Title: A Case of Using the Distal Radial Artery to Open an Occluded Radial Artery.

Abstract: We describe a case of radial artery occlusion caused by previous percutaneous coronary intervention. The occluded radial artery was opened through the distal radial artery, and left main coronary artery intervention was subsequently performed. Follow-up vascular ultrasound showed that the radial artery had smooth blood flow and no stenosis. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
