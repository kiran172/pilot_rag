Title: Pre-Procedural Right Ventricular Longitudinal Strain and Post-Procedural Tricuspid Regurgitation Predict Mortality in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction has been linked to worse outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI. Assessment of RV function is challenging due to its complex morphology. RV longitudinal strain (LS) assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is a novel measure that may overcome most of the limitations of conventional echocardiographic parameters of RV function. The aim of current study was to assess the prognostic value of RV LS in patients undergoing TAVI and to assess echocardiographic predictors of long-term mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at our hospital between 1 January 2015 and 1 June 2016. Indication for TAVI was approved by a local heart-team. Echocardiographic data at baseline and after TAVI were re-analyzed and RV LS was measured in all patients with adequate image quality. A total of 229 patients were included in our study (mean age 83.8 ± 5 years, 62% women, mean EuroSCORE II 5.7 ± 5%). All-cause mortality occurred in 17.3% over a mean follow-up of 929 ± 373 days. In multivariate analysis, only baseline average RV free-wall LS (HR 1.05, 95% CI (1.01 to 1.10), p = 0.049) and more than mild tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) after TAVI (HR 4.39, 95% CI (2.22 to 8.70), p &lt; 0.001) independently increased the risk of all-cause mortality at long- term follow-up (2.5 years), while conventional echocardiographic parameters of RV function did not predict mortality.
CONCLUSION: Pre-procedural RV LS and post-procedural tricuspid regurgitation significantly predicted long-term all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVI while conventional echocardiographic parameters of RV function failed in predicting long-term outcome. RV longitudinal strain by STE should be considered in the routine echocardiographic assessments of patients with severe AS.
