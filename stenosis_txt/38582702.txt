Title: The Role of Comorbidities in Predicting Functional Improvement After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have a high comorbidity burden. We sought to stratify patients into functional outcomes using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12), a patient-reported outcome with benefits over both the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and the original 23-item KCCQ, and to evaluate the importance of comorbidities in predicting failure of functional improvement post-TAVI in a contemporary cohort.
METHODS: In total, 366 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI with baseline KCCQ-12 were retrospectively analysed and divided into two groups. Failure to improve was defined as a score <60 and a change in score <10 at 1 year in either overall score (KCCQ-OS) or clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS).
RESULTS: Failure to improve was noted in 13% of patients, who were more likely to have lower KCCQ-OS at baseline (47 [35-59] vs 56 [42-74]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (19% vs 8%), severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (13% vs 2%), a clinical frailty score (CFS) â‰¥5 (41% vs 14%), and lower serum albumin (36 g/L [34-38] vs 38 g/L [35-40]). On multivariate analysis, with an area under the curve of 0.71 (0.63-0.78), baseline KCCQ-OS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.3 [0.1-0.6], p=0.04), COPD (aOR 2.8 [1.2-6.5], p=0.02), and severe CKD (aOR 5.7 [1.7-18.5], p=0.004) remained independent predictors. CFS alone had a similar predictive value as the multivariable model (OR 2.0 [1.3-3.4], area under the curve 0.69 [0.59-0.80], p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: KCCQ scores were effective in delineating functional outcomes, with most patients in our relatively lower surgical risk cohort showing significant functional improvements post-TAVI. Low baseline KCCQ, moderate or worse COPD, and severe CKD were associated with failure of improvement post-TAVI. Baseline CFS appears to be a good screening tool to predict poor improvement. These factors should be evaluated and weighted accordingly in pre-TAVI assessments and decision-making.
