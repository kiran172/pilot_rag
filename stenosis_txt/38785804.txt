Title: Mesenteric Lymphatic B Cells Migrate to the Intestine and Aggravate DSS-Induced Colitis via the CXCR5-CXCL13 Axis.

Abstract: The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown. Mesenteric lymphatics (MLs), which are closely related to the intestine in both anatomy and physiology, have been suggested to be involved in IBD. In the present study, we aim to investigate the effects of ML immune cells on IBD and explore the potential associated mechanisms. Acute colitis was induced in rats using dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS). Mesenteric lymphangiogenesis, ML stenosis, and dilation were observed, with an increased proportion of MLB cells in DSS-induced colitis rats. The adoptive transfer of B cells isolated from ML (MLB) was employed to investigate their effects on colitis. MLB cells derived from DSS-induced colitis rats exhibited a higher propensity to migrate to the intestine. The proportion of colonic T cells was altered, along with the aggravated colitis induced by the adoptive transfer of MLB cells derived from DSS-induced colitis rats. RNA sequencing revealed increased Cxcr5 expression in MLB cells from colitis rats, while real-time PCR indicated an upregulation of its ligand Cxcl13 in the colon of colitis rats. These findings suggest that MLB cells may migrate to the intestine and aggravate colitis. In summary, colonic T cells respond to MLB cells from colitis rats, and MLB cells aggravate DSS-induced colitis via the CXCR5-CXCL13 axis.
