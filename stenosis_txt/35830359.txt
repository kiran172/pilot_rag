Title: Direct Comparison of Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Veterans and Non-Veterans Using the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare veterans and non-veterans undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using data from the Society for Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy (STS/ACC TVT) registry.
METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVR at George Washington University (GWU) and veterans treated at Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) who underwent TAVR at GWU from 2014-2020 were included. All patients were reported in the TVT registry. Emergency and valve-in-valve TAVR were excluded. Cohorts were divided based on veteran status. Operators were the same for both groups. Outcomes were compared at 30 days and 1 year. The primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes were morbidity metrics.
RESULTS: A total of 299 patients (91 veterans, 208 non-veterans) were included. Veterans had higher rates of hypertension (87.9% vs 77.9%; P=.04), diabetes (46.7% vs 28.9%; P<.01), and lung disease (2.4% vs 11.0%; P<.001). Outcomes were not significantly different between veterans and non-veterans, including 30-day mortality (0% vs 2.9%, respectively; P=.18), 1-year mortality (9.8% vs 10.7%, respectively; P=.61), stroke incidence (0% vs 2.5%, respectively; P=.73), median intensive care unit stay (24 hours in both groups), and overall hospital stay (2 days in both groups).
CONCLUSIONS: The affiliation between a VAMC and an academic medical center allowed for direct comparison between veterans and non-veterans undergoing TAVR by the same operators using the TVT registry. Despite significantly higher rates of comorbidities, veterans had equivalent outcomes compared with non-veterans. This may be in part due to the comprehensive care that veterans receive in the VAMC and this institution's integrated heart center team.
