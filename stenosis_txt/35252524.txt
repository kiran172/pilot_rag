Title: The Use of Interdigitating Y-Flap Technique for Imperforate Hymen.

Abstract: Imperforate hymen is a rare condition affecting 1 of 2,000 women worldwide. Its treatment is surgical hymenectomy to relieve obstruction and reduce the risk of secondary endometriosis. Current surgical techniques for imperforate hymen pose risks of postoperative complications such as stenosis and ascending infection; thus, a new technique is needed. A case of a 12-year-old girl with a progressively bulging mass was presented. Physical examination revealed hematocolpos due to imperforate hymen. Surgery, using interdigitating Y-flap technique, was performed on the patient. The surgical outcome was satisfactory, and no postoperative complication was found during a follow-up visit.
