Title: Carotid Endarterectomy for Intractable Repetitive Stenosis Following Carotid Artery Stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Restenosis after carotid artery stenting has raised concerns regarding the long-term durability of carotid stenting. Recurrent restenosis after multiple endovascular interventions may pose a challenge for clinicians.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We encountered 2 cases of intractable restenosis after redo-carotid artery stenting and performed carotid endarterectomy. We removed the embedded stent and plaque simultaneously, used the internal shunting system, and performed patch angioplasty with no further recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Carotid endarterectomy could be considered as a first-line treatment for recurrent stenosis that proves refractory to multiple endovascular interventions.
