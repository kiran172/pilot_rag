Title: Feasibility of Point-of-Care Ultrasound for Diagnosing Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis in the Emergency Department.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for diagnosing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) in the emergency department (ED).
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in infants aged younger than 90 days who were brought to the ED due to vomiting between January 2015 and December 2019. Of these, infants who were clinically suspected of having HPS and underwent ultrasound were included and categorized into 3 groups: POCUS only, POCUS followed by radiologist-performed ultrasound (RADUS), and RADUS only. All confirmative diagnoses of HPS were made by RADUS. The diagnostic performance of POCUS was analyzed, and the ED patient flow was compared between the POCUS-performed (POCUS only or POCUS followed by RADUS) and RADUS-only groups.
RESULTS: Overall, 171 patients with a median age of 34 days were included. Of these, 79 patients (46.2%) underwent POCUS only, and none had HPS; 50 patients (29.2%) underwent POCUS followed by RADUS; and 42 patients (24.5%) underwent RADUS only. Overall, 41 patients (24.0%) were diagnosed with HPS, and POCUS showed a sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 94.0%. In the total cohort, length of stay in the ED (EDLOS) was shorter in the POCUS-performed group than in the RADUS-only group (2.6 vs 3.8 hours, P = 0.015). Among non-HPS patients, time to disposition (1.8 vs 2.7 hours, P = 0.005) and EDLOS (2.0 vs 3.0 hours, P = 0.004) were shorter in the POCUS-performed group than in the RADUS-only group. Performing POCUS followed by RADUS did not significantly delay the treatment among HPS patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Point-of-care ultrasound is accurate and useful for diagnosing HPS and improved the ED patient flow by reducing EDLOS and door-to-disposition time in non-HPS patients.
