Title: Contralateral sublaminar approach for decompression of the combined lateral recess, foraminal, and extraforaminal lesions using biportal endoscopy: a technical report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The development of specialized instruments and surgical techniques has enabled the biportal endoscopic system to access the foraminal and extraforaminal area using the contralateral sublaminar approach at the lumbar level.
METHODS: Biportal endoscopic contralateral sublaminar approach was used to resolve the contralateral foraminal, and extraforaminal stenosis at the lumbar level. Prominent syndesmophytes and herniated disc compression of the exiting nerve root were successfully removed, and the distorted nerve root was restored to a smooth downward angulation in the far-out area.
CONCLUSION: We successfully utilized biportal endoscopy to decompress the combined lumbar lateral recess, foraminal, and extraforaminal lesions using a contralateral sublaminar approach.
