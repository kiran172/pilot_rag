Title: Association Between Airway Stenosis Degree and Respiratory Distress in Infants With a Vascular Ring.

Abstract: Background Although the number of cases of prenatally diagnosed vascular rings is increasing, some cases may remain asymptomatic, and no indicator of the appearance of dyspnea has been established. Thus, we aimed to determine the relationship between the degree of airway compression by the vascular ring on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and respiratory distress. Methods This is a retrospective study of nine patients diagnosed with vascular rings at a single hospital from July 2010 to December 2019. Data regarding the patient's clinical characteristics, such as prenatal diagnosis, vascular ring type, complicated cardiac disease, and presence or absence of surgery, were recorded. Airway assessment on contrast-enhanced CT was measured in the axial cross-section. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) (version 25.0; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY). Results Five of the eight patients had respiratory distress. Patients with respiratory distress were less likely to have been diagnosed prenatally (p = 0.04) and had smaller stenosis degree of anteroposterior diameter (p = 0.03). Conclusion Contrast-enhanced CT is useful in patients with vascular rings. Our study suggests that the stenosis degree of the anterior-posterior diameter of the airway is related to dyspnea.
