Title: Andrographolide regulates H3 histone lactylation by interfering with p300 to alleviate aortic valve calcification.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our previous studies have found that andrographolide (AGP) alleviates calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), but the underlying mechanism is unclear. This study explores the molecular target and signal mechanisms of AGP in inhibiting CAVD.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The anti-calcification effects of the aortic valve with AGP treatment were evaluated by alizarin red staining in vitro and ultrasound and histopathological assessment of a high-fat (HF)-fed ApoE-/- mouse valve calcification model. A correlation between the H3 histone lactylation (H3Kla) and calcification was detected. Molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were further used to confirm p300 as a target for AGP. Overexpression (oe) and silencing (si) of p300 were used to verify the inhibitory effect of AGP targeting p300 on the H3Kla in vitro and ex vivo.
KEY RESULTS: AGP significantly inhibited calcium deposition in valve interstitial cells (VICs) and ameliorated aortic valve calcification. The multi-omics analysis revealed the glycolysis pathway involved in CAVD, indicating that AGP interfered with lactate production by regulating lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). In addition, lactylation, a new post-translational modification, was shown to have a role in promoting aortic valve calcification. Furthermore, H3Kla and H3K9la site were shown to correlate with Runx2 expression inhibition by AGP treatment. Importantly, we found that p300 transferase was the molecular target of AGP in inhibiting H3Kla.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings, for the first time, demonstrated that AGP alleviates calcification by interfering with H3Kla via p300, which might be a powerful drug to prevent CAVD.
