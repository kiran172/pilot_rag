Title: Intravascular ultrasound-guided stent implantation in reimplanted left main coronary artery of a 15-year-old child: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Only a few cases have been reported about clinical value of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients with stenosis of a re-implanted left main coronary artery (LMCA).
CASE SUMMARY: We herein report a rare case of restenosis after direct reimplantation of an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) in a 15-year-old girl. At the first evaluation, she had mildly reduced systolic dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction of 47%. Three months after surgical repair, the patient developed recurrent precordial pain. Consequent imaging tests and IVUS revealed a restenosis of the LMCA characterized as an attenuated plaque with a large plaque burden. A drug-eluting stent was implanted with IVUS guidance. Follow-up revealed a patent LMCA and preserved systolic function.
DISCUSSION: The current case demonstrated that IVUS-guided PCI can be feasible in the treatment of coronary artery stenosis after repair of an ALCAPA. Further study is needed to explore the pathophysiological mechanism of this condition and the clinical value of PCI and IVUS in patients with stenosis of the LMCA.
