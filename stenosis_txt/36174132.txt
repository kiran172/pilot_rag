Title: Osteoporosis as a Risk Factor for Intraoperative Complications and Long-term Instrumentation Failure in Patients With Scoliotic Spinal Deformity.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review study.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effect of osteoporosis on spine instrumentation.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporosis is a common skeletal pathology that affects systemic cortical bone maintenance and remodeling. This disease accelerates the degeneration of the spine, often necessitating spinal surgery for progressive vertebral deformity, pathologic fracture, bony canal stenosis, and/or neural element decompression. There is a paucity of literature describing the role of osteoporosis as it relates to both perioperative complications and outcomes after spine fusion surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of a prospectively maintained database for patients undergoing spine surgery between January 1, 2006 and October 3, 2017. Inclusion criteria included age 18 years and above and surgery performed for the correction of thoracolumbar scoliosis. Data collected included various demographic, clinical, and operative variables.
RESULTS: A total of 532 patients met inclusion criteria, including 144 (27%) patients with a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis was significantly associated with increased blood volume loss (P=0.003). Postoperatively, osteoporosis was associated with increased rates of instrumentation failure (19% vs. 10%; P=0.008) and the need for revision surgery (33% vs. 16%; P<0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed osteoporosis to be an independent risk factor for increased mean number of spinal segments fused (P<0.05), mean blood volume loss (P<0.05), rate of postoperative deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (P<0.05), rate of instrumentation failure (P<0.05), and need for revision surgery (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Osteoporosis is a significant risk factor for instrumentation failure and need for revision surgery following arthrodesis for scoliosis correction. Furthermore, patients with osteoporosis have a significantly higher risk of intraoperative blood volume loss and postoperative thromboembolic events.
