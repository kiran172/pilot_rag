Title: Plasma sLRP-1 Level Independently Relates to a Higher Risk of Moderate-Severe Stenosis by Gensini Score in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients.

Abstract: Soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (sLRP-1) plays a crucial role in facilitating inflammation, lipid accumulation, and atherosclerosis, and the latter factors are involved in the pathology of cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to explore the ability of plasma sLRP-1 for reflecting stenosis degree in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. sLRP-1 was detected from plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 169 ACS patients and 77 non-ACS subjects (as controls) after admission. Our study illustrated that sLRP-1 was increased in ACS patients versus controls (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, sLRP-1 was positively correlated with body mass index (P = 0.021), white blood cells (P = 0.009), neutrophils (P = 0.002), cardiac troponin I (P = 0.009), and brain natriuretic peptide (P = 0.008) in ACS patients. Notably, sLRP-1 was positively associated with the Gensini score (P = 0.002) and Gensini score stratified stenosis severity (P = 0.004) in ACS patients. After adjustment, sLRP-1 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.333, P = 0.045] independently estimated a higher risk of moderate-severe stenosis, so did numbers of coronary artery lesions (OR = 2.869, P = 0.001), but ejection fraction forecasted a lower risk (OR = 0.880, P = 0.012). Interestingly, a combination of sLRP-1, ejection fraction, and numbers of coronary artery lesions exhibited a good ability to estimate moderate-severe stenosis risk with an area under the curve (95% confidence interval) of 0.845 (0.783-0.906). In summary, increased plasma sLRP-1 represents an aggravated inflammation, impaired cardiac function, and especially a higher stenosis severity in ACS patients.
