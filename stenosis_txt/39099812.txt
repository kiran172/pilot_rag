Title: Magnetic resonance imaging combined with serum endolipin and galactagoglobin-3 to diagnose cerebral infarction in the elderly with diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with serum endothelin and galactagoglobin-3 (Gal-3) can improve the clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus complicated with cerebral infarction.
AIM: To analyze the clinical value of MRI combined with serum endolipin and Gal-3 for the diagnosis of cerebral infarction in the elderly with diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients with acute cerebral infarction hospitalized between January 2021 and December 2023 were divided into two groups according to comorbid diabetes mellitus, including 62 and 88 cases in the diabetic and nondiabetic cerebral infarction groups. Serum samples were collected to detect the expression of serum endolipoxins, and Gal-3, and cranial MRI was performed at admission. Differences between the two groups were compared to analyze the diagnostic value of these parameters.
RESULTS: Serum endolipin and Gal-3 expression were higher in the diabetic cerebral infarction group (P &lt; 0.05). The arterial wall area, vessel area, normalized wall index, and lumen stenosis rate were higher in the diabetic cerebral infarction group, while the rate of arterial lumen moderate and severe stenosis was 48.39% higher (36.36%, P &lt; 0.05). The percentage of large (29.03%) and multiple infarcts (33.87%) in the diabetic cerebral infarction group was higher (13.64% and 20.45%), and the incidence rate of lacunar infarcts was lower (37.10% vs 65.91%) (P &lt; 0.05). The total incidence of arterial plaque in patients in the diabetic cerebral infarction group was 96.77% higher (69.32%), while the incidence of necrotic lipid core plaque was 58.06% higher (26.14%) (P &lt; 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnosis utility of these techniques. MRI in combination with serum endoglin and Gal-3 had the highest area under the curve, the Yoden index, sensitivity and specificity (P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The expression of serum endolipin and Gal-3 in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus with cerebral infarction showed an elevated trend, and the degree of luminal stenosis was severe. MRI predominantly revealed large and multiple infarct foci. This combined index examination can improve the clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus combined with cerebral infarction.
