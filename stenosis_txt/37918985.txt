Title: 2022 Recommendations of The AFU Lithiasis Committee: Open surgery and laparoscopy.

Abstract: Only few hundred interventions are performed in France each year to remove upper urinary tract stones using a laparoscopic/robotic transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach. These interventions are proposed to patients with large (>20mm) and complex stones, sometimes after failure of endoscopic techniques or in the presence of malformations that can be treated at the same time. The major interest of these interventions is the possibility to remove the whole stone without prior fragmentation. Some anatomical situations can increase the technical difficulty, particularly the presence of an intrarenal pelvis and the presence of pelvic and periureteral adhesions. The reported complications are essentially urinary fistula and ureteral stenosis, the risks of which are reduced by the use of double J stenting. As struvite stones are more friable, their whole removal is more difficult and may lead to dispersion of fragments, particularly during laparoscopy. Conventional open surgery has a higher stone-free rate, but comes with a greater kidney function loss. METHODOLOGY: These recommendations were developed using two methods: the Clinical Practice Recommendation (CPR) method and the ADAPTE method, depending on whether the question was considered in the European Association of Urology (EAU) recommendations (https://uroweb.org/guidelines/urolithiasis) (EAU Guidelines on urolithiasis. 2022) and their adaptability to the French context.
