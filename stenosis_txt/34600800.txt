Title: Assessment of Postoperative Pain and Opioid Consumption Following Laryngeal Surgery: A Pilot Study.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The epidemic of opioid use in the United States has been declared a national public health crisis due to the rapid increase in drug overdose mortality. Physician overprescribing has been identified as one of many contributing factors, with most patients receiving excess opioid pain medication. Furthermore, there is a significant correlation between prescribed opioid dosage and mortality. Postoperative pain is a well-recognized clinical problem, but little has been done to advance or standardize pain management protocols. The purpose of this study was to determine the expected postoperative pain severity and quantity of opioid analgesic required for adequate pain management after laryngeal surgery.
METHODS: Adult voice center patients who had recently undergone laryngeal surgery were included in this retrospective review. Tylenol #3 had been prescribed for all patients for pain management and they had been instructed to take additional over-the-counter acetaminophen as needed. In the senior author's (RTS) practice, patients are asked routinely to report pain severity and analgesic use during postoperative visits. All patients who had this information available were included in the cohort. Opioid medication consumed, over-the-counter medication consumed, and pain level (scale of 0-10 with 10 being most severe) were analyzed over the first week postoperatively.
RESULTS: There were 43 patients (19 male, 24 female) included in the retrospective cohort (average age = 46.8 ± 18.6, range = 18-82). Procedures performed included vocal fold mass excision (48.8%), type I thyroplasty (27.9%), laser vaporization of vascular lesions (11.6%), laser stenosis resection (9.3%), and VF medialization injection with abdominal fat harvest (7.0%). Overall, voice surgery patients reported mild to moderate pain (2.1-4.7 out of 10). An average of 13.2 ± 2.8 T3 tablets were prescribed for pain management (range = 10-20), and no patient required more T3 tablets than the number provided. Sixteen patients (37.2%) supplemented or substituted their T3 medication for it with OTC acetaminophen. No patients used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for supplemental pain management. Consumption of both T3 pain medication (r = 0.444) and OTC acetaminophen (r = 0.274) was correlated significantly with postoperative pain severity (P < 0.001). When stratified by type of surgical procedure performed, one-way ANOVA (F = 2.749, P = 0.043) and post-hoc Games-Howell test revealed that the patients who underwent type I thyroplasty reported a significantly higher (P = 0.041) pain severity score than patients who underwent vocal fold mass excision (4.7 versus 2.1, respectively). No significant differences in pain severity existed between other procedures (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences between type of procedure performed for number of T3 tablets prescribed, number of T3 tablets taken, or number of OTC tablets taken (P > 0.05). Younger age was correlated significantly with a higher number of OTC tablets consumed (r = -0.316, P = 0.039). Women consumed more OTC pain medications than men.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in this study reported mild to moderate postoperative pain. Adequate pain management was achieved using less pain medication tablets than the number prescribed. Type I thyroplasty was associated with more severe pain than other surgeries. Women used more OTC pain medications than men with no significant difference in reported pain level.
