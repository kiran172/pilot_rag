Title: Heart Failure after Aortic Valve Replacement: Incidence, Risk Factors, and Implications.

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) carries a poor prognosis with the onset of heart failure (HF) symptoms, and surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) is its only definitive treatment. The management of AS has seen a paradigm shift with the adoption of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), allowing for the treatment of AS in patients who would not otherwise be candidates for surgical AVR. Despite improving long-term survival after TAVR in recent years, residual HF symptoms and HF hospitalization are common and are associated with an increased mortality and a poor health status. This review article summarizes the incidence and risk factors for HF after AVR. Strategies for preventing and better managing HF after AVR are necessary to improve outcomes in this patient population. Extensive research is underway to assess whether earlier timing for AVR, prior to the development of severe symptomatic AS and associated extra-valvular cardiac damage, can improve post-AVR patient outcomes.
