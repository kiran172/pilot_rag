Title: Elective Non-Cardiac Surgery in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis　- Observations From the CURRENT AS Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) might be at high risk for adverse cardiovascular events at the time of non-cardiac surgery.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The current study population included 348 patients who underwent elective non-cardiac surgery under general or spinal anesthesia during the follow up of 3,815 patients in the CURRENT AS (Contemporary outcomes after sURgery and medical tREatmeNT in patients with severe Aortic Stenosis) registry. There were 187 patients with untreated severe AS at time of surgery (untreated severe AS group) and 161 patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement (AVR) before surgery (prior AVR group), including 23 patients with prophylactic AVR. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality after non-cardiac surgery. At 30 days after non-cardiac surgery, 8 patients (4.3%) died in the untreated severe AS group, while no patients died in the prior AVR group (P=0.008). The causes of death were cardiovascular in 6 out of 8 patients. Mortality at 30 days was higher in untreated severe AS patients with AS-related symptoms before surgery than in those without AS-related symptoms (7.2% vs. 3.1%). Higher surgical risk estimates of the non-cardiac surgery incrementally increased the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with untreated severe AS, though the difference was not statistically significant (low-risk: 0%, intermediate-risk: 4.3%, and high-risk: 6.6 %, P=0.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic and asymptomatic severe AS might be associated with higher risk of 30-day mortality if untreated before elective intermediate- and high-risk non-cardiac surgery, while no patient with prior AVR died after elective non-cardiac surgery.
