Title: Long-term outcomes and dynamic changes of in-stent stenosis after Pipeline embolization device treatment of intracranial aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Flow diverters have revolutionized the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. However, the delayed complications associated with flow diverter use are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence, severity, clinical outcomes, risk factors, and dynamic changes associated with in-stent stenosis (ISS) after treatment with a Pipeline embolization device (PED).
METHODS: Patients who underwent PED treatment between 2015 and 2020 were enrolled. The angiographic, clinical, and follow-up data of 459 patients were independently reviewed by four neuroradiologists to identify ISS. Binary logistic regression was conducted to determine ISS risk factors, and an ISS-time curve was established to demonstrate dynamic changes in ISS after PED implantation.
RESULTS: Of the 459 treated patients, 69 (15.0%) developed ISS. At follow-up, nine patients (2.0%) with ISS demonstrated reversal, while 18 (3.9%) developed parental artery occlusion. A total of 380 patients (82.8%) achieved complete aneurysm occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta grade D). Patients with posterior-circulation aneurysm (OR=2.895, 95% CI (1.732 to 4.838; P&lt;0.001) or balloon angioplasty (OR=1.992, 95% CI 1.162 to 3.414; P=0.037) were more likely to develop ISS. Patients aged &gt;54 years (OR=0.464, 95% CI 0.274 to 0.785; P=0.006) or with a body mass index of &gt;28 kg/m2 (OR=0.427, 95% CI 0.184 to 0.991; P=0.026) had a lower ISS risk. Intimal hyperplasia initiated by PED placement peaked within 1 year after the procedure, rarely progressed after 12 months, and tended to reverse within 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: ISS is a common, benign, and self-limiting complication of PED implantation in the Chinese population.
