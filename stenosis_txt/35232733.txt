Title: Role of an IUCD in managing patients with post-LLETZ cervical stenosis.

Abstract: Large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) is one of the fertility sparing treatments for people with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, however, this procedure is known to increase the risk of postoperative cervical stenosis by 1.3%-5.2%. We present a case demonstrating the successful use of a copper intrauterine contraceptive device to manage a patient with cervical stenosis secondary to three LLETZ procedures for severe dyskaryosis.
