Title: Endovascular thrombectomy and repair of suprarenal inferior vena cava thrombosis: A case series.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to document the combined use of catheter-based thrombectomy/thrombolysis with endovascular repair of high-risk segments of the inferior vena cava in the setting of iatrogenic and traumatic injuries. While the use of endovascular techniques to treat caval thrombosis is well documented and often preferred due to its minimally invasive nature, there is still little literature that focuses on the nuances related to injury of high mortality areas of the IVC as a result of major trauma, transplant, and other surgical interventions.
METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective review of all patients undergoing IVC thrombectomy was performed at a single tertiary care academic center between January 2018 and July 2021. Cases were subsequently selected based on those who underwent primary mechanical thrombectomy followed by endovascular stenting (or angioplasty). Among this cohort, four patients who underwent this procedure in the context of iatrogenic and traumatic injuries were included.
RESULTS: All four patients undergoing primary mechanical thrombectomy followed by endovascular stenting (or angioplasty) due to IVC thrombus and/or stenosis were technically successful with immediate positive clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy in conjunction with IVC recanalization via stenting may be a useful intervention with promising technical success and positive clinical outcomes for occlusive thrombosis and IVC stenosis.
