Title: Employment of color Doppler echocardiographic video clips in a cardiac auscultation class with a cardiology patient simulator: discrepancy between students' satisfaction and learning.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We have provided fourth-year medical students with a three-hour cardiac auscultation class using a cardiology patient simulator since 2010. The test results of 2010-2012 revealed that as compared with aortic stenosis murmur, students correctly identified murmurs of other valvular diseases less often. We investigated whether employment of color Doppler echocardiographic video clips would improve proficiency in identifying murmurs of aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation, and whether students' favorable responses to a questionnaire were associated with improved proficiency.
METHODS: A total of 250 fourth-year medical students were divided into groups of 7-9 students in 2014 and 2015. Each group attended a three-hour cardiac auscultation class comprising a mini-lecture, facilitated training, two different auscultation tests (the second test being closer to clinical setting than the first) and a questionnaire. We provided each student with color Doppler echocardiographic videos of aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation using a tablet computer, which they freely referred to before and after listening to corresponding murmurs. The test results were compared with those in 2010-2012. The students had already completed the course of cardiovascular medicine, comprising lectures including those of physical examination, echocardiography, and valvular heart diseases, before participating in this auscultation training class.
RESULTS: Most students indicated that the videos were useful or somewhat useful regarding aortic regurgitation (86.3%) and mitral regurgitation (85.7%). The accuracy rates were 78.4% (81.2% in 2010-2012) in aortic regurgitation and 76.0% (77.8%) in mitral regurgitation in the first test, and 83.3% (71.4%) in aortic regurgitation and 77.1% (77.6%) in mitral regurgitation in the second test, showing no significant differences as compared to 2010-2012. Overall accuracy rate of all heart sounds and murmurs in the first test and that of second/third/fourth sounds in the first and second tests were significantly lower in 2014-2015 than in 2010-2012.
CONCLUSIONS: Referring to color Doppler echocardiographic video clips in the way employed in the present study, which most students regarded as useful, did not improve their proficiency in identifying the two important regurgitant murmurs, revealing a discrepancy between students' satisfaction and learning. Video clips synchronized with their corresponding murmurs may contribute toward improving students' proficiency.
