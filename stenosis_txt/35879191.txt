Title: First Application of the LAMPOON Procedure to a Surgical Mitral Bioprosthesis.

Abstract: A cardiogenic shock patient with a history of a surgical mitral valve replacement presented to the hospital with critical mitral stenosis with thickening of prosthetic valve leaflets and thrombus in left atrial appendage. We considered TMVR inside of the degenerated bioprosthetic valve. However, there were two concerns during TMVR based on multimodality imaging assessment: 1) LVOT obstruction due to the surgical bioprosthetic leaflet, 2) stroke due to left atrial appendage thrombus. We performed TMVR with LAMPOON (laceration of the anterior leaflet of the surgical valve to prevent left ventricular outflow tract obstruction) for the bioprosthesis using cerebral protection. While the LAMPOON procedure has developed to prevent LVOT obstruction by the native anterior mitral leaflet during transcatheter mitral valve-in-ring or valve-in-mitral annular calcification, this is the first case that illustrates its use for mitral valve-in-valve replacement.
