Title: Complex Bench Surgery Does Not Increase the Risk of Vascular Complications after Pediatric Kidney Transplantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION:  Vascular complications are severe complications of pediatric kidney transplantation (KT). We aimed to investigate whether a complex bench surgery (BS) affects the outcomes.
METHODS:  All pediatric KT performed at the University Hospital of Padua from 2015 to 2019 were analyzed, comparing those in which a standard BS was possible to those that necessitated a complex BS. The rates of vascular complications, patients' outcome, and graft survival were compared in the two groups.
RESULTS: Eighty KTs were performed in 78 patients with a median age of 11 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4.3-14) and a median body weight of 24 kg (IQR 13-37). Thirty-nine donor kidneys (49%) needed a complex BS due to anomalies of renal veins in 12 (31%) and renal arteries in 16 (41%). The remaining 11 grafts (28%) underwent an elongation of the vein. There was no difference in the rate of primary graft non function (p = 0.97), delayed graft function (p = 0.72), and overall survival (p = 0.27). The rates of vascular complications, bleedings, and venous graft thrombosis were similar (p = 0.51, p = 0.59, p = 0.78, respectively). No arterial thrombosis or stenosis was reported.
CONCLUSION:  Complex BS did not compromise survival of the graft and did not put the allograft at risk of vascular complications, such as bleedings or thrombosis.
