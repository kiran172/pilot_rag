Title: Entropy and stability analysis on blood flow with nanoparticles through a stenosed artery having permeable walls.

Abstract: In this research, the electro-osmotic effects are highlighted for a blood-based hybrid nanofluid flow across an artery infected with multiple stenosis. The artery has permeable walls together with slip boundary effects. The slip and permeable boundary conditions model the more realistic blood flow problems. The governing equations of the problem are converted into non-dimensional form by introducing adequate dimensionless variables and acquired the exact solutions. The detailed study of heat transfer is given by Joule heating and viscous dissipation effects. The disorder of fluid flow is investigated by the mathematical study of entropy generation. Analytically attained solutions are examined graphically for both symmetric and non-symmetric shapes of stenosis. Streamlines are analyzed for varying values of flow rate Q and electro-osmotic parameter m. The flow velocity has smallest values on the axis of channel and gets higher value near the boundary walls. The temperature profile delineates opposite behavior to the velocity, and it is parabolic in nature. The velocity reduces towards the non-uniform stenosis except for electroosmotic parameter m. The temperature has larger magnitude in the case of anti-symmetric stenosis. Moreover, the stability of velocity solution is also analyzed.
