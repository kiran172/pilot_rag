Title: The Role of Vertebral Morphometry in the Pathogenesis of Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: The aim of the current study was to establish whether the vertebral morphometry (e.g., vertebral body width and spinal canal diameters) is associated with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS). A retrospective computerized tomography (CT) study from L1 to L5 for two sample populations was used. The first included 165 participants with symptomatic DLSS (sex ratio 80 M/85F), and the second had 180 individuals from the general population (sex ratio: 90 M/90F). Vertebral body length (VL) and width (VW) were significantly greater in the stenosis males and females compared to their counterparts in the control. The mean VL in the stenosis males was 31.3 mm at L1, 32.6 mm at L2, 34 mm at L3, 34.1 mm at L4, and 34.5 at L5 compared to 29.9 mm, 31.3 mm, 32.6 mm, 32.8 mm, and 32.9, respectively, in the control group (P ≤ 0.003). Additionally, the bony anterior-posterior (AP) canal diameters and cross-sectional area (CSA) were significantly smaller in the stenosis group compared to the control. The mean AP canal values in the stenosis males were 17.8 mm at L1, 16.6 mm at L2, 15.4 mm at L3, 15.6 mm at L4, and 16.1 at L5 compared to 18.7, 17.8, 16.9, 17.6, and 18.8, respectively, in the control group. Vertebral length (OR-1.273 to 1.473; P ≤ 0.002), AP canal diameter (OR-0.474 to 0.664; P ≤ 0.007), and laminar inclination (OR-0.901 to 0.856; P ≤ 0.025) were significantly associated with DLSS. Our study revealed that vertebral morphometry has a role in DLSS development.
