Title: Tricuspid Stenosis in Pregnancy: A Valve-in-Valve Conundrum.

Abstract: Redo tricuspid valve replacement has high surgical operative mortality. Transcatheter valve-in-valve provides a viable option for valve replacement. We discuss the decision-making process involved in performing transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve replacement in a 23-week pregnant woman with multiple comorbidities and symptomatic severe bioprosthetic stenosis. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
