Title: Treatment of Extracranial Vertebral Artery Aneurysm with Flow Diversion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aneurysms of the extracranial vertebral artery are rare, and the treatment options are not standardized. We present a case of an extracranial vertebral artery aneurysm treated with flow diversion.
CASE DESCRIPTION: In a 72-year-old woman, computed tomography angiography demonstrated a right extracranial vertebral artery aneurysm. The saccular aneurysm (7.9 × 6.6 mm) was demonstrated on digital subtraction angiography at the V3 segment of the right vertebral artery. A Pipeline embolization device was placed in the diseased parent artery. The patency of the Pipeline embolization device was confirmed at 12-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Flow diversion is a simple and promising treatment option for a V3 segment aneurysm. Postoperative asymptomatic partial in-stent stenosis is tolerable.
