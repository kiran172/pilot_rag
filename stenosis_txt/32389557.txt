Title: A case report and experience of endovascular treatment for a patient with hemophilia who had a hyperacute ischemic stroke.

Abstract: No previous study has reported endovascular treatment (EVT) in a patient with hemophilia who had an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Herein, we report the case of a patient with hemophilia A who presented with hyperacute stroke due to a near occlusion of the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA). A 54-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness that occurred 4 hours prior to admission. He had been diagnosed with congenital hemophilia A during his childhood. Although brain computed tomography revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, we did not consider intravenous thrombolysis because of his bleeding-prone condition. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed a restricted diffusion in the right anterior and middle cerebral artery territories. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed that the right proximal ICA was nearly occluded and had a residual stump. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a near occlusion of the right proximal ICA with a thread-like lumen. Balloon angioplasty was performed in the proximal ICA, and distal flow was restored, but residual stenosis was observed. Stepwise revascularization by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was planned instead of immediate carotid stenting. He underwent CEA with preoperative and postoperative coverage of factor VIII and recovered without any bleeding complication.
