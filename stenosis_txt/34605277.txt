Title: Open-sleeve technique: A new approach for aortic valve leaflet reconstruction in small children.

Abstract: A boy was diagnosed with a unicuspid aortic valve with severe stenosis at birth. Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed four times; however, he had severe heart and growth failure. Thus, aortic valve repair was performed at age 2 years and 6 months. He weighed 6.6 kg. The aortic valve annulus diameter was 9.8 mm (z value = 0.43). We report on a small toddler with congenital aortic stenosis who was successfully treated with autologous pericardial aortic valve leaflet reconstruction using the open-sleeve technique.
