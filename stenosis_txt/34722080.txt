Title: Transforaminal Endoscopic Decompression of Facet Cysts by Interventional Pain Physicians.

Abstract: Lumbar synovial cysts (LSC) can impinge neural structures, causing radicular back pain. Conservative treatment options; however, are often ineffective, and traditional surgical techniques can cause joint instability. We describe two cases in which interventional pain physicians used transforaminal endoscopic spine surgery to treat LSC. The patients reported complete resolution of their lower back and radicular pain and the procedures preserved their motor function and sensation in their bilateral lower extremities. This technique is a viable option for remediation of LSC and can be performed by well-trained pain physicians.
