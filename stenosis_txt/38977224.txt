Title: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty bridge to transcatheter aortic valve replacement is associated with worse in-hospital mortality.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) has gained renewed interest as a bridge to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for patients with aortic stenosis (AS). However, it is unclear whether they patients should undergo TAVR directly or receive a staged bridge to BAV before TAVR is unclear. We used a national database to examine the association between BAV and TAVR in patients with TAVR and its effect on in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: Using the nationwide inpatient database of the Japanese registry of all cardiac and vascular diseases and the combination of the diagnosis procedure combination, we retrospectively analyzed 27,600 patients with AS who underwent TAVR between October 2013 and March 2021. Outcomes of the direct TAVR group (n = 27,387) were compared with those of the BAV bridge to TAVR group (n = 213), which received BAV at least 1 day before TAVR.
RESULTS: The median age was 85 (interquartile range: 82-88) years, with 33.3% (n = 9188) being male. Unplanned/emergent admissions increased with TAVR, whereas the use of BAV bridge to TAVR decreased. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.3% and decreased over time. However, the BAV bridge to TAVR had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality than direct TAVR (5.6% vs. 1.3%; p < .0001). Factors associated with in-hospital mortality included age, body mass index, chronic renal disease, percutaneous coronary intervention, and BAV bridge to TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: In unplanned/emergent and planned admission settings, the in-hospital mortality rate for BAV bridge to TAVR is worse than that for direct TAVR. Practical criteria for BAV bridge to TAVR should be proposed to improve outcomes.
