Title: Histopathological changes in salivary glands after radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid diseases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the histopathological alterations in human salivary glands after radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment for thyroid diseases.
STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively selected patients with a history of RAI treatment for thyroid diseases from a database of patients who underwent surgery for oral and maxillofacial diseases and had specimens of salivary glands at Peking University School of Stomatology between December 2012 and July 2023. The patients' clinical records and histopathological slides of the salivary glands were carefully reviewed.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included. Three symptomatic patients showed duct cell cytoplasmic vacuolization and increased numbers of disordered duct cell layers (3/3), severe duct stenosis and dilation (2/3), and exfoliated epithelial cells in the duct lumen (1/3). The glandular parenchyma showed severe acinar atrophy (2/2), fat content enhancement (2/2), and severe periductal fibrosis (3/3). Thirteen asymptomatic patients showed duct cell cytoplasmic vacuolization (5/13), acinar atrophy and increased fat content in the parenchyma (5/13), and periductal fibrosis (5/13).
CONCLUSION: Main histopathologic changes in the salivary glands after RAI treatment for thyroid diseases are cytoplasmic vacuolization of duct cells, acinar atrophy, fat content enhancement, and periductal fibrosis. These changes were evident in symptomatic cases, and were also seen in some asymptomatic patients.
