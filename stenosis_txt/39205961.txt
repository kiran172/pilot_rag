Title: Advances in the Diagnosis and Management of Cardiac Amyloidosis: A Literature Review.

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis, increasingly recognized for its significant impact on global heart health and patient survival, demands a thorough review to understand its complexity and the urgency of improved management strategies. As a cause of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, particularly in patients with aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation, this condition also relates to higher incidences of dementia in the affected populations. The objective of this review was to integrate and discuss the latest advancements in diagnostics and therapeutics for cardiac amyloidosis, emphasizing the implications for patient prognosis. We evaluated the latest literature from major medical databases such as PubMed and Scopus, focusing on research from 2020 to 2024, to gather comprehensive insights into the current landscape of this condition. Insights from our review highlight the complex pathophysiology of cardiac amyloidosis and the diagnostic challenges it presents. We detail the effectiveness of emerging treatments, notably gene silencing therapies like patisiran and vutrisiran, which offer transformative potential by targeting the production of amyloidogenic proteins. Additionally, the stabilization therapy acoramidis shows promise in modifying disease progression and improving clinical outcomes. This review underscores the critical need for updated clinical guidelines and further research to expand access to groundbreaking therapies and enhance disease management. Advocating for continued research and policy support, we emphasize the importance of advancing diagnostic precision and treatment effectiveness, which are vital for improving patient outcomes and addressing this debilitating disease globally.
