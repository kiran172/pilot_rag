Title: Experience in the treatment of obstructive colorectal cancer with self-expandable colon prosthesis in a tertiary hospital.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent neoplasms, with an increasing incidence in recent years. Intestinal obstruction is present at the time of diagnosis in 10-30% of patients. The aim of our study is to describe our experience in the use of colonic SEMS in the treatment of colonic stenosing neoplasia. For this purpose, we retrospectively evaluated the 92 patients treated with self-expandable metallic prostheses in our hospital between 2016 and 2021. In 66.3% of patients the prosthesis placement was bridge to curative surgery and in 33.7% with palliative attitude. The stenosis location was differentiated: rectum (2.1%), rectosigmoid junction (20.7%), sigma (58.7%), left colon (8.7%), splenic angle (8.7%) and transverse colon (1.1%); being the size of the self-expandable metallic prostheses used 60x25 mm, 90x25 mm and 120x25 mm. The procedure was technically effective in 92.4% of the cases and clinically effective in 89.1%, with post-procedural perforations being detected in 9 patients (9.8%). Survival 30 days after prosthesis placement was 91.3%. No mortality directly related to the procedure was detected. In our experience, placement of self-expandable metallic prostheses is a safe and effective option in the initial management of neoplastic colon stenosis.
