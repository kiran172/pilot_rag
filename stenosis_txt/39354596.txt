Title: Outcome of patient undergoing redo mitral valve surgery with incidence rate of mitral valve infective endocarditis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) in patients undergoing redo mitral valve (MV) surgery was evaluated. The outcomes of all the patients and the patients' specific characteristics were recorded. The patients were analyzed to further the research of IE in this population.
METHOD: This was a retrospective review of patients admitted for redo MV surgery with a prospective follow-up of electronic medical records at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 2009 to 2019. Pre/intra/post-operative factors contributing to mortality, morbidity, and freedom of adverse events were analyzed.
RESULT: A total of 211 patients underwent redo MV surgery, and 41 patients (19.4%) had IE; and 51% of this subset of patients, 21 individuals, developed IE after the initial MV surgery. MV stenosis was moderate/severe in 50 patients. Furthermore, MV regurgitation was present in 89 patients. Multivariate analysis of the data revealed multiple factors influencing mortality: age, peripheral vascular disease, concomitant procedures, peripheral vascular disease, red blood cell transfusions, preoperative mechanical valves, and active IE. In-hospital Mortality was 10.9%. The one-, five-, and ten-year survival was 88%, 79%, and 69% across all patients.
CONCLUSION: Although redo MV surgery has acceptable outcomes; the presence of IE or concomitant procedures is a significant health detriment in these patients. Our study highlights the need for careful patient management and more in-depth research in this area to improve patient outcomes.
