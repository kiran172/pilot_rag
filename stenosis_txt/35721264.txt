Title: Small bowel obstruction caused by appendiceal and ileal endometriosis: a case report.

Abstract: Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of an ectopic endometrial gland. Intestinal endometriosis with small bowel obstruction is uncommon. In this case, a 37-year-old woman with no history of endometriosis presented with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed a distal small bowel obstruction. Surgical intervention was performed because of the emergent abdominal condition and the potential resistance to conservative management. Histopathological examination revealed appendiceal and ileal endometriotic lesions. Preoperative diagnosis was difficult because there were no specific clinical features. Intraoperatively, it is difficult to distinguish intestinal endometriosis and bowel malignancy; thus, oncological resection should be performed.
