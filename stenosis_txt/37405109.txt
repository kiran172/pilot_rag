Title: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis: Two case reports.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis (UC). PSC is a well-known risk factor for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and ICC is known to have a poor prognosis.
CASE SUMMARY: We present two cases of ICC in patients with PSC associated with UC. In the first case, a tumor was found by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the liver of a patient with PSC and UC who presented to our hospital with right-sided rib pain. The second patient was asymptomatic, but we unexpectedly detected two liver tumors in an MRI performed to evaluate bile duct stenosis associated with PSC. ICC was strongly suspected by computed tomography and MRI in both cases, and surgery was performed, but unfortunately, the first patient died of ICC recurrence 16 mo postoperatively, and the second patient died of liver failure 14 mo postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Careful follow-up of patients with UC and PSC with imaging and blood tests is necessary for early detection of ICC.
