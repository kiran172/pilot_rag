Title: Myocardial sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 expression and cardiac remodelling in patients with severe aortic stenosis: The BIO-AS study.

Abstract: AIM: Cardiac remodelling plays a major role in the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and could impact the benefits of aortic valve replacement. Our study aimed to evaluate the expression of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) gene and protein in patients with severe AS stratified in high gradient (HG) and low flow-low gradient (LF-LG) AS and its association with cardiac functional impairments.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Gene expression and protein levels of main biomarkers of cardiac fibrosis (galectin-3, sST2, serpin-4, procollagen type I amino-terminal peptide, procollagen type I carboxy-terminal propeptide, collagen, transforming growth factor [TGF]-β), inflammation (growth differentiation factor-15, interleukin-6, nuclear factor-κB [NF-κB]), oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase 1 [SOD1] and 2 [SOD2]), and cardiac metabolism (sodium-hydrogen exchanger, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR]-α, PPAR-γ, glucose transporter 1 [GLUT1] and 4 [GLUT4]) were evaluated in blood samples and heart biopsies of 45 patients with AS. Our study showed SGLT2 gene and protein hyper-expression in patients with LF-LG AS, compared to controls and HG AS (p < 0.05). These differences remained significant even after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, history of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and coronary artery disease. SGLT2 gene expression was positively correlated with: (i) TGF-β (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) and collagen (r = 0.73, p < 0.001) as markers of fibrosis; (ii) NF-κB (r = 0.36, p < 0.01) and myocardial interleukin-6 (r = 0.68, p < 0.001) as markers of inflammation: (iii) SOD2 (r = -0.38, p < 0.006) as a marker of oxidative stress; (iv) GLUT4 (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and PPAR-α (r = 0.36, p < 0.01) as markers of cardiac metabolism.
CONCLUSION: In patients with LF-LG AS, SGLT2 gene and protein were hyper-expressed in cardiomyocytes and associated with myocardial fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.
