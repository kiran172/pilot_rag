Title: Levels of plasma Quaking and cyclooxygenase-2 predict in-stent restenosis in patients with coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is one of the important methods for the treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). In-sent restenosis (ISR) after PCI for patients suffered from CAD is considered to be an essential factor affecting long-term outcomes and prognosis of this disease. This study aims to investigate the correlation between plasma Quaking (QKI) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels and ISR in patients with CAD.
METHODS: A total of 218 consecutive CAD patients who underwent coronary angiography and coronary arterial stenting from September 2019 to September 2020 in the Department of Cardiology of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University were enrolled in this study, and 35 matched individuals from the physical examination center were served as a control group. After admission, clinical data of these 2 groups were collected. Plasma QKI and COX-2 levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Follow-up angiography was performed 12 months after PCI. CAD patients were divided into a NISR group (n=160) and an ISR group (n=58) according to the occurrence of ISR based on the coronary angiography. The clinical data, coronary angiography, and stent features between the NISR group and the ISR group were compared, and multivariate logistic regression was used to explore the factors influencing ISR. The occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 1 year after operation was recorded. Fifty-eight patients with ISR were divided into an MACE group (n=24) and a non-MACE group (n=34), classified according to the occurrence of MACE, and the plasma levels of QKI and COX-2 were compared between the 2 groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to analyze the diagnostic value of plamsa levels of QKI and COX-2 for ISR and MACE occurrences in patients after PCI.
RESULTS: Compared with control group, plasma levels of QKI and COX-2 in the CAD group decreased significantly (all P&lt;0.001). Compared with the NISR group, the plasma levels of QKI and COX-2 also decreased obviously in the ISR group (all P&lt;0.001), while the levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) significantly increased (all P&lt;0.001). The level of COX-2 was negatively correlated with hs-CRP (r=-0.385, P=0.003). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high level of plasma QKI and COX-2 were protective factors for in-stent restenosis after PCI, while hs-CRP was a risk factor. ROC curve analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of plasma QKI for evaluating the predictive value of ISR were 77.5% and 66.5%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of plasma COX-2 for evaluating the predictive value of ISR were 80.0% and 70.7%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma QKI combined with COX-2 for evaluating the predictive value of ISR were 81.3% and 74.1%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma QKI for evaluating the prognosis of ISR were 75.0% and 64.7%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma COX-2 for evaluating the prognosis of ISR were 75.0% and 70.6%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma QKI combined with COX-2 for prognostic evaluation of ISR were 81.7% and 79.4%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma COX-2 combined with QKI for evaluating ISR and MACE occurrences in patients after PCI were better than those of COX-2 or QKI alone (P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: High level of plasma QKI and COX-2 might be a protective factor for ISR, which can also predict ISR patient's prognosis.
