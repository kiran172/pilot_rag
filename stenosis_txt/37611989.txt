Title: Aortic Valve Disease, Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, and the Heart Failure Patient: A State-of-the-Art Review.

Abstract: Concomitant aortic stenosis (AS) in heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Current guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement in patients with severe symptomatic AS and asymptomatic AS with left ventricular ejection fraction <50% and during other cardiac surgeries. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has now allowed for the treatment of severe AS in previously inoperable or high-surgical-risk patients. Leveraging multimodality imaging techniques is increasingly recognized for reinforcing the rationale for intervening early, thus mitigating the risk of ongoing progression to advanced HF. There are increasing data in favor of TAVR in diverse clinical scenarios, particularly asymptomatic AS and moderate AS. Limited information is, however, available regarding the advantages of HF medical therapy before and after intervention. This review aims to comprehensively examine the phenotypes of AS in the context of HF progression, while exploring the evolving role of TAVR in specific populations.
