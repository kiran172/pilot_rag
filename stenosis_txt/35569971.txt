Title: Early Outcomes of Intuity Rapid Deployment Aortic Valve Replacement Compared With Conventional Biological Valves in Japanese Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to elucidate the short-term surgical outcomes and hemodynamics of the Intuity valve compared to the standard bioprosthesis in Japanese patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Among the 307 consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) between February 2019 and March 2021, the Intuity valve was implanted in 95 patients (Intuity group) and a conventional stented bioprosthesis was implanted in 193 patients (conventional group). After propensity score matching, there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between the Intuity (n=2, 3%) and conventional groups (n=0, P=0.490). Operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and aortic cross-clamping times were significantly shorter in the Intuity group. Although the effective orifice area index, trans-prosthetic mean pressure gradient, and peak velocity were similar between the 2 groups at 1 week postoperatively, the Intuity group showed a better mean pressure gradient and peak velocity at 1 year postoperatively. Complete atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation developed in 2 patients (3%) in the Intuity group and none in the conventional group (P=0.476). Mild or greater paravalvular leakage was present in 8 patients (13%) in the Intuity group and 2 patients (3%) in the conventional group (P=0.095).
CONCLUSIONS: AVR using the Intuity valve in Japanese patients is satisfactory, with a better valve performance and a low incidence of complete atrioventricular block at 1 year postoperatively.
