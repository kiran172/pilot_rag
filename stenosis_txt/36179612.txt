Title: Clinical features and long-term outcomes of symptomatic low-grade carotid stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In symptomatic low-grade stenosis, most of the reports did not clarify the long-term outcome. This study aims to clarify the clinical features and long-term outcomes of symptomatic low-grade stenosis cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 123 symptomatic patients with low-grade (<50%) carotid stenosis. The relative plaque signal intensity (rSI) and expansive remodeling rate (ERR) were measured using carotid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Antiplatelet therapy and treatment for atherosclerosis risk factors were administered in all cases. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was performed when ischemic symptoms appeared, or the percent stenosis progressed despite medical treatment.
RESULTS: The mean percent stenosis, rSI, and ERR on admission were 22.3, 1.70, and 2.01, respectively. The mean volume of the hyperintense plaque on carotid MRI was 641.4Â± 540 mm3. Sixty percent of cases involved intraplaque hemorrhage and expansive remodeling. During a mean follow-up of 52 months, recurrence of ischemic events was confirmed in 45 cases (36.6%). Of the 67 cases performed follow-up MRI, 34 cases (50%) had an increased volume of T1-hyperintense plaque. CEA or carotid artery stenting was performed in 49 cases. During a mean follow-up of 57.8 months after CEA, two cases of death (fatal intracerebral hemorrhage and asphyxia) and one case of brain stem lacunar infarction were observed, but ipsilateral ischemic events were not.
CONCLUSION: Most of the symptomatic patients with low-grade stenosis had both intraplaque hemorrhage and expansive remodeling and presented a high risk of recurrence and stenosis progression. CEA may have preventive effects against ischemic events in low-grade stenosis.
