Title: Acquired Von Willebrand Deficiency in Adults With Aortic Stenosis: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: Von Willebrand factor (VWF) deficiency is associated with bleeding complications. The congenital type of Von Willebrand disease(VWD) is a very well-known bleeding disorder and sometimes may be associated with life-threatening hemorrhage. This systematic review is aimed at gathering further knowledge regarding the pathology of an acquired VWD form within a population of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) by shortlisting quality articles on this theme, through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. High shear stress caused by the stenotic valve cleaves VWF multimers, causing a relative state of deficiency. The condition returns to baseline immediately following surgical replacement of the valve. Results across eight studies reviewed by a majority concluded that in an AS patient with bleeding, the most likely cause is an acquired deficiency of VWF, associated with factors influencing blood flow and caused by the in-situ valve. However, several studies suggested otherwise/were misclassifications. This review highlighted the relationship between AS and acquired VWF deficiency and should be foreseen as an adverse complication, attracting further research and future theragnostic strategies for this condition.
