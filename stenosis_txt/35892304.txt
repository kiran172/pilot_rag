Title: [Right Anterior Minithoracotomy as an Effective Technique for Minimally Invasive Aortic Valve Replacement in Frail and Elderly Patient:Report of a Case].

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has increasingly been used as a standard treatment option for patients with aortic valve stenosis, especially in the frail and the elderly. However, it is not recognized as a valid treatment for patients with aortic valve regurgitation. In this study, we report our experience in conducting a right anterior minithoracotomy for a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement in the elderly. An 87-year-old woman with severe aortic valve regurgitation was admitted to our department. Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement was performed, through a right anterior minithoracotomy in the second intercostal space. A localized transverse aortotomy was performed at a position higher than that in an ordinary aortotomy. Our procedure for aortic valve replacement was similar to the conventional method. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged after 10 days. Therefore, we conclude that right anterior minithoracotomy for a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement is a feasible, effective, and safe technique.
