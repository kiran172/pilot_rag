Title: Appraisal of urgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Urgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is needed in unstable patients with severe aortic stenosis and acute decompensated heart failure who are refractory to initial medical management. The outcome of urgent TAVR is worse and heavily influenced by the severity of the clinical status prior to intervention. Careful patient evaluation, procedural planning, and postoperative management should be optimized to improve the clinical results.
