Title: Outcomes and quality of life after aortic valve surgery in octogenarians.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The emergence of catheter-based techniques questioned existing treatment strategies for patients with aortic stenosis. The increasing effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation therapies justifies a renewed evaluation of the results in terms of survival rate as well as the quality of life (QoL) after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in the elderly. The aim of this study is the assessment of QoL in octogenarians undergoing isolated SAVR.
METHODS: A retrospective observational and descriptive study between January 2015 and January 2018, was conducted. Eighty-four Caucasians patients over 80 years of age undergoing aortic valve replacement in a single unit were, finally, followed-up. The patients' medical records were reviewed and QoL after a median 22-month follow-up time was evaluated by administering the EQ-5D questionnaire on the telephone.
RESULTS: Mean European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II was 2.1%. The 30-day mortality was 0% and the 1-year mortality was 3.6%. On the assessment of QoL within mean follow-up time of 22 months, performed in 81 patients (survivors), a remarkable improvement was recorded in 76.5% of patients (62 patients), while 12.3% (10 patients) reported aggravation of their health status and 11.1% (9 patients) had no change.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates after SAVR can be kept at very low levels, especially in experienced high-volume centers, even in the elderly. Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the majority of these patients achieve a good functional status and a satisfactory QoL after the operation. Therefore, SAVR should not be withheld on the grounds of age alone.
