Title: Subacute In-Stent Occlusion 2 Weeks after CASPER Rx Stenting: A Case Report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: CASPER Rx stent (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) is one of the dual-layer micromesh stents for carotid artery stenosis. Although it is expected to be safe and efficacious even for vulnerable plaque, we report a case of in-stent occlusion 2 weeks after stenting with CASPER Rx stent.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 78-year-old man with a symptomatic, severely stenosed lesion of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA). He had an unstable plaque and underwent carotid artery stenting with the CASPER Rx stent. There were no problems with the procedure or the patient's subsequent course, and he was discharged home 1 week after the procedure. However, on postoperative day 14, the patient had a transit ischemic attack and imaging showed acute occlusion due to thrombus in the stent and in the distal part of the ICA. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed and good recanalization was achieved, but postoperative cerebral infarction was observed and the patient was transferred to other hospital with modified Rankin Scale 2.
CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of in-stent occlusion 2 weeks after stenting with the CASPER Rx stent.
