Title: Ultrasound-Guided Cradle-Like Infiltrative Anesthesia for Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty of Stenotic Autogenous Arteriovenous Hemodialysis Access.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is an effective treatment for autogenous arteriovenous hemodialysis access (AAVA) stenosis; however, it causes pain in most cases. Therefore, safe and effective anesthesia for PTA is required.
METHODS: We introduced a method of ultrasound-guided cradle-like infiltration anesthesia (UCIA) to administer analgesia during PTA. Using ultrasound guidance, 1% lidocaine was injected into the bilateral and inferior perivascular spaces of the stenosis to form a cradle-like region. In this study, 100 consecutive patients were divided into two groups, and the analgesic effect of UCIA was evaluated using a numerical rating scale with non-ultrasound-guided infiltration anesthesia as a control. Meanwhile, we compared the effect of PTA between the two groups with the postoperative internal diameter of the stenosis.
RESULTS: The numerical rating scale score was 4.6 ± 1.9 and 2.0 ± 1.6 (P < 0.001) in UCIA group and non-ultrasound-guided infiltration anesthesia group, respectively. The postoperative internal diameter of stenosis was 3.9 ± 0.6 mm and 4.1 ± 0.7 mm (P = 0.113); the postoperative AAVA flow volume was 627 ± 176 mL/min and 644 ± 145 mL/min (P = 0.600).
CONCLUSIONS: This study preliminarily showed that UCIA is effective and safe for the analgesia of AAVA PTA.
