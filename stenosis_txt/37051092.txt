Title: Rapid airway stenosis due to ruptured occipital artery in a patient with neurofibromatosis type I.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type I is rarely associated with vascular abnormalities. Here, we report a case of rapid airway stenosis caused by a ruptured occipital artery that was treated with surgical airway management.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old woman, with no medical history, presented with a chief complaint of a sudden neck pain on the left side. She had a prominent mass in the outer left side of the neck. After arrival at the emergency room, the patient complained of severe dyspnea and experienced a rapid drop in oxygen saturation. Supplemental ventilation was ineffective, and tracheal intubation was attempted; however, laryngeal expansion could not be observed because of the enlarged cervical mass. Therefore, to manage the surgical airway, a cricothyrotomy was first carried out, which resulted in an immediate increase in oxygen saturation. Two percutaneous embolizations and one surgical procedure were carried out, and the patient was discharged without any complications.
CONCLUSION: For a sudden onset cervical mass, airway management should be undertaken, keeping in mind the possibility of worsening rapid airway narrowing due to bleeding.
