Title: Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement in a Very High-Risk Octagenerian Patient: A Case Report.

Abstract: Degeneration of the surgical bioprosthetic valves remains one of the most common complications of surgical valve replacement. Redo surgery is the gold standard, butÂ unfortunately, most of these patients are deemed inoperable because of the high perioperative mortality. Transcatheter implantation of a new valve inside the degenerated bioprosthesis (valve-in-valve (ViV)) has emerged as an alternative solution. A 79-year-old patient with a medical history of surgical replacement of the mitral valve with a bioprosthetic valve, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) with implantation of the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease was referred to our hospital for ViV transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR). He had recent hospitalizations with pulmonary edema caused by severe stenosis of the bioprosthetic valve and his perioperative mortality for a redo surgery was very high (EuroSCORE II: 13.72%). The ViV TMVR was performed with a transseptal approach and after the implantation of the new valve, the mean pressure gradient was dropped from 19.39 to 2.33 mmHg. The procedure was technically successful and the patient was discharged asymptomatic.
