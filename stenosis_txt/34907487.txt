Title: Successful treatment of severe adrenaline-resistant anaphylactic shock with glucagon in a patient taking a beta-blocker: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The efficacy of glucagon for adrenaline-resistant anaphylactic shock in patients taking β-blockers is controversial. However, understanding the efficacy of glucagon is important because adrenaline-resistant anaphylactic shock is fatal. We present a case of severe adrenaline-resistant anaphylactic shock in a patient taking a β-blocker, and glucagon was effective in improving hemodynamics.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 88-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and taking a selective β-1 blocker underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, she received 100 mg sugammadex, but 2 min later developed severe hypotension and bronchospasm. Suspecting anaphylactic shock, we intervened by administering adrenaline, fluid loading, and an increased noradrenaline dose. Consequently, the bronchospasm improved, but her blood pressure only increased minimally. Therefore, we administered 1 mg glucagon intravenously, and the hypotension resolved immediately.
CONCLUSIONS: Glucagon may improve hemodynamics in adrenaline-resistant anaphylactic shock patients taking β-blockers; however, its efficacy must be further evaluated in more cases.
