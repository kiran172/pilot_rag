Title: Double stenting in T configuration with safety micro-guidewire technique in a complex middle cerebral artery stenosis.

Abstract: Intracranial arterial stenosis is a frequently misdiagnosed cause of ischemic stroke, associated with high rates of recurrence under medical therapy alone. Endovascular intracranial angioplasty and stenting has increasingly been used worldwide for treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenoses, despite controversial results of the first randomized trials. Lesion morphology and etiology must be considered during endovascular treatment planning. Complex morphologies can lead to serious complications during the endovascular procedure. We present a case of a symptomatic complex middle cerebral artery stenosis that was successfully treated with a double stenting in T configuration, using a safety micro-guidewire technique. During follow-up, intracranial Doppler revealed a non-significant residual stenosis and the patient remained asymptomatic.
