Title: Impact of Post-PCI FFR Stratified by Coronary Artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low fractional flow reserve (FFR) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Hitherto, this assessment has been independent of the epicardial vessel interrogated.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the predictive capacity of post-PCI FFR for target vessel failure (TVF) stratified by coronary artery.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and individual patient-level data meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials and observational studies with protocol-recommended post-PCI FFR assessment. The difference in post-PCI FFR between left anterior descending (LAD) and non-LAD arteries was assessed using a random-effect models meta-analysis of mean differences. TVF was defined as a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization.
RESULTS: Overall, 3,336 vessels (n = 2,760 patients) with post-PCI FFR measurements were included in 9 studies. The weighted mean post-PCI FFR was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.90) and differed significantly between coronary vessels (LAD = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.88 vs non-LAD = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.91-0.94; P < 0.001). Post-PCI FFR was an independent predictor of TVF, with its risk increasing by 52% for every reduction of 0.10 FFR units, and this was mainly driven by TVR. The predictive capacity for TVF was poor for LAD arteries (AUC: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.47-0.58) and moderate for non-LAD arteries (AUC: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.59-0.73; LAD vs non-LAD arteries, P = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: The LAD is associated with a lower post-PCI FFR than non-LAD arteries, emphasizing the importance of interpreting post-PCI FFR on a vessel-specific basis. Although a higher post-PCI FFR was associated with improved prognosis, its predictive capacity for events differs between the LAD and non-LAD arteries, being poor in the LAD and moderate in the non-LAD vessels.
