Title: Undersized stent graft for treatment of cephalic arch stenosis in arteriovenous hemodialysis access.

Abstract: Cephalic arch stenosis (CAS) is a common cause of AV dialysis access failure and is notoriously difficult to treat with conventional venoplasty. Although stent graft (SG) placement has improved patency rate, they are prone to stent failure caused by edge stenosis. We investigate the effect of SG diameter relative to cephalic vein on patency rate among hemodialysis patients with dysfunctional arteriovenous access caused by CAS. We identified 22 patients with recalcitrant cephalic arch stenosis or post-venoplasty vessel rupture and received SG placement. Patients were divided into two groups based on the stent-to-vessel diameter (S/V) ratio: undersized group, < 1; and apposed group, 1-1.2. Outcomes were assessed through follow-up angiography. S/V ratio was significant smaller in the undersized patient group (p < 0.001). Placement of undersized SG demonstrated higher primary stent (p = 0.001) and access patency rates (p = 0.021) and a reduced number of post-treatment reinterventions per access year (p = 0.021). A decreased number of lateral edge stenosis was noted in undersized SG (p = 0.005). Increased S/V ratio was significantly associated with lateral edge stenosis (OR = 5.19; p = 0.027). Undersized SG is associated with higher primary stent and access patency rate, and decreased number of post-SG interventions, and are suggested in the treatment of cephalic arch stenosis.
