Title: Efficacy and Safety Profile of Montgomery T-Tube Implantation in Patients with Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheal stenosis is able to lead to airway obstruction.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of Montgomery T-tube implantation in patients with tracheal stenosis.
METHODS: Fifty-two patients with tracheal stenosis diagnosed between 2016 and 2019 were included in this retrospective cohort study. The patients were divided into observation group (n = 25 cases) and control group (n = 27). The therapeutic effect, arterial blood gas analysis, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>), arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), shortness of breath score, airway diameter change, dyspnea score, quality of life, and safety were compared between the two groups before and after treatment.
RESULTS: The therapeutic effect of the observation group gained better results than that of the control group (84.00% vs. 62.96%). One week after operation, the pH value, SaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, shortness of breath score, airway diameter change, dyspnea score, life quality, and incidence of postoperative complications in the observation group exerted better results as compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION: The implantation of Montgomery T-tube has effective function in terms of improving the symptoms of dyspnea and the life quality of patients with safety profile in patients harboring tracheal stenosis.
