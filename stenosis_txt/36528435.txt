Title: Outcomes of pulmonary artery sling repair without tracheoplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate surgical outcomes of pulmonary artery (PA) sling without tracheoplasty.
METHODS: From 2001 through 2020, among 22 patients who underwent PA sling repair, all but 1 patient who underwent concomitant tracheal surgery were analyzed. The outcomes of interest were all-cause death, PA reintervention, tracheal intervention, and readmission for respiratory symptoms. Computed tomography was used to measure the narrowest tracheal diameter.
RESULTS: The median age and weight at repair were 7.6 months and 7.7 kg, respectively. Most patients (20 out of 21, 95.2%) had preoperative respiratory symptoms. Associated airway anomalies included tracheal ring in 12 (57.1%), bridging bronchus in 8 (38.1%), and tracheal bronchus in 2 patients (9.5%). There was 1 in-hospital death (4.8%). The median ventilator time and intensive care unit stay were 23 hours and 3 days, respectively. There was neither late death nor tracheal intervention during follow-up. Five patients (25.0%) underwent reintervention for left PA stenosis. Hospital readmission for respiratory symptom was required in 7 patients and was associated with the narrowest preoperative tracheal diameter (P = .025) and cardiopulmonary bypass time (P = .040) in univariable analysis. The narrowest tracheal diameter of 3.4 mm was identified as a cutoff value for readmission for respiratory symptom. Freedom from readmission for respiratory symptom was 63.3% at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: PA sling repair without tracheal surgery might be a reasonable surgical option with rare need for tracheal intervention. Hospital readmissions for respiratory symptoms are more frequently required in patients with smaller tracheal diameter and all readmissions were limited to within 2 years after repair.
