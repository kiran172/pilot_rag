Title: CT coronary angiography in asymptomatic male patients with high atherosclerosis risk: Is it justified?

Abstract: PURPOSE: To study the necessity of coronary artery screening with computerized tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in asymptomatic male patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 226 asymptomatic male patients aged over 50 years were included in this prospective study, according to a clinical protocol approved by the Heraklion University Hospital's Ethics Committee. All participants had at least 3 or more known atherosclerosis risk factors. All patients had none or normal noninvasive cardiological tests in the past and had no contraindications for CTCA. All patients gave their informed consent after being notified regarding contrast medium and radiation dose risks.
RESULTS: Significant stenoses were found in 52 asymptomatic males (23%). Out of them, 38 male patients underwent invasive coronography and 14 patients were lost in follow-up. In 18 patients, no lesions were found (47.4%). In the other 20 (52.6%) patients, 28 lesions were found. Stent placement was performed in 11 patients, bypass surgery was proposed in 3 patients, and in another 6 patients conservative treatment was suggested. Patients with findings in CTCA were more likely to have a family history of coronary artery disease, compared to patients with normal CTCA (P < 0.05 by using Fischer's Exact Test). Sensitivity of CTCA for significant stenosis was 74.3% with a specificity of 62%.
CONCLUSION: CTCA may be used to screen for clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in asymptomatic male patients, particularly those with positive family history or potentially high-risk patients with >3 risk factors for CAD.
