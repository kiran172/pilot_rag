Title: Free Tube Graft Urethroplasty for Repair of Hypospadias.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess the outcome of free tube graft urethroplasty for single-stage repair of hypospadias with chordee in children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated a series of 56 patients (16 months to 9 years old, median 24 months) who underwent free graft urethroplasty for repair of hypospadias with chordee between May 2005 and November 2017. The median follow-up was 7 years (range 1-11).
RESULTS: After releasing the chordee, the hypospadiac orifice was retracted to become penile in 32 patients (57%), penoscrotal in 18 patients (32%), and scrotal in 6 patients (11%). Single-stage repair was achieved without complications in 42 patients (75%). Of the remaining 14 patients with postoperative complications requiring surgical intervention, 2 had meatal stenosis, 9 had urethrocutaneous fistula, 1 had urethral diverticulum without meatal stenosis, and 1 had meatal regression. One patient who complained the urine stream went upwards in an arc underwent cutback meatoplasty to correct the stream. In all patients, a neomeatus with a vertically oriented slit-like appearance was eventually achieved at the tip of the glans.
CONCLUSION: A free graft is an appropriate choice for repairing hypospadias with chordee. Our procedure achieved favorable functional and cosmetic outcomes with a low postoperative morbidity rate.
