Title: Patients with bicuspid aortic valves may be associated with infra-hisian conduction disease requiring pacemakers.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs) are associated with accelerated valvular dysfunction. Increasing rates of conduction system disease are seen in patients with calcific tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). However, little is known regarding the extent of conduction disorders in BAV patients. We sought to determine the extent of infra-hisian conduction pathology among patients with BAVs undergoing EP studies.
METHODS: We prospectively analyzed patients presenting to the EP laboratory from 2006 to 2017 at our institution. Thirty-three BAV patients had measured HV intervals. Each individual was matched by age and gender to two control patients. Clinical characteristics were collected and compared, and patients followed for outcomes.
RESULTS: The BAV cohort had a mean age of 47.8 ± 17.2 years (range 19-76 years). Indications for referral to the EP lab in the BAV cohort included SVT ablation (n = 16), VT ablation (n = 10), and EP study for syncope, pre-syncope, or palpitations (n = 29). Patients with BAVs had a mean HV interval of 58.7 ms ± 18.6 ms, compared to a mean of 47.2 ms ± 9.6 ms for controls (p value = 0.0001). Over a 10-year follow-up period, 9 BAV patients (27%) went on to require permanent pacing compared to 6 patients (9%) in the control group (p value = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Compared to patients with TAVs presenting for EP evaluation, individuals with BAVs have longer HV intervals and a significantly increased requirement for pacemaker therapy over long-term follow-up. Closer monitoring of progressive conduction system disease in BAV patients may be warranted.
