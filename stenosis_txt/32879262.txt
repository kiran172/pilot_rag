Title: 18-Year Follow-Up After Coronary Stenting for Left Main Coronary Artery Lesions.

Abstract: The current treatment of radiation-induced coronary artery disease (RCAD) is comparable to that of generic coronary artery disease (CAD); however, the outcomes of these treatment measures have not been fully examined in RCAD. A 33-year-old woman, without conventional cardiovascular risk factors, presented with left main coronary artery (LMCA) lesions. At the age of 26, she received mediastinal radiation therapy (RT) to treat mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma. One BiodivYsio 3.5 Ã— 18 mm stent was implanted at the LMCA site. At the age of 38, the patient was treated by balloon dilatation because of approximately 50% in-stent stenosis. At the last follow-up in February 2018, when the patient was 51 years old, she no longer complained of chest pain. Coronary angiography showed no de novo or in-stenosis lesions, although optical coherence tomography showed mild neointimal proliferation, calcific plaque, small ruptured intima, and several uncovered struts. The experience of treating this case may shed some light on coronary stenting in coronary lesions caused by RCAD.
