Title: Structural and Functional Disturbances of the Thoracic Aorta in Atherosclerosis of Various Gradations.

Abstract: Aim      To study global aortic circumferential strain in normal conditions and in atherosclerosis of various grades and to determine its role in prediction of structural and functional disorders of the thoracic aorta (TA) and coronary atherosclerosis using 2D speckle-tracking transesophageal echocardiography.Material and methods  182 patients with typical or probable angina were examined. The control group consisted of 11 healthy volunteers. TA was visualized along its entire length. The height of each atheroma was measured, and the total number of plaques in the TA was determined. Five stages of TA atherosclerosis were identified. In the descending TA, the global peak systolic circumferential strain (GCS, %) and the global peak systolic circumferential strain normalized to pulse arterial pressure (PAP) (GCS / PAP∙100) were calculated. All patients underwent coronary angiography. The number of coronary arteries (CAs) with &gt;50 % stenosis was determined, and the SYNTAX Score was calculated.Results TA atherosclerosis was not detected in the control group. Among 182 patients, stage 1-5 TA atherosclerosis was found in 23 (12.6 %), 103 (56.6 %), 43 (23.6 %), 7 (3.8 %), and 6 (3.4 %) cases respectively. GCS and GCS / PAD decreased as the ultrasound stage of TA atherosclerosis increased as compared with the control group: 9.2 % and 15.3 for the control group; stage 1, 5.6 % and 8.9 (p&lt;0.001); stage 2, 4.1 % and 5.9 (p&lt;0.001); stage 3, 4 % and 5.8 (p&lt;0.001); stage 4, 3.7 % and 4.9 (p&lt;0.01); and stage 5, 2.6 % and 3.3 (p&lt;0.01), respectively. ROC analysis showed that GCS ≥5.9 % (area under the curve, AUC, 0.94±0.03; p&lt;0.001) and GCS / PAD ≥11.4 (AUC, 0.97±0.02; p &lt;0.001) were predictors of intact TA. Also, GCS ≤4.85 % (AUC, 0.82±0.04; p&lt;0.001) and GCS / PAD ≤8.06 (AUC, 0.87±0.03; p&lt;0.001) were predictors of hemodynamically significant TA atherosclerosis (stages 3-5). GCS ≤4.05 % (AUC, 0.62±0.04; p=0.007) and GCS / PAD ≤5.95 (AUC, 0.61±0.04; p=0.018) were predictors of hemodynamically significant (&gt;50 %) stenosing atherosclerosis of at least one CA. Furthermore, GCS ≤3.75 % (AUC, 0.67±0.07; p=0.039) and GCS / PAD ≤5.15 (AUC, 0.64±0.07; p=0.045) were predictors of severe and advanced coronary atherosclerosis (SYNTAX Score ≥22).Conclusion      GCS and GCS / PAD are new diagnostic markers of structural and functional disorders of TA in atherosclerosis of various grades. GCS and GCS / PAD are independent predictors of high-grade TA atherosclerosis (stages 3-5) with GCS / PAD demonstrating the highest level of significance. GCS and GCS / PAD are non-invasive predictors of severe and advanced CA atherosclerosis.
