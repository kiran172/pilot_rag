Title: Hypogastric artery luminal diameter predicts common-external iliac stent patency and major adverse limb events in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Hypogastric coverage may be required for occlusive disease at the iliac arterial bifurcation. In this study, we sought to determine patency rates of common-external iliac artery (C-EIA) bare metal stents (BMS) spanning the hypogastric origin in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). In addition, we sought to identify predictors of C-EIA BMS patency loss and major adverse limb events (MALE) in patients requiring hypogastric coverage. We hypothesized that worsening stenosis of the hypogastric origin would negatively influence C-EIA stent patency and freedom from MALE.
METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing elective, endovascular treatment of aortoiliac disease (AIOD) between 2010 and 2018. Only patients with C-EIA BMS coverage of a patent IIA origin were included in the study. Hypogastric luminal diameter was determined from preoperative CT angiography. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariable and multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operator characteristics (ROC).
RESULTS: There were 236 patients (318 limbs) who were included in the study. AIOD was TASC C/D in 236/318 (74.2%) of cases. C-EIA stent primary patency was 86.5% (95% confidence interval: 81.1, 91.9) at 2 years and 79.7% (72.8, 86.7) at 4 years. Freedom from ipsilateral MALE was 77.0% (71.1, 82.9) at 2 years and 68.7% (61.3, 76.2) at 4 years. Luminal diameter of the hypogastric origin was most strongly associated with loss of C-EIA BMS primary patency in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio: 0.81, p = .02). Insulin-dependent diabetes, Rutherford's class IV or above, and stenosis of the hypogastric origin were significantly predictive of MALE in both univariable and multivariable analyses. In ROC analysis, luminal diameter of the hypogastric origin was superior to chance in prediction of C-EIA primary patency loss and MALE. Hypogastric diameter &gt;4.5 mm had a negative predictive value of 0.94 for C-EIA primary patency loss and 0.83 for MALE.
CONCLUSIONS: Patency rates of C-EIA BMS are high. Hypogastric luminal diameter is an important and potentially modifiable predictor of C-EIA BMS patency and MALE in patients with AIOD.
