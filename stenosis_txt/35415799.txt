Title: Postoperative liver function tests can predict anastomotic dysfunction after bile duct injury repair.

Abstract: Liver function tests help in the follow-up of postoperative patients with iatrogenic bile duct injury. There is not clear evidence regarding their predictive role on anastomosis dysfunction. We describe our experience with postoperative liver function tests and a predictive model of long-term patency after repair. This is retrospective cohort study of patients with bilioenteric anastomosis for bile duct injury and their long-term follow-up. A binomial logistic regression model was performed to ascertain the effects of the grade of bile duct injury and liver function test in the postoperative period. A total of 329 patients were considered for the analysis. In the logistic regression model two predictor variables were statistically significant for anastomosis stenosis: type of bilioenteric anastomosis and alkaline phosphatase levels. A ROC curve analysis was made for alkaline phosphatase with an area under the curve of 0.758 (95% CI 0.67-0.84). A threshold of 323 mg/dL was established (OR 6.0, 95% CI 2.60-13.83) with a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 67%, PPV of 20%, NPV of 96%, PLR of 2.27 and NLR of 0.37. Increased alkaline phosphatase (above 323 mg/dL) after the fourth operative week was found to be a predictor of long-term dysfunction.
