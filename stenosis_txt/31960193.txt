Title: The Ureter in the Kidney Transplant Setting: Ureteroneocystostomy Surgical Options, Double-J Stent Considerations and Management of Related Complications.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the setting of kidney transplantation, the ureter is a common source for complications. As a result, prevention of ureteral complications and their management is of crucial importance. In this context, the purpose of this review is to summarize recent literature on the ureter in the kidney transplant setting with a special focus on new findings. We conducted a PubMed and Medline search over the last 10Â years to identify all new publications related to ureteroneoimplantations, stents and management of complications in the kidney transplant setting.
RECENT FINDINGS: Performance of the "Lich-Gregoir" technique for ureteroneocystostomy seems to be favourable in regard to postoperative complications when compared with other methods described in the literature. Moreover, major urologic complications can be further reduced by ureteral stenting. A new approach for management of ureteral strictures in renal transplants is presented. We discussed the usage of a ureteral stent covered with a biostable polymer aiming to prevent tissue ingrowth into the lumen as a new option for management of ureteral stricture in the kidney transplant setting.
