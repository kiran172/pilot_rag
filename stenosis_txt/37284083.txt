Title: Low-profile visualized intraluminal support-within-Enterprise overlapping-stent technique versus flow diversion in the treatment of intracranial vertebrobasilar trunk dissecting aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is necessary to explore the safety and efficacy of various endovascular treatment techniques in the treatment of patients with intracranial vertebrobasilar trunk dissecting aneurysms (VBTDAs). This study sought to compare the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with intracranial VBTDAs following low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS)-within-Enterprise overlapping-stent technique with those of flow diversion (FD).
METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational, cohort study. Between January 2014 and March 2022, 9,147 patients with intracranial aneurysms were screened, and 91 patients with 95 VBTDAs who underwent LVIS-within-Enterprise overlapping-stent assisted-coiling technique or FD were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the complete occlusion rate at the last angiographic follow-up. The secondary outcomes included adequate aneurysm occlusion, in-stent stenosis/thrombosis, general neurological complications, neurological complications within 30 days after the procedure, the mortality rate, and unfavorable outcomes.
RESULTS: Among the 91 included patients, 55 were treated with LVIS-within-Enterprise overlapping-stent technique (the LE group) and 36 were treated with FD (the FD group). The angiography results at the median follow-up time of 8 months showed complete occlusion rates of 90.0% and 60.9% for the LE and FD groups, respectively, with an adjusted odds ratio of 5.79 (95% CI: 1.35-24.85; P=0.01). Adequate aneurysm occlusion (P=0.98), in-stent stenosis/thrombosis (P=0.46), general neurological complications (P=0.22), neurological complications within 30 days after the procedure (P=0.63), mortality rate (P=0.31), and unfavorable outcomes (P=0.07) at the last clinical follow-up did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher complete occlusion rate for VBTDAs was found following LVIS-within-Enterprise overlapping-stent technique as compared with FD. The 2 treatment modalities have comparable adequate occlusion rates and safety profiles.
