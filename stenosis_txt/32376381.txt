Title: Percutaneous Endoscopic Thoracic Decompression for Thoracic Spinal Stenosis Under Local Anesthesia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Thoracic spinal stenosis (TSS), a common vertebral degenerative disease, is generally treated via surgical decompression. Percutaneous endoscopic thoracic decompression (PETD) under local anesthesia is considered a relatively safe, minimally invasive procedure. Few reports detail the success of endoscopic decompression for treatment of TSS caused by ossification of ligamentum flavum, the most common cause of TSS. This study investigated application of PETD for treatment of TSS caused by ossification of ligamentum flavum, ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament, or thoracic disc herniation.
METHODS: From January 2017 to January 2019, 12 consecutive patients (6 men and 6 women) underwent PETD. TSS was caused by ossification of ligamentum flavum in 5 patients, thoracic disc herniation in 5 patients, and ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament in 2 patients. All cases were followed up for 1 year postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative neurologic status was evaluated using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, and complications were documented.
RESULTS: Average modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score improved significantly from 6.25 ± 1.60 preoperatively to 9.75 ± 1.21 at final follow-up. Dural tear was observed in 1 case during the intervention, and 1 case had transient worsening of preoperative paralysis. Recovery at final follow-up was classified as excellent in 5 cases, good in 6 cases, and poor in 1 case.
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis showed that PETD under local anesthesia may be a feasible alternative to treat TSS in elderly patients with other underlying complications for whom general anesthesia or major surgical trauma would be harmful.
