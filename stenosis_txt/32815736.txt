Title: Cerebral Venous Stenting for Pulsatile Tinnitus After Unsuccessful Jugular Ligation: Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Pulsatile tinnitus constitutes up to 10% of all tinnitus cases. Cerebral venous stenosis is a known etiology of pulsatile tinnitus. Treatment of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to venous stenosis with venous stenting has been reported in the literature but is not performed routinely. We would like to report a case of chronic pulsatile tinnitus treated with venous stent in a patient who previously underwent jugular vein ligation.
