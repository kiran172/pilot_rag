Title: Vascular Complications in Pediatric Liver Transplants and Their Management.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The blood supply of the liver occurs through the hepatic artery and portal vein. Outflow of blood circulation in the liver is via the hepatic veins. Any disruption in this blood circulation results in deterioration of liver functions. In this study, we evaluated early vascular complications in pediatric liver transplant recipients seen at our center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 1988 to December 2021, our team has performed 701 liver transplant procedures, which have included 334 pediatric liver transplants. Among these pediatric liver transplant recipients (mean age of 7.34 y), 176 were male patients. Nineteen patients (5.7%) were recipients of deceased donors. Reason for liver failure was mainly biliary atresia (n = 169). Mean weight of recipients was 23.3 kg. Most graft types were left lateral grafts (n = 204).
RESULTS: Three patients had hepatic vein complications. All 3 patients were successfully treated with interventional radiological methods by placing a stent in the anastomosis region. Portal vein complications occurred in 3 patients. One patient had hemostasis performed surgically. The second patient had surgically revision of the anastomosis because of thrombus formation. Because of stenosis of more than 50% in the portal vein anastomosis, the third patient required stent placement in the anastomosis region. Hepatic artery complications occurred in 54 patients: 31 patients had hepatic artery thrombosis, 13 patients had hepatic artery stenosis, 7 patients had bleeding from hepatic artery anastomosis, 2 patients had hepatic artery dissection, and 1 patient had pseudoaneurysm in the hepatic artery. Forty-three of these patients were successfully treated with interventional radiological methods and 11 required surgical treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Vascular complications after liver transplant can cause deterioration in hepatic functions and acute liver failure. Vascular complications can be successfully treated in experienced organ transplant centers.
