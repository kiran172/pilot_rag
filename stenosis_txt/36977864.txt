Title: Individualized Biliary Reconstruction Techniques in Liver Transplantation: Five Years' Experience of a Single Institution.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To summarize the experience of individualized biliary reconstruction techniques in deceased donor liver transplantation and explore potential risk factors for biliary stricture.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected medical records of 489 patients undergoing deceased donor liver transplantation at our center between January 2016 and August 2020. According to anatomical and pathological conditions of donor and recipient biliary ducts, patients' biliary reconstruction methods were divided into six types. We summarized the experience of six different reconstruction methods and analyzed the biliary complications' rate and risk factors after liver transplantation.
RESULTS: Among 489 cases of biliary reconstruction methods during liver transplantation, there were 206 cases of type I, 98 cases of type II, 96 cases of type III, 39 cases of type IV, 34 cases of type V, and 16 cases of type VI. Biliary tract anastomotic complications occurred in 41 cases (8.4%), including 35 cases with biliary stricture (7.2%), 9 cases with biliary leakage (1.8%), 19 cases with biliary stones (3.9%), 1 case with biliary bleeding (0.2%), and 2 cases with biliary infection (0.4%). One of 41 patients died of biliary tract bleeding and one died of biliary infection. Thirty-six patients significantly improved after treatment, and 3 patients received secondary transplantation. Compared with patients without biliary stricture, a higher warm ischemic time was observed in patients with non-anastomotic stricture and more leakage of bile in patients with an anastomotic stricture.
CONCLUSION: The individualized biliary reconstruction methods are safe and feasible to decrease perioperative anastomotic biliary complications. Biliary leakage may contribute to anastomotic biliary stricture and cold ischemia time to non-anastomotic biliary stricture.
