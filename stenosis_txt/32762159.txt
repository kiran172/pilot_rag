Title: [Preliminary result of stents implantation for spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery: a prospective single-arm study].

Abstract: ObjectiveTo access the efficacy of stents for spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SIDSMA). MethodThe study is a prospective single-arm study which has been registered on Clinical Trials (NCT03916965). Clinical data and follow-up information of the SIDSMA patients who received stent implantation in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University during April 1, 2019 and September 30, 2019 were collected. The patients were recommended to be followed up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. ResultsA total of 34 patients were enrolled. Their mean age was (54±8) years. Abdominal pain was the most common symptom. Patients received (2.1±0.6) stents on the average. Post-operation hospital stay was (2.7±1.6) days, and the patients were followed up for (2.3±1.9) months (CT angiography) and (5.5±1.7) months (clinical visit/phone call). There was no recurrence of abdominal pain. The CT angiography showed complete remodeling and incomplete remodeling took place in 23 and 9 patients (69.7% and 27.3%), respectively. Two patients (6.1%) had mild in-stent stenosis. No stent rupture or migration was reported. ConclusionThis study demonstrated a satisfactory short-term result of stents implantation for SIDSMA, which indicated the endovascular treatment could be the first-line therapy for SIDSMA.
