Title: Procedural safety and outcome of ultrathin strut stents (<60 μm) in the management of very long coronary artery stenosis (>30 mm) - A retrospective real world study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The ultrathin strut stents (<60 μm) are new in the current stents technology. This technology has assured to have less stent thrombosis, restenosis and better deliverability. Still there is lacking data of using long ultrathin strut stents in very long segment coronary artery disease (>30 mm).
AIM: The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the procedural safety and outcome of using ultrathin strut stents in very long segment coronary artery lesion.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we have enrolled those patients who had an implant of more than 30 mm length of ultrathin strut stents (Evermine 50TM and Tetrilimus stents) in real world patients as per physician discretion. Here, we enrolled 156 patients which included both acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). The endpoint of this study was to evaluate the immediate procedural success and short to intermediate term follow-up of all-cause mortality and clinically driven target lesion revascularization.
RESULTS: Out of these 156 patients (mean age- 61.2 +/- 10.4 years; male: 114), in 12 patients, these long stents couldn't be delivered. In rest 144 patients, 147 ultrathin strut stents were implanted. In about 56% patients were hypertensive and 48% patients were diabetic. About 63% patients had ACS and rest 37% patients had SIHD. The mean duration of follow up was 8.4 +/- 13.9 months. Average stent length and diameter were 39.5 +/- 5.9 mm and 3.03 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. There was no acute or sub-acute stent thrombosis and no procedural complication. Five patients died during follow-up (all-cause mortality) and rest are all symptoms free. There were no statistical significant differences seen among the stent types.
CONCLUSION: Ultrathin strut stents can be considered for stenting in long segment coronary artery stenosis with reasonably good procedural success rate and have good clinical outcome, but needs further large randomized trial before using in this particular clinical condition. Both the stent designs have similar clinical outcome and procedural success.
