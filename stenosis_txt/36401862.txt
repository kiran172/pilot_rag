Title: [Comparative analysis of the results of decompressive interventions in elderly patients with cauda equine syndrome caused by lumbar spinal stenosis.].

Abstract: The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment and the effectiveness of clinical recovery in elderly patients with cauda equina syndrome (CES) caused by degenerative spinal canal stenosis after isolated open and minimally invasive decompression. A retrospective analysis of the results of surgical treatment of 50 patients over 60 years of age who underwent isolated open (n=21) and minimally invasive (n=29) decompressive interventions for CES caused by lumbar spinal stenosis was performed. For comparative analysis, we used the technical features of the intervention, the specificity of postoperative management of patients, clinical parameters, and the number of perioperative complications. As a result, the advantages of minimally invasive isolated decompression compared to open decompression due to a smaller volume of blood loss and duration of hospitalization, low need for postoperative pain relief, a minimum number of perioperative surgical complications, as well as the dynamics of neurological symptoms, better efficiency of clinical recovery of functional state indicators according to ODI and quality life according to SF-36 in the late postoperative period.
