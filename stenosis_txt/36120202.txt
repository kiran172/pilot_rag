Title: Covered Stenting for a Large Coronary Artery Aneurysm With Adjacent Stenosis in a Poor Surgical Candidate.

Abstract: Coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) are being increasingly diagnosed with the advent of coronary angiography, and their management depends on the clinical presentation, size, and etiology of the aneurysm. Small aneurysms are usually managed with covered stents, while surgical intervention is considered for large aneurysms. We present a challenging case of a large CAA with adjacent coronary artery stenosis managed with guide extension catheter-assisted covered stent deployment as the patient was not a good surgical candidate.
