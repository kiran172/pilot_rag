Title: Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis Related Brain Infarction in Synovitis-Acne-Pustulosis-Hyperostosis Osteomyelitis Syndrome.

Abstract: A 50-year-old woman with a history of synovitis-acne-pustulosis-hyperostosis osteomyelitis (SAPHO) syndrome was admitted for left unilateral neglect, dysarthria, and left hemiparesis. Brain MRI showed multiple infarctions in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery and gadolinium enhancement of the thickened frontotemporal dura mater on the right side. MR angiography showed significant narrowing of the cavernous segment of the right internal carotid artery. The right internal carotid artery stenosis was thought to originate from hypertrophic pachymeningitis associated with SAPHO syndrome. This is the first report of brain infarction due to internal carotid artery stenosis caused by hypertrophic pachymeningitis associated with SAPHO syndrome.
