Title: Development of a sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistula secondary to sigmoid sinus thrombosis after resection of a foramen magnum meningioma: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The precise etiology of dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is still unknown. The authors reported a case of delayed postoperative sigmoid sinus (SS) DAVF secondary to SS thrombosis after resection of a foramen magnum meningioma through a suboccipital craniotomy.
OBSERVATIONS: The authors visualized the clear architecture of the DAVF using fusion three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) images reconstructed from multimodal imaging studies. These fusion 3DCG images revealed that the feeders of the DAVF had connected through neovascularization to the SS at the previous thrombus site. The authors also reviewed previously reported cases of DAVFs that developed after craniotomy.
LESSONS: This study indicated that SS stenosis and occlusion with sinus thrombosis are possible risk factors for delayed postoperative DAVF that demand special consideration.
