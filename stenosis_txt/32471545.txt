Title: MR Imaging of the Mesenteric Vasculature.

Abstract: MR angiography is a flexible imaging technique enabling morphologic assessment of mesenteric arterial and venous vasculature. Conventional gadolinium-based contrast media and ferumoxytol are used as contrast agents. Ferumoxytol, an intravenous iron replacement therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for iron deficiency anemia, is an effective and well tolerated blood pool contrast agent. The addition of 4D flow MR imaging enables a functional assessment of the arterial and venous vasculature; when coupled with a meal challenge, the severity of mesenteric arterial stenosis is well appreciated. Noncontrast MR angiographic techniques are useful for evaluating suspected mesenteric ischemia.
