Title: Histologically Validated Myocardial Fibrosis in Relation to Left Ventricular Geometry and Its Function in Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: The combination of aortic valve stenosis (AS) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) is quite common and is associated with myocardial fibrosis (MF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the histologically verified left ventricular (LV) MF and its geometry and function in isolated AS and AS within IHD groups. Materials and Methods: In a single-center, prospective trial, 116 patients underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) with/without concomitant surgery. The study population was divided into groups of isolated AS with/without IHD. Echocardiography was used, and LV measurements and aortic valve parameters were obtained from all patients. Myocardial tissue was procured from all study patients undergoing elective surgery. Results: There were no statistical differences between isolated AS and AS+IHD groups in LV parameters or systolic and diastolic functions during the study periods. The collagen volume fraction was significantly different between the isolated AS and AS+IHD groups and was 7.3 ± 5.6 and 8.3 ± 6.4, respectively. Correlations between MF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (r = 0.59, p = &lt; 0.001), left ventricular mass (LVM) (r = 0.42, p = 0.011), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = -0.67, p &lt; 0.001) and an efficient orifice area (EOA) (r = 0.371, p = 0.028) were detected in isolated AS during the preoperative period; the same was observed for LVEDD (r = 0.45, p = 0.002), LVM (r = 0.36, p = 0.026), LVEF (r = -0.35, p = 0.026) and aortic annulus (r = 0.43, p = 0.018) in the early postoperative period; and LVEDD (r = 0.35, p ≤ 0.05), LVM (r = 0.43, p = 0.007) and EOA (r = 0.496, p = 0.003) in the follow-up period. In the group of AS and IHD, correlations were found only with LV posterior wall thickness (r = 0.322, p = 0.022) in the follow-up period. Conclusions: Histological MF in AS was correlated with LVM and LVEDD in all study periods. No correlations between MF and LV parameters were found in aortic stenosis in the ischemic heart disease group across all study periods.
