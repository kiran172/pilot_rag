Title: Five-step unilateral biportal endoscopic surgery for central lumbar canal stenosis: "Z" technique nuance.

Abstract: The treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis has advanced through the use of minimally invasive surgery techniques. Endoscopic methods go even further, with studies showing that both uniportal and biportal endoscopic techniques have outcomes comparable to traditional approaches. However, there is limited knowledge of the step-by-step decompression process when using the unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE). To address this, the authors introduce the five steps in the "Z" sequence, which aims to reduce surgical time and complications.
