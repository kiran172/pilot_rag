Title: Clinical efficacy of ureteroscopy-assisted laparoscopic ureteroplasty in the treatment of ureteral stricture after pelvic surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of ureteroscope-assisted laparoscopic ureteroplasty in treating ureteral stricture after pelvic surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 95 patients treated for ureteral stricture at Ganzhou People's Hospital from June 2017 to March 2023 after pelvic surgery. In this group, 49 patients underwent ureteroscope and laparoscopic ureteroplasty under lithotomy position. The control group consisted of 46 patients who underwent simple laparoscopic ureteroplasty in a supine position. Postoperative data from both groups were collected and compared, including operation time, amount of blood loss during surgery, postoperative hospital stay, incidence of complications, success rate of ureteroplasty, and effectiveness of the operation.
RESULTS: The success rate of end-to-end ureteral anastomosis in the observation group was 93.88%, and the operation effectiveness rate was 100%. The success rate in the control group was 78.26% and the operation effectiveness rate was 89.1%.The average operation time and intraoperative blood loss in the observation group were (121.3 ± 44.6) min and (137.5 ± 34.2) ml, respectively, while in the control group they were (151.2 ± 52.3) min and (165.6 ± 45.8) ml, the difference were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The incidence of perioperative complications in the observation group was 2%, significantly lower than that in the control group (19.6%) (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Ureteroscope-assisted laparoscopic ureteroplasty for ureteral stricture after pelvic surgery has the advantages of shortened operation time, increased success rate, and reduced incidence of complications, making it an optional surgical scheme in clinical practice.
