Title: Cardiac amyloidosis prevalence and 1-year outcome in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transaortic valve implantation: Findings from the CAMPOS-TAVI study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) can manifest as rhythm disorders, heart failure, but also valvular degeneration. Despite aortic stenosis (AS) being prevalent among the elderly, data on ATTR-CM prevalence and outcome in patients with AS undergoing transaortic valve implantation (TAVI) remain scarce.
AIM: To determine ATTR-CM prevalence and evaluate 1-year survival in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: Between December 2020 and September 2021, 100 consecutive patients underwent TAVI and were screened prospectively for ATTR-CM using bone scintigraphy (BS). Monoclonal gammopathy was ruled out in case of cardiac uptake on BS. All patients were followed prospectively for 1year after TAVI.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients agedâ‰¥75years or with a EuroSCORE II>8% and possible femoral access was 99%. The abnormal cardiac uptake rate on BS was 7% (95% confidence interval: 2-12%); 86% of these patients were male. The RAISE (remodelling, age, injury, system and electrical) score, indicative of ATTR-CM risk, was higher in case of positive BS (P=0.04). Patients with positive BS were older and exhibited wider QRS complexes on electrocardiography (P=0.003), a higher frequency of reduced LVEF (57% vs. 17%), impaired basal LV strain (P=0.02) and a lower voltage/mass ratio (P=0.01). History of pacemaker implantation before TAVI was higher in the positive BS group (P=0.0004) and remained the only statistically significant factor after adjustment using the Holm-Bonferroni method. One-year survival of patients with positive BS did not differ from that of patients with isolated AS.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of ATTR-CM in patients treated with TAVI, underscoring the need for continued surveillance for potential development of ATTR-CM after TAVI. Caution is warranted regarding the 1-year survival because of the lack of study power. Further investigations are needed to define long-term prognosis of AS with ATTR-CM.
