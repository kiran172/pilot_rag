Title: Dynamic coronary CT Angiography-Estimated coronary flow in Non-Obstructive, Plaque-free coronary Arteries: Association with dyslipidemia and diabetes.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: In this study, we implemented dynamic coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in order to estimate the coronary flow rate in morphologically normal coronary arteries as well as to identify factors affecting the coronary flow rate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 95 consecutively presenting patients without stenosis or plaque in their major coronary arteries on CCTA conducted with a 320-detector scanner (mean age, 57 years; 43 % men). Time-attenuation curves of the distal sites of the major coronary arteries and the aortic root were extracted from dynamic CCTA data. Coronary flow rate, an indicator of coronary blood flow, was calculated via a convolution-integration method integrating the two curves. Patients with dyslipidemia were divided according to the presence or absence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) as well as according to the receipt of statin therapy.
RESULTS: We found that the coronary flow rate was statistically significantly lower in statin-naïve patients with dyslipidemia (n = 27, 0.56 ± 0.10) than in patients without dyslipidemia (n = 32, 0.64 ± 0.10, p = 0.0013). In FH (n = 26), the coronary flow rate was statistically significantly lower in statin-naïve patients (n = 7, 0.65 ± 0.08) than in those taking statins (n = 19, 0.72 ± 0.10, p = 0.0221). Coronary flow rate likewise exhibited a statistically significant negative correlation with hemoglobin A1c (Pearson r, -0.437; p = 0.0003), but no correlation with other coronary risk factors. The coronary flow rate was statistically significantly lower in patients with diabetes (n = 14, 0.55 ± 0.10) than in those without diabetes (n = 81, 0.61 ± 0.11, p = 0.0461).
CONCLUSION: We found a reduction in coronary flow rate in patients with statin-naive dyslipidemia and diabetes, even within morphologically normal coronary arteries.
