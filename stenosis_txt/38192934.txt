Title: Persistent Nausea and Gastrointestinal Distention: A Case Report of Aerophagia.

Abstract: A 43-year-old woman experienced acute nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, leading her to our hospital. No relevant medical history or physical abnormalities were noted. Symptoms persisted for a month, causing weight loss and abdominal bloating. CT scans revealed distension throughout the gastrointestinal tract without stenosis. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction and aerophagia were suspected. MR enterography confirmed normal gastric and intestinal motility, diagnosing the condition as aerophagia-induced gastrointestinal distention. This case underscores the value of MR enterography in assessing intestinal motility and differentiating between intestinal pseudo-obstruction and aerophagia.
