Title: Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty: A systematic review.

Abstract: There is conclusive evidence for relief of pulmonary valve obstruction immediately after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) and at follow-up. Development of infundibular obstruction is seen in more severe PS cases and in older subjects. Reappearance of PS was observed in approximately 10 % of patients following BPV. The reasons for recurrence were found to be balloon/annulus ratio less than 1.2 and immediate post-BPV pulmonary valve peak gradients greater than 30 mmHg. Recurrent stenosis is successfully addressed by repeating BPV with lager balloons than used initially. Long-term results revealed continue relief of obstruction, but with development of pulmonary insufficiency, some patients requiring replacement of the pulmonary valve. It was concluded that BPV is the treatment of choice in the management valvar PS and that balloon/annuls ratio used for BPV should be lowered to 1.2 to 1.25. It was also suggested that strategies should be developed to prevent/reduce pulmonary insufficiency at long-term follow-up.
