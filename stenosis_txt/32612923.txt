Title: Isolated pulmonary vasculitis associated with nilotinib use: A case report.

Abstract: An association between tyrosine-kinase inhibitor therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia and vascular adverse events including peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery disease, and pulmonary hypertension has been described. We present a patient who developed isolated pulmonary artery vasculitis resulting in left pulmonary artery stenosis, in addition to left coronary artery stenosis while on nilotinib. While monitoring for cardiovascular events is important, clinicians should also recognize possible drug-induced vasculitis during chronic nilotinib therapy.
