Title: Isolated sleeve gastrectomy stricture: a systematic review on reporting, workup, and treatment.

Abstract: The isolated stricture after the sleeve gastrectomy is one of the possible surgical complications. Previous algorithms have been proposed to address the workup and treatment of sleeve gastrectomy stricture. However, current literature lacks standardization and systematic reviews on this topic. This study aimed to review all currently available publications and to create evidence-based recommendations. We searched Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and Central Cochrane from inception to June 10, 2019. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting treatment of sleeve gastrectomy stricture with no associated leaks. The primary outcome was the reported clinical resolution rate. The final analysis included 32 articles. The pooled reported clinical resolution rate for the primary treatment was 68% (11/16), 82% (296/361), and 75% (34/45) for noninvasive medical therapy, endoscopic, and surgical treatments, respectively (not significant). Among the endoscopic modalities, the pneumatic dilation has the highest clinical success rate. Most rescue surgeries described in the literature were successful. Conclusively, the initial treatment should entail noninvasive medical management followed by the endoscopic approach, if needed. Pneumatic balloon dilation should be the preferred approach, if technically feasible. Revisional surgery should be reserved for endoscopic failure.
