Title: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as an irreplaceable diagnostic tool for Williams-Beuren syndrome in developing countries: a literature review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to sum up and characterize all Williams-Beuren syndrome cases diagnosed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) since its implementation, as well as to discuss FISH as a cost-effective methodology in developing countries.
DATA SOURCE: From January 1986 to January 2022, articles were selected using the databases in PubMed (Medline) and SciELO. The following terms were used: Williams syndrome and In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence. Inclusion criteria included Williams-Beuren syndrome cases diagnosed by FISH with a stratified phenotype of each patient. Only studies written in English, Spanish, and Portuguese were included. Studies with overlapping syndromes or genetic conditions were excluded.
DATA SYNTHESIS: After screening, 64 articles were included. A total of 205 individuals with Williams-Beuren syndrome diagnosed by FISH were included and further analyzed. Cardiovascular malformations were the most frequent finding (85.4%). Supravalvular aortic stenosis (62.4%) and pulmonary stenosis (30.7%) were the main cardiac alterations described.
CONCLUSIONS: Our literature review reinforces that cardiac features may be the key to early diagnosis in Williams-Beuren syndrome patients. In addition, FISH may be the best diagnostic tool for developing nations that have limited access to new technologic resources.
