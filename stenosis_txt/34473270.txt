Title: Mesenchymal Stem Cell Injection in Crohn's Disease Strictures: A Phase I-II Clinical Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties and could be a potential therapy for Crohn's disease [CD] strictures. In this phase I-II pilot trial, we assessed safety and efficacy of local MSC injection to treat CD strictures.
METHODS: CD patients with a short [less than 5 cm in length] non-passable stricture accessible by ileocolonoscopy were included. Allogenic bone-marrow derived MSCs were injected in the four quadrants of the stricture. Adverse events and clinical scores were evaluated at each follow-up visit and endoscopy and magnetic resonance enterography were performed at baseline, Week [W]12 and W48. The main judgement criterion for efficacy was the complete [defined by the ability to pass the ileocolonoscope] or partial [defined by a diameter increase] resolution of the stricture at W12. Second efficacy criteria included assessment of the stricture at W48 and evolution of clinical scores at W12 and W48.
RESULTS: We performed 11 MSC injections in 10 CD patients [three primary and seven anastomotic strictures; one stricture injected twice]. MSC injections were well tolerated but four hospitalisations for occlusion were reported. At W12, five patients presented a complete or partial resolution of the stricture [two complete and three partial]. Seven patients were re-evaluated at W48 [one dilated, one operated, and one lost to follow-up] and four patients had a complete resolution. The evolution of clinical scores between W0, W12, and W48 was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: MSCs injection in CD stricture was well tolerated and may offer a benefit.
