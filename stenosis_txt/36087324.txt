Title: North American multicenter experience with the Flow Redirection Endoluminal Device in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Flow diverters have revolutionized the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Here, the authors present the first large-scale North American multicenter experience using the Flow Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED) in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms.
METHODS: Consecutive cerebral aneurysms treated with FRED at 7 North American centers between June 2020 and November 2021 were included. Data collected included patient demographic characteristics, aneurysm characteristics, periprocedural and long-term complications, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, and radiological follow-up.
RESULTS: In total, 133 aneurysms in 116 patients were treated with 123 FRED deployment procedures and included in this study. One hundred twenty-six aneurysms (94.7%) were unruptured, 117 (88.0%) saccular, and 123 (92.5%) located in anterior circulation. The mean (range) aneurysm maximal width and neck width sizes were 7.2 (1.5-42.5) mm and 4.1 (1.0-15.1) mm, respectively. Successful FRED deployment was achieved in 122 procedures (99.2%). Adjunctive coiling was used in 4 procedures (3.3%). Radiological follow-up was available for 101 aneurysms at a median duration of 7.0 months. At last follow-up, complete occlusion was observed in 55.4% of patients, residual neck in 8.9%, and filling aneurysm in 35.6%; among cases with radiological follow-up duration > 10 months, these values were 21/43 (48.8%), 3/43 (7.0%), and 19/43 (44.2%), respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, age (OR 0.93, p = 0.001) and aneurysm neck size (OR 0.83, p = 0.048) were negatively correlated with odds of complete occlusion at latest follow-up. The retreatment rate was 6/124 (4.8%). The overall complication rate was 31/116 (26.7%). Parent vessel occlusion, covered branch occlusion, and in-stent stenosis were detected in 9/99 (9.1%), 6/63 (9.5%), and 15/99 (15.2%) cases, respectively. The FRED-related, symptomatic, thromboembolic, and hemorrhagic complication rates were 22.4%, 12.9%, 6.9%, and 0.9% respectively. The morbidity rate was 10/116 patients (8.6%). There was 1 death due to massive periprocedural internal carotid artery stroke, and 3.6% of the patients had an mRS score > 2 at the last follow-up (vs 0.9% at baseline).
CONCLUSIONS: As the first large-scale North American multicenter FRED experience, this study confirmed the ease of successful FRED deployment but suggested lower efficacy and a higher rate of complications than reported by previous European and South American studies on FRED and other flow-diverting devices. The authors recommend judicious use of this device until future studies can better elucidate the long-term outcomes of FRED treatment.
