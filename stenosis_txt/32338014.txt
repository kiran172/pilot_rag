Title: Esophageal perforation after dilation due to a peptic stricture that concealed esophageal cancer.

Abstract: The management and prognosis of benign esophageal strictures differ from those of malignant strictures. Distinguishing between the two entities may occasionally be challenging, despite endoscopy and biopsies. The consequences of erroneous treatment may be fatal. We review this topic in a patient who required an emergency esophagectomy following a perforation after dilation due to a peptic stricture, which concealed an esophageal cancer.
