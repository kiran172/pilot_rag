Title: Perioperative mannitol intensive use may avoid the early complication of cerebral venous sinus stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus (CVS) stenting has been widely applied for correcting CVS stenosis. However, there are still some potential complications. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of perioperative management on avoiding complications of CVS stenting.
METHODS: Patients confirmed as CVS stenosis were enrolled from January 2014 through November 2019. All CVS stenosis were corrected by stenting when the trans-stenotic mean pressure gradient (MPG) was up to or over 8 mmHg. Patients were divided into perioperative management group and control group. Patients in the former group underwent transiently mannitol 250 mL intravenous infusion immediately prior to stenting besides routine ICP control. While patients in control group underwent the same routine treatment as in the perioperative management group. The clinical symptoms, intracranial pressure (ICP), and MPG of the patients were compared before and after stenting. In addition, the complications between the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 81 eligible patients were finally enrolled in this study, including 64 females and 17 males, mean aged 45.35±13.83 years. After stenting, the stenotic CVS restored normal blood flow and MPG decreased significantly [10.0 (8.0-15.0) vs. 0.0 (0.0-0.7) mmHg, P&lt;0.001]. Headache, tinnitus, visual impairment, visual loss, Frisén papilledema grade (FPG), and ICP were ameliorated immediately (P&lt;0.001) in the majority of patients in the two groups. However, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was higher in control group (11.4% vs. 0.0%, P=0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: A transiently strict preoperative ICP control by mannitol may inhibit CVS stenting-related hemorrhage, which makes the stenting safer and more effective on correcting the CVS stenosis.
