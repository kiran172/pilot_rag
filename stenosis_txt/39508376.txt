Title: Minimally invasive treatments for chronic low back pain.

Abstract: This article describes minimally invasive treatments for managing chronic low back pain (LBP) related to lumbar spinal stenosis, facetogenic LBP, vertebrogenic LBP, or discogenic LBP. We also propose a clinical decision-making tool to guide clinicians in appropriate patient selection for various treatments.
