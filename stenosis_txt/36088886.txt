Title: Hemodynamic depression after carotid surgery: Incidence, risk factors and outcomes.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Hemodynamic Depression (HD) characterized by hypotension and bradycardia is a complication of carotid surgery due to direct autonomic stimulation in the carotid sinus. The authors believe the incidence of HD is high and possibly related to major cardiac complications.
METHODS: Analysis of patient records during admissions for carotid surgery between January 2014 and December 2018 in two hospitals. HD was defined as bradycardia or hypotension in the first 24 postoperative hours. Bradycardia was defined as heart rate < 50bpm; hypotension as systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, continuous use of vasopressors, or a drop in SBP > 20% compared to preoperative values. Myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death were defined as adverse events.
RESULTS: Overall, 237 carotid surgeries (178 endarterectomies, 59 angioplasties) were studied, and the global incidence of HD was 54.4% (hypotension in 50.2%, bradycardia in 11.0%, and hypotension and bradycardia in 6.8%). The independent predictors of HD were asymptomatic carotid stenosis (OR = 1.824; 95% CI 1.014-3.280; p = 0.045), endovascular surgery (OR = 3.319; 95% CI 1.675-6.576; p = 0.001) and intraoperative hypotension or bradycardia (OR = 2.144; 95% CI 1.222-3.762; p = 0.008). Hypotension requiring continuous vasopressor infusion was the only factor independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events (OR = 5.504; 95% CI 1.729-17.529; p = 0.004).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Incidence of Hemodynamic Depression after carotid surgery is high and independently associated with surgical technique, symptomatic repercussion of the carotid stenosis, and intraoperative hypotension or bradycardia. Hypotension requiring the continuous infusion of vasopressors was independently associated with the occurrence of MACE.
