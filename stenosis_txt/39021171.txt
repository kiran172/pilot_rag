Title: Immediate Destiny of Bifurcation Lesions Treated with Biomatrix Alpha Stents.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: About 15% of coronary artery interventions are performed on coronary artery bifurcation. Managing these lesions presents a significant therapeutic obstacle in the context of coronary artery issues. Addressing both immediate and lasting side effects of these lesions demands ongoing monitoring and action. The introduction of drug-eluting stents has raised hopes for better outcomes in patients experiencing cardiovascular events.
METHODS: In this study, we selected 51 patients (out of 850) who had received ≥1 cobalt-chromium, biodegradable polymer, Biolimus A9-eluting stent (CoCr-BP-BES) Biomatrix Alpha stent. Immediately after stenting, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow score in the coronary artery and its bypass branch, plaque shift, and lateral dissection immediately after angioplasty were evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean age for patients was 65 (±10.35) years, where 49.02% of them were male and 45.1% had diabetes. No lateral dissection and death were reported in any of the patients. Also, the TIMI flow grade was 3 for the main branch in all patients. Plaque shifts were compared at different degrees of the TIMI flow coronary artery bypass graft. A statistical study revealed a noteworthy distinction between the groups. There was no discernible change when gender, diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure with plaque changes were all controlled for.
CONCLUSION: We discovered that the Biomatrix Alpha stents' instant clinical results are admissible. Our findings confirm the clinical utility of the recently developed biolimus-eluting (BES) stent technology, which combines the BA-9 medication, a thin-strut CoCr stent platform, and a biodegradable polymer. This aligns with the existing body of research on the most recent generation of drug-eluting stents (DES).
