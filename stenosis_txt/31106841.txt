Title: Valve hemodynamic performance and myocardial strain after implantation of a third-generation, balloon-expandable, transcatheter aortic valve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) mechanics are impaired in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS); however, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may positively affect LV mechanics. Assessed herein is the performance of the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve (THV) and the effect of TAVI on LV function recovery, as assessed by global longitudinal strain (GLS).
METHODS: A subset of patients from the SOURCE 3 registry (n = 276) from 16 European centers received SAPIEN 3 balloon-expandable THV. Echocardiography was performed at baseline, postprocedure, and at 1 year, including assessment of GLS using standard two-dimensional images, and was analyzed in a core laboratory. Paired analyses between baseline and discharge, baseline and at 1 year were conducted.
RESULTS: Hemodynamic parameters were improved after TAVI and sustained to 1 year. At 1 year, the rate of moderate to severe paravalvular leaks (PVL), and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitations were 1.8%, 1.7%, and 8.0%, respectively. The discharge GLS (-15.6 ± 5.1; p = 0.004; n = 149) improved significantly from baseline (-15.1 ± 4.8) following TAVI. This improvement was sustained at 1 year compared with baseline (-17.0 ± 4.6, p < 0.001; n = 100). Conversely, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) did not significantly change following TAVI (p = 0.47).
CONCLUSIONS: Following TAVI with a third-generation THV, valve performances were good at 1 year with low PVL rate. The LV mechanics improved immediately after the procedure and were maintained at 1 year. These findings demonstrate the benefit of TAVI on LV mechanics, and suggests that GLS may be superior to LVEF in assessing this benefit. Clinicaltrial.gov number: NCT02698956.
