Title: Central retinal artery occlusion as initial presentation of Moyamoya disease in a middle-aged woman.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To present a case of central retinal artery occlusion as the first symptomatic manifestation of Moyamoya disease in a middle-aged patient.
OBSERVATIONS: Case report of a 48-year-old female Chinese-American patient who presented with sudden onset painless unilateral vision loss. Fundus photos, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, and catheter cerebral angiogram were performed. The patient's dilated fundus examination showed classic findings of a central retinal artery occlusion. Diagnostic brain imaging demonstrated extensive stenosis of the cerebrovascular network, with almost complete unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery along with compensatory collateral vessels. This led to a new diagnosis of Moyamoya disease. The patient was treated with extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Arterial abnormalities in patients with Moyamoya disease are uncommon and have previously only been reported in younger patients in their teens and 20s. Young and middle-aged patients presenting with central retinal artery occlusions should undergo complete neurologic workup including stroke evaluation; in this case, revealing Moyamoya disease, a rare yet life-threatening condition, as the underlying etiology.
