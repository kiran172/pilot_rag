Title: Cardiogeriatrics: the current state of the art.

Abstract: It is estimated that by 2050, 17% of the world's population will be greater than 85 years old, which, combined with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being the leading cause of death and disability, sets an unprecedented burden on our health and care systems. This perfect storm will be accompanied by a rise in the prevalence of CVD due to increased survival of patients with pre-existing CVD and the incidence of CVD that is associated with the process of ageing. In this review, we will focus on the diagnosis and management of common CVD conditions in old age, namely: heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and valvular heart disease (VHD). Despite limited evidence, clinical guidelines are increasingly considering the complexity of management of these conditions in the older person, which often coexist, for example, AF and HF or CAD and VHD. Furthermore, they, in turn, need specific consideration in the context of comorbidities, polypharmacy, frailty and impaired cognition found in this age group. Hence, the emerging role of the geriatric cardiologist is therefore vital in performing comprehensive geriatric assessment, attending multidisciplinary team meetings and ultimately considering the patient and the sum of their diseases in their totality. There have been recent advances in CVD management but how we apply these to deliver integrated care to the elderly population is key. This review article aims to bring together emerging studies and guidelines on assessment and management of CVD in the elderly, summarising latest definitions, diagnostics, therapeutics and future challenges.
