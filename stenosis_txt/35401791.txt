Title: Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Australia.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis is the most common valvular lesion in Australia, with a rising prevalence in line with the ageing population. Recent trials have demonstrated the efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) versus surgical aortic valve replacement in consecutively lower surgical risk patient cohorts. Despite this, the current indication for TAVI in Australia is for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis in patients who are of prohibitive or high surgical risk and ultimately deemed suitable by a heart team. This article summarises the trends in TAVI in Australia over the last 5 years in terms of funding, accreditation and service delivery, as well as advances in technique, technology, patient selection and local outcomes.
