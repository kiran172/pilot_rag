Title: A case of type 2 diabetes mellitus with limb-shaking TIA.

Abstract: Limb-shaking transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a rare manifestation of carotid-occlusive damage. This case report highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment of bilateral ballism as limb-shaking TIA. Superficial cephalic artery and mid-large artery anastomosis was performed after the initial acute treatment, and involuntary limb shaking disappeared.
