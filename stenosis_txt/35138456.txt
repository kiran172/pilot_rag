Title: Modified balloon vaginoplasty for high position vaginal atresia.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The first-line approach for the management of distal vaginal atresia involves a pull-through vaginoplasty. If the proximal vagina is 3 cm or more from the introitus, the risk of stenosis is high, and an interposition graft may be necessary. We describe a safe, low-cost, and accessible approach for distal vaginal atresia ≥ 3 cm that we call the "modified balloon vaginoplasty" and validate the technical feasibility and anatomical outcomes.
METHODS: Ten patients who underwent modified balloon vaginoplasty were retrospectively evaluated. Age, symptoms at presentation, length of atresia, operation time, and postoperative complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: All the cases were successfully performed without any intraoperative morbidity. The postoperative complications included one case of stenosis ring in the distal vagina because not right used vagina model. All the girls had regular menstruation and were satisfied with the surgical outcome.
CONCLUSION: Modified balloon vaginoplasty allows further distention of the distal vagina or thinning of the septum, which may decrease the risk of stenosis, is a beneficial choice for patients with distal vaginal atresia ≥ 3 cm.
