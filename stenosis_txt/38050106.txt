Title: Automated Motion Correction for Myocardial Blood Flow Measurements and Diagnostic Performance of 82Rb PET Myocardial Perfusion Imaging.

Abstract: Motion correction (MC) affects myocardial blood flow (MBF) measurements in 82Rb PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI); however, frame-by-frame manual MC of dynamic frames is time-consuming. This study aims to develop an automated MC algorithm for time-activity curves used in compartmental modeling and compare the predictive value of MBF with and without automated MC for significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: In total, 565 patients who underwent PET-MPI were considered. Patients without angiographic findings were split into training (n = 112) and validation (n = 112) groups. The automated MC algorithm used simplex iterative optimization of a count-based cost function and was developed using the training group. MBF measurements with automated MC were compared with those with manual MC in the validation group. In a separate cohort, 341 patients who underwent PET-MPI and invasive coronary angiography were enrolled in the angiographic group. The predictive performance in patients with significant CAD (≥70% stenosis) was compared between MBF measurements with and without automated MC. Results: In the validation group (n = 112), MBF measurements with automated and manual MC showed strong correlations (r = 0.98 for stress MBF and r = 0.99 for rest MBF). The automatic MC took less time than the manual MC (&lt;12 s vs. 10 min per case). In the angiographic group (n = 341), MBF measurements with automated MC decreased significantly compared with those without (stress MBF, 2.16 vs. 2.26 mL/g/min; rest MBF, 1.12 vs. 1.14 mL/g/min; MFR, 2.02 vs. 2.10; all P &lt; 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for the detection of significant CAD by stress MBF with automated MC was higher than that without (AUC, 95% CI, 0.76 [0.71-0.80] vs. 0.73 [0.68-0.78]; P &lt; 0.05). The addition of stress MBF with automated MC to the model with ischemic total perfusion deficit showed higher diagnostic performance for detection of significant CAD (AUC, 95% CI, 0.82 [0.77-0.86] vs. 0.78 [0.74-0.83]; P = 0.022), but the addition of stress MBF without MC to the model with ischemic total perfusion deficit did not reach significance (AUC, 95% CI, 0.81 [0.76-0.85] vs. 0.78 [0.74-0.83]; P = 0.067). Conclusion: Automated MC on 82Rb PET-MPI can be performed rapidly with excellent agreement with experienced operators. Stress MBF with automated MC showed significantly higher diagnostic performance than without MC.
