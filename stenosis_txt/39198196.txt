Title: Complete Aortic Valve Reconstruction with Autologous Pericardium: Analysis of Mid-Term Results of Single-Center Experience with AVNeo Procedure.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) is a relatively recent advancement in surgical AV replacement. Data on its performance beyond the short term are limited. We assessed the mid-term outcomes in patients undergoing AVNeo, focusing on feasibility, perioperative details, and its role in AV pathology treatment.
METHODS: Sixty-five consecutive patients underwent AVNeo between December 2016 and February 2018. Clinical data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Tricuspid reconstruction with autologous pericardium was performed in all cases. Echocardiographic follow-up was conducted post-discharge, at 6 and 12 months, and annually thereafter.
RESULTS: The mean age was 62.6 ± 18.7 years. AVNeo was feasible in all cases. Concomitant procedures were performed in 43 (66.2%) patients. Mean bypass and cross-clamp times were 119.2 ± 30.3 and 87.1 ± 22.9 minutes, respectively. Postoperative transvalvular hemodynamics was excellent. There was one (1.5%) in-hospital death. Follow-up (mean 66.72 ± 12.77 months) was complete in 58 patients (89.2%). There were no detected valve-related or thromboembolic events. Transvalvular hemodynamic parameters were stable during the observation period: peak pressure gradient at discharge and follow-up was 15.3 ± 4.6 mmHg and 15.01 ± 6.3 mmHg, respectively (ρ = 0.346).
CONCLUSIONS: AVNeo demonstrated the feasibility and favorable mid-term outcomes. Studies with longer-term observation are warranted to evaluate its durability.
