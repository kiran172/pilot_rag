Title: Heart Rate-Independent 3D Myocardial Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent MRI at 3.0 T with Simultaneous 13N-Ammonia PET Validation.

Abstract: Background Despite advances, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) cardiac MRI for myocardial perfusion is limited by inadequate spatial coverage, imaging speed, multiple breath holds, and imaging artifacts, particularly at 3.0 T. Purpose To develop and validate a robust, contrast agent-unenhanced, free-breathing three-dimensional (3D) cardiac MRI approach for reliably examining changes in myocardial perfusion between rest and adenosine stress. Materials and Methods A heart rate-independent, free-breathing 3D T2 mapping technique at 3.0 T that can be completed within the period of adenosine stress (≤4 minutes) was developed by using computer simulations, ex vivo heart preparations, and dogs. Studies in dogs were performed with and without coronary stenosis and validated with simultaneously acquired nitrogen 13 (13N) ammonia PET perfusion in a clinical PET/MRI system. The MRI approach was also prospectively evaluated in healthy human volunteers (from January 2017 to September 2017). Myocardial BOLD responses (MBRs) between normal and ischemic myocardium were compared with mixed model analysis. Results Dogs (n = 10; weight range, 20-25 kg; mongrel dogs) and healthy human volunteers (n = 10; age range, 22-53 years; seven men) were evaluated. In healthy dogs, T2 MRI at adenosine stress was greater than at rest (mean rest vs stress, 38.7 msec ± 2.5 [standard deviation] vs 45.4 msec ± 3.3, respectively; MBR, 1.19 ± 0.08; both, P &lt; .001). At the same conditions, mean rest versus stress PET perfusion was 1.1 mL/mg/min ± 0.11 versus 2.3 mL/mg/min ± 0.82, respectively (P &lt; .001); myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was 2.4 ± 0.82 (P &lt; .001). The BOLD response and PET MPR were positively correlated (R = 0.67; P &lt; .001). In dogs with coronary stenosis, perfusion anomalies were detected on the basis of MBR (normal vs ischemic, 1.09 ± 0.05 vs 1.00 ± 0.04, respectively; P &lt; .001) and MPR (normal vs ischemic, 2.7 ± 0.08 vs 1.7 ± 1.1, respectively; P &lt; .001). Human volunteers showed increased myocardial T2 at stress (rest vs stress, 44.5 msec ± 2.6 vs 49.0 msec ± 5.5, respectively; P = .004; MBR, 1.1 msec ± 8.08). Conclusion This three-dimensional cardiac blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI approach overcame key limitations associated with conventional cardiac BOLD MRI by enabling whole-heart coverage within the standard duration of adenosine infusion, and increased the magnitude and reliability of BOLD contrast, which may be performed without requiring breath holds. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
