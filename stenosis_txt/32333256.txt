Title: Incidence and outcome of prosthetic valve endocarditis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the Netherlands.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly being used as an alternative to conventional surgical valve replacement. Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a rare but feared complication after TAVR, with reported first-year incidences varying from 0.57 to 3.1%. This study was performed to gain insight into the incidence and outcome of PVE after TAVR in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A multicentre retrospective registry study was performed. All patients who underwent TAVR in the period 2010-2017 were screened for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis in the insurance database and checked for the presence of PVE before analysis of general characteristics, PVE parameters and outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 3968 patients who underwent TAVR were screened for PVE. During a median follow-up of 33.5 months (interquartile range (IQR) 22.8-45.8), 16 patients suffered from PVE (0.4%), with a median time to onset of 177 days (IQR 67.8-721.3). First-year incidence was 0.24%, and the overall incidence rate was 0.14 events per 1000 person-years. Overall mortality during follow-up in our study was 31%, of which 25% occurred in hospital. All patients were treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics alone, and none underwent a re-intervention. Other complications of PVE occurred in 5 patients (31%) and included aortic abscess (2), decompensated heart failure (2) and cerebral embolisation (1).
CONCLUSION: PVE in patients receiving TAVR is a relatively rare complication and has a high mortality rate.
