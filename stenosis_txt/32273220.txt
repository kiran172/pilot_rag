Title: Early vascular imaging and key system strategies expedite carotid revascularization after transient ischemic attack and stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend carotid revascularization within 14 days for patients with a symptomatic transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke event. However, significant delays in care persist, with only 9% of outpatients and 36% of inpatients in Ontario meeting this target. The study objective was to explore the influence of health system factors on carotid revascularization timelines.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all symptomatic TIA/stroke patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or stenting at The Ottawa Hospital (2015-2016). The primary outcome was time from TIA/stroke to carotid revascularization. Health system variables of interest included location and timing of patient presentation, timelines to vascular imaging, and same-day collaboration between key services such as emergency, neurology, and surgery. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were used to determine statistically significant differences between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 228 records met the inclusion criteria. The median time from TIA/stroke to carotid revascularization was 10 days, with 58% of patients meeting the 14-day guideline. Prompt patient presentation to emergency demonstrated significantly shorter timelines to surgery (7 days; P < .001). Early vascular imaging was strongly correlated with early revascularization (4-5 days; P < .001). In addition, collaboration from two or more care services enhanced timelines to surgery ranging from 2.0 to 6.5 days (P < .001-.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Early/emergency response to stroke symptoms was pivotal in achieving best practice recommendations for rapid carotid revascularization, emphasizing the need for ongoing public awareness. Emergency and ambulatory strategies to facilitate urgent vascular imaging, as well as mechanisms for same-day communication between teams require optimization to promote early revascularization.
