Title: Clinical and molecular characterization of five Chinese patients with autosomal recessive osteopetrosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Osteopetrosis is characterized by increased bone density and bone marrow cavity stenosis due to a decrease in the number of osteoclasts or the dysfunction of their differentiation and absorption properties usually caused by biallelic variants of the TCIRG1 and CLCN7 genes.
METHODS: In this study, we describe five Chinese children who presented with anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, repeated infections, and increased bone density. Whole-exome sequencing identified five compound heterozygous variants of the CLCN7 and TCIRG1 genes in these patients.
RESULTS: Patient 1 had a novel variant c.1555C>T (p.L519F) and a previously reported pathogenic variant c.2299C>T (p.R767W) in CLCN7. Patient 2 harbored a novel missense variant (c.1025T>C; p.L342P) and a novel splicing variant (c.286-9G>A) in CLCN7. Patients 3A and 3B from one family displayed the same compound heterozygous TCIRG1 variant, including a novel frameshift variant (c.1370del; p.T457Tfs*71) and a novel splicing variant (c.1554+2T>C). In Patient 4, two novel variants were identified in the TCIRG1 gene: c.676G>T; p.E226* and c.1191del; p.P398Sfs*5. Patient 5 harbored two known pathogenic variants, c.909C>A (p.Y303*) and c.2008C>T (p.R670*), in TCIRG1. Analysis of the products obtained from the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the c.286-9G>A variant in CLCN7 of patient 2 leads to intron 3 retention, resulting in the formation of a premature termination codon (p.E95Vfs*8). These five patients were eventually diagnosed with autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, and the three children with TCIRG1 variants received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results expand the spectrum of variation of genes related to osteopetrosis and deepen the understanding of the relationship between the genotype and clinical characteristics of osteopetrosis.
