Title: Biventricular Outflow Obstruction Associated With Atrioventricular Septal Defects and Patent Ductus Arteriosus: An Extremely Rare Combination.

Abstract: We present an extremely rare combination of biventricular outflow obstruction associated with atrioventricular septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Almost all the other published cases, including ours, were associated with other congenital cardiac lesions other than biventricular outflow obstruction. Most cases ended with poor outcomes. Our patient was a 55-day-old term female infant. She was managed by successful aortic balloon valvuloplasty withÂ successful early outcome.
