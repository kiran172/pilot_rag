Title: Long-Term Outcomes of Modified Cone Reconstruction for Ebstein's Anomaly in Pediatric Patients in a Single Center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes, including tricuspid valve durability, annular growth, and left ventricular reverse remodeling, after modified cone reconstruction in patients with Ebstein's anomaly.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all pediatric patients who underwent modified cone reconstruction for Ebstein's anomaly at a single tertiary center between January 2005 and June 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 14 pediatric patients underwent modified cone reconstruction for Ebstein's anomaly; the median age was 5.8 years (range, 0.01-16.6). There were three patients (21.4%) with Carpentier type B, ten patients with Carpentier type C (71.4%), and one patient with Carpentier type D (7.1%). There was no early or late mortality, arrhythmia, or readmission for heart failure at a 10-year follow-up. There were no cases of more than mild tricuspid stenosis or more than moderate tricuspid regurgitation during the study period, except for one patient with severe tricuspid regurgitation who underwent reoperation. The z value for tricuspid valve annular size significantly decreased immediately after the operation (2.46 vs. -1.15, p<0.001). However, from 1 year to 7 years after surgery, the z values were maintained between -1 and +1. Left ventricular end-systolic volume, end-diastolic volume, and stroke volume increased after surgery and remained elevated until seven years postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Ebstein's anomaly in children can be repaired by modified cone reconstruction with low mortality and morbidity, good tricuspid valve durability, and annular growth relative to somatic growth.
