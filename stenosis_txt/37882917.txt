Title: A new comprehensive MRI classification and grading system for lumbosacral central and lateral stenosis: clinical application and comparison with previous systems.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to provide a novel schematized and comprehensive classification of causes and severity grading system for lumbosacral stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MRI system proposed consisted of a severity grading scale for central and lateral (recess and foramen) stenosis, together with a schematized indication of the main causes of the disease (disc, arthritis, epidural lipomatosis, and their combinations). The system was applied to a cohort of patients from a single Institution in the last 2-years. Two radiologists evaluated all the MRIs to determine intra- and inter-observer reliability according to Cohen Kappa (K<sub>c</sub>, for non-ordered categorical variables) and weighted Kappa (K<sub>w</sub>, for ordered variables). Two orthopaedic surgeons clinically evaluated all patients and provided a schematic grading system with a central and lateral stenosis clinical score (CS-CS and LS-CS). Associations between ordinals were tested with chi-square test and measured with the Goodman and Kruskal's gamma index (Gi, with 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). Lastly, the most used previous MRI systems were applied, and their performances were compared to the new system proposed.
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients were included (55 females-mean age 63.3 ± 10.7 years). An almost perfect intra-observer agreement for the assessment of central stenosis, foramen stenosis, and lateral recess stenosis was found (K<sub>w</sub> = 0.929, 0.928, and 0.924, respectively). The inter-observer agreement was almost perfect for central stenosis and foramen stenosis and substantial for lateral recess stenosis (K<sub>w</sub> = 0.863, 0.834, and 0.633, respectively). Whatever the aetiologies involved in central and lateral stenosis, the intra-observer agreement was perfect (all K<sub>c</sub> = 1), whereas the inter-observer agreements were almost perfect for arthritis (K<sub>c</sub> = 0.838) and lipomatosis (K<sub>c</sub> = 0.955) and substantial for disc (K<sub>c</sub> = 0.691) regarding central stenosis. The inter-observer agreement for the causes of lateral stenosis was lower and variable, ranging from perfect (lipomatosis) to fair (disc, K<sub>c</sub> = 0.224). The grading system revealed a strong association with CS-CS for both readers, with GI = 0.671 (95% CI 0.535-0.807) and 0.603 (95% CI = 0.457-0.749), respectively. The association with MRI grading and LS-CS was moderate for foraminal stenosis and for the concomitant presence of foraminal and lateral recess stenosis, with Gi = 0.337 (95% CI 0.121-0.554) and Gi = 0.299 (95% CI 0.098-0.500), respectively. A weak association was found between lateral recess grading alone and LS-CS with Gi = 0.102 (95% CI 0.193-0.397). The new grading systems showed higher Gi for associations with clinical symptoms, compared with previous ones, both for CS-CS and LS-CS.
CONCLUSIONS: A standardized visual grading system for lumbar spinal stenosis that takes into account all of the major contributing factors-including disc, arthritis, and lipomatosis, for the central canal, lateral recess, and neural foramina could be a useful and practical tool for defining the stenosis, lowering inter-observer variability, and directing the various treatment options.
