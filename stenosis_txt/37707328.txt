Title: [Surgical management of tracheal anastomosis failure and risk of arterial bleeding].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal algorithm for tracheal anastomotic insufficiency and prevention of arterial bleeding.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present 2 patients with defects of tracheal anastomosis after tracheal resection and divergence of tracheal edges. We primarily analyzed appropriate emergency care and prevention of subsequent severe complications such as arterial bleeding and respiratory insufficiency.
CONCLUSION: Tracheostomy may be preferable for complete late tracheal anastomotic insufficiency to restore breathing. However, surgery should be accompanied by prevention of arterial bleeding. Isolation of damaged area, particularly tracheostomy tube, from the mediastinum by well-vascularized tissues can prevent bleeding from major vessels (for example, innominate artery). Follow-up is unreasonable due to worsening of clinical situation, risk of hemorrhagic complications and fatal outcomes. General satisfactory clinical status of the patient is not of matter. Repeated tracheal anastomosis is justified only for early insufficiency, i.e. within 2-3 days when postoperative inflammation is mild.
