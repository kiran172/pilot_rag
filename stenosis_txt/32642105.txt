Title: A study on the risk factors of coronary artery disease in patients with Takayasu arteritis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors of Takayasu arteritis (TA) involving the coronary artery.
METHODS: Patients with TA involving coronary artery were included in this study. According to the patients' condition of coronary artery involvement, they were divided into two groups: group A: TA involved coronary artery disease [at least one coronary artery stenosis (≥50%)] and group B: TA did not involve coronary artery. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the risk factors of arteritis involving the patients' coronary artery lesions.
RESULTS: A total of 442 TA patients were included in this study. The patients were significantly older in group A than those patients in group B (52.54±11.17 vs. 37.73±12.72, P&lt;0.001). The age of onset in group A was significantly older than those patients in group B (42.21±11.46 vs. 32.74±13.13, P&lt;0.001). The patients in group A had a longer course of disease (P&lt;0.001), larger BMI (P=0.002) and higher rates of smoking, drinking, diabetes, dyslipidemia (P&lt;0.05) when compared with group B. The level of eGFR was significantly decreased and the UA and TG levels were significantly increased in group A when compared with group B(P&lt;0.05). Besides, the risk factors for TA involving coronary artery included the age of TA onset (OR =1.143, 95% CI: 1.007-1.298, P=0.039), course of TA (OR =1.165, 95% CI: 1.025-1.324, P=0.020), and BMI (OR =1.100, 95% CI: 1.021-1.185, P=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: The later the age of TA onset, the longer the course of TA onset and the more traditional risk factors associated with atherosclerosis, the more vulnerable patients are to coronary artery involvement and this may not be related to clinical disease activity.
