Title: TAVI With or Without Predilation: Trends From a Large, Propensity-Score Weighted German Aortic Valve Registry (GARY) Population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Currently, it is unclear whether transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) without predilation (direct TAVI; d-TAVI) or with preimplantation balloon valvuloplasty (b-TAVI) provides similar clinical safety and efficacy. Therefore, we analyzed patients undergoing d-TAVI or b-TAVI for severe aortic stenosis (AS) with either self-expanding or balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valves (THVs) from the German Aortic Valve Registry (GARY).
METHODS: Between 2011 and 2017, a total of 44,783 TAVI patients were collected, with 25,717 (57.4%) receiving a balloon-expandable THV and 19,066 (42.6%) receiving a self-expanding THV. A propensity-score weighted model was used to compare d-TAVI vs b-TAVI regarding differences in outcome.
RESULTS: B-TAVI was performed in 71% and d-TAVI was performed in 29% of patients. In the investigated time interval, frequency of b-TAVI declined from 88.4% to 58.2%, accompanied by a constant rate of postdilation. After propensity weighting of patients receiving balloon-expandable THV, d-TAVI vs b-TAVI was associated with more frequent postoperative transvalvular mean pressure gradients (mPG) >15 mm Hg (20.7% vs 18.4%; P<.001), similar rates of paravalvular leakage (PVL) ≥ moderate (18.0% vs 16.9%; P=.08), fewer postdilations (13.4% vs 15.5%; P<.001), and fewer complications (permanent pacemaker implantation, 10.2% vs 11.9% [P=.01]; vascular complications, 1.9% vs 2.6% [P<.01]; pericardial tamponade, 0.5% vs 0.9% [P<.01]; and stroke, 0.9% vs 1.3% [P=.02]). In patients receiving self-expanding THVs, d-TAVI vs b-TAVI was associated with more frequent postimplantation mean PG ≥ 15 mm Hg (12.7% vs 10.4%; P<.01), higher rates of PVL ≥ moderate (24.8% vs 16.5%; P<.001), and similar complication rates including permanent pacemaker implantation.
CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy of d-TAVI vs b-TAVI depends on the type of THV implanted. For balloon-expandable valves, d-TAVI provides an advantage, while self-expanding valves offer a similar safety profile for d-TAVI compared with b-TAVI. However, increased mPG post intervention with both valve types and more significant PVL in self-expanding THVs emphasize the importance of proper patient selection and evaluation of valve anatomy to identify suitable cases for d-TAVI.
