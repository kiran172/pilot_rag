Title: Factors predicting successful resolution and long-term outcomes of benign anastomotic strictures following rectal cancer surgery.

Abstract: AIM: Although advances in treatment have improved sphincter-preservation rates in rectal cancer, the incidence of benign anastomotic strictures has also increased. This retrospective single-institution study sought to determine the incidence of benign anastomotic strictures and the factors associated with their successful resolution following treatment.
METHODOLOGY: From January 2010 to December 2019, consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic dilatation and/or surgery for benign anastomotic strictures developing after radical sphincter-sparing resections for rectal cancer were evaluated. To model the relationship between outcomes and potential independent variables, sequential univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 2069 rectal cancer patients undergoing sphincter-preserving surgery, benign anastomotic strictures were identified in 110 (5.3%). Mean age was 48.2 ± 13.98 years; 73.6% were male. Distal tumor-extent was within 6 cm of the anal verge in 60%; 80.9% patients received neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Surgical approach in 71.8% was open, 74.5% being anterior or low anterior resections and 70.9% of anastomoses stapled. Covering stoma was performed in 91.8%. On follow-up, strictures of median length 4 cm were identified at median 3 cm from the anal verge. Endoscopic dilatation was offered in 89.1%, whereas 9.1% required redo-surgery. Overall, 49.1% experienced sustained stricture-resolution with dilatation and 45.4% required re-intervention. At last follow-up, 72.7% were stoma-free. On multivariate analysis, good performance status, absence of anastomotic leak, and short-segment strictures predicted successful stricture-resolution.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic dilatation is an effective first-line therapy, with redo anastomosis used to salvage those failing conservative measures. Adverse performance status, anastomotic leak and greater stricture length may predict detrimental outcomes in terms of stricture resolution.
