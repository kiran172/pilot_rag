Title: Current Evidence on Long-Term Prognostic Factors in Vasospastic Angina.

Abstract: Vasospastic angina (VSA) is characterized by a reversible spasm of the coronary arteries and is more prevalent in Asians. Vasodilators, such as calcium channel blockers, are effective in relieving coronary spasms and preventing clinical events. Therefore, the prognosis of VSA is generally known to be better than for significant organic stenosis caused by atherosclerosis. However, coronary vasospasm is sometimes associated with fatal complications such as sudden death, ventricular arrhythmia, and myocardial infarction. Thus, it is very important to identify and actively treat high-risk patients to prevent VSA complications. Here, we will review clinical factors associated with long-term prognosis in patients with VSA.
