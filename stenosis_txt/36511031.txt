Title: Novel prosthodontic technique in fabrication of customized nasal stent in an infant.

Abstract: Burn injuries have a major impact on the physical and functional aspects of patients, thereby affecting their quality of life. Nasal stenosis which occurs as a result of wound contraction may lead to serious complications if not intervened at the earliest. In the prosthodontic front, nasal stents may be utilized in conjunction with reconstructive surgery procedures to minimize scar contraction and prevent nasal stenosis. This clinical report focuses on a customized technique in the fabrication of nasal stent to maintain the nasal airway patency in an infant who had suffered burn injuries. An intraoral tip was employed as a receptacle for accurate impression making, followed by the insertion of an intermediate stent fashioned from a scalp vein set catheter. The definitive stent fabricated using methyl methacrylate resin served to maintain the patency of the nasal passageway.
