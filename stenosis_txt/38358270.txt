Title: Retrospective Case Series of Spinal Cord Neurapraxia in Male Adolescent Athletes: Can These Athletes Return-to-Play?

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: While spinal cord neurapraxia (SCN) is a documented pathology in athletes, guidance for neurosurgeons evaluating these patients is sparse. Therefore, in a cohort of adolescent athletes with SCN, we sought to (1) review their presentation and management and (2) describe outcomes and return-to-play (RTP).
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective case series was conducted to examine adolescent athletes diagnosed with SCN from 2017 to 2022. SCN was defined as an episode of bilateral upper and/or lower extremity weakness/numbness after an impact during sport. Collected variables included demographics, presentation, management, outcomes, and RTP.
RESULTS: Six patients were included (mean age = 14.5 ± 2.1 years, 100.0% male). Three American football players sustained tackle injuries, 1 ice hockey and 1 basketball player fell and landed on their head/neck, and 1 weight lifter sustained an axial load of weights to his neck. Motor symptoms ranged from quadriplegia to partial weakness. Full symptom resolution was seen in 6/6 patients: in <1 day for 3 patients, 2-3 days for 2 patients, and 1-2 months for 1 patient. All 6/6 patients received computed tomography of head/cervical spine and MRI of cervical spine, half of whom received computed tomography and MRI of thoracic/lumbar spine. No patient had congenital stenosis or abnormal T2 signal on MRI. Specific RTP recommendations varied. All 6 patients/parents were contacted at a mean of 16.6 ± 2.6 months from the injury. All patients returned to play at a mean of 5.7 ± 3.3 months. All 6 patients returned to their previous sports. Across all patients, no recurrence or neurological sequelae was endorsed in the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Six athletes with SCN with no imaging abnormalities and full symptom resolution were able to RTP to their previous sport without future consequence. Symptom duration may not be clinically useful in determining the feasibility of RTP. Follow-up studies are warranted in this patient cohort to standardize RTP recommendations.
