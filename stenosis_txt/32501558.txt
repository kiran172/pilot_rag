Title: TIPU outcomes for hypospadias treatment and predictive factors causing urethrocutaneous fistula and external urethral meatus stenosis in TIPU: Clinical study.

Abstract: Our aim is to present patient outcomes for the TIPU method, currently mostly used for distal and sometimes proximal hypospadias treatment, and to identify predictive factors for the most commonly encountered complications of this surgery of urethrocutaneous fistula and urethral meatus stenosis. TIPU is a versatile, reliable, cosmetic and functionally successful surgical method mainly used for distal hypospadias patients but also in recent times for some proximal hypospadias patients. The main complications are urethrocutaneous fistula, urethral meatus stenosis, glans dehiscence and urethral meatus dehiscence. The pre-operative anatomic features of patients were assessed with the glans-meatus-shaft (GMS) scoring. Post-operative assessment of surgical outcomes was performed with the hypospadias objective scoring evaluation (HOSE). The mean total urethrocutaneous fistula and meatal stenosis development rates were 20 (12.3%) and 25 (15.4%). Both complications were found to be significantly high among hypospadias patients with narrow urethral plate, flat glandular groove and small glans (p < .001). Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis found urethral plate, glandular groove and glans shape were predictive factors for fistula and stenosis development.
