Title: Long-Term Survival Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Real-World Experience of a Large Tertiary Center.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) becomes the leading therapeutic choice for severe aortic stenosis. There is a growing body of knowledge on long-term survival outcomes, but available data from real-world observational studies are scarce. An observational cohort study was conducted on 705 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at Strasbourg University Hospital between February 2010 and June 2017. We observed the living status (dead or alive) for each study participants by March 2023. The primary end point was to evaluate the all-cause mortality rate beyond 5 years after TAVR, compare the survival outcomes according to valve type, and identify predictors of mortality. Of the 705 study participants, 91.8% of the TAVR procedures were performed through the common femoral artery and 60.6% were treated with a balloon-expandable valve. Over a mean study period of 5.4 ± 3 years, the all-cause mortality rate was 45.8%. No difference in survival outcomes according to valve type was observed (p = 0.449). All-cause mortality rate was associated with age ≥90 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.625, 1.109 to 2.380, p = 0.013), female gender (HR 0.228, 0.176 to 0.294, p <0.001), diabetes mellitus (HR 1.356, 1.070 to 1.719, p = 0.012), post-TAVR stroke (HR = 2.867, 1.690 to 4.865, p <0.001), and post-TAVR acute kidney injury (HR 1.977, 1.445 to 2.703, p <0.001). In conclusion, the present real-world large tertiary center experience showed that more than half of patients who underwent TAVR are alive beyond 5 years from procedure's date. All-cause mortality is mainly determined by advanced age and co-morbid conditions, and valve type has no advantage on the survival outcomes.
