Title: Treatment of end-stage pharyngeal strictures after laryngectomy with fasciocutaneous microvascular reconstruction.

Abstract: Pharyngeal strictures can develop after laryngectomy for larynx cancer, particularly in combination with radiation. Some patients develop intractable strictures where conservative swallowing therapy and pharyngeal dilations fail. Secondary reconstruction of these patients has not been described in the literature. We report our experience with completion pharyngectomy and fasciocutaneous free tissue reconstruction for this patient population. Five subjects who had undergone laryngectomy and radiation were successfully reconstructed with fasciocutaneous free tissue transfer using the radial forearm or anterolateral thigh with minimal post-operative complications. Following surgery, enteral tube feeding requirements were eliminated, and all diets were advanced. A few patients still required a modified diet or continued dilations. We thus demonstrate that pharyngectomy with secondary reconstruction is an effective option for end-stage pharyngeal strictures, though this should only be undertaken with careful patient selection.
