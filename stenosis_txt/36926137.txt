Title: Post-traumatic cauda equina nerve calcification: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic cauda equina nerve calcification is extremely rare in clinical practice, and its etiology, pathogenesis, treatment and prognosis are unclear. There are few studies and reports on Post-traumatic cauda equina nerve calcification, and this review reports a case of Post-traumatic cauda equina nerve calcification for reference.
CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old patient presented to our hospital with a history of lumbar spinal stenosis and a lumbar vertebral fracture caused by trauma. The patient's right lower limb had weakness in hip flexion, knee extension and plantarflexion with muscle strength grade 3, right ankle dorsiflexion and thumb dorsiflexion with muscle strength grade 0. The patient's skin sensation below the right knee plane disappeared. The patient's Computed tomography (CT) data showed signs of cauda equina nerve calcification and the terminal filaments in the plane of the third to fifth lumbar vertebrae. After treatment the patient's symptoms were slightly relieved.
CONCLUSION: We provide an extremely rare case of Post-traumatic cauda equina nerve calcification and offer a conservative treatment plan. However, the etiology, mechanism and treatment of Post-traumatic cauda equina nerve calcification are still unclear. This requires scholars to conduct more research and exploration in this area.
