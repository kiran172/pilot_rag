Title: Factors Predicting De Novo Formation of Fistulas After Dural Fistula Embolization Using Venous Sinus Balloon Protection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endovascular embolization with transvenous sinus preservation using balloon is at present the preferred modality for dural arteriovenous fistulas involving venous sinuses (sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid) with potential drainage function. The aim of the study was to evaluate the necessity and medium-term efficacy of this technique.
METHODS: Patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas involving large sinuses who underwent vascular embolization with transvenous balloon protection technique at our center from December 2012 to July 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical symptoms, postoperative and mid-term follow-up imaging results, perioperative complications, and follow-up clinical outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (8 women and 10 men) with mean age 49 years were included in this study. Complete (16 of 18) or near-complete (1 of 18) occlusion of original fistula was achieved in 17 patients (94.4%). Recurrence of original fistula (1 of 18) or de novo fistula (3 of 18) occurred in 4 patients (22.2%). The patency rate of balloon-protected sinus was 72.2% (13 of 18) during the follow-up, and the involved sinuses were eventually occluded in 5 patients (27.8%). The frequency of de novo fistulas was higher in patients with sinus occlusion (P < 0.05). Stenosis of the involved sinus was more likely related to balloon-protected sinus occlusion (P < 0.05). After a mean follow-up of 17.6 months, 17 patients (94.4%) achieved remission of the original symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Transvenous balloon protection technique maintains sinus patency in most cases, and preoperative stenosis increases the probability of sinus occlusion. De novo fistula is related to sinus occlusion during the follow-up.
