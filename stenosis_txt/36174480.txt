Title: Assessment of socioeconomic disadvantage in laryngotracheoplasty outcomes among pediatric patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine whether socioeconomic disadvantage impacts outcomes after pediatric laryngotracheoplasty.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.
METHODS: All laryngotracheoplasty procedures at a tertiary children's hospital between 2010 and 2019 were included. Primary zip code determined Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a validated socioeconomic vulnerability measure, and children were grouped based on less or more community disadvantage. Primary outcomes included complication and decannulation rates.
RESULTS: Eighty-four procedures were included with 69% (58/84) double-stage and 31% (26/84) single-stage reconstructions. Median age at surgery was 3.2 (IQR 2.2-4.9) years, 56% (47/84) were male, and median gestational age was 25 (IQR 24-28) weeks. Children from more disadvantaged communities represented 67% (56/84) of surgeries and were more likely to have higher grade stenosis (89% vs. 64%, P = .02). Postoperative airway complications (20% vs. 18%, P = .99), non-airway complications (14% vs. 18%, P = .75), and total length of stay (7 vs. 6 days, P = .26) were not impacted by ADI grouping. While children from higher community disadvantage were just as likely to be decannulated after double stage surgeries (76% vs. 76%, P = .99), it more often took longer than six months to achieve (90% vs. 61%, P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Community disadvantage is associated with higher grade airway stenosis and longer times to successful decannulation in children requiring expansion airway surgery. Encouragingly, ADI grouping did not impact complication and decannulation rates. Continued work is needed to understand how socioeconomic metrics influence pediatric open airway surgery.
