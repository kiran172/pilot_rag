Title: Factors influencing outcomes of esophageal balloon dilatation for anastomosis site stenosis after esophageal atresia surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Esophageal balloon dilatation is an effective treatment for anastomotic strictures, but the factors affecting the outcome of dilatation remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictive factors of esophageal balloon dilatation outcome in children with anastomotic stricture after esophageal atresia repair.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed children with esophageal atresia who underwent esophageal balloon dilatation for postoperative strictures between August 2007 and February 2021. We investigated each child's age, weight and height; type of esophageal atresia surgery; shape, length and level of stricture; esophageal balloon dilatation balloon size; application of mitomycin; number of inflation sessions; and number of esophageal balloon dilatation sessions. The outcome of each esophageal balloon dilatation session was determined as improvement in stricture diameter between pre- and post-esophageal balloon dilatation esophagography. We used uni- and multivariate analyses with generalized estimating equations to evaluate outcome predictors.
RESULTS: Overall, 69 children (mean age, 2.3Â years; 45 boys) underwent 227 esophageal balloon dilatations. In the univariate analysis, the positive effect of esophageal balloon dilatation decreased with increased age, weight, height, balloon size and number of esophageal balloon dilatation sessions. Additionally, the positive effect was decreased in cervical-level strictures and with the application of mitomycin during esophageal balloon dilatation. In the multivariate analysis, independent prognostic factors of the positive esophageal balloon dilatation effect were age (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: -0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.01, -0.002), shape of stricture (IRR: -0.54; 95% CI: -0.91, -0.18) and number of esophageal balloon dilatation sessions (IRR, -0.10; 95% CI: -0.14, -0.18).
CONCLUSION: Repeated esophageal balloon dilatation, older age and eccentric stricture shape are associated with poor response to esophageal balloon dilatation in children with anastomotic strictures after esophageal atresia repair.
