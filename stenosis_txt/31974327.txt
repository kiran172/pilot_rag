Title: Comparison of relative safety and efficacy of handmade S-shaped catheter and conventional catheters in concomitant carotid and coronary angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We have evaluated the feasibility of concomitant carotid angiography after coronary angiography with the same catheter, and the practicality, safety and success of image acquisition with respect to conventional catheters.
METHOD: 248 patients have been enrolled in the study, who have been evaluated with both carotid and coronary angiography in a time period between 2010 and 2017. 117 of them were evaluated with right diagnostic catheters and 131 of them were evaluated with handmade S shaped (HMS) catheters. Basic parameters were similar in both of the groups. Total procedural time (7.34 ± 1.10 vs 9.56 ± 3.59 minutes, p < 0.001), fluoroscopy use time (6.08 ± 1.72 vs 5.23 ± 1.00 minutes, p < 0.001), used contrast media volume (50.2 ± 15.6 mL vs 62.3 ± 17.9 mL, p < 0.001) were all lower in the HMS catheter group.
CONCLUSION: There is strong correlation between coronary and carotid artery disease (62%). Many Cardiologists perform concomitant carotid angiography when performing coronary angiography using right diagnostic catheters (JR). The JR catheters tip can be reshaped like to S to enhance its safety and efficacy during carotid imaging. Our experience supports this. Imaging of the carotid arteries is advantageous for the patients with severe coronary artery disease, when performing coronary angiography. For this purpose, the same catheter used for coronary imaging can be used after it is reshaped at hand, in place of a special catheter. This method is both efficient and safe.
