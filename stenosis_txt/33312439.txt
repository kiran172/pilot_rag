Title: Rapid right ventricular pacing for balloon valvuloplasty in congenital aortic stenosis: A systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is a well-established treatment modality for congenital aortic valve stenosis.
AIM: To evaluate the role of rapid right ventricular pacing (RRVP) in balloon stabilization during BAV on aortic regurgitation (AR) in pediatric patients.
METHODS: A systematic review of the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (end-of-search date: July 8, 2020). The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Newcastle-Ottawa scales was utilized for quality assessment.
RESULTS: Five studies reporting on 72 patients were included. The studies investigated the use of RRVP-assisted BAV in infants (> 1 mo) and older children, but not in neonates. Ten (13.9%) patients had a history of some type of aortic valve surgical or catheterization procedure. Before BAV, 58 (84.0%), 7 (10.1%), 4 (5.9%) patients had AR grade 0 (none), 1 (trivial), 2 (mild), respectively. After BAV, 34 (49.3%), 6 (8.7%), 26 (37.7%), 3 (4.3%), patients had AR grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 (moderate), respectively. No patient developed severe AR after RRVP. One (1.4%) developed ventricular fibrillation and was defibrillated successfully. No additional arrhythmias or complications occurred during RRVP.
CONCLUSION: RRVP can be safely used to achieve balloon stability during pediatric BAV, which could potentially decrease AR rates.
