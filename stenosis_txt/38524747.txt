Title: Prognostic value of mitral annular calcification in coronary atherosclerotic disease assessed by coronary computed tomographic angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a lack of evidence on the link between mitral annular calcification (MAC) and coronary atherosclerotic diseases. The present investigation was undertaken to detect the clinical and prognostic value of MAC in coronary atherosclerotic diseases in patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five individuals with MAC and without it (n = 85 and 120, respectively) were included in the present cross-sectional study. Coronary artery disease-reporting and data system (CAD-RADS) at coronary CT angiography was used to define the severity of coronary atherosclerotic diseases. Patients were classified into no or non-significant CAD (CAD-RADS 0-2) and significant CAD (CAD-RADS 3-5) according to the severity of coronary atherosclerotic diseases. The association of MAC with two mentioned groups (no or non-significant CAD and significant CAD) was assessed using the Chi-squared test and logistic regression in crude and adjusted models.
RESULTS: Patients with MAC were significantly older (69.34 ± 8.20 vs. 60.64 ± 11.42, P &lt; 0.001), had lower glomerular infiltration rate (69.67 ± 20.92 vs. 78.00 ± 20.23, P = 0.005), and higher coronary artery calcification score (352.87 ± 495.85 vs. 200.55 ± 426.13, P = 0.05) in comparison to those without MAC. However, the significant difference between the two groups regarding coronary artery calcification score disappeared after adjustment for confounders (P = 0.14). In addition, a statistically significant positive link between MAC and significant CAD was observed (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.96 [1.04-3.71], P = 0.04). Nevertheless, the association became statistically insignificant after adjustment for confounders (OR [95% CI]: 1.60 [0.78-3.28], P = 0.2).
CONCLUSION: The findings of the study revealed that MAC has no independent prognostic value in coronary atherosclerotic diseases evaluated by coronary CT angiography.
