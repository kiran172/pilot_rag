Title: Tungsten-Based Contrast Agent for Photon-Counting Detector CT Angiography in Calcified Coronaries: Comparison to Iodine in a Cardiovascular Phantom.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Calcified plaques induce blooming artifacts in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) potentially leading to inaccurate stenosis evaluation. Tungsten represents a high atomic number, experimental contrast agent with different physical properties than iodine. We explored the potential of a tungsten-based contrast agent for photon-counting detector (PCD) CCTA in heavily calcified coronary vessels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cardiovascular phantom exhibiting coronaries with calcified plaques was imaged on a first-generation dual-source PCD-CT. The coronaries with 3 different calcified plaques were filled with iodine and tungsten contrast media solutions equating to iodine and tungsten delivery rates (IDR and TDR) of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 g/s, respectively. Electrocardiogram-triggered sequential acquisitions were performed in the spectral mode (QuantumPlus). Virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) were reconstructed from 40 to 190 keV in 1 keV increments. Blooming artifacts and percentage error stenoses from calcified plaques were quantified, and attenuation characteristics of both contrast media were recorded.
RESULTS: Blooming artifacts from calcified plaques were most pronounced at 40 keV (78%) and least pronounced at 190 keV (58%). Similarly, percentage error stenoses were highest at 40 keV (48%) and lowest at 190 keV (2%), respectively. Attenuation of iodine decreased monotonically in VMIs from low to high keV, with the strongest decrease from 40 keV to 100 keV (IDR of 2.5 g/s: 1279 HU at 40 keV, 187 HU at 100 kV, and 35 HU at 190 keV). The attenuation of tungsten, on the other hand, increased monotonically as a function of VMI energy, with the strongest increase between 40 and 100 keV (TDR of 2.5 g/s: 202 HU at 40 keV, 661 HU at 100 kV, and 717 HU at 190 keV). For each keV level, the relationship between attenuation and IDR/TDR could be described by linear regressions ( R2 â‰¥ 0.88, P < 0.001). Specifically, attenuation increased linearly when increasing the delivery rate irrespective of keV level or contrast medium. Iodine exhibited the highest relative increase in attenuation values at lower keV levels when increasing the IDR. Conversely, for tungsten, the greatest relative increase in attenuation values occurred at higher keV levels when increasing the TDR. When high keV imaging is desirable to reduce blooming artifacts from calcified plaques, IDR has to be increased at higher keV levels to maintain diagnostic vessel attenuation (ie, 300 HU), whereas for tungsten, TDR can be kept constant or can be even reduced at high keV energy levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Tungsten's attenuation characteristics in relation to VMI energy levels are reversed to those of iodine, with tungsten exhibiting high attenuation values at high keV levels and vice versa. Thus, tungsten shows promise for high keV imaging CCTA with PCD-CT as-in distinction to iodine-both high vessel attenuation and low blooming artifacts from calcified plaques can be achieved.
