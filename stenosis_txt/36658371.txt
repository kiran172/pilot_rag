Title: Predictors of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in middle-aged patients undergoing cardiac surgery: retrospective observational study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors of early post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in middle-aged patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS: Data were examined retrospectively from 71 patients aged 46-64 years who underwent elective cardiac surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography were obtained preoperatively to assess prior cerebral infarctions, carotid artery stenosis, and intracranial arterial stenosis. Patients also completed six neuropsychological tests of memory, attention, and executive function before and after surgery. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was defined as performance 1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the population means on any neurocognitive battery, whereas POCD was defined as a decrease of 1 SD population means on at least two in the test battery. Patient characteristics were analyzed using univariate analysis, and independent predictors were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: After surgery, 25 patients (35%) were assessed with POCD. Patients with POCD had significantly higher rates of preoperative MCI and cerebral infarcts on MRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified preoperative MCI and cerebral infarctions detected by MRI as a predictor of POCD.
CONCLUSION: More than one-third of middle-aged patients undergoing cardiac surgery developed POCD. Our findings suggested preoperative MCI and infarcts detected by MRI were risk factors for POCD in these middle-aged patients.
