Title: First Experience of Sutureless Redo on Mitral Valve Using Valve-in-Valve Technique: Two-Stage Implantation on a Large Animal.

Abstract: Sutureless implantation of the mitral valve bioprosthesis using the valve-in-valve method was performed on a large animal (sheep). According to the results of a two-stage implantation (primary implantation of a xenopericardial 26-mm framed bioprosthesis and reimplantation of the developed 23-mm bioprosthesis), minor changes in quantitative indicators were revealed: an increase in the transprosthetic gradient by 1.3 mm Hg and a decrease in the area of the mitral orifice by 21.6%. Considerable reduction in the intervention time by 18 min was achieved (by 40% in comparison with the primary prosthesis). The absence of adverse events in the animal and complications in the post-operative period, as well as physiological hemodynamic indicators indicate the safety of the developed medical device.
