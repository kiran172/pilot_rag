Title: Point-of-Care Ultrasound in Detection, Severity and Mechanism of Significant Valvular Heart Disease and Clinical Management.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of significant valvular heart disease (VHD) enables appropriate implementation of the best therapeutic strategy and follow-up. Cardiac auscultation remains suboptimal in early detection of VHD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for early detection of VHD and its severity.
METHODS: All consecutive patients with VHD who did not have a standard echocardiogram prior to first outpatient cardiology consultation underwent history and physical examination followed by POCUS study by an experienced physician in a general cardiology clinic from June 2017 to August 2022 at our institution. Subsequent standard transthoracic echocardiography (sTTE) was performed as the gold standard. Comparison was performed between POCUS and sTTE for the presence and severity of VHD. sTTE was performed by registered cardiac sonographers and interpreted by another cardiologist blinded to the POCUS results.
RESULTS: A total of 77 patients were studied (ge 72 ± 11 years, 58.4% males). A total of 89 significant valvular abnormalities were diagnosed. There were 39 (43.8%) cases of regurgitant VHD, 16 (18.0%) of stenotic VHD and 34 (38.2%) had evaluation for prosthetic valve function. The sensitivity (90.9%; 82.4%; 83.3%; 100%) and specificity (100%; 96.7%; 100%; 100%) were high for detecting ≥ moderate aortic regurgitation (AR), mitral regurgitation (MR), aortic stenosis (AS) and prosthetic valvular abnormality, respectively. The weighted κ coefficient between POCUS and sTTE for the assessment of ≥ moderate MR, AR and AS was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.65-0.97), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.84-1.00) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.76-1.0), respectively, indicating excellent agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: POCUS can identify patients with significant VHD and may serve as a powerful screening tool for early detection of significant VHD in the outpatient clinical practice with downstream impact on clinical management of significant VHD.
