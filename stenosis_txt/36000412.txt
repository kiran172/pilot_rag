Title: Role of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibition in Patients Undergoing Carotid Revascularization.

Abstract: Background Previous data suggest that using renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASIs) improves survival in patients with cardiovascular diseases. We sought to investigate the association of different patterns of use of RAASIs on perioperative and 1-year outcomes following carotid revascularization. Methods and Results We investigated patients undergoing carotid revascularization, either with carotid endarterectomy or transfemoral carotid artery stenting, in the VQI (Vascular Quality Initiative) VISION (Vascular Implant Surveillance and Interventional Outcomes Network) data set between 2003 and 2018. We divided our cohort into 3 groups: (1) no history of RAASI intake, (2) preoperative intake only, and (3) continuous pre- and postoperative intake. The final cohort included 73 174 patients; 44.4% had no intake, 50% had continuous intake, and 5.6% had only preoperative intake. Compared with continuous intake, preoperative and no intake were associated with higher odds of postoperative stroke (odds ratio [OR], 1.7 [95% CI, 1.5-1.9]; P&lt;0.001; OR, 1.1 [95% CI, 1.03-1.2]; P=0.010); death (OR, 4.8 [95% CI, 3.8-6.1]; P&lt;0.001; OR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.6-2.2]; P&lt;0.001); and stroke/death (OR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.8-2.3]; P&lt;0.001; OR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.3]; P&lt;0.001), respectively. At 1 year, preoperative and no intake were associated with higher odds of stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4 [95% CI, 1.3-1.6]; P&lt;0.001; HR, 1.15, [95% CI, 1.08-1.2]; P&lt;0.001); death (HR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.5-1.9]; P&lt;0.001; HR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.4]; P&lt;0.001); and stroke/death (HR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.4-1.7]; P&lt;0.001; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.17-1.3]; P&lt;0.001), respectively. Conclusions Compared with subjects discontinuing or never starting RAASIs, use of RAASIs before and after carotid revascularization was associated with a short-term stroke and mortality benefit. Future clinical trials examining prescribing patterns of RAASIs should aim to clarify the timing and potential to maximize the protective effects of RAASIs in high-risk vascular patients.
