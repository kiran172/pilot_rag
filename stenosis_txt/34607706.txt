Title: Lipoprotein(a) and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are limited data regarding the association between lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. This study investigated the association between Lp(a) and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis detected by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) in an asymptomatic population.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 7201 asymptomatic individuals (mean age 54.4 ± 7.9 years; 65.3% men with no prior history of coronary artery disease who voluntarily underwent CCTA as part of a general health examination). The degree and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis were evaluated by CCTA. Study participants were stratified into quartiles according to their Lp(a) levels (<4.3, 4.3-8.9, 9.0-20.1, and ≥20.2 mg/dL).
RESULTS: Of the study participants, any coronary plaque on CCTA was observed in 2557 (35.5%). Specifically, calcified, non-calcified, and mixed plaques were observed in 2411 (33.5%), 363 (5.0%) and 249 (3.5%) participants, respectively. After adjustment for the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, the fourth Lp(a) quartile was significantly associated with any coronary (odds ratio [OR] 1.212; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.038-1.416), calcified (1.205, 95% CI 1.030-1.410), non-calcified (1.588, 95% CI 1.152-2.189), or mixed (1.674, 95% CI 1.172-2.391) plaque compared with the first Lp(a) quartile. In addition, 442 (6.1%) had significant coronary artery stenosis (≥50% diameter stenosis). The odds ratio for significant stenosis (1.537, 95% CI 1.153-2.048) was higher in the fourth quartile compared with the first quartile.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large cross-sectional study with asymptomatic individuals undergoing CCTA, higher Lp(a) level was associated with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.
