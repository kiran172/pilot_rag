Title: Sex does not have an impact on perioperative transfemoral carotid artery stenting outcomes among octogenarians.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been validated as an acceptable alternative to carotid endarterectomy in patients at high risk for open surgery. There are variable sex- and age-based differences in transfemoral CAS outcomes of published randomized controlled trials. The aim of our study was to evaluate sex-based differences in perioperative outcomes after transfemoral CAS performed in octogenarians.
METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program targeted vascular module was queried for all patients ≥80 years of age who underwent transfemoral CAS between 2011 and 2017. Symptomatic status was defined as a history of prior ipsilateral stroke, transient ischemic attack, or amaurosis fugax. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of perioperative (30-day) stroke or death. Outcomes were compared for male vs female patients and stratified by symptomatic status using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for emergent status, symptomatic status, comorbidities, and use of an embolic protection device.
RESULTS: Overall, there were 143 patients ≥80 years of age who underwent transfemoral CAS during the study period, including 95 men (66.4%) and 48 women (33.6%). Race (white, 88.0% vs 85.4%), symptomatic status (30.9% vs 29.2%), and degree of stenosis (severe, 71.6% vs 62.5%) were not significantly different for men vs women (P ≥ .27). Periprocedural stroke/death occurred in six men (6.4%) vs two women (4.2%; P = .59) and did not significantly differ when stratified according to symptomatic (6.9% vs 7.1%; P = .98) and asymptomatic (6.2% vs 2.9%; P = .49) status. Based on multivariable analysis, independent factors associated with the composite end point included emergent vs elective status (adjusted odds ratio OR [aOR], 20.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.25-183) and failure to use an embolic protection device (aOR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.59-50.0). Sex was not significantly associated with the primary outcome after risk adjustment (aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.28-3.28).
CONCLUSIONS: We found no sex-based differences in risk of perioperative stroke/death among patients ≥80 years of age undergoing transfemoral CAS. Our study validates previous studies showing a high rate of perioperative complications after transfemoral CAS in octogenarians and suggests that the decision to use this technology in older patients should be determined by patients' anatomic and medical risk factors irrespective of sex.
