Title: Percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy and transcatheter aortic valve replacement for rheumatic mitral and aortic stenosis.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The indications for transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have been expanding; however, treatment protocol for patients with severe aortic stenosis with other significant valve disease is still controversial. Furthermore, there are few randomized data to guide therapy in multivalvular disease. We describe a successful percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy and TAVR simultaneously. A 3-year follow-up echocardiography showed preserved valve function.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: A combination of percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy and transcatheter aortic valve replacement for multivalvular disease with severe mitral stenosis and aortic stenosis may be a treatment option. For multivalvular disease, heart team decisions can be valuable for an optimal management strategy.
