Title: H-type congenital tracheo-oesophageal fistula associated with oesophageal stenosis: anatomical variant.

Abstract: The goal of this paper was to report a new variant of oesophageal atresia: an H-type congenital tracheo-oesophageal fistula associated with oesophageal segmental stenosis distal to the fistula. Although symptoms were present from birth, we did not differentiate the new anatomical variant preoperatively. The patient was treated by fistula ligation, segmental resection of the distal oesophagus and end-to-end anastomosis of the oesophagus by thoracoscopic surgery. Here we describe the clinical history and management of the newborn infant, together with diagnostic recommendations to prevent misdiagnosis in the management of this condition.
