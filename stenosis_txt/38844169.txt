Title: Association between cerebral artery stenosis and depressive symptoms in elderly patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between cerebral artery stenosis and depressive symptoms in elderly patients.
METHODS: The study participants were 365 patients aged ≥65 years who visited the psychiatric outpatient clinic, Samsung Medical Center between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2019, and were diagnosed with depressive disorder. They had brain imaging tests including magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), psychological evaluations including the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), and lab tests. Individuals' cerebral artery stenosis was identified and the association with significant depressive symptoms was examined.
RESULTS: Of the 365 subjects, 108 had at least one location of cerebral artery stenosis (29.6 %). The mean score of GDS-15 in the stenosis group was 8.1 (SD, 3.8), higher than the mean GDS-15 score of 6.5 (SD, 4.0) for the group without stenosis (p < 0.001). Compared to no middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis, having MCA stenosis was associated with significant depressive symptoms (p = 0.005). Compared to no posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stenosis, having left PCA stenosis was associated with significant depressive symptoms (p = 0.022). In the multivariable linear regression analysis, only bilateral MCA stenosis had a positive association with the score of GDS-15 (p = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: Bilateral MCA stenosis and left PCA stenosis are associated with significant depressive symptoms among elderly patients, with bilateral MCA stenosis positively associated with the severity of depression.
