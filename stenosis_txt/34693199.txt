Title: Same-day discharge after transcatheter mitral valve repair using MitraClip in a tertiary community hospital: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Due to the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a realization for innovation in procedures and protocols to minimize hospital stay and at the same time ensure continued evidence-based treatment delivered to the patients. We present a same-day discharge protocol for transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) using MitraClip under general anaesthesia in a six-patient case series. This protocol aims to reduce the length of hospital stay, thereby minimizing potential for nosocomial COVID-19 infections and to promote safe discharge with cautious follow-up.
CASE SUMMARY: Six patients with severe symptomatic mitral valve (MV) regurgitation underwent successful transfemoral MV repair using standard procedures. Following repair, patients were monitored on telemetry in the recovery area for 3 h, ambulated to assess vascular access stability and underwent post-procedural transthoracic echocardiogram to assess for any pericardial effusion or post-procedural prosthetic mitral stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Same-day discharge after TMVR is possible when done cautiously with close follow-up, can minimize hospital stay, improve resource utilization, and reduce risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
