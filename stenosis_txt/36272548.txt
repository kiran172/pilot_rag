Title: Cardiovascular Outcomes of Older versus Newer Generation Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Recipients: A Systematic Review & Meta-analysis.

Abstract: Newer generation transcatheter heart valves (THV) are presumed to yield better clinical efficacy and postprocedural complication profile as compared to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using older generation THVs. The real impact of newer generation valves on TAVR outcomes is not well known. Studies comparing older and newer generation THVs were identified from online databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception until August 2020. The primary outcome of the study was to compare mortality. Secondary outcomes included cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction, major vascular complications, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, paravalvular leak, and post-procedural pacemaker implantation. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel random effect model with an odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value significance â‰¤0.05. A total of 14 studies were included with a combined patient population of 5697 patients (older generation n=1996; newer generation n=3701). Newer generation valves showed statistically significant results favoring lower major vascular complications (OR=2.05; 95% CI, 1.33-3.18; P = 0.00), major bleeding (OR=1.99; 95% CI, 1.35-2.93; P = 0.00), acute kidney injury (OR=1.71; 95% CI, 1.13-2.59; P = 0.01), paravalvular leak (OR=2.41; 95% CI, 1.11-5.28; P = 0.03) and mortality (OR=1.50; 95% CI, 1.10-2.06; P = 0.01) as compared to older generation valves. Cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction, and pacemaker placement rates were found to be similar between older and newer generation valves. TAVR outcomes using newer generation valves are superior to those of older generation valves in terms of major vascular complications, acute kidney injury, paravalvular leak, and mortality.
