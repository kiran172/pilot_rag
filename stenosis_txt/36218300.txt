Title: Surgical repair of the adult form of scimitar syndrome.

Abstract: Scimitar syndrome has various clinical presentations and anatomic features, and some cases are diagnosed in adulthood. Reconstruction using autologous tissue to reroute the right pulmonary venous blood flow to the left atrium is ideal. However, if the scimitar vein drains to the caudal segment of the inferior vena cava, reconstruction using prosthetic material may be necessary due to the distance between the left atrium and the scimitar vein. We describe the case of a 16-year-old boy with scimitar syndrome. We anastomosed the scimitar vein to the right atrium using an artificial graft and created an atrial septal defect for rerouting the right pulmonary venous blood to the left atrium. It has been 9 years since this procedure, and the patient has not experienced graft stenosis or thromboembolic events.
