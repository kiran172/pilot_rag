Title: Efficacy and long-term outcomes of single-balloon enteroscopy-assisted treatment for biliary obstruction after choledochojejunostomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of single-balloon enteroscopy endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (SBE-ERC) for the treatment of biliary obstruction and to analyze the factors affecting the recurrence of benign bilioenteric anastomotic stricture after SBE-ERC treatment.
METHODS: The clinical data of patients with biliary diseases treated with SBE-ERC after choledochojejunostomy in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2021 were analyzed retrospectively for the success rates of diagnosis and treatment and the incidence of complications. Patients who were diagnosed with benign bilioenteric anastomotic stricture were followed up. The independent factors affecting recurrence were obtained by univariate and multivariate analyses using the Kaplan‒Meier method and Cox proportional hazard regression model.
RESULTS: A total of 289 SBE-ERCs were performed in 165 patients. The overall success rate was 83.0% (240/289). The incidence of postoperative complications was 5.2% (15/289). The 108 successfully treated patients diagnosed with benign bilioenteric anastomotic stricture were followed up. Twenty-six percent (29/108) of patients had recurrent stricture after SBE-ERC. The biliary patency rates at 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after SBE-ERC were 90.1%, 69.3%, and 53.9%, respectively. Single-factor analysis revealed the absence of intrahepatic biliary gas imaging during endoscopy (  χ 2  =5.366, P = 0.021), a diameter of balloon dilatation during the last endoscopic treatment less than 0.8 cm (  χ 2  =4.552, P = 0.033), and the presence of a thread in the anastomosis (  χ 2  =8.921, P = 0.003) as risk factors for recurrence. A non-indwelling biliary plastic stent (  χ 2  =14.868, P &lt; 0.001) and undergoing only one ERCP treatment (  χ 2  =13.313, P = 0.001) were risk factors for the recurrence of benign stricture after SBE-ERC resection. Multivariate analysis revealed that the absence of a stent (HR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.06-0.40, P = 0.001), absence of intrahepatic biliary gas imaging during endoscopy (HR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17-0.91, P = 0.03) and the presence of a thread in the anastomosis (HR = 3.69, 95% CI 1.59-8.57, P = 0.002) were independent risk factors for stricture recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Treating biliary disease after choledochojejunostomy with SBE-ERC is safe and effective, with a good immediate technical success rate and an acceptable incidence of complications. SBE-ERC has long-term efficacy in the treatment of benign bilioenteric anastomotic stricture. The absence of intrahepatic biliary gas imaging during endoscopy, non-indwelling biliary stents and the existence of anastomotic threads are independent risk factors for the recurrence of benign bilioenteric anastomotic stricture.
