Title: Internal fixation of the proximal tracheal self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS): migration prevention in high risk patients.

Abstract: Airway stenting provides an important treatment option for patients with proximal tracheal stenosis. However, the risk of migration remains a major challenging problem. In our report we describe the internal fixation of SEMS in 3 patients with proximal tracheal stenosis due to variable causes. The fixation was performed in different situations including: prophylaxis to prevent the stent migration, fixation due to displacement of the stent during insertion and finally internal fixation of migrated tracheal stent.
