Title: Early Intervention in Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis: What Are We Waiting For?

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) contributes to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the natural history from symptoms to ventricular decompensation, heart failure, and death has been well documented. For more than 2 decades, technologies including imaging and biomarkers have shown a promising ability to detect myocardial damage associated with AS before symptoms arise. Current treatment guidelines rely heavily on symptoms or ventricular decompensation as triggers for aortic valve intervention. There is increasing appreciation of the relationship between myocardial damage due to AS before the emergence of symptoms, and a number of published randomised trials suggest a benefit to early intervention in asymptomatic AS, with additional trials actively enrolling. Future treatment paradigms may incorporate early detection of ventricular damage by noninvasive new technologies as triggers for asymptomatic intervention. Enthusiasm for early aortic valve replacement should be tempered by consideration of the competing risks of early valve intervention, but an increasing preponderance of evidence continues to suggest that earlier intervention in AS is warranted.
