Title: Trans-femoral TAVI: Successful hemostasis of a totally calcified femoral artery ("calcium tube") with the Manta© device.

Abstract: We describe a case of trans-femoral trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) wherein the use of a novel collagen plug-based device (i.e. Manta© device) was very successful in arterial 16 French sheath hemostasis despite an extremely hostile peripheral vessel anatomy due to calcification.
