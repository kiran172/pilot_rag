Title: [Correlation of Transluminal Attenuation Gradientdistal with Corrected Contrast Opacification with Anterior Coronary Atherosclerosis].

Abstract: Objective To explore the correlation between the transluminal attenuation gradient with corrected contrast opacification(TAG-CCO)and the severity of atherosclerotic stenosis in the anterior segment of myocrardial bridge(MB). Methods The imaging data of 200 patients diagnosed with left anterior descending branch(LAD)single MB and coronary atherosclerosis in the anterior segment of MB were retrospectively analyzed.According to MB types,the patients were divided into two groups:incomplete and complete.There were some significant differences in TAG-CCO between patients with the same degree of coronary atherosclerosis(mild,moderate,and severe stenosis)in two groups.The relationships among groups with different degrees(mild,moderate,and severe stenosis)of the same type of MB were further compared. Results Among 84 patients with complete MB,36,30,and 18 patients had mild,moderate,or severe coronary atherosclerosis in the anterior segment of MB;among 116 patients with incomplete MB,45,42,and 29 patients had mild,moderate,or severe coronary atherosclerosis in the anterior segment of MB.In the complete MB group,the TAG-CCO in the anterior segment of MB subgroups were(-0.0086±0.0014)/10 mm,(-0.0170±0.0180)/10 mm,and(-0.0230±0.0026)/10 mm,respectively,in mild,moderate,and severe subgroups(F = 404.728, P&lt;0.001).In the incomplete MB group,the TAG-CCO of patients with mild,moderate and severe coronary stenosis in the anterior segment of MB were(-0.0039±0.0011)/10 mm,(-0.0100±0.0140)/10 mm,and(-0.0160±0.0020)/10 mm,respectively,and the difference among the different stenosis groups was statistically significant(F = 17.756, P &lt; 0.001);the TAG-CCO of patients with mild(t = 16.519, P &lt; 0.001),moderate(t = 2.570, P = 0.012)and severe anterior segment coronary stenosis(t = 10.714, P &lt; 0.001)were significantly lower in the complete MB group than in the incomplete MB group. Conclusions TAG-CCO is correlated with the MB type and the degree of anterior coronary artery stenosis.Thus,TAG-CCO can be used as a predictive indicator for the degree of atheroscleratic stenosis in the anterior segment of MB.
