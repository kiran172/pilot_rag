Title: Introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement technology increases overall aortic valve surgical volume: Evaluating the Florida experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement technology is increasingly used for aortic valve stenosis. We sought to evaluate the adoption of transcatheter aortic valve replacement technology with respect to overall surgical aortic valve replacement volume in Florida.
METHODS: The 2010-2019 Florida Agency for Health Care Administration data set was queried. Difference-in-difference analysis was used to evaluate the impact of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on the total aortic valve surgical volume of transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus nonperforming hospitals. Length of stay and elements of charges were compared for the raw and 1:1 propensity matched data.
RESULTS: A total of 46,032 surgical aortic valve procedures were performed at 88 hospitals. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement performing hospitals experienced a 21% increase in total aortic valve surgical volume. Length of stay was significantly less for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Propensity matched transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients had less gross total charges.
CONCLUSION: Introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement technology significantly increased overall surgical aortic valve volume and may be associated with less gross total hospital charges.
