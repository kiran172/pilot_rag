Title: Early versus delayed reconstruction for bile duct injury a multicenter retrospective analysis of a hepatopancreaticobiliary group.

Abstract: Common bile duct injury is a severe complication. It is related to increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Early recognition and on-time diagnosis plus multidisciplinary management of this disease led by a hepatobiliary surgeon show fewer complications rate and best postoperative outcomes. However, no guidelines exist about the proper time of reconstruction. This study aims to describe the experience of a specialized Hepato-Pancreatic-Biliary (HPB) group and to analyze the outcomes regarding the time of bile duct injury (BDI) repair. A multicenter retrospective review of a prospective database was conducted. All the patients older than 18 years old that underwent common bile duct reconstruction between January 2014 and December 2021 were included. Analysis and description of preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes were performed. A reconstruction time-based group differentiation was made and analyzed. 44 patients underwent common bile duct reconstruction between January 2014 and December 2021. 56.82% of the patients were female. The mean age was 53.27 years ± 20.7 years. The most common injury was type E2 (29.55%). Hepaticojejunostomy was performed in 81.81% (of the patients. Delayed reconstruction (> 72 h) was performed in the majority of the cases (75.00%) due to delays in the referral centers or poor condition. No statistically significant difference regarding complications in early or delayed BDI reconstruction. The mortality rate was 2.7% (n = 1). 2-year follow-up bilioenteric stenosis was observed in 7 patients. Biloma showed a statistical relationship with complex bile duct injuries (p = 0.02). Bile duct injury is a severe and complex postoperative complication that increases morbidity and mortality rates in the short and long term in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. In our study, there were no statistical differences between the timing of bile duct reconstruction and the postoperative outcomes; we identified the presence of biloma as a statistically related factor associated with complex bile duct injury; however, further prospective or studies with an increased sample size are required to prove our results.
