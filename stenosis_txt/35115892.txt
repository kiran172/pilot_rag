Title: A Prospective Interventional Study on LigaSureTM Haemorrhoidectomy as a Daycare Procedure.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study was designed as a prospective and interventional study that evaluated LigaSure™ haemorrhoidectomies with regional anaesthesia as a daycare procedure.
METHODS: Patients with third- and fourth-degree haemorrhoids were recruited from the clinic from January 2018 to December 2019. The procedure was performed as a day case under regional anaesthesia. Using a LigaSureTM device, excisional haemorrhoidectomies (Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy) were performed without sutures or an anal sponge. We evaluated wound bleeding, pain and urinary retention per daycare protocols.
RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were enrolled. There were 153 males (57.9%) with a median age of 30 years old (range 16 years old-80 years old). A total of 142 patients (54%) had third-degree haemorrhoids, while the rest had fourth-degree haemorrhoids. The median operating time was 8 min (range 4 min-17 min) and minimal blood loss was observed. During follow-up, the complications were one case (0.3%) had anal stenosis, one case (0.3%) had minimal bleeding and one case (0.3%) had urine retention. Upon discharge, four patients (1.5%) required additional analgesia and another four (1.5%) developed post-spinal headaches. No incontinence was encountered.
CONCLUSION: LigaSure™ excisional haemorrhoidectomy is a safe and effective daycare procedure with acceptable re-admission and complication rates.
