Title: Cervical Stenosis After Hysteroscopic Surgery for Cesarean Scar Disorder.

Abstract: Cesarean scar disorder (CSDi) is a newly recognized cause of secondary infertility. Laparoscopic or hysteroscopic surgery is generally chosen for the surgical treatment of CSDi, depending on the residual myometrial thickness of the cesarean scar. Previously, hysteroscopic transcervical resection for CSDi (TCR-CSDi) has been reported to be a safe procedure, with no cases of postoperative cervical stenosis. Herein, we report a novel case of cervical stenosis after circumferential hysteroscopic TCR-CSDi of an extensive CSDi lesion. Notably, although no cervical stenosis was observed upon postoperative hysteroscopy one month postoperatively, cervical stenosis developed four months after the surgery; therefore, it is important to avoid circumferential resection and cauterization in patients with CSDi, even when abnormal blood vessels are present. Additionally, it is advisable to check for delayed cervical stenosis at least three weeks before embryo transfer in patients who have undergone TCR-CSDi.
