Title: Use of biliary stents for large coronary arteries.

Abstract: Dedicated coronary artery drug-eluting stents may be inadequate in coronary arteries >6 mm in diameter, due to the risk of stent undersizing if the stent is not fully expanded or to loss of radial strength or damage to the drug coating if the stent is expanded >6 mm. We present two patients with large coronary arteries who were successfully treated with biliary balloon expandable stents.
