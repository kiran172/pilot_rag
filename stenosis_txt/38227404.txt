Title: Detection of Coronary Artery Disease Based on Clinical Phonocardiogram and Multiscale Attention Convolutional Compression Network.

Abstract: Heart sound is an important physiological signal that contains rich pathological information related with coronary stenosis. Thus, some machine learning methods are developed to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) based on phonocardiogram (PCG). However, current methods lack sufficient clinical dataset and fail to achieve efficient feature utilization. Besides, the methods require complex processing steps including empirical feature extraction and classifier design. To achieve efficient CAD detection, we propose the multiscale attention convolutional compression network (MACCN) based on clinical PCG dataset. Firstly, PCG dataset including 102 CAD subjects and 82 non-CAD subjects was established. Then, a multiscale convolution structure was developed to catch comprehensive heart sound features and a channel attention module was developed to enhance key features in multiscale attention convolutional block (MACB). Finally, a separate downsampling block was proposed to reduce feature losses. MACCN combining the blocks can automatically extract features without empirical and manual feature selection. It obtains good classification results with accuracy 93.43%, sensitivity 93.44%, precision 93.48%, and F1 score 93.42%. The study implies that MACCN performs effective PCG feature mining aiming for CAD detection. Further, it integrates feature extraction and classification and provides a simplified PCG processing case.
