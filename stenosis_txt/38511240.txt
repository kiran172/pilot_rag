Title: Successful management of fatal cardiac tamponade resulting from intravascular intervention for central vein occlusion in hemodialysis patients: A case report.

Abstract: This case report highlights the successful management of fatal cardiac tamponade caused by intravascular intervention for central vein occlusion in hemodialysis patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential for patient prognosis in such cases. We present a case involving a challenging surgical procedure to address multiple complications, emphasizing the importance of early detection and appropriate interventions. The patient, who had a history of long-term central venous catheter use for hemodialysis, was diagnosed with central vein stenosis in addition to superior vena cava occlusion, hemodialysis catheter rupture, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. Urgent ultrasound examination during surgery revealed pericardial effusion, prompting immediate pericardial drainage for stabilization. To overcome the complex challenges, we successfully performed an innominate vein-right atrial appendage bypass to restore vascular access and salvage the patient's life. The timely use of echocardiography for diagnosis and pericardial drainage contributed to stabilizing the patient's vital signs, providing an opportunity for subsequent surgical intervention. The innominate vein-right atrial appendage bypass procedure successfully relieved central vein stenosis and saved the patient's life. Although this surgical technique is not widely documented in hemodialysis patients with central venous involvement, it show cases the potential benefits for clinicians managing vascular access in this patient population. This case report underscores the need for awareness among clinicians regarding the risk of cardiac tamponade associated with intravascular intervention for central vein stenosis in hemodialysis patients. Minimizing central venous catheterization and prioritizing autogenous arteriovenous fistulas are crucial principles in preparing vascular access for hemodialysis patients. Early detection, timely interventions, and consideration of alternative surgical techniques can improve outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications.
