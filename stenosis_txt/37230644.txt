Title: Aortic Regurgitation and Heart Failure: Advances in Diagnosis, Management, and Interventions.

Abstract: This review discusses the contemporary clinical evaluation and management of patients with comorbid aortic regurgitation (AR) and heart failure (HF) (AR-HF). Importantly, as clinical HF exists along the spectrum of AR severity, the present review also details novel strategies to detect early signs of HF before the clinical syndrome ensues. Indeed, there may be a vulnerable cohort of AR patients who benefit from early detection and management of HF. Additionally, while the mainstay of operative management for AR has historically been surgical aortic valve replacement, this review discusses alternate procedures that may be beneficial in high-risk cohorts.
