Title: CARDIOKIN1: Computational Assessment of Myocardial Metabolic Capability in Healthy Controls and Patients With Valve Diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many heart diseases can result in reduced pumping capacity of the heart muscle. A mismatch between ATP demand and ATP production of cardiomyocytes is one of the possible causes. Assessment of the relation between myocardial ATP production (MV<sub>ATP</sub>) and cardiac workload is important for better understanding disease development and choice of nutritional or pharmacologic treatment strategies. Because there is no method for measuring MV<sub>ATP</sub> in vivo, the use of physiology-based metabolic models in conjunction with protein abundance data is an attractive approach.
METHOD: We developed a comprehensive kinetic model of cardiac energy metabolism (CARDIOKIN1) that recapitulates numerous experimental findings on cardiac metabolism obtained with isolated cardiomyocytes, perfused animal hearts, and in vivo studies with humans. We used the model to assess the energy status of the left ventricle of healthy participants and patients with aortic stenosis and mitral valve insufficiency. Maximal enzyme activities were individually scaled by means of protein abundances in left ventricle tissue samples. The energy status of the left ventricle was quantified by the ATP consumption at rest (MV<sub>ATP</sub>[rest]), at maximal workload (MV<sub>ATP</sub>[max]), and by the myocardial ATP production reserve, representing the span between MV<sub>ATP</sub>(rest) and MV<sub>ATP</sub>(max).
RESULTS: Compared with controls, in both groups of patients, MV<sub>ATP</sub>(rest) was increased and MV<sub>ATP</sub>(max) was decreased, resulting in a decreased myocardial ATP production reserve, although all patients had preserved ejection fraction. The variance of the energetic status was high, ranging from decreased to normal values. In both patient groups, the energetic status was tightly associated with mechanic energy demand. A decrease of MV<sub>ATP</sub>(max) was associated with a decrease of the cardiac output, indicating that cardiac functionality and energetic performance of the ventricle are closely coupled.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the ATP-producing capacity of the left ventricle of patients with valvular dysfunction is generally diminished and correlates positively with mechanical energy demand and cardiac output. However, large differences exist in the energetic state of the myocardium even in patients with similar clinical or image-based markers of hypertrophy and pump function.
