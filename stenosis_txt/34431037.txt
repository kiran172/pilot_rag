Title: Genotyping of interleukins-18 promoters and their correlation with coronary artery stenosis in Saudi population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complex coronary atherosclerotic lesions often lead to coronary occlusion, clinically represented as a single-vessel disease (SVD) and multivessel disease (MVD). These occlusions could hinder the blood flow in coronary arteries that affects appropriate management of the CVD. The current study intended to genotype interleukin (IL)-18 promoter's hotspots (rs187238, rs1946518, and rs1946519) and their possible association with coronary artery stenosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The IL-18 promoter genotyping was performed by the Sanger method along with the examination of biochemical parameters in 125 study subjects categorized into three groups, viz. controls, SVD and MVD.
RESULTS: The current study observed a significant association of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia between the studied group's viz. healthy controls, SVD, and MVD. Fasting blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1C) were also significantly enhanced from 4.82 vs. 8.01 and 4.33 vs. 8.27, in SVD, and MVD respectively. Despite the visible differences in the pattern of genotypic and allelic expressions, the current study did not show any statistically significant correlation with IL-18 promoter polymorphism at its hotspots with controls, SVD, and MVD subjects. The only exception of the above results was the distribution of allelic frequency at the rs1946519 hotspot, where a significant change (P < 0.05) was observed.
CONCLUSION: This study is of additional value to our previous reports, revealing the pattern of genotypes and allelic frequency of IL-18 promoters in a small cohort of Saudi ethnicity. Further investigations on larger sample size are recommended to envisage the presence of functional mutations in the IL-18 gene that could establish or rule out the possible association of IL-18 polymorphism with SVD and MVD.
