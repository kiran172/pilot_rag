Title: Determinants of prehospital and in-hospital delay in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and their influence on the outcome after elective carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study analyses the determinants of prehospital (index event to admission) and in-hospital delay (admission to carotid endarterectomy (CEA)). In addition, the analysis addresses the association between prehospital or in-hospital delay and outcomes after CEA for symptomatic patients in German hospitals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis is based on the nationwide German statutory quality assurance database. 55 437 patients were included in the analysis. Prehospital delay was grouped as follows: 180-15, 14-8, 7-3, 2-0 days or 'in-hospital index event'. In-hospital delay was divided into: 0-1, 2-3 and >3 days. The primary outcome event (POE) was in-hospital stroke or death. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed for statistical analysis. The slope of the linear regression line is given as the β-value, and the rate parameter of the logistic regression is given as the adjusted OR (aOR).
RESULTS: Prehospital delay was 0-2 days in 34.9%, 3-14 days in 29.5% and >14 days in 18.6%. Higher age (β=-1.08, p<0.001) and a more severe index event (transitory ischaemic attack: β=-4.41, p<0.001; stroke: β=-6.05, p<0.001, Ref: amaurosis fugax) were determinants of shorter prehospital delay. Higher age (β=0.28, p<0.001) and female sex (β=0.09, p=0.014) were associated with a longer in-hospital delay. Index event after admission (aOR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.47) and an intermediate in-hospital delay of 2-3 days (aOR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.33) were associated with an increased POE risk.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that older age, higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) stage, increasing severity of symptoms and ipsilateral moderate stenosis were associated with shorter prehospital delay. Non-specific symptoms were associated with a longer prehospital delay. Regarding in-hospital delay, older age, higher ASA stage, contralateral occlusion, preprocedural examination by a neurologist and admission on Fridays or Saturdays were associated with lagged treatment. A very short (<2 days) prehospital and intermediate in-hospital delay (2-3 days) were associated with increased risk of perioperative stroke or death.
