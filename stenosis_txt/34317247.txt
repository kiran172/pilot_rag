Title: Reduction of Outflow Tract Obstruction After PCI to Proximal LAD in a Patient With HOCM.

Abstract: We present a patient with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and accompanying aortic valve stenosis who had a myocardial infarction with a significant proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis. The primary percutaneous coronary intervention resulted in a notable improvement in the left ventricular outflow tract gradient and global longitudinal strain. (Level of Difficulty: Beginner.).
