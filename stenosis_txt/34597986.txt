Title: Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio is Associated with Worse Outcomes after Carotid Endarterectomy in Asymptomatic Patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Management of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) remains controversial and proper patient selection critical. Elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been associated with poor outcomes after vascular procedures. The effect of NLR on outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is assessed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients between 2010 and 2018 with carotid stenosis >70% as defined by CREST 2 criteria. A total of 922 patients were identified, of whom 806 were treated with CEA and 116 non-operatively with best medical therapy (BMT). Of patients undergoing CEA, 401 patients (290 asymptomatic [aCEA], 111 symptomatic [sCEA]) also had an available NLR calculated from a complete blood count with differential. All patients treated with BMT were asymptomatic and had a baseline NLR available. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed composite ipsilateral stroke or death over 3 years.
RESULTS: In sCEA group, the 3-year composite stroke/death rates did not differ between NLR < 3.0 (22.9%) vs NLR > 3.0 (38.1%) (P=.10). In aCEA group, patients with a baseline NLR >3.0 had an increased risk of 3-year stroke/death (42.6%) compared to both those with NLR <3.0 (9.3%, P<.0001) and those treated with BMT (23.6%, P=.003). In patients with NLR <3.0, aCEA showed a superior benefit over BMT with regard to stroke or death (9.3% vs. 26.2%, P=.02). However, in patients with NLR >3.0, there was no longer a benefit to prophylactic CEA compared to BMT (42.6% vs. 22.2%, P=.05). Multivariable analysis identified NLR >3.0 (HR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.93-5.42; P<.001) and congestive heart failure (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.33-3.58; P=.002) as independent risk factors for stroke/death in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: NLR >3.0 is associated with an increased risk of late stroke/death after prophylactic CEA for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, with benefits not superior to BMT. NLR may be used to help with selecting asymptomatic patients for CEA. The effect of NLR and outcomes in symptomatic patients requires further study. Better understanding of the mechanism(s) for NLR elevation and medical intervention strategies are needed to modulate outcome risk in these patients.
