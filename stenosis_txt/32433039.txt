Title: Association between renal function impairment and multivessel involvement in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving multivessel and the severity of renal function impairment. We reviewed medical records of patients with acute STEMI admitted to a regional teaching hospital in southern Taiwan between March 1999 and October 2013. A total of 1215 patients who underwent coronary angiography were included. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that multivessel involvement (at least two) with significant stenosis was significantly associated with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.09-4.20) and stage 5 chronic kidney disease (aOR=2.35, 95% CI=1.13-4.89), adjusting for age, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and systolic blood pressure at admission in patients with acute STEMI. In addition, multivessel total occlusion was significantly associated with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (aOR=3.68, 95% CI=1.27-10.70) and stage 5 chronic kidney disease (aOR=3.43, 95% CI=1.08-10.82), adjusting for heart rate at admission and systolic blood pressure at admission in patients with acute STEMI. In conclusion, severe renal function impairment was significantly associated with multivessel significant stenosis and multivessel total occlusion in patients with acute STEMI.
