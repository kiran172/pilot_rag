Title: Bow Hunter Phenomenon From Advanced Cerebrovascular Disease Treated With Subclavian Artery Stenting and Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: Bow Hunter syndrome (BHS) is a rare disorder characterized by mechanical occlusion of the vertebral artery (VA) during neck rotation, resulting in symptomatic, transient, and positional vertebrobasilar insufficiency. We describe a case of a 76-year-old female who presented with dizziness and right ear tinnitus triggered by right head rotation. Her symptoms would immediately resolve upon returning her head to the neutral position. CT angiogram showed 80% stenosis of the left subclavian artery origin, 50%-70% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA), and near occlusive stenoses of the origins of the bilateral VAs. After failing conservative management, the patient was treated with left subclavian artery stenting, followed by a right carotid endarterectomy (CEA) 6 weeks later. Follow-up at 1 month showed resolution of paroxysmal symptoms and no neurological sequelae. To our knowledge, there have not yet been reported cases of patients with concurrent BHS, subclavian artery stenosis, and carotid artery stenosis. We suggest that global revascularization via subclavian artery stenting and CEA may be considered as treatment for patients with BHS complicated by other cerebrovascular disease secondary to stenoses of the ICA and subclavian artery. This approach obviates the need for more complex surgery or endovascular intervention of the VA.
