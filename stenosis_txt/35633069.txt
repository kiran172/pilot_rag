Title: The role of vacuum-assisted mechanical thrombectomy in the management of acutely thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas and grafts.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the mechanical thrombectomy with the Indigo System in the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas and grafts.
METHODS: A retrospective search of endovascular procedures performed from November 2018 to June 2020 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were: acute arteriovenous fistula or graft thrombosis that underwent endovascular mechanical thrombectomy with Indigo System. The following information was collected from each case: sex, age, fistula modality, fistula location, treatment modality, and outcomes. Endpoints evaluated were: technical and clinical success rates; primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates; complication rates.
RESULTS: Twenty-six mechanical thrombectomy procedures for declotting of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, using the Indigo System, were performed in 22 patients. Technical and clinical success was achieved in 23/26 cases (88%). Mean follow-up was 9 months (range 11-539 days). The 6-month primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates were 71%, 86%, 93% and the 12-month primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates were 71%, 72%, 80%, respectively. No technical or device-related complications were observed during thrombectomy, however two venous ruptures occurred on the angioplasty of the underlying stenosis.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, vacuum-assisted thrombectomy of acutely thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas and grafts with Indigo System is safe and effective, providing good short term patency rates.
