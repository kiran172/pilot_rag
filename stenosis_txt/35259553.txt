Title: Genetic determinants of intracranial large artery stenosis in the northern Manhattan study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial stenosis is one of the most common causes of stroke worldwide. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with intracranial atherosclerosis, which is inferred to be the most common underlying cause of intracranial large artery stenosis (ILAS). We previously reviewed known genetic variants related to ILAS in predominantly Asian cohorts, but their prevalence and role in ILAS among western multiethnic populations are uncertain.
METHODS: We leveraged existing imaging and genetic data from the Northern Manhattan Study, a multiethnic prospective cohort study. Based on literature review, we selected adiponectin Q (ADIPOQ) rs2241767 and rs182052, ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) rs112735431, apolipoprotein E (APOE) rs429358, phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) rs2910829, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) rs320, and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) rs1799998 variants as candidates to explore. We defined ILAS as luminal stenosis >50% in any intracranial large artery using time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).
RESULTS: We included 1109 participants (mean age 70 ± 9 years, 70% Hispanic, 60% women) in this study. ILAS was identified in 81 (7%) NOMAS participants. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, principal components, and vascular risk factors showed ILAS prevalence associated with CYP11B2 rs1799998 under the dominant model (OR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.35-0.89) and LPL rs320 heterozygote genotype (OR = 1.68, 95%CI: 1.05-2.71). The genotype distributions of ADIPOQ rs2241767 and rs182052, APOE rs429358 and CYP11B2 rs1799998 variants were significantly different among non-Hispanic white and Black, and Hispanic groups. When participants were further stratified by race/ethnicity, the estimates were consistent for CYP11B2 rs1799998 across race/ethnic groups but not for LPL rs320.
CONCLUSION: The CYP11B2 rs1799998 variant may be a protective genetic factor for ILAS across race/ethnic groups, but the risk of ILAS associated with LPL rs320 varies by race/ethnic group. Further functional studies may help elucidate the role that these variants play in the pathophysiology of ILAS.
