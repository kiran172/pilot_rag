Title: Biomarkers as Prognostic Markers for Aortic Stenosis: A Review.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease among the older individuals. Current guidelines indicate intervention for patients with symptomatic or fast progressive severe AS and asymptomatic patients with a reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction by 50%. Interestingly, myocardial damage may have already happened by the time symptoms appear or LV function deteriorates. Serum biomarkers can be an early indicator to show LV function decline and AS progression even before clinical symptom onset. Studies have shown that cardiac biomarkers have prognostic value in patients with AS. Hence, cardiac biomarkers can be helpful in determining the optimum time to intervene. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a less invasive alternative to conventional surgical aortic valve replacement. The elevation of cardiac biomarkers at discharge has been associated with 2-year mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The correlation between biomarkers and AS-associated morbidity and mortality is an area to explore further. The authors of this review article have discussed the role of cardiac biomarkers in patients with AS for better risk stratification and identification of patients who would benefit from early intervention.
