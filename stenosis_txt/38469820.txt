Title: Long-term outcome of percutaneous endovascular stenting in external iliac artery endofibrosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: External iliac artery endofibrosis (EIAE) is a rare vascular disease which has been traditionally seen in avid cyclists. The conventional approach has been surgery, although no high-quality evidence suggests superiority of surgery over percutaneous endovascular intervention. There are limited data on the efficacy of stenting in EIAE.
METHODS: Over a 14-year period, we treated 10 patients (13 limbs) with EIAE with stents. These patients had declined surgery. The mean follow up was 8.4 ± 3.3 years. There were eight women. Five patients were competitive runners, three were cyclists, and two were triathletes. The mean age was 40.7 ± 2.9 years and body mass index was 19.46 ± 1.6. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was used in eight limbs.
RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in all. The recurrence of symptoms occurred in three patients at a mean of 9.3 ± 2.1 months postindex intervention. The other seven patients remained symptom free. IVUS revealed a pathognomonic finding which we termed 'perfect circle appearance'. It results from symmetric or asymmetric hypertrophy of one or more layers of the arterial wall leading to negative remodeling, which creates a distinct echo dense structure contrasting itself from the luminal blood's echoluscent appearance. It is identical to IVUS images of diffuse venous stenosis with important implications in the treatment technique.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that stenting in EIAE is safe and effective with a good long-term outcome. It can be an alternative to surgery, particularly in those patients who refuse a surgical approach. The IVUS image is pathognomonic and 'sine qua non' of EIAE.
