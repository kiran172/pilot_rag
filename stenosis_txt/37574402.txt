Title: Multidetector CT-derived tricuspid annulus measurements predict tricuspid regurgitation reduction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIM: To use multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT)-derived tricuspid annulus (TA) measurements to identify predictors for tricuspid regurgitation (TR) reduction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and to investigate the impact of TR change on prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-centre study was conducted on consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with concomitant baseline mild or more severe TR from April 2012 to April 2022. TA parameters were measured using MDCT.
RESULTS: The study comprised 266 patients (mean age 74.2 ± 7.6 years, 147 men) and 45.1% had more than one grade of TR reduction at follow-up. Independent predictors of TR reduction at follow-up were distance between TA centroid and antero-septal commissure (odd ratio [OR] 0.776; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.672-0.896, p=0.001), baseline TR of moderate or worse (OR 4.599; 95% CI: 2.193-9.648, p<0.001), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (OR 1.018; 95% CI: 1.002-1.035, p=0.027), age (OR 0.955; 95% CI: 0.920-0.993, p=0.019), and pre-existing atrial fibrillation (OR 0.209; 95% CI: 0.101-0.433, p<0.001). Patients without TR reduction had higher rates of rehospitalisation (hazard ratio [HR] 0.642; 95% CI: 0.413-0.998, p=0.049).
CONCLUSIONS: The MDCT-derived TA parameter was predictive of TR reduction after TAVR. Persistent TR after TAVR was associated with higher rates of rehospitalisation.
