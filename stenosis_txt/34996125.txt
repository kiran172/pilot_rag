Title: Concomitant surgery for double-chambered right ventricle and coronary stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The clinical data of coronary artery disease in patients with double-chambered right ventricle are limited. We report an adult double-chambered right ventricle case with three-vessel coronary artery disease that was successfully treated with concomitant double-chambered right ventricle repair and coronary artery bypass grafting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patient case data was extracted from hospital records.
RESULTS: The patient was the case of a 60-year-old man with a double-chambered right ventricle and three-vessel coronary artery disease. He underwent concomitant surgery comprising double-chambered right ventricle repair and coronary artery bypass grafting. Achieving cardiac arrest allowed us to obtain a good surgical view of the heavy and severely hypertrophied heart. Postoperative computed tomography revealed a feasible running course of the sequential graft, indicating that the path of the sequential graft should be clockwise (aorto-right coronary-left circumflex artery) in this unusual anatomical condition.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We report this rare disease combination and highlight the need for careful preoperative planning in such cases.
