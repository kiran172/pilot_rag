Title: Outcome of Transanal Endorectal Pull-Through in Patients with Hirschsprung's Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) has become one of the preferred treatments for Hirschsprung's disease (HD) in our setting. This report aims to evaluate the current outcome of TERPT in the setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 71 children who had TERPT for histologically-confirmed HD in 11 years (2006-2017) in Nigeria.
RESULTS: There were 48 boys and 23 girls; aged 3 days-12 years at initial presentation (median = 10 months). Three (4.2%) patients had associated anomalies (duodenal atresia; anorectal malformation and sensorineural deafness with hypopigmented skin patches each). Age at TERPT was 2 months to 15 years (median = 3 years), with surgery waiting time of 1 month-14.9 years (median = 18 months). Sixty-six (93.0%) patients had rectosigmoid, four (5.6%) patients had long segment and one (1.4%) had total colonic disease. Five (7.0%) patients with large megacolon and one (1.4%) with the total colonic disease had assisted abdominal resection of the colon at TERPT. Seventeen (23.9%) patients had post-operative complications, including post-operative enterocolitis 8 (11.3%); anastomotic dehiscence 3 (4.2%); retained aganglionic segment 2 (2.8%); anastomotic stenosis 2 (2.8%), resulting in prolonged hospital stay (P = 0.0001; range = 1-30 days; median = 5 days). The mortality rate was 4.2% (3) from malignant hyperthermia in one patient and in 2 patients, the cause of mortality was unclear. Patients were followed up for 3-6 years (median = 3.5 years). Bowel movement stabilised to 2-4 times daily by 6 weeks after surgery.
CONCLUSION: TERPT is a safe treatment for HD in this setting with good short-term outcomes. Longer follow-up is necessary to further evaluate the long-term bowel movement outcomes.!
