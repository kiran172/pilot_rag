Title: Acute ischemia secondary to popliteal artery stent fracture and embolization.

Abstract: Femoropopliteal disease comprises more than one half of lesions in peripheral vascular disease. The treatment modalities for stenosis or occlusion of this anatomic region include femoropopliteal bypass and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with or without stenting. Our patient developed acute leg ischemia 3 years after stenting, secondary to stent fracture, with distal embolization of stent fragments. Using mechanical thromboembolectomy and superficial femoral artery to below-the-knee popliteal in situ saphenous vein bypass, we were able to restore perfusion to the limb and retrieve fragments of the fractured stent.
