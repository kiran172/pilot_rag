Title: NF-κB p65-dependent transcriptional regulation of histone deacetylase 2 contributes to the chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain via the microRNA-183/TXNIP/NLRP3 axis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is related to the sustained activation of neuroglial cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal dorsal horn. However, the clinical efficacy of currently available treatments is very limited. The transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a ubiquitously expressed protein family and considered to be crucial in autoimmunity. Thus, our study aimed to examine the influence of NF-κB p65 in chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain as well as its underlying mechanism.
METHODS: A rat model of neuropathic pain was established by CCI induction followed by isolation of microglial cells. The binding of NF-κB p65 to HDAC2, of miR-183 to TXNIP, and of TXNIP to NLRP3 was investigated. Expression of miR-183, NF-κB p65, HDAC2, TXNIP, and NLRP3 was determined with their functions in CCI rats and microglial cells analyzed by gain- and loss-of-function experiments.
RESULTS: NF-κB p65 and HDAC2 were upregulated while miR-183 was downregulated in the dorsal horn of the CCI rat spinal cord. NF-κB p65 was bound to the HDAC2 promoter and then increased its expression. HDAC2 reduced miR-183 expression by deacetylation of histone H4. Additionally, miR-183 negatively regulated TXNIP. Mechanistically, NF-κB p65 downregulated the miR-183 expression via the upregulation of HDAC2 and further induced inflammatory response by activating the TXNIP-NLRP3 inflammasome axis, thus aggravating the neuropathic pain in CCI rats and microglial cells.
CONCLUSION: These results revealed a novel transcriptional mechanism of interplay between NF-κB and HDAC2 focusing on neuropathic pain via the miR-183/TXNIP/NLRP3 axis.
