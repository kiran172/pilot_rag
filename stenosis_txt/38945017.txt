Title: Bowel pseudo-obstruction caused by goblet cell adenocarcinoma of the appendix: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Goblet cell adenocarcinoma of the appendix is a rare diagnosis with features of both adenocarcinomas and carcinoid tumors. Commonly presenting with chronic abdominal pain, appendicitis, or abdominal distention, it can also be incidentally discovered during appendectomies.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old man with right lower abdominal pain was admitted to our hospital, which is a critical care center. A computed tomography(CT) scan showed ileal narrowing, but endoscopy found no strictures. He was admitted with suspected bowel obstruction and improved with an ileal tube. Laparoscopic surgery revealed a tumor of the appendix. Histologically, he was diagnosed goblet cell adenocarcinoma, suggesting tumor infiltration of nerve fibers impairing peristalsis.
DISCUSSION: Goblet cell adenocarcinoma of the appendix has unique histology and a poor prognosis. Treatment typically involves surgery and chemotherapy. This case highlights challenges in preoperative diagnosis, with the tumor causing bowel pseudo-obstruction by invading the intestinal wall and nerve plexus. Extensive infiltration of Auerbach's plexus was observed, consistent with the length of intestinal stenosis.
CONCLUSION: This case describes goblet cell adenocarcinoma of the appendix leading to bowel pseudo-obstruction due to ileal end stenosis. It emphasizes the importance of considering this diagnosis in cases of bowel obstruction without an obvious mass.
