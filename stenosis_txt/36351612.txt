Title: Successful Repair of the Quadricuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: Quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is rare. Aortic valve replacement is the most frequent treatment for those patients with severe regurgitation or stenosis of the QAV. However, as our comprehension of the aortic valve grows, to repair a dysfunctional QAV becomes more and more feasible. We present a case of successful repair of the QAV using the surgical strategy of bicuspidization.
