Title: The Ross/Ross-Konno procedure in infancy is a safe and durable solution for aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize early and midterm outcomes after the Ross/Ross-Konno procedure performed in infancy for severe aortic valve disease.
METHODS: Between January 1995 and December 2018, 35 infants younger than 1 year (13 neonates) underwent a Ross/Ross-Konno procedure. Patients were followed up to a median of 4.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.6-9.5). Primary outcome measures were survival, early morbidity, freedom from reintervention and long-term functional and echocardiographic status.
RESULTS: Median age at operation was 49 days (IQR, 17-135) and weight was 4 kg (IQR, 3.4-5.2). Thirty-one (89%) had undergone a previous procedure, including balloon valvuloplasty in 26 (74%). Thirty (86%) required annular enlargement (Konno incision). Five required concomitant aortic arch surgery (2 neonates, 3 infants). There were no early deaths, and 1 late death at 18 months. Freedom from reoperation was 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68%-93%) at 1 year, 76% (95% CI, 54%-88%) at 5 years, and 62% (95% CI, 36%-79%) at 10 years. One modified Konno was performed at 5 years after a Ross in infancy. Ten right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits have required reintervention (2 percutaneous pulmonary valve implantations). One child required a permanent pacemaker for complete heart block. At latest follow-up, 32 (94%) of 34 survivors were asymptomatic. There was no significant change in neoaortic Z-scores between 6 weeks and latest follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The neonatal and infant Ross/Ross-Konno procedure can be performed with low mortality and achieves a stable left ventricular outflow tract. Significant early morbidity reflects the preoperative condition of the patients but definitive surgery of this type can be considered as a primary approach.
