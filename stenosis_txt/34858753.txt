Title: "Asymptomatic" Subclavian Steal Syndrome.

Abstract: The definition of subclavian steal is subclavian artery occlusion or hemodynamically significant stenosis proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery that results in lower pressure in the distal subclavian artery. Although subclavian steal can often remain asymptomatic, if ignored, it can cause syncope or neurological deficits. Detailed routine evaluation of blood pressure and careful physical examination, simultaneously on both sides of patients at high vascular risk (such as those with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes), can assist in the early detection. Herein, we report the case of an 82-year-old male patient with steal syndrome, who had no subjective symptoms despite severe stenosis of the subclavian artery, with a marked left-right difference in blood pressure.
