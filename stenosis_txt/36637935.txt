Title: Case series: Montgomery T-tube placement for subglottic tracheal stenosis: a report of 3 cases.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Subglottic tracheal stenosis is stenosis of the trachea between the vocal cords and the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage. The Montgomery T-tube is used as a tracheostomy tube and a combined tracheal stent to avoid postoperative tracheal stenosis.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Because the stenosis is close to the glottis, surgical treatment is complex, and many complications may arise.
DIAGNOSES: Subglottic tracheal stenosis.
INTERVENTIONS: The patients underwent endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy because of acute pancreatitis, laryngeal malignancy, or cerebral hemorrhage after endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy and presented with varying degrees of tracheal stenosis and dyspnea. We relieved airway stenosis and improved dyspnea in these 3 patients by placing a Montgomery T-tube.
OUTCOMES: None of the 3 patients had intraoperative complications. In 2 of the cases, airway secretions were stored after surgery.
LESSONS: Montgomery T-tube placement is safe and effective for patients with complex subglottic tracheal stenosis.
