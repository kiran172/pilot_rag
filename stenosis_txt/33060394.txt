Title: Posterior glottic stenosis: management and outcomes.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pediatric posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) is a challenging clinical entity with multiple treatment options. This review describes the evaluation of patients with PGS and discusses existing surgical techniques.
RECENT FINDINGS: PGS secondary to a distinct scar band between the vocal folds can often be effectively managed with endoscopic division and surveillance. More advanced glottic scarring that also involves the interarytenoid mucosa, cricoarytenoid joints, or subglottis merits a more thorough investigation and repair. A postcricoid mucosal advancement flap can be employed in select adolescent or adult PGS, but long-term cricoarytenoid joint mobility is difficult to restore once it has been fixed. Younger pediatric patients have smaller airways and frequent concurrent subglottic stenosis which is better addressed with cartilage grafting.
SUMMARY: Surgical success in pediatric PGS depends on careful preoperative airway assessment and the accurate characterization of airway stenosis. A surgical technique should be chosen based on the severity and extent of stenosis.
