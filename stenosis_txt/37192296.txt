Title: Influence of Obesity on Coronary Artery Disease and Clinical Outcomes in the ADVANCE Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The relationship between body size and cardiovascular events is complex. This study utilized the ADVANCE (Assessing Diagnostic Value of Noninvasive FFR<sub>CT</sub> in Coronary Care) Registry to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI), coronary artery disease (CAD), and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: The ADVANCE registry enrolled patients undergoing evaluation for clinically suspected CAD who had &gt;30% stenosis on cardiac computed tomography angiography. Patients were stratified by BMI: normal &lt;25 kg/m2, overweight 25-29.9 kg/m2, and obese â‰¥30 kg/m2. Baseline characteristics, cardiac computed tomography angiography and computed tomography fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>), were compared across BMI groups. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association between BMI and outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 5014 patients, 2166 (43.2%) had a normal BMI, 1883 (37.6%) were overweight, and 965 (19.2%) were obese. Patients with obesity were younger and more likely to have comorbidities, including diabetes and hypertension (all P&lt;0.001), but were less likely to have obstructive coronary stenosis (65.2% obese, 72.2% overweight, and 73.2% normal BMI; P&lt;0.001). However, the rate of hemodynamic significance, as indicated by a positive FFR<sub>CT</sub>, was similar across BMI categories (63.4% obese, 66.1% overweight, and 67.8% normal BMI; P=0.07). Additionally, patients with obesity had a lower coronary volume-to-myocardial mass ratio compared with patients who were overweight or had normal BMI (obese BMI, 23.7; overweight BMI, 24.8; and normal BMI, 26.3; P&lt;0.001). After adjustment, the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events was similar regardless of BMI (all P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obesity in the ADVANCE registry were less likely to have anatomically obstructive CAD by cardiac computed tomography angiography but had a similar degree of physiologically significant CAD by FFR<sub>CT</sub> and similar rates of adverse events. An exclusively anatomic assessment of CAD in patients with obesity may underestimate the burden of physiologically significant disease that is potentially due to a significantly lower volume-to-myocardial mass ratio.
