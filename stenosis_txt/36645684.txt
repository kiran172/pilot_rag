Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a patient with mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Aortic valve stenosis occurs in about 3% of people over 65. It is the most important heart valve disease in developed countries. Pathogenesis includes processes similar to those in atherosclerosis, including lipid accumulation, inflammation and calcification.
A CASE REPORT: In this study, we describe the case transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a 73-year-old patient after mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair 15 years ago.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an effective method of surgical treatment of elderly patients with aortic stenosis with a high risk of mortality in traditional surgical correction of defects. This type of treatment can be widely used in repeated interventions, where there is an adhesion process, technical complexity and a significant risk of complications. This method of treatment minimizes side effects and shortens the patient's rehabilitation period.
