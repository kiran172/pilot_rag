Title: Angioplasty, stenting, or both - rescue maneuvers and reperfusion after endovascular therapy for intracranial atherosclerosis-related occlusion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Data concerning reperfusion strategies of intracranial atherosclerosis-related occlusion (ICARO) and clinico-angiographic outcomes remain scarce, particularly in Caucasians. We aim to compare the reperfusion rate and functional outcome between reperfusion strategies in the setting of the ICARO.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) registries at three high-volume stroke centers were retrospectively analyzed for consecutive ICARO patients from January 2015 to December 2019. We defined ICARO as any fixed high-degree (> 70%) focal narrowing or stenosis of any degree with a perpetual tendency for reocclusion. We categorized reperfusion strategies into four groups: EVT [group 1], balloon angioplasty [(BAp), group 2], placement of self-expandable stents [(SES), group 3], and BAp combined with implantation of SES; or direct placement of balloon mounted stents (BMS) [(BAp-SES/BMS), group 4]. We evaluated the association with the successful reperfusion [mTICI 2b - 3] and favorable outcome [mRS 0-2] with logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Out of 2550 EVT, 124 patients (median age, 70 (61-80) years; 76 men) with ICARO and 130 reperfusion attempts [36 EVT, 38 BAp, 17 SES, and 39 BAp + SES/BMS] were analyzed. SES implantation showed the highest frequency of post-procedural symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [(18%, 3/17), p = .03]; however, we observed no significant differences in the mortality rate. Overall, we achieved successful reperfusion in 71% (92/130) and favorable outcomes in 42% (52/124) of the patients. BAp + SES/BMS was the only independent predictor of the final successful reperfusion [aOR, 4.488 (95% CI, 1.364-14.773); p = .01], which was significantly associated with the 90-day favorable outcome [aOR, 10.837 (95% CI, 3.609-32.541); p =  < .001] after adjustment for confounding variables between the reperfusion strategies.
CONCLUSION: Among patients with ICARO, the rescue angioplasty stenting effectively contributed to higher odds of successful reperfusion with no increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage.
