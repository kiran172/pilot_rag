Title: Leaflet modification or chimney stenting in patients at risk for coronary artery obstruction in valve-in-valve procedure for a failed surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve.

Abstract: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (VIV-TAVR) for a degenerated surgical aortic bioprosthesis is a well-established treatment modality but carries an increased risk of coronary artery obstruction (CAO) with potentially catastrophic consequences. Both chimney stenting and leaflet modification by BASILICA (Bioprosthetic or Native Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to Prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Obstruction) are increasingly employed and can be highly effective means of preventing CAO. Using a case report, in which both strategies were utilized, as a platform for detailed discussion, we address the indications, contraindications, and relative merits of each technique in the prevention of CAO.
