Title: Common Consequences of Uncommon Congenital Heart Disease: Exploring the Trilogy of Fallot With Infective Endocarditis and Cerebral Venous Thrombosis.

Abstract: Trilogy of Fallot (ToF) is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by a combination of atrial septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy. It is more common in females and can cause symptoms such as cyanosis and breathlessness. ToF can lead to complications like thromboembolic events, including infective endocarditis (IE) and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). This case study discusses a nine-year-old female with ToF who also had IE and CVT. The patient recovered well following treatment with intravenous beta-lactam and aminoglycoside for IE and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin for CVT.
