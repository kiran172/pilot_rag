Title: Utility of the web excision with pre-membranous incision for congenital intestinal atresia-type I and stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study analyzed the efficacy of web excision combined with a pre-membranous incision on the dilated proximal segment for congenital intestinal atresia with type I and stenosis (CIA-I/S).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients underwent surgery for CIA-I/S from January 1990 to June 2022. Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the surgical procedure: Group A, web excision with pre-membranous incision of the dilated intestine (n = 14); Group B, enteroplasty with a trans-membranous vertical incision (n = 7) and Group C, diamond-shaped anastomosis (n = 5). To minimize the impact of obstruction location on outcomes, we specifically examined 17 cases of duodenal atresia/stenosis: Group D-A, (n = 6); Group D-B, (n = 6) and Group D-C, (n = 5). We retrospectively compared the operative and postoperative parameters among the three groups.
RESULTS: No patient experienced anastomotic leakage or obstruction. There were no significant differences in operative duration or blood loss among the 3 Groups. The median time to feeding initiation was 4, 6.5, and 5 days in Groups A, B, and C, respectively (p = 0.04) and was 4, 6.5, and 5 days in Groups D-A, D-B, and D-C, respectively (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Web excision, when compared to enteroplasty and diamond-shaped anastomosis, showed comparable results in terms of the operative duration and postoperative complications. However, it may allow for an earlier initiation of enteral nutrition.
