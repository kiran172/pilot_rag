Title: Pacemaker lead-induced tricuspid stenosis treated with percutaneous valvotomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tricuspid stenosis is an uncommon complication of ventricular pacemaker electrode implantation, with few cases reported in the literature.
CASE: We present an 18-year-old male who developed severe tricuspid stenosis 15 years after endocardial VVI pacemaker implantation for complete AV block following a surgically repaired ventricular septal defect.
CONCLUSION: In this case we have shown that percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty was performed and successful in treating this complication.
