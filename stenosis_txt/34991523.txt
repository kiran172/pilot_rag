Title: Predictors of preoperative cognitive dysfunction in adults with Moyamoya disease: a preliminary research.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore potential risk factors of preoperative cognitive dysfunction in adult patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) and discuss significance of moyamoya vessels.
METHODS: The author reviewed adult MMD patients harboring no parenchymal infarction or hemorrhage underwent a standardized neuropsychological assessment test battery from December 2018 to May 2019. The authors defined patients with cognitive dysfunction as cognitive impairment shown on 3 or more neuropsychological tests. According to the presence of cerebral angiography, arterial stenosis, moyamoya vessels, and compensatory arteries were conducted. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors for cognitive dysfunction before surgery. Subgroup analyses by onset type and Suzuki stage were carried out to identify specific predictors for preoperative cognitive dysfunction.
RESULTS: In total, 29 of 92 (31.52%) patients had cognitive dysfunction. Multivariate analysis showed that moyamoya vessels generating from left hemisphere was recognized as independent predictor for cognitive dysfunction (P = 0.025, OR [95%CI], 0.085 [0.012-0.874]). For patients in left ICA-moyamoya subgroup, 19 of 45 (42.22%) cases with sparse moyamoya vessels had cognitive dysfunction (P = 0.031), while 22 (91.67%) of patients with dense moyamoya vessels had normal cognition (P = 0.004). Moyamoya vessels arising from ophthalmic artery had no significant association with cognitive dysfunction (P = 0.111). Multivariate analysis found that moyamoya vessels originating from left ICA was recognized as independent predictors for preoperative cognitive dysfunction (P = 0.048, OR [95%CI], 0.394 [0.132-0.926]).
CONCLUSIONS: Moyamoya vessels arising from left hemisphere was a risk factor for the preoperative cognitive dysfunction in adult patients with MMD, with the denser moyamoya vessels, the less cognitive dysfunction. The current study offers a new perspective of moyamoya vessels and supporting data for choosing MMD candidates on cerebral revascularization.
