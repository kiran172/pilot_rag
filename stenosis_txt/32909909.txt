Title: Two-Point Fixation Technique in Retrosternal Midcolon Interposition for Corrosive Stricture of Esophagus-Our Experience With 25 Patients.

Abstract: Background. In 1911, Vuillet and Kelling independently described the anatomical and surgical bases of esophageal replacement with the colon. An important complication, in particular in later follow-up, is redundancy of the interposed colon, seen more after retrosternal interposition. The best treatment is prevention by a meticulous surgical technique and measurement of the length of the colon needed to replace the esophagus. Methods. This was a retrospective study of innovative surgical technique. A total of 25 patients with corrosive stricture of the esophagus undergoing two-point fixation in retrosternal colon interposition were included in the study. Preventive Operative Technique. After straightening of conduit by pulling very delicately over both sides, first fixation point we considered cervical anastomoses and second fixation point was made in subxiphoid space, taking two seromuscular stiches from the antimesenteric border of the colon to falciform ligament situated on the right side of the conduit. Results. There were 07 male and 18 female patients with M:F was 1:2.5; mean age was 29 years (range: 23-45 years) and mean hospital stay was 14 days (range: 10-23 days). In this study, we did not encounter any subjective or objective evidence of redundancy in any patients in follow-up barium swallow after 2.5 years of follow-up. Conclusion. Our Two-point fixation technique is refinement of already performed and tried fixation techniques to prevent redundancy of the colon conduit considering kinetics, anatomical alignment, and pathology.
