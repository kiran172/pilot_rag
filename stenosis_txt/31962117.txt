Title: Feasibility and Accuracy of Aortic Valve Calcium Quantification on Computed Tomographic Angiography in Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Traditionally, quantification of aortic valve calcium (AVC) has been performed with noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) using the Agatston method. This study sought to derive and validate a systematic method enabling AVC quantification using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: The study included 134 consecutive patients with AS who underwent both NCCT and CTA and were subdivided into derivation (n = 71) and validation cohorts (n = 63). AVC on NCCT (AVC<sub>NCCT</sub>) was quantified using the Agatston method using the software developed for semiautomatic assessment of coronary calcium. On CTA, the mean contrast attenuation of the aorta in Hounsfield units (Aorta<sub>HU</sub>) and SD was measured in the region of interest at the level of the sinotubular junction.
RESULTS: Using an adjusted calcium detection threshold of Aorta<sub>HU</sub> + 2 SD, we calculated AVC on CTA (AVC<sub>CTA</sub>) using the same software without modifying other variables. Correlation between AVC<sub>NCCT</sub> and AVC<sub>CTA</sub> in the derivation cohort was excellent (r = 0.9679; P &lt; .001). We used a linear regression model to derive a formula for predicting AVC<sub>CTA</sub> that enabled conversion of AVC<sub>CTA</sub> to AVC<sub>Derived</sub> (AVC<sub>Derived</sub> = 1.821 × AVC<sub>CTA</sub>). Applying this formula in validation cohort, we calculated AVC<sub>Derived</sub>, which showed excellent agreement with AVC<sub>NCCT</sub> (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.9648; 95% confidence interval, 0.9427-0.9782). Excellent correlation was also found between categorized AVC<sub>NCCT</sub> and AVC<sub>Derived</sub> scores (κ = 0.9044; 95% confidence interval, 0.7989-1.0000), with 95.24% (60 of 63) of scores falling within the same severity category.
CONCLUSIONS: AVC quantification on CTA is feasible with high accuracy and reliability and shows excellent agreement with the standard AVC<sub>NCCT</sub> score. With the systematic approach using "dynamic thresholds" being largely independent of the scan acquisition protocol, AVC<sub>Derived</sub> can potentially replace AVC<sub>NCCT</sub>, eliminating the need for separate NCCT acquisition solely for AVC quantification.
