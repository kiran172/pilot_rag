Title: Three-Month Outcome of Carotid Artery Stenting in Patients with/without Coexistent Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Safety of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients having carotid stenosis with coexistent unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is rarely reported. Thus, we studied the 3-month outcome of CAS in the presence of coexistent UIAs in our institution.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients receiving CAS at our institution from September 2011 to December 2019 was carried out. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: group of CAS with UIAs (CAS-UIA) and group of CAS without UIAs (CAS). The main complications within 3 months after stenting were TIA, ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), rupture of UIAs, and death. The baseline characteristics and complications of the 2 groups were compared.
RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-six patients (CAS, n = 468; CAS-UIA, n = 88) were included and 604 stenting procedures were performed. More patients had hypertension in the CAS-UIA group (87.5 vs. 73.7%, p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in TIAs, ischemic stroke, sICH, and death within 3 months after stenting between the CAS and CAS-UIA groups. None of the 113 coexistent UIAs detected in 88 patients had aneurysm rupture within 3 months after CAS.
CONCLUSIONS: In our large cohort of CAS patients, coexistent UIAs are not uncommon. Stenting of a carotid artery in the presence of coexistent UIAs could be conducted safely. Together with 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy, CAS did not increase the rupture risk of the coexistent UIAs within 3 months.
