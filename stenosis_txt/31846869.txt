Title: Case report of an arteriovenous graft for renal dialysis, with multiple complications treated successfully over 5 years.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Arteriovenous grafts (AVG) is a good alternative when native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is not possible. However, complications are higher and close surveillance is required for successful salvage intervention.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of a 35â€¯year old man with a history of a successful Brachio-Axillary AVG performed in his right arm in 2012. He had a background of multiple previous failed attempts of a native AVF formation. He presented in 2014 with symptoms consistent with AVF stenosis. He underwent a successful fistuloplasty and 2 stent insertion. In June 2015 he presented again with re-stenosis and successful fistuloplasty was performed with balloon dilatation. In October 2015 he presented with AVF thrombosis. This was treated with fistuloplasty and thrombolysis. He presented again in August 2016 with a recurrent thrombosis in his AVG and this was again treated with a successful fistuloplasty and thrombolysis on two separate occasions. He then presented in September 2016 with re-stenosis. This was treated with fistuloplasty and 2 stent insertion. He underwent a successful renal transplant during this time and presented again with a sinus discharge in February 2019 when the plan was made for subtotal graft excision.
CONCLUSION: Incidence of complications is higher when a graft is used over a native AVF. However, close surveillance and prompt intervention can lead to multiple successful salvage procedures thus prolonging the lifespan of the graft. As in our case we were able to prolong the lifespan of the AVG with multiple successful interventions.
