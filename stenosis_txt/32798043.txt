Title: Late Adverse Cardiorenal Events of Catheter Procedure-Related Acute Kidney Injury After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Data regarding the longitudinal effect of catheter procedure-related acute kidney injury (AKI) on clinical outcomes are limited. This study aimed to assess the late adverse cardiorenal events of AKI following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). A total of 2,518 patients who underwent TAVI, excluding in-hospital deaths, were enrolled from the Japanese multicenter registry. The definition of AKI was determined using the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The incidence, predictors, major adverse renal and cardiac events (MARCE), and all-cause mortality of AKI were evaluated. MARCE included readmission for renal and heart failure (HF), hemodialysis requirement, and cardiovascular-renal death during the follow-up period. The incidence of AKI was 9.7% in the entire cohort. The significant predictive factors of AKI were men, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, low albumin, overdose of contrast media, nontransfemoral approach, transfusion, vascular complications, and new pacemaker implantation. The rates of HF readmission and future hemodialysis were significantly higher in patients with AKI than in those without AKI (19.7% vs 9.0%, p <0.001, 3.3% vs 0.4%, p <0.001, respectively). Cox regression multivariate analysis showed that AKI occurrence was an independent predictive factor for the incremental risk of both MARCE and late mortality up to 4 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 1.20, p <0.001, HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.79; p <0.001, respectively). In conclusion, AKI occurrence was significantly associated with late adverse cardiorenal events after TAVI. Adequate clinical management can be expected to reduce AKI-related late phase cardiorenal damage even after successful TAVI.
