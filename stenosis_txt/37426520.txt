Title: Etiologies and Patterns of Valvular Heart Disease Among Cardiac Patients at the Cardiac Center of Ethiopia During February 2000 to April 2022.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The leading global contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is valvular heart disease. It is on the rise worldwide, including in the developing countries. However, the prevalence, patterns, and etiologies of valvular heart disease have not been well studied in Ethiopia. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, patterns, and etiologies of valvular heart disease at the Cardiac Center of Ethiopia from February 2000 to April 2022.
METHODS: This institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2000 and April 2022. Data from three thousand two hundred fifty-seven VHD were extracted from the electronic medical records and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Descriptive statistics, such as the frequency, mean Â± standard deviation, and cross tabulations, were used to summarize the data.
RESULTS: Of 10,588 total cardiac cases registered and treated at the Cardiac Centre of Ethiopia from February 2000 to April 2022, 30.8% (3257) were diagnosed with VHD. The most typical diagnosis for VHD was multi-valvular involvement, which accounted for 49.5% of cases (1612), followed by pulmonary stenosis (15%) and mitral regurgitation (14.3%). Females were more likely to develop valve diseases than males, being at the highest risk for each identified etiology of valve disease 1928 (59.2%). The majority percentages of the population affected by VHD were between 18 and 44 age category 1473 (45.2%). The most common etiology of VHD was rheumatic 2015 (61.87%), followed by congenital origin 828 (25.42%).
CONCLUSION: VHD affects nearly one-third of all cardiac cases admitted to the hospital. Multi-valvular involvement is the most commonly diagnosed form of VHD. Rheumatic causes were more prevalent in this study. As found in this study, VHD affects a significant percentage of the population, which in turn could have an impact on the country's economy and deserve attention as a possible means of intervention.
