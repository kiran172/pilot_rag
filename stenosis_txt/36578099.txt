Title: Severe colitis in patients with melanoma treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dual blockade of BRAF and MEK kinases is a standard of care for metastatic V600E/K BRAF mutant melanoma. This study reports the first systematic description of colitis due to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.
METHODS: We studied consecutive patients with melanoma, treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors, who had colitis requiring hospitalisation. Electronic files were studied; endoscopic biopsies and colectomy specimens were read centrally.
RESULTS: Between January 2021 and March 2022, nine women and one man, aged 50-90â€‰years, were studied. Nine patients received encorafenib and binimetinib; one patient received dabrafenib and trametinib. The main symptoms were diarrhoea, haematochezia, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction. Blood tests showed anaemia, increased CRP and low serum albumin levels in most patients. All patients had ulcerations of the right colon with (2/10) or without (8/10) stenosis of the ileocecal valve, and 4/10 patients also had ulcerations distal to the right colon. Histopathological findings were suggestive of ischaemia and mild inflammation. Nine of the 10 patients discontinued BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Drugs were reintroduced in four patients, three of whom had a severe relapse of diarrhoea. Two patients required surgery and underwent intestinal resection. One patient died of enterocolitis.
CONCLUSION: BRAF/MEK inhibitors can induce severe colitis characterised by ulcerations of the right colon.
