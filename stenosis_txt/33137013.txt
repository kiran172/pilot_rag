Title: Does Fixation of Gastric Sleeve Prevent Functional Stenosis in Sleeve Gastrectomy Patients?

Abstract: AIM: The aim of this study is to determine whether gastric sleeve fixation prevents functional stenosis (twist or kink) and to investigate its effects on symptoms such as nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).
METHODS: A total of 717 patients who underwent primary LSG for morbid obesity and completed at least 1 year of follow-up between 2012 and 2019 were included in the study. All operations were performed by the same surgical team using the same technique. The patients were divided into 2 groups, that is, group 1: standard LSG and group 2: gastric sleeve fixation with LSG. These 2 groups were compared in terms of demographic characteristics, baseline body mass index, follow-up duration, bleeding, leaks, gastric stenosis, postoperative nausea, vomiting, and the need for antiemetics. In the follow-up period, patients with suspected gastric stenosis underwent endoscopy and upper gastrointestinal series.
RESULTS: LSG was performed in 717 patients (55.2% female) with a mean age of 37.8±11.5 years and a median body mass index of 42.2 (30.2 to 74.2) kg/m2. The 241 patients in the first group underwent LSG without fixation, and the 476 patients in the second group with fixation. Functional stenosis was detected in 8 patients, all of whom were in group 1. One patient in group 1 had a leak on the background of functional stenosis. There was bleeding that required transfusion in 2 patients (group 1) and reoperation in 2 patients (group 2). None of the study patients died. During the in-hospital period, 122 (50.6%) patients in group 1 and 159 (33.4%) patients in group 2 had nausea and vomiting that required antiemetic treatment (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Gastric sleeve fixation in LSG prevents complications that may arise because of improper gastric mobilization. This method is effective in reducing nausea and vomiting in LSG patients.
