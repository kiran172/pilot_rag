Title: Clinical and Electrocardiographic Findings for Predicting the Severity of Pulmonary Valve Stenosis in Dogs.

Abstract: Pulmonary valve stenosis (PS) in dogs is usually suspected due to the presence of a heart murmur and clinical signs. Echocardiography is needed to confirm the diagnosis and define the severity of PS. This retrospective study evaluated the utility of clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in the prediction of PS severity. Data regarding heart murmur and ECG analysis were gathered. Ninety-seven dogs with PS were included. A murmur grade ≥IV/VI was predictive of severe PS (area under curve (AUC) = 0.71; sensitivity (Se) = 95%; specificity (Sp) = 33%; p = 0.003). In lead II, P wave amplitude &gt;0.35 mV (AUC = 0.67; Se = 31%; Sp = 100%; p = 0.038), Q wave &lt; 0.15 mV (AUC = 0.70; Se = 70%; Sp = 59%; p = 0.0015), R wave &lt; 0.87 mV (AUC = 0.66; Se = 67%; Sp = 69%; p = 0.006), and S wave &gt; 0.37 mV (AUC = 0.80; Se = 72%; Sp = 85%; p &lt; 0.0001) were predictive of severe PS. The extent of right deviation of the mean electrical axis of the QRS complex was correlated with the pulmonary pressure gradient (r = 0.648; p &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, a systolic murmur with intensity ≥IV/VI, a P wave amplitude &gt;0.35 mV, low amplitude of Q and R waves, deep S waves in lead II, and right axis deviation of the QRS complex in a young dog are predictive of severe PS.
