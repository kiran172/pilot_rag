Title: Treatment of Intracranial Pseudoaneurysms With a Novel Covered Stent: A Series of 19 Patients With Midterm Follow-Up.

Abstract: Background: The optimal treatment for intracranial pseudoaneurysm is unclear. This study aims to analyze the outcome of treating intracranial pseudoaneurysm with a novel covered stent. Materials and Methods: The institutional imaging and clinical databases were retrospectively reviewed for patients with intracranial pseudoaneurysms treated with Willis covered stent from January 2017 to December 2019. The clinical presentations, etiology, intraoperative complications, and immediate and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 19 patients with 20 pseudoaneurysms were enrolled for analysis. Seventeen patients presented with vision loss and two with epistaxis. Nineteen Willis covered stents were used with one for each patient without technical failure. Intraoperative thrombosis was encountered in one patient (5.3%), which was recanalized by tirofiban. During clinical follow-up, no further epistaxis occurred, and visual acuity improved in three (17.6%) patients. Endoleak occurred in seven (36.8%) patients after the initial balloon inflation and persisted in one (5.3%) patient after balloon re-inflation. This endoleak disappeared at 8 month follow-up. Finally, during angiographic follow-up (median 13 months), parent artery occlusion and in-stent stenosis occurred in one (5.3%) patient. No stent-related ischemic event was encountered. Conclusions: The Willis covered stent is feasible, safe, and efficient in treating intracranial pseudoaneurysms.
