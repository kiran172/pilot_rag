Title: Claviculotracheopexy for complex airway reconstructions.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Revision surgery for correcting benign laryngotracheal stenosis is challenging and it gets complicated in patients with comorbidities. To improve results in such cases, we describe a new technique of stabilizing the trachea by splinting it to the clavicle on both sides.
METHODS: Retrospective case series.
RESULTS: Three patients received claviculotracheopexy to maintain their tracheal static. The surgery offers an immediate and optimal support to an unstable trachea.
CONCLUSION: Claviculotracheopexy can be used as a complementary procedure in complex airway reconstructions.
