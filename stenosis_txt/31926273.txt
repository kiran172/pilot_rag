Title: Endovascular Repair of Carotid Artery Pseudoaneurysm using Transcarotid Artery Revascularization Flow Reversal Technique.

Abstract: Carotid artery aneurysm overall is a rare occurrence with <1% formed after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Several methods of repair have been described including open and endovascular techniques. Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) with stenting using the reverse flow technique has been used in patients with carotid artery stenosis with neck irradiation, previous neck surgeries, or for those who are at high risk for open surgery. We describe a patient with a post-CEA pseudoaneurysm of the extracranial internal carotid artery that was repaired using the TCAR flow reversal approach with coiling of the external carotid artery.
