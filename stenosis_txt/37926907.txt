Title: How I do it: novel use of a modified nasopharyngeal airway in laryngotracheal stenosis as a temporary stent.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This paper reports the innovative use of a modified nasopharyngeal airway device as a temporary stent in patients with laryngotracheal stenosis. It also discusses the technique of endoscopic stent placement, and our experience in terms of the indications and suitability.
METHOD: The nasopharyngeal airway device was modified to use as an airway stent by trimming it to the desired length. Next, the stent was inserted endoscopically and anchored using a novel approach.
RESULTS: The surgery was performed successfully without complications. The patients had full use of their voice while the stent was in situ. No significant granulation tissue was observed.
CONCLUSION: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of using a nasopharyngeal airway device as a temporary stent to prevent restenosis in cases where the patients have a strong demand for phonation. The modified nasopharyngeal airway device is potentially very promising, but cases must be selected carefully to avoid compromising efficacy and safety.
