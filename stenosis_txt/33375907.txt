Title: Carotid-Esophageal Fistula Treated By Endovascular Approach.

Abstract: The carotid-esophageal fistula is a rare and serious complication of the metallic esophageal prosthesis. A high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis and treatment, decreasing the morbidity and mortality rate of this severe complication. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy presenting severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a carotid-esophageal fistula, secondary to deployment of an esophageal metallic prosthesis for treatment of a recurrent stenosis. The carotid pseudo-aneurism was successfully treated with stents and coils. Although endovascular treatment is a safe and effective option, arterial stenting in children needs further studies with long-term follow-up.
