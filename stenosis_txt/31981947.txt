Title: Free cholesterol, cholesterol precursor and plant sterol levels in atherosclerotic plaques are independently associated with symptomatic advanced carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Circulating sterols result either from cholesterol (CH) synthesis or intestinal uptake. They are mainly esterified and can be oxygenated. Sterols accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques whereby their clinical impact is uncertain. Here, we determined associations between circulating and plaque sterol levels in patients with advanced carotid artery stenosis in respect to a prior ischemic event and statin treatment.
METHODS: Free and esterified CH, CH precursors and plant sterols as well as oxysterols were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 63 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
RESULTS: CH, CH precursors, plant sterols and oxysterols accumulated in carotid artery plaques. Absolute circulating sterol levels were not predictive for their corresponding plaque levels. After normalisation to CH, plant sterol but not oxysterol levels correlated between plasma and plaques. Among the circulating sterols, oxysterols occurred proportionally less in plaques. Furthermore, CH and plant sterols were less esterified in plaques than in plasma. Patients who experienced a prior ischemic event (n = 29) and asymptomatic patients had, except for lanosterol, comparable circulating sterol levels. In contrast, the absolute plaque levels of free CH, CH precursors and plant sterols as well as oxysterols were increased in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic patients. These differences remained significant for free CH, precursors and 3 out of 4 analyzed plant sterols after adjustment to the most influencing covariates - statin treatment, type 2 diabetes and age.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased absolute plaque levels of free CH, precursors and plant sterols predict an ischemic event in patients with advanced carotid artery stenosis.
