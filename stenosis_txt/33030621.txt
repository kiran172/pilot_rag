Title: Trans-Radial Approach: technical and clinical outcomes in neurovascular procedures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate efficacy and safety of Trans-Radial Approach (TRA) in cerebral angiography for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose.
METHODS: We retrospectively included consecutive patients eligible for TRA cerebral angiography at our Institution between September 2019 and January 2020. Cerebral DSA was classified in diagnostic (one-vessel imaging) or therapeutic (emergency/elective). Technical and clinical outcome were recorded for each group.
RESULTS: A total of 61 TRA angiographies were evaluated. Right-sided TRA was obtained in 85,2% of all cases. Interventional procedures included 11 strokes, 2 ruptured aneurysms, 2 unrupted aneurysms, 1 DAVF and 3 symptomatic atheromatous intracranial stenosis. Successful TRA angiographies were obtained in 97,6% and 94,7% for diagnostic and therapeutic group, respectively. No major radial artery complications were recorded. Mean puncture-to-final angiogram was 11 and 62 min for diagnostic and therapeutic groups, respectively. Mean radial compression maintenance was 4 h, allowing patients discharge within 6 h in all cases undergone diagnostic angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: TRA could be a valid technique in terms of efficacy and safety both for diagnostic and therapeutic cerebral angiographies, with low complication rate.
