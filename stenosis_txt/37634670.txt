Title: Acute Vertebrobasilar Artery Occlusion with Underlying Atherosclerosis: Balloon Angioplasty Combined with Tirofiban as Initial Salvage Therapy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The optimal rescue endovascular treatment for patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis in acute vertebrobasilar artery occlusion is not well established. We investigated the safety and efficacy of balloon angioplasty combined with tirofiban as the initial rescue strategy in these patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 41 patients admitted between January 2014 and September 2022, with vertebrobasilar artery atherosclerotic occlusion. Balloon angioplasty in combination with tirofiban was used as the first-line salvage therapy after the failure of mechanical thrombectomy. The technical success rate, recanalization outcome, procedure-related complications, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and functional outcome at 90Â days were reviewed.
RESULTS: Recanalization with a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade of 2b-3 was achieved in 38 of the 41 patients (92.7%). Acute stents were deployed in 5 patients who did not achieve successful reperfusion after balloon angioplasty. Six patients (14.6%, 6/41) underwent stent angioplasty in the stable stage for severe residual stenosis detected on follow-up imaging. There was no procedure-related complication. Hemorrhagic transformation was detected on follow-up imaging in 11 patients (26.8%), while no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was recorded. Good functional outcome rate was 31.7% (13/41).
CONCLUSIONS: Balloon angioplasty combined with intravenous tirofiban administration is a safe and effective salvage therapy in patients with acute atherosclerotic occlusion of the vertebrobasilar artery.
