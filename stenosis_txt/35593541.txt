Title: Comparison of 26-mm Evolut and 23-mm Sapien 3 Valves in TAVR for Small Aortic Annulus.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with small aortic annuli (SAA) are prone to higher post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) transvalvular gradients and development of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM). In many patients with SAA, the choice of TAVR valve commonly involves choosing between the 26-mm Medtronic Evolut 2 (ME26) or the 23-mm Edwards Sapien 3 valve (ES23). We compared echocardiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with SAA undergoing TAVR with either valve.
METHODS: We queried the Providence St. Joseph Health Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry database for patients undergoing TAVR with either the ES23 or ME26 between July 2015 and December 2018 at 11 hospitals. Post-TAVR echocardiographic and clinical results in-hospital, at 1 month, and at 1 year were examined. High gradient (HG) was defined as mean gradient (MG) ≥20 mm Hg.
RESULTS: We identified 1162 patients with SAA undergoing TAVR with either the ME26 (n = 233) or ES23 valve (n = 929). Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. At 1 month, the ME26 was associated with a lower MG than the ES23 (7.7 ± 4.7 mm Hg vs 13.1 ± 4.9 mm Hg; P<.001) and moderate or severe PPM (11% and 3% vs 27% and 13%; P<.001). Occurrence of HG at 1 year was lower with the ME26 valve vs the ES23 valve (0% vs 15%; P<.001). In-hospital and follow-up clinical outcomes to 1 year were similar for both groups.
CONCLUSION: TAVR in SAA with the ME26 is associated with lower incidence of HG or PPM compared with the ES23. While clinical outcomes at 1 year were similar, the long-term implications of these findings remain unknown.
