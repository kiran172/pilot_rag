Title: [Anesthetic and Perioperative Management in Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA), Part 1: Anesthetic Procedures].

Abstract: Carotid endarterectomy is a standard procedure in therapy and prevention of ischemic stroke in particular patients. To ensure an optimal anesthetic management, fundamental knowledge of anatomy, pathophysiology and surgical technique is essential. General anesthesia may be considered as well as regional anesthesia in affected patients. This article reviews the cause of extracranial carotid artery stenosis, its surgical and anesthetic treatment as well as perioperative characteristics.
