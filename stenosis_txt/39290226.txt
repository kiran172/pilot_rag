Title: Office-based pediatric urology procedures.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Office-based procedures under local anesthesia are not a popular and well-accepted concept in pediatric urology except for newborn circumcision. There is limited literature on the utilization of office-based procedures under local anesthesia in pediatric urology. In this study, we present our experience of office-based procedures under local anesthesia from a tertiary center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of the patients who underwent meatotomy and penile adhesion release in the clinic under local anesthesia between January 2017 and August 2022 by a single surgeon in a tertiary center. A total of 92 patients were included in this study.
RESULTS: There were 65 patients diagnosed with meatal stenosis and 27 patients diagnosed with penile adhesion. The overall incidence of recurrence was noted in four patients. Only one patient had minimal complications. The overall average follow-up was 5.39 months (1-10 months).
CONCLUSION: Selective office-based procedure (meatotomy and penile adhesion release) under topical local anesthesia is a simple, safe, and effective method to treat such conditions with a high success rate, especially with financial and time constraints on health care nowadays.
