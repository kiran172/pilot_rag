Title: [Clinical outcomes of opening coronary chronic total occlusion lesions with the assistance of BridgePoint devices].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the safety, efficacy and prognosis of antegrade dissection re-entry (ADR) with the assistance of BridgePoint devices in opening coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO). Methods: A total of 87 consecutive patients, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using BridgePoint devices from April 2016 to December 2018 in Xijing Hospital, were included in this study. General information of the selected patients, features of CTO lesions and intraoperative parameters were recorded. Short-term outcomes including technical success rate (defined as achieving TIMI 3 blood flow with residual stenosis&lt;30%), surgical success rate (defined as no major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occured while hospitalized), complications, and MACE during hospitalization were observed. MACE included death, recurrent myocardial infarction, target vascular reconstruction (TVR) and cardiac tamponade. Patients were followed up by outpatient or telephone visits at 30 days and 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after discharge. Results: Eighty-seven patients, aged (61±10) years with J-CTO scores (2.49±0.52) were included, and 75(86%) were male. Six patients underwent direct ADR with BridgePoint system, and all were successful. Eighty-one patients underwent rescue ADR using BridgePoint devices, and 62 of them were successful. The success rate of ADR with BridgePoint devices was 78.2% (68/87). Nine out of the 19 failed cases succeeded after the application of rescue antegrade/retrograde technique. The technical success rate was 88.5% (77/87). Coronary perforation occurred in 2 cases (2.3%), one case was treated with covered stent and the other case with tamponade was treated with pericardiocentesis. One patient developed periprocedural myocardial infarction, and one patient suffered from sudden death, and one patient had cardiac tamponade. In-hospital MACE occurred in 3 (3.4%) patients. The surgical success rate was 85.1% (74/87).The procedure time was (175±72)minutes and the amount of contrast used was (449±155)ml. During a follow-up of 17(11, 26) months, the incidence of MACE within 30 days was 4.7% (4/86), while 10.5% (9/86) within 6 months, 17.4% (15/86) within 17 months. Conclusion: Opening CTO with the assistance of BridgePoint devices is feasible and safe, with high success rate and satisfactory outcome.
