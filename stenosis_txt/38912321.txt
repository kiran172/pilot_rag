Title: Balloon-Expandable Valve for the Treatment of Self-Expanding Valve Failure: The Need for a Tailored Approach.

Abstract: An 82-year-old patient experienced symptomatic intra-prosthetic aortic regurgitation 5 years after self-expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation. Redo-transcatheter aortic valve replacement was initially considered at high risk of coronary obstruction. Using a systematic computed tomography-based approach planning a low implantation with a SAPIEN 3 Ultra THV, we effectively mitigated risks.
