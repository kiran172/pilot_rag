Title: Anastomosis near to the ileocecal valve in neonates with focal intestinal perforation, is it safe.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anastomosis near the ileocecal valve (ICV) are controversial due to the increased pressure on the suture; in this situation, the valve could be removed at a first stage or at the moment of stoma closure. However, preservation of the ICV has proved important benefits in the long term. The aim of this study is to evaluate its feasibility in neonates with focal intestinal perforation (FIP).
METHODS: Retrospective study (2010-2019) of neonates with FIP who underwent intestinal resection and primary anastomosis. Patients were divided into group A (anastomosis less than 5 cm from ICV) and group B (more than 5 cm).
RESULTS: Forty patients were treated. Patients ostomized or with resection of ICV were excluded. Finally, 24 patients (birth weight 1043 ± 594 g (520-3000), age 8.8 ± 7.8 days (2-39)) were included for analysis. Patent ductus arteriosus was present in 75%. There were 6 patients in group A (25%) and 18 in group B (75%). Groups were comparable in terms of gestational age, birth weight, and age at the time of surgery (p &gt; .05). There were no cases of dehiscence nor stenosis of the anastomosis. There were no differences in reoperation rate, infectious complications, time to enteral feeding, days of parenteral nutrition, hospital stay nor survival (p &gt; .05).
CONCLUSION: Ileo-ileal anastomosis closer to the ileocecal junction, in neonates with focal intestinal perforation, is an effective and safe option which also allows the preservation of the ICV avoiding the complications derived from its absence in a group of patients with high morbidity.
