Title: [Debulking strategy of endovascular treatment for lower extremity artery lesions].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the debulking strategy of lower extremity artery lesions. Methods: Retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 101 patients underwent debulking therapy at Department of Vascular Surgery,Zhongshan Hospital,Fudan University from June 2019 to June 2020.There were 74 males and 27 females,aged (73.2±11.7)years (range:35 to 93 years).There were 31 cases in Rutherford class 3,39 cases in class 4 and 31 cases in class 5. Hypertension occurred in 72 patients. One hundred and forty lesions were treated in 101 patients. Among them, there were 13 lesions(9.3%) in iliac artery,72 lesions(51.4%) in superficial femoral artery,41 (29.3%) lesions in popliteal artery,10 lesions(7.1%) in tibiofibular trunk,and 4 lesions(2.9%) in below the knee artery.Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) was mainly used in acute thrombosis,excimer laser ablation (ELA) was mainly used for chronic in-stent restenosis and chronic stenosis or totally occlusive lesions,while directional atherectomy (DA) was mainly used for short calcified lesions. Results: All of the patients underwent debulking therapy. Eighty-two lesions(58.6%,82/140) were treated by PMT, 56 (40.0%,56/140) were treated by ELA,and 2 (1.4%,2/140) were treated by DA.The ankle-brachial index of the patient was 0.44±0.19 before surgery, 0.87±0.17 immediately after surgery (t=-16.26, P&lt;0.01), and 0.81±0.20 at 6 months after surgery(t=-14.67,P&lt;0.01),and 0.79±0.15 (t=-14.12,P&lt;0.01) at 12 months after surgery. At 12 months,the primary patency was 86.1% (87/101),mortality was 5.0% (5/101), freedom from major-amputation survival rate was 93.1% (94/101),and target lesion reintervention rate was 9.9% (10/101). Conclusions: Debulking is feasible and effective to eliminate the arterial contents and maximize the acquisition of lumen.Selection of suitable debulking methods for different segments and lesions would be helpful to improve the technical success and obtain satisfactory results.
