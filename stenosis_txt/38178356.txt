Title: Interventional Bridging Therapy for Radical Cardiac Surgery in a Patient Seemed to be Inoperable Due to Very Poor Left Ventricular Function: A Case Report.

Abstract: Cases that are inoperable owing to poor preoperative conditions are sometimes encountered. However, there are some cases that are led to radical treatment by performing bridge therapy. Here, we presented a case of a patient with complex cardiac disease in an inoperable state who underwent bridging therapy that led to successful surgical treatment. A 73-year-old male who received hemodialysis treatment and had severe aortic valve stenosis and coronary artery disease planned surgical treatment. However, he was deemed inoperable owing to his low cardiac function and hemodynamic instability. Therefore, to escape from a fatal condition, we first performed balloon aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous coronary intervention as palliative procedures. Subsequently, his cardiac function and hemodynamic stability remarkably improved; therefore, after 1 month, we performed a successful radical surgical treatment. Even in inoperable patients, bridging therapy leading to radical treatment is possible.
