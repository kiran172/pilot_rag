Title: Carotid Interventions in Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Narrative Review.

Abstract: Simultaneous carotid artery stenosis (CS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common condition among patients with several cardiovascular risk factors; however, its optimal management still remains under investigation, such as the assumption that carotid disease is causally related to perioperative stroke and that preventive carotid revascularization decrease the risk of this complication. Synchronous surgical approach to both conditions, performing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) before coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) during the same procedure, should still be considered in selective patients, in order to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke during coronary cardiac surgery. For the same purpose, staged approaches, such as CEA followed by CABG or CABG followed by CEA during the same hospitalization or a few weeks later have been described. Hybrid approach with carotid artery stenting (CAS) and CABG can also be an option in selected cases, offering a minimally invasive procedure to treat CS among patients whom CABG cannot be postponed. When carotid intervention is indicated in patients with concomitant CAD requiring CABG, a personalized and tailored approach is mandatory, especially in asymptomatic patients, in order to define the ideal surgical strategy. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current "state of the art" of the different approaches to carotid artery diseases in patients undergoing CABG.
