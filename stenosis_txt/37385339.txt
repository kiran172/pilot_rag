Title: Clinical Outcomes of Common Femoral Thromboendarterectomy with Bovine Pericardium Patch Angioplasty.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of thromboendarterectomy (TEA) for common femoral occlusive disease using bovine pericardium patch angioplasty.
METHODS: The subjects were patients who underwent TEA for common femoral occlusive disease with bovine pericardium patch angioplasty from October 2020 to August 2021. The study had a prospective, multicenter, and observational design. The primary end point was primary patency (freedom from restenosis). The secondary end points were secondary patency, amputation-free survival (AFS), postoperative wound complication, hospital death within 30 days, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 30 days.
RESULTS: Forty-seven TEA procedures with a bovine patch were performed in 42 patients (34 males; median age, 78 years; diabetes mellitus, 57%; end-stage renal disease with hemodialysis, 19%). Clinical presentations were intermittent claudication (68%) and critical limb-threatening ischemia (32%). Sixteen (34%) limbs underwent TEA alone and 31 (66%) underwent a combined procedure. Surgical site infection (SSI) occurred in 4 limbs (9%) and lymphatic fistulas in 3 limbs (6%). One limb with SSI required surgical debridement 19 days after the procedure, and 1 limb (2%) without postoperative wound complications required additional treatment due to acute bleeding. Hospital death within 30 days occurred in 1 case due to panperitonitis. There was no MACE within 30 days. Claudication was improved in all cases. Postoperative ABI of 0.92 [0.72-1.00] was significantly higher than the preoperative value (P < 0.001). The median follow-up period was 10 months [9-13 months]. One limb (2%) required additional endovascular therapy due to stenosis at the endarterectomy site at 5 months postoperatively. Primary and secondary patencies were 98% and 100% at 12 months, respectively, and the AFS rate was 90% at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Common femoral TEA with bovine pericardium patch angioplasty has satisfactory clinical outcomes.
