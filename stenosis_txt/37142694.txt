Title: Treatment of broad-based intracranial aneurysms with the LVIS EVO stent: a retrospective observational study at two centers with short- and medium-term follow-up.

Abstract: The use of stents is well established in the treatment of broad-based intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study is to report on safety, feasibility and midterm follow-up of the new LVIS EVO braided stent for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. All consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysms who were treated with the LVIS EVO stent in two high volume neurovascular centers were retrospectively enrolled in this observational study. Clinical and technical complications, angiographic outcome and clinical short-term and midterm results were evaluated. The study included 112 patients with 118 aneurysms. 94 patients presented with incidental aneurysms, 13 patients with acute SAH and 2 patients with acute cranial nerve palsy. For 100 aneurysms a jailing technique was used, re-crossing of the stent was performed in 3 cases. For the residual 15 cases the stent was placed as a bail-out or as a second step. Immediate complete occlusion was observed in 85 aneurysms (72%). Midterm follow-up was available for 84 patients with 86 aneurysms (72.9%). One stent showed asymptomatic complete occlusion on follow-up imaging, in all other cases no in-stent stenosis was observed. The rate of complete occlusion was 79.1% at 6 months and 82.2% at 12-18 months. Midterm follow-up data of this retrospective observational cohort of two neurovascular centers corroborates the safety profile of the LVIS EVO device for treatment of ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
