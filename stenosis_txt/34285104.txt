Title: Early clinical and haemodynamic matched comparison of balloon-expandable valves.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The balloon-expandable Sapien-3 valve demonstrated superior results in terms of residual aortic regurgitation when compared with self-expandable devices. We aimed to compare for the first-time early outcomes of Sapien-3 transcatheter heart valve (THV) with the balloon-expandable Myval device.
METHODS: Consecutive real-world patients from nine European institutions with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis treated either with Sapien-3 or Myval THV devices after June 2018 were compared. Early clinical outcomes were prospectively gathered and blinded analysis of 30-day echocardiography was conducted. Matching for the following variables was performed: age, body surface area, Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score, left ventricular function, mean gradient, transfemoral approach, aortic valvular calcium, aortic annulus mean diameter, area and eccentricity index.
RESULTS: A total of 416 patients treated either with the Sapien-3 (n=286, 68.7%) or with Myval THV (n=130, 31.3%) were included and 103 pairs compared after matching. Baseline characteristics were similar. Procedural success rate (Sapien-3: 94.2%; Myval: 93.2%, p=0.219), 30-day mortality (Sapien-3: 2.9%; Myval: 0.97%, p=0.625), clinical efficacy (12.6 vs 4.9%, p=0.057) and early safety (12.6 vs 4.9%, p=0.096) were comparable. There was a lower need for new permanent pacemaker (15.5 vs 5.8% p=0.020) with Myval. No significant differences were found in terms of â‰¥moderate aortic regurgitation (1% for Sapien-3, 0% for Myval, p=0.314), but mean gradients were higher following Sapien-3 than after Myval (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The new Myval balloon-expandable THV was favourable in terms of safety, with low rate of permanent pacemaker and with favourable residual gradients and paravalvular leak rate according to blinded echocardiographic analysis.
