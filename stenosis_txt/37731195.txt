Title: Proteomic architecture of frailty across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: While frailty is a prominent risk factor in an aging population, the underlying biology of frailty is incompletely described. Here, we integrate 979 circulating proteins across a wide range of physiologies with 12 measures of frailty in a prospective discovery cohort of 809 individuals with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Our aim was to characterize the proteomic architecture of frailty in a highly susceptible population and study its relation to clinical outcome and systems-wide phenotypes to define potential novel, clinically relevant frailty biology. Proteomic signatures (specifically of physical function) were related to post-intervention outcome in AS, specifying pathways of innate immunity, cell growth/senescence, fibrosis/metabolism, and a host of proteins not widely described in human aging. In published cohorts, the "frailty proteome" displayed heterogeneous trajectories across age (20-100 years, age only explaining a small fraction of variance) and were associated with cardiac and non-cardiac phenotypes and outcomes across two broad validation cohorts (N > 35,000) over ≈2-3 decades. These findings suggest the importance of precision biomarkers of underlying multi-organ health status in age-related morbidity and frailty.
