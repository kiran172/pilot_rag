Title: [Thinking of the treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis with high-dense silven needle therapy based on the theory of six-meridian differentiation].

Abstract: The paper introduces the thinking of the diagnosis and treatment with high-dense silver needle therapy for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) based on the theory of six-meridian differentiation. According to the severity of LSS and the depth of illness location, LSS is differentiated as six syndromes/patterns, including taiyang disorder, yangming disorder, shaoyang disorder, shaoyin disorder, jueyin disorder and taiyin disorder. The high-dense silver needle therapy is used. The main points include the bilateral Jiaji points (EX-B 2) from L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>5</sub> and the acupoints of the bladder meridian of foot-taiyang (1.5 cun lateral to each side of L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>5</sub>); and the supplementary points are selected from the affected meridians. According to the disorders of six meridians, the length of moxa stick is adjusted in warm acupuncture, targeting the tender sites of soft tissue damage. In order to obtain the satisfactory effects, the appropriate physical exercise is applicable rather than absolutely limiting the movement of affected vertebrae during the treatment.
