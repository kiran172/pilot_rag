Title: Subclinical Leaflet Thrombosis After Balloon versus Self-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) has been recognized as one of the complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation and may promote structural valve degeneration and increase the risk of cerebrovascular events. The 2 main types of available transcatheter heart valves (THVs), the balloon-expandable (BE) and the self-expanding (SE), are interchangeably used in clinical practice despite substantial design differences. There is unclear evidence on whether these 2 different THV models are achieving similar or different rates of subclinical leaflet thrombosis/HALT. A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted to identify studies that reported the incidence of HALT between SE THVs and BE THVs. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to calculate the 95% confidence interval and pooled risk ratio with a random-effects model. A total of 126 records were identified, of which 22 studies comprising 14,401 patients were included in our final analysis. Among 5,951 patients receiving SE THVs, 194 (3.2%) developed HALT, compared with 8,450 patients receiving BE THVs, of whom 484 (5.7%) developed HALT. There was a statistically significant decrease in the risk of developing HALT in patients receiving SE THVs compared with those receiving BE THVs (risk ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.95, I2 32%, p = 0.02). In conclusion, could potentially reduce the risk of HALT/subclinical leaflet thrombosis.
