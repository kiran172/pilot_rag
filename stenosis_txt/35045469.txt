Title: [A Case of Stenosis at the Junction of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter after Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy].

Abstract: A 50s year old woman was referred to former hospital for abdominal pain and melena. Colonoscopy revealed an ascending colon cancer(cT4aN1bM0, cStage Ⅲb, UICC)and gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an esophagogastric junction cancer(cT1bN0M0, cStage ⅠA, UICC). Preoperative CT showed mild bilateral hydronephrosis. Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy( Lap-RHC, D3)was performed for ascending colon cancer then, and abdominal CT was taken 2 days before the robot-assisted proximal gastrectomy(RAPG, D1+). Right hydronephrosis was observed. No evidence of obvious ureteral damage was found during Lap-RHC. When retrograde pelvic ureterography was performed and a stenosis was found at the right renal pelvis and ureteral junction. It is considered that the ureter stenosis became prominent due to the postoperative inflammatory change of Lap-RHC. RAPG was performed as scheduled. Two months after discharge, a renal fistula was constructed. Pyeloplasty is scheduled to be performed in the future.
