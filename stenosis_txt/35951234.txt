Title: Surgical Tracheostomy in a COVID-19 Positive Patient: A Case Study.

Abstract: COVID-19 has caused a worldwide epidemic, essentially forcing healthcare workers to adapt and innovate in an effort to provide quality patient care while also protecting themselves from potential infection. Current clinical guidelines do not recommend the routine placement of tracheostomies in COVID-19 positive patients. Inevitably, patients who require intubation secondary to COVID-19 related pulmonary infections may require prolonged ventilation, placing the patients at risk for tracheal and laryngeal stenosis, vocal cord paralysis, and ventilation-associated pneumonias among other complications. This case study demonstrates the successful performance of a surgical tracheostomy in a COVID-19 positive patient while additionally discussing the personal protective equipment used by the anesthesia and surgical teams and reviewing recommendations for anesthetic care during tracheostomy in a COVID-19 positive patient.
