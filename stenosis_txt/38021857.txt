Title: A Different Approach to the Treatment of Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Tracheal stenosis can occur from several malignant and non-malignant conditions, including vascular ring/aneurysms, tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia, endotracheal tubes (ETT), tracheostomy tubes, mucus plug, burn, trauma, tuberculosis, etc. Significant tracheal stenosis typically requires management by bronchoscopy, dilatation, or surgical resection. Bronchoscopic balloon dilatation is a simple, inexpensive, safe, and minimally invasive method that can be used to dilate airway stenosis and restore adequate airflow. A Montgomery tracheostomy tube is often used as a combined tracheal stent and airway device. We describe a 68-year-old female with tracheal stenosis, which was managed with an unconventional approach, a non-compliant endovascular balloon, due to resource scarcity.
