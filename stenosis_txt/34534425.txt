Title: The circle method for preoperative TAVI sizing in a Sievers type 0 stenotic bicuspid aortic valve.

Abstract: The most common congenital cardiac anomaly, affecting an estimated 0.4-2.25% of the general population, is the bicuspid aortic valve. The "pure" bicuspid aortic valve (non-raphe-type or bicuspid aortic valve type 0) is composed of 2 cusps, morphologically and functionally. The shape of the bicuspid aortic valve annulus is often elliptical, is relatively larger than the tricuspid aortic valves, and probably shows severe eccentric calcification. This situation contributes to the difficulties in selecting the correct type and size of transcatheter heart valve when treating bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. Furthermore, it is often associated with a dilated, horizontal ascending aorta and effaced sinuses. The goal of our video tutorial is to present the contemporary circle method used in preoperative sizing during TAVI procedures in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve as well as certain technical considerations and useful advice. Although annular sizing is the main focus for most patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, some patients may need the supra-annular level of sizing. For a dedicated sizing and positioning approach for the SAPIEN 3 Ultra valve, experts in the field propose the circle method.
