Title: Clinical Outcomes Associated With Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty in the Contemporary Era.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe aortic stenosis is the most common acquired valvular disorder. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is considered for patients who are not suitable for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve insertion (TAVI). The American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology recommend BAV as a bridging procedure for SAVR and TAVI due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with it. We aim to investigate the morbidity and mortality associated with BAV only, BAV bridged to TAVI and TAVI-only patients over 3 years in Epworth Richmond, a tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia.
METHODS: We divided patients into three groups including BAV only, BAV bridged to TAVI and TAVI only and assessed the baseline demographics, procedural complications, and mortality between the groups.
RESULTS: Of 438 patients, 26 patients underwent BAV only, 36 patients bridged to TAVI post-BAV and 376 patients underwent TAVI directly. All patients had significant reductions in their mean AV pressure gradient (p<0.01). There was no significant difference in periprocedural morbidity and mortality between the groups. At 6-month follow-up, the mortality in patients undergoing only BAV was 31%, compared with 8.3% in BAV bridged to TAVI and 1.9% in TAVI-only group (p<0.01). The 12-month follow-up demonstrated a similar pattern; 42.3% vs 13.9% vs 4.5% (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests no significant difference in inpatient and periprocedural morbidity and mortality between the three groups but a significant mortality benefit at 6-month and 12-month post valve insertion, either directly or post BAV.
