Title: Validation of Animal Models for Simulation Training in Pediatric Laryngotracheal Reconstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the face (FV) and content validity (CV) of three ex vivo animal models for simulation training in pediatric laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR).
METHODS: Feasibility of performing LTR was assessed on the head and neck of three different animals (lamb/suckling-pig/rabbit) and laryngeal dimensions and qualitative observations were recorded. A 19-item five-point Likert scale questionnaire was completed for each model to assess FV and CV. Data was prospectively collected and analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistics.
RESULTS: All three models were suitable for LTR simulation with laryngeal dimensions corresponding to 0-2 years (rabbit), 5-10 (pig) and >10 years (lamb model). Five trainees and five expert pediatric otolaryngologists performed LTR on each model. The overall median FV score was 5 for the lamb model (IQR 4-5), 3 for the rabbit (IQR 2-3), and 4 for the pig (IQR 4-4). The overall median CV score was 5 for the lamb (IQR 5-5), 2 for the rabbit (IQR 2-3), and 4 for the pig model (IQR 4-4). Comparison of the models demonstrated the lamb to be favored as the most realistic and practical model for simulation training in pediatric LTR, with both the lamb and the porcine model attaining validation thresholds.
CONCLUSION: Our study is the first comparative validation assessment of animal models for use in pediatric LTR simulation and it supports the use of ex vivo lamb and porcine models for use in LTR surgical skills training. The lamb model was the favored simulation model while the rabbit was considered inferior for simulation training in pediatric LTR.
