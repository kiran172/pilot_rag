Title: Osteoma in the upper cervical spine: A case report and comprehensive literature review.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Osteoma is a benign, and usually asymptomatic bone tumor normally found in the skull and facial bones, although it can occasionally occur in the long bones and spine.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this article, we present a 49-year-old male patient who experienced progressive neck pain accompanied by left-sided radicular pain symptoms. Clinical investigation using various imaging techniques confirmed a bone-forming lesion located within the C1 vertebrae region. Treatment involved performing hemilaminectomy of C1 along with resection for complete removal of this extradural bone lesion, ultimately achieving symptom relief. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen leads to the diagnosis of osteoma. Along with reporting this case, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of the previously reported spinal osteoma cases.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of osteoma. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, revealing 16 previously reported cases of spinal osteoma. Among these, only one case involved the C1 vertebra and presented similar neurological symptoms. The review underscores the rarity of spinal osteomas and the importance of surgical intervention for symptom relief.
CONCLUSION: Spinal osteomas are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with neck pain and radicular symptoms. Surgical removal of the lesion is often necessary for symptom relief, as highlighted by our case and supported by the literature review. This case adds to the limited body of evidence on spinal osteomas and emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for optimal patient outcomes.
