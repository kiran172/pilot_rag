Title: Advances in prenatal surgical management of congenital aqueductal stenosis: A bench to bedside approach.

Abstract: Congenital aqueduct stenosis AS is a significant cause of fetal obstructive hydrocephalus, characterized by the obliteration of the cerebral aqueduct, leading to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation in the ventricular system and secondary brain damage and cerebral maldevelopment. This review explores the progression from basic science to clinical applications of antenatal surgical interventions for AS, emphasizing historical efforts, current research, and translational studies. Despite advances in prenatal imaging and genetic screening, challenges remain in achieving appropriate fetal candidates, consistent ventricular decompression, and standardized surgical protocols. This review highlights the need for further research and innovation to improve prenatal treatment and outcomes for AS-affected fetuses.
