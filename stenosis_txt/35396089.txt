Title: Clinical implications of serum autotoxin in regular follow up after pediatric living donor liver transplantation for biliary atresia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients sometimes develop graft fibrosis after living donor liver transplant (LDLT). Autotaxin is a recently developed serum marker for hepatic fibrosis. We studied the relationship between serum autotaxin levels and histological findings in patients after LDLT for biliary atresia (BA).
METHODS: Information on patients aged <19 years who received LDLT for BA and were followed for at least 1 year after LDLT was gathered. Autotaxin levels were compared with pathological fibrosis scores.
RESULTS: The study included 52 patients, of whom 4 patients had no fibrosis (F0), 36 patients had F1 fibrosis, and 12 patients had F2. The median serum autotaxin level was 0.89 mg/L. In patients with portal vein (PV) complications such as stenosis or thrombosis (n = 7), the mean autotoxin level was 1.25 mg/L compared with 0.95 mg/L in patients without PV complications (p = 0.004). Among patients without PV complications, the mean autotaxin level was 0.90, 0.88, and 1.18 mg/L in F0, F1, and F2 fibrosis, respectively. The mean autotaxin was higher in F2 fibrosis than in F0 or F1 fibrosis (p<0.05). Autotoxin had a high area under the curve (0.86) with the cut-off level of 0.897 mg/L.
CONCLUSION: Serum autotaxin is a novel marker for liver fibrosis in patients after pediatric LDLT for BA.
TYPE OF STUDY: Study of Diagnostic Test.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II.
