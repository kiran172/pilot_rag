Title: Montgomery T-Tube Airway Restoration and Swallowing Rehabilitation for a Near-Hanging Female.

Abstract: Patients who fail to commit suicide by hanging often end up with laryngotracheal injuries, which may lead to a compromised airway, swallowing dysfunction, and dysphonia. Previous studies have mainly focused on airway management after near-hanging attempts. Few have shed light on the treatment of swallowing dysfunction after laryngotracheal injuries. Here, we present a near-hanging patient who developed complete dysphagia shortly afterward. We used a Montgomery T-tube as an endolaryngeal stent, combined with swallowing rehabilitation. The patient's swallowing ability was gradually restored one month after the surgery, and the stent was removed six months later. The present case report exemplifies the unique way of using the Montgomery T-tubes in clinical practice. Among the patients with airway stenosis affecting the larynx and extending to the vocal cords, Montgomery T-tube may be the only stent that can help manage strictures at the level of the vocal cords and in the supraglottic region, restoring swallowing function and maintaining the airway.
