Title: Cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Insights from a consecutive series with the Sentinel cerebral protection device.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Growing interest in neuroprotection in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has catalyzed the development of cerebral protection systems (CPS).
OBJECTIVES: Report insights from consecutive real-world patients undergoing TAVR with the Sentinel-CPS.
METHODS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR from April 2019 to May 2022 were enrolled in a prospective registry. The reason for unsuccessful Sentinel-CPS deployment and the amount of debris captured by the filters were prospectively recorded.
RESULTS: The Sentinal CPS was successfully deployed in 330 patients (85%, Group 1). Deployment was not attempted, unsuccessful or only partially successful in 59 patients (15%, Group 2), caused by anatomical factors such as tortuosity, heavy calcification or small dimensions of radial or brachial artery in 46, technical aspects such as puncture failure or dissection in 5 or use of right radial access for the pigtail in 6. Debris was captured in 98% of patients in Group 1. In 40%, the amount of debris was graded moderate or extensive. Predictors for moderate/extensive debris were moderate/severe aortic calcification (OR 1.50, CI 1.05-2.15, p = 0.03), pre- and postdilatation (OR 1.97, CI 1.02-3.79, p = 0.04 and OR 1.71, CI 1.01-2.89, p = 0.048). The risk of stroke was numerically lower in patients who underwent TAVR with the Sentinel CPS (2.1 vs. 5.1%, respectively, p = 0.15). There was no stroke during CPS deployment, but one patient had a stroke immediately after device retrieval.
CONCLUSIONS: The Sentinel-CPS was successfully deployed in 85% of patients. Predictors for moderate/extensive debris captured were moderate/severe aortic calcification, pre- and postdilatation.
