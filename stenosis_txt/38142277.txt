Title: Arterial revascularization in patients with hand pain dialyzing with upper arm Arteriovenous (AV) fistulas: A single center experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Distal hand ischemia syndrome (DHIS) is a well reported adverse outcome in patients with upper arm AV access. 25%-40% of these patients have been reported to be due to primary arterial disease complicated with significant arterial calcification. The effectiveness of revascularization of the distal arterial circulation on symptom resolution has not been reported yet.
METHODS: Retrospective single center analysis of patients evaluated for hand/forearm pain in patients with upper arm AV access who had arterial revascularization between 01/2016 and 12/2020 were included for the analysis. Fifty-one patients met inclusion criteria. Stenotic lesions greater than 70% in the subclavian, axillary, brachial, radial, or ulnar artery were treated with balloon angioplasty. Institutional approval was obtained to review charts.
OUTCOMES: Successful revascularization, improvement in pain in 48 h, 1 month, and 3 months.
RESULTS: Seventy six percent of patients had an upper arm Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) and 24% patients had an upper arm Arteriovenous Graft (AVG). Mean access flow was 1210 (556) ml/min. 55% of patients had radial or ulnar arterial stenosis, 45% had brachial/axillary or subclavian artery stenosis. 45% patients had lesions in both radial and ulnar arteries, 88% of patients were successfully revascularized. 76% (18) of patients had improvement in symptoms within 48 h and 68% remained symptom free in 3 months. Mean DHIS stage was 3.1 before intervention and improved to 1.1 post intervention (p &lt; 0.001). Patient satisfaction with their AV access improved from 34% to 72% (p &lt; 0.01). Multiple regression analysis did not reveal statistically significant correlations between time on dialysis vintage and other chronic medical conditions on post procedure symptom improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: DHIS with occlusive arterial disease can be successfully revascularized to improve symptoms. Complete evaluation of the inflow arterial segment and optimal endovascular revascularization could decrease the need for access revision procedures or access abandonment.
