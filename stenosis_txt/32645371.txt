Title: Robotic Surgery for the Reconstruction of Transplant Ureteral Strictures.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility and success of a robotic approach to reconstruction of ureterovesical anastomotic strictures in kidney transplants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2017 and December 2019, a total of 5 patients with transplant ureteral stricture were identified and treated with robot assisted laparoscopic repair. All patients were confirmed to have ureteral stricture with a preoperative antegrade nephrostogram through their nephrostomy tube and cystogram. The patients demographics, ureteral characteristics, type of procedure, and outcomes are reported.
RESULTS: All patients were diagnosed after evaluation for renal deterioration. The average age of the patients was 49 years old. The average stricture length was 2.5 cm, and the location was variable, though more commonly in the distal ureter. Three patients required a pyelo-vesicostomy, while 2 required a ureteroneocystostomy. The mean length of stay was 2.2 days. Average follow-up was 97 days, with all 5 patients having successful outcomes, no strictures or delayed leaks were identified. There were no wound infections or readmissions within 30 days.
CONCLUSION: Though a complex repair, the robot-assisted approach to transplant ureter reconstruction using either an end to side neoureterocystotomy or direct pyelo-vesicotomy is technically feasible and successful. Given the many advantages inherent in comparison to an open approach, the robotic repair offers significant advantages to both the patient and the surgeon who is experienced with robotic surgery and reconstructive principles.
