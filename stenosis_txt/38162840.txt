Title: Medical radiation exposure during gastrointestinal enteral metallic stent placement: Post hoc analysis of the REX-GI study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Recently, the use of various endoscopic procedures performed under X-ray fluoroscopy guidance has increased. With the popularization of such procedures, diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) have been widely accepted as the global standard for various procedures with ionizing radiation. The Radiation Exposure from Gastrointestinal Fluoroscopic Procedures (REX-GI) study aimed to prospectively collect actual radiation exposure (RE) data and establish DRLs in gastrointestinal endoscopy units. In this post hoc analysis of the REX-GI study, we established DRLs for each disease site by analyzing cases of gastrointestinal enteral metallic stent placement.
METHODS: The REX-GI study was a multicenter, prospective observational study conducted to collect actual RE data during gastrointestinal enteral metallic stent placement. To establish DRL values for three disease sites, namely the esophagus, gastroduodenum, and colon, we examined fluoroscopy time (FT; min), number of X-ray images, air kerma at the patient entrance reference point (K <sub>a,r</sub>; mGy), and the air kerma-area product (P <sub>KA</sub>; Gy cm2) during enteral metallic stent placement.
RESULTS: Five-hundred and twenty-three stenting procedures were performed. The DRL values of FT (min) and the number of X-ray images for the esophagus/gastroduodenum/colon were 9/16/18 min and 9/15/11 min, respectively. Furthermore, the DRL values of K <sub>a,r</sub> and P <sub>KA</sub> for each disease site were 43.3/120/124 mGy and 10.3/36.6/48.4 Gy cm2, respectively. Among the procedures, esophageal stents were significantly associated with the lowest values (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The characteristics of RE vary according to disease site among gastrointestinal enteral metallic stent placements. Thus, it is desirable to set DRL values based on the disease site.
