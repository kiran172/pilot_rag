Title: Study of immediate and late effects of successful PTMC on left atrial appendage function in patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis IN SINUS rhythm.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Since its introduction in 1984, Percutaneous Transvenous Mitral Commissurotomy (PTMC) has become established as a safe and effective treatment for rheumatic Mitral Stenosis (MS).( Ben Farhat et al., 1998) 1 Chronic pressure and volume overload imposed by MS causes left atrial (LA) and Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) dysfunction. Risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is increased approximately 17-fold in patients of MS in Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and is present even in patients of MS in sinus rhythm (SR). This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of PTMC on LAA function by Trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) Doppler and Doppler Tissue Imaging (DTI).
METHODS: Total 70 cases were enrolled in this study. Patients with symptomatic severe MS (Mitral Valve Area <1.5cm2), in SR, who underwent a successful PTMC during the period from May 2016 to May 2019 were selected. All the patients underwent Clinical examination, ECG, detailed TTE and TEE before, immediately after (within 24 h) & after 6 months of PTMC.
RESULTS: There was non significant improvement in Left Atrial appendage fractional area change {LAAAC (%)} immediately Post PTMC but there was significant improvement at 6 months Post PTMC. There was significant increase in LAA PW Doppler velocities (LAAEDE, LAALDE and LAAF velocity) immediately Post PTMC which got further improved significantly at 6 months of follow up. There was significant increase in LAA DTI velocities (E<sub>LAA</sub>, A<sub>LAA</sub> and S<sub>LAA</sub> velocity) immediately Post PTMC which got further improved significantly at 6 months of follow up.
CONCLUSION: PTMC improves left atrial appendage function in patients with mitral stenosis.
