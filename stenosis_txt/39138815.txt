Title: Unraveling the Complexities of Uretero-Enteric Strictures: A Modern Review.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review article is to provide a contemporary overview of benign uretero-enteric anastomotic stricture (UAS) management and outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: In this article, we will review the most recent studies investigating UAS and evaluate etiology, potential risk factors, presentation, diagnosis, and management options, along with personal insight gained from our experience with managing this challenging reconstructive complication. Benign UAS is a relatively common long-term complication of intestinal urinary diversion, affecting approximately 1 in 10 patients. It is thought to be caused by ureteral tissue ischemia and fibrosis at the anastomotic site. Risk factors appear to include any that increase the likelihood of leak or ischemia; it is not clear if anastomotic approach impacts risk for stricture as well. Management options are varied and include endourologic, open, and robotic approaches. Endoscopic approaches may be less morbid but are considerably less effective than reconstruction performed after a period of ureteral rest.
