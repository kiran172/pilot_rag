Title: Transcarotid Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Simple "Flip-n-Flex" Technique.

Abstract: Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly accepted as a safe and efficacious alternative when transfemoral access is contraindicated. Technical and anatomic considerations unique to transcarotid access warrant several adaptations to the routine TAVR procedure. This report describes an approach to overcome these challenges and improve efficiency, including adoption of the "flip-n-flex" technique originally developed for right transaxillary TAVR. This technique has been used at Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) since 2019 in both left and right transcarotid TAVR approaches with success to ensure coaxial alignment of the transcatheter heart valve to the aortic root.
