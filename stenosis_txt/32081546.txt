Title: [Bilateral renal infarction: A rare complication of fibromuscular dysplasia].

Abstract: Bilateral renal infarction complicating Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) is extremely rare and has so far been reported only in a handful of cases. We report a 44-year-old man who presented with complaints of abdominal pain and severe hypertension. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed bilateral renal infarction and a renal angiography confirmed the bilateral and irregular stenosis due to FMD, in the absence of systemic vasculitis and other risk factors for thromboembolic events. Therefore, angioplasty with balloon was performed in order to obtain a good vessel patency and to improve patency in the long term follow-up. After the endovascular treatment the blood pressure improved markedly, maintaining this result at 3-months follow-up. Our case highlight the importance of recognizing renal infarction as an initial presentation of FMD.
