Title: Prognostic significance of vascular and valvular calcifications in low- and high-gradient aortic stenosis.

Abstract: AIMS: In low-gradient aortic stenosis (LGAS), the high valvulo-arterial impedance observed despite low valvular gradient suggests a high vascular load. Thoracic aortic calcifications (TACs) and valvular aortic calcifications (VACs) are, respectively, surrogates of aortic load and aortic valvular gradient. The aim of this study was to compare the respective contributions of TAC and VAC on 3-year cardiovascular (CV) mortality following TAVI in LGAS vs. high-gradient aortic stenosis (HGAS) patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1396 consecutive patients were included. TAC and VAC were measured on the pre-TAVI CT-scan. About 435 (31.2%) patients had LGAS and 961 (68.8%) HGAS. LGAS patients were more prone to have diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), P<0.05 for all. During the 3â€‰years after TAVI, 245(17.8%) patients experienced CV mortality, 92(21.6%) in LGAS and 153(16.2%) in HGAS patients, P=0.018. Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, AF, CAD, LVEF, renal function, vascular access, and aortic regurgitation showed that TAC but not VAC was associated with CV mortality in LGAS, hazard ratio (HR) 1.085 confidence interval (CI) (1.019-1.156), P=0.011, and HR 0.713 CI (0.439-1.8), P=0.235; the opposite was observed in HGAS patients with VAC but not TAC being associated with CV mortality, HR 1.342 CI (1.034-1.742), P=0.027, and HR 1.015 CI (0.955-1.079), P=0.626.
CONCLUSION: TAC plays a major prognostic role in LGAS while VAC remains the key in HGAS patients. This confirms that LGAS is a complex vascular and valvular disease.
