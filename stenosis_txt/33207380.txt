Title: [Lacrimal Duct Obstruction in Adults].

Abstract: The tearing eye (epiphora) is the guiding symptome of nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Depending on the localization of stenosis, mucopurulent lacrimal discharge occurs additionally. These symptoms induce alterations of the optical system and can cause severe complications such as acute phlegmonous dacryocystitis. The grade of suffering in these patients is very high. For the diagnosis, patient's history, ocular surface conditions and inspection (macro-/microscopically) as well as palpation of the lacrimal region are essential examinations. Moreover, functional and anatomical tests enable a classification of nasolacrimal duct obstruction regarding grade of stenosis (incomplete vs. complete), type (functional vs. mechanical), and localization (pre-, intra-, postsaccal). ENT consultation prior to lacrimal surgery is obligate. Through this, a purposeful therapeutic intervention is warranted. Surgical methods consist of minimally invasive transcanalicular procedures or anastomosing surgeries. Dependent on the clinical findings, these treatment options can be applied in a patient centered therapeutic concept.
