Title: Ultrasound-guided carotid sheath block for carotid endarterectomy surgery in a high-risky patient and literature review.

Abstract: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) surgery is generally performed for patients who under the risk of ischemic cerebral stroke due to the critical obstruction of the carotid artery. Ischemic complications may occur during the surgery. So, the awakeness of the patient is very important during the surgery. Regional anesthesia techniques may be performed instead of general anesthesia for shunt placement during CEA surgery. Herein, we aimed to share our successful US-guided carotid sheath block experience for anesthesia management during CEA surgery.
