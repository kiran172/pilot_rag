Title: Endoscopic extended transforaminal approach (medial subchoroid) as an alternative to the classical transchoroidal approach: Technical note.

Abstract: The extended transforaminal endoscopic approaches allows visualization and manipulation of the middle and posterior third of the III ventricle. In selected cases where the venous anatomy is favorable, the medial subchoroidal approach can be performed as an alternative to the classic transchoroidal approach (via trans-taenia fornicis) with increased protection over the fornix and without the need to sacrifice the septal vein. We present a 14-year-old male with history of Neurofibromatosis type 1 referred for two weeks of clinical evolution with headache, dizziness, gait instability and appearance of a right VI nerve palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed obstructive tri-ventricular hydrocephalus due to stenosis of the aqueduct of Sylvius with suspicion of an underlying tumor. An endoscopic surgical procedure was performed through a single approach with III cisternostomy and resection of the tissue that produced the stenosis. The anatomopathological diagnosis showed reactive glial tissue with no signs of malignancy. In conclusion, the medial subchoroidal approach is a plausible alternative in the endoscopic approach to the III ventricle structures in a safe and comfortable manner.
