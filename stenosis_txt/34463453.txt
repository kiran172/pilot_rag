Title: [Successful surgical treatment of patient with cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a rare clinical observation and literature review].

Abstract: The authors describe the result of combined surgical treatment of a patient with symptomatic multiple-level cervical spine stenosis following ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament. The first stage included decompressive laminectomy and cervical spine fusion using a screw. At the second stage, C<sub>IV</sub>-C<sub>V</sub>-C<sub>VI</sub>-C<sub>VII</sub> corporectomy with total resection of the ossified posterior longitudinal ligament and C<sub>III</sub>-Th<sub>I</sub> corporodesis with a bone autograft were carried out. This approach was valuable to minimize the risk of iatrogenic damage to the spinal cord, eliminate long spinal stenosis and perform circular fusion of the cervical spine. These measures led to regression of cervical myelopathy symptoms. A brief review is presented.
