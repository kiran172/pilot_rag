Title: Long-term Outcome of Endoscopic Retrograde Biliary Drainage of Biliary Stricture Following Living Donor Liver Transplantation.

Abstract: Background/Aims: Biliary strictures remain one of the most challenging aspects after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The aim of this study was to assess long-term outcome of endoscopic treatment of biliary strictures occurring after LDLT and to identify risk factors of recurrent biliary strictures following endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) in LDLT. Methods: A total of 1,106 patients underwent LDLT from May 1995 to May 2014. We compared the risk factors between patients with and without recurrent biliary strictures. Results: Biliary strictures developed in 24.0% of patients. Technical success rate of ERBD for biliary stricture after LDLT was 66.2% (145/219). Among 145 patients managed by endoscopic drainage, stricture resolution occurred in 69 with median duration of stent indwelling of 13.6 months (range, 0.5 to 67.3 months), and stricture recurrence was seen in 20 (21.3%) out of 94. The median recurrence-free duration after final endoscopic success was 13.1 months (range, 0.5 to 67.3 months). Older donor age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.17; p=0.004) and non-B, non-C liver cirrhosis (HR, 5.10; 95% CI, 1.10 to 25.00; p=0.043) were associated with higher recurrence of biliary stricture. Conclusions: Long-term stricture resolution rate after ERBD insertion for biliary stricture occurring after LDLT was 73.4%. Clinicians should pay careful attention during following-up to decide when to remove ERBD in patients who have factors associated with recurrent biliary strictures.
