Title: Application of hybrid operating rooms for clipping large or giant intracranial carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A hybrid operating room (Hybrid-OR) is a surgical theatre that combines a conventional operating room with advanced medical imaging devices. There are still plenty of limitations when endovascular treatment or microsurgical treatment is used individually to treat large or giant carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms.
AIM: To explore and summarize the technical features and effectiveness of the application of a Hybrid-OR in managing major intracranial carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms.
METHODS: The Department of Neurosurgery treated 12 cases of large or giant intracranial carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms between March 2013 and December 2019 in a Hybrid-OR. All cases were treated with clipping and parent vessel reconstruction.
RESULTS: With the assistance of the Hybrid-OR, the rate of incomplete intraoperative aneurysm clipping decreased from 25% (3/12) to 0%, while the rate of vessel stenosis decreased from 16.7% (2/12) to 8.35% (1/12). In terms of thromboembolic events, ischemic infarction complication occurred in only one patient, and none of the patients experienced embolic infarction complications. All 12 patients were followed for an average of 3 years, and no aneurysms recurred. The postoperative recovery was evaluated with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS): 11 patients showed no symptoms (mRS = 0), 1 patient showed slight disability (mRS 1-2), and none of the patients had severe disability (mRS = 5) or died (mRS = 6).
CONCLUSION: The Hybrid-OR provides new ideas for the surgical clipping of large or giant intracranial carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms and decreases the rate of intraoperative vessel stenosis and unsuccessful clipping.
