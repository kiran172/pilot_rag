Title: Treatment of outflow graft stenosis in left ventricular assist device patients: Endovascular approach.

Abstract: Left ventricular assist device outflow graft stenosis is a rare, but a lethal complication. Device replacement or thrombolytic treatments are associated with serious mortality and morbidity. Implantation of covered stents is a less invasive option. Herein, we represent a successful stent placement of two cases with outflow graft stenosis, which we performed by leaving the stents on the aortic side of the anastomosis line 5 to 10 mm. This treatment option can be used reliably in cases of stenosis of the outflow graft with part of the stent leaving the aorta.
