Title: Magnetic compression anastomosis for sigmoid stenosis treatment: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic balloon dilation is a minimally invasive treatment for colorectal stenosis. Magnetic compression anastomosis can be applied against gastrointestinal anastomosis. When combined with endoscopy, it offers a unique approach to the recanalization of colorectal stenosis.
CASE SUMMARY: We have reported here the case of a 53-year-old female patient who underwent a descending colostomy due to sigmoid obstruction. Postoperative fistula restoration was not possible in her due to sigmoid stenosis. Accordingly, endoscopic-assisted magnetic compression anastomosis for sigmoid stenosis was performed, and the sigmoid stenosis was recanalized 15 d after the surgery. Subsequently, a reduction colostomy was successfully performed after 10 d.
CONCLUSION: This case report proposes a novel minimally invasive treatment approach for colorectal stenosis.
