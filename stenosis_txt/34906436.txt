Title: Accuracy of ultra-high-resolution computed tomography with a 0.3-mm detector for quantitative assessment of coronary artery stenosis grading in comparison with conventional computed tomography: A phantom study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The development of ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) is expected to improve the accuracy of coronary stenosis evaluation. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the stenosis severities of coronary artery phantoms estimated using U-HRCT by comparing them to those estimated with conventional CT.
METHODS: Coronary artery phantoms with non-calcified and calcified lesions were scanned with conventional CT (64-row ​× ​0.625 ​mm) and U-HRCT (32-row ​× ​0.3125 ​mm). The coronary artery phantoms had lumen diameters of 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 ​mm with non-calcified lesions representing 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% stenosis and 3.0 and 4.0 ​mm with calcified lesions representing 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% stenosis. The lumen diameters at the stenotic and non-stenotic regions were measured, and the stenosis severities were compared with the true values.
RESULTS: For non-calcified lesions, conventional CT significantly underestimated the stenosis severity in the phantom showing 75% stenosis with lumen diameters of 2.0 and 3.0 ​mm (p ​< ​0.05), while the estimated stenosis severities were not significantly different from the true values at all settings with U-HRCT. For the calcified lesions, conventional CT overestimated the stenosis severities at all settings (p ​< ​0.05), while U-HRCT yielded estimations closer to the true values, although still with some overestimation (p ​< ​0.05).
CONCLUSION: By using U-HRCT, the estimated stenosis severities of the coronary artery with non-calcified lesion become almost equal to the true value, while those with calcified lesion are still overestimated although they become closer to the true value.
