Title: Biliary stenosis after liver transplant is not associated with cytomegalovirus infection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is the best treatment for end-stage liver disease; however, biliary complications (BCs) still pose a significant challenge. Among the post-transplant BC, strictures and biliary fistulas are the most common. Biliary strictures are classified as anastomotic and non-anastomotic. Some previous studies suggest an association between post-transplant biliary strictures and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. In this study, we aimed to identify whether there is an association between CMV infection and biliary strictures in patients undergoing LT.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 175 patients aged â‰¥18 years undergoing LT at Felicio Rocho Hospital between 2011 and 2017 was conducted. All included patients received grafts perfused with Institut Georges Lopez-1 (IGL-1) solution from brain-dead donors, survived post-transplantation for more than 120 days, and had a minimum follow-up of 12 months after LT. The diagnosis of CMV was made by antigenemia and biliary strictures by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).
RESULTS: The average age of the recipients was 54 years. Postoperative BCs occurred in 12% of transplants. The most common BC was stricture (9.1%), with a predominance of anastomotic strictures (AS) over non-AS (NAS) (87.5% vs. 12.5%, respectively). CMV infection was confirmed in 22.9% of patients. In the univariate analysis, post-transplant CMV infection correlated with the development of BCs (P=0.01), as well as biliary strictures (P=0.008). In the multivariate analysis, however, only model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) &gt;21 was a risk factor for the development of BCs in general (P=0.02) and biliary strictures (P=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: CMV infection was not an independent risk factor for the development of non-anastomotic post-transplant biliary strictures in this study.
