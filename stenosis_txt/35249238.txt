Title: Minimum requirements in emergency kits for bailout strategies in TAVR complications.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The proportion of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis treated by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasing, driven by favorable outcomes from randomized trials and current valve guidelines recommendations. Despite device and technique improvements having reduced procedural morbidities, complications during or immediately after TAVR still carries significant mortality risk.
METHODS: We propose a check-list of essential items to anticipate potentially life-threatening complications in TAVR.
RESULTS: Purpose of this review is to discuss the most common life-threatening complications during TAVR from a troubleshooting perspective, depicting the minimum required equipment needed in emergency situations.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of complications remains the most important strategy to optimize outcomes in TAVR procedures. Each specialized Center should institute and make easily accessible standardized emergency kits for the most common life-threatening conditions during TAVR that should be readily available in the cath-lab or hybrid operating room.
