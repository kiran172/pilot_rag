Title: Endoscopic Balloon Dilation of Gastric Stenosis secondary to Polyarteritis Nodosa and Arterial Thrombosis in an Adolescent.

Abstract: A 13-year-old female with polyarteritis nodosa underwent a partial gastrectomy for ischemic necrosis and gastric perforation following left gastric artery thrombosis. She later presented with vomiting, early satiety, weight loss, and severe malnutrition, when she was diagnosed with an occlusive gastric stricture. She successfully underwent repeated therapeutic endoscopic balloon dilations until the endpoint of 15-18 mm lumen was achieved without any complications, and her symptoms resolved.
