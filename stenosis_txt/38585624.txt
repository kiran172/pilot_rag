Title: Incidental findings of cervical magnetic resonance imaging: A retrospective reinterpretation of a large adult population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine is one of the routine MRI scans of the cervical region in investigating spinal disc pathologies, spinal stenosis, and the detection of spinal lesions, which are the major parameters to be evaluated in this examination.
PURPOSE: The authors of this study are focused on a different aspect of cervical MRI, revealing the incidences and reporting rates of extraspinal incidental findings.
METHODS: A total of 1000 patients (324 males, 676 females, mean age 47 ± 14) who had undergone an MRI of the cervical spine were enrolled in this study. The magnetic resonance (MR) images of these patients were re-interpreted with respect to the incidental extraspinal imaging findings. The incidence and reporting rate of each incidental finding encountered during the evaluation were presented in percentages.
RESULTS: 726 patients in this study had at least one incidental lesion. The results of this study revealed that the most common incidental lesions encountered during the reinterpretation of cervical MRI were nasopharyngeal mucosal thickening (n = 442) and thyroid hypertrophy (n = 231). The total reporting rate of incidental findings was 5.29%.
CONCLUSION: There are many data to be reported and evaluated by MR imaging of the cervical spine, not only the main parameters of MRI scanning in the routine daily practice of radiologists. All our colleagues should be aware and careful of these incidental findings, which may be the initial medical data of the patients' diagnoses, or to avoid undesirable medicolegal problems.
