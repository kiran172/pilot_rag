Title: [Clinical features of Chinese patients with Takotsubo syndrome].

Abstract: Objective: To analyze the characteristics, diagnosis and treatment status of Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) of Chinese patients. Methods: Complete literature review was performed to summarize Chinese TTS cases between 2007 and 2018. Results: A total of 131 literatures were included including 160 TTS patients (age (58.3±14.7) years). There were 137 female patients (85.6%) in this cohort, the age was (59.6±14.0) years. There were 124 cases (77.5%) of stress-evoking factors, of which 83 cases (66.9%) were self-stress factors. There were 97 cases (60.6%) complained of chest pain and 15 cases (9.4%) with syncope. Forty-eight cases (30.0%) presented with cardiogenic shock. CK-MB and cTnT/I increased in 109 cases (80.1%). There were 124 cases (77.5%) presented with ST segment elevation on electrocardiogram, which were common in lead V<sub>2</sub>-V<sub>5</sub>. Echocardiography results were available in 128 cases (80.0%), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (&lt;50%) was reported in 78 cases (73.6%). Coronary angiography was performed in 133 patients (83.1%), of which 126 patients (94.7%) had normal coronary arteries or single non-significant stenosis. One hundred and thirty-eight patients (87.3%) were apical type. The misdiagnosis rate on admission was 96.9% (155/160), of which 141 cases (88.1%) were misdiagnosed as acute myocardial infarction. Nitroglycerin was used in 36 patients (30.3%). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin Ⅱ receptor antagonist were used in 38 patients (31.9%). β blockers were used in 46 patients (38.7 %). Dopamine was used in 22 cases (18.5%) and norepinephrine was used in 12 cases (10.1%). Intra-aortic balloon counter pulsation was used in 5 cases (3.1%). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in 9 cases (5.6%). Cardiac function recovery time was 7 (6, 15) days. The average InterTAK diagnosis score was (51.5±18.1) points, and value was&gt;70 points in 2 cases (1.3%). There were 92 patients in the high-risk group, and there were 3 recurrent TTS cases. Five patients died. Conclusions: TTS incidence tends to be young and dominates in female in China. The misdiagnosis rate is extremely high on admission. Most patients are treated with medication.
