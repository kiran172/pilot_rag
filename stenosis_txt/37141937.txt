Title: Clinical characteristics and prognostic implications of orthopedic ligament disorders in patients with wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is associated with multiple ligament disorders (LD) such as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), and spontaneous tendon rupture (STR). No studies have investigated the prevalence of these LD in the same cohort of ATTRwt patients. Furthermore, the clinical characteristics and prognostic implications of such disorders have not been studied.
METHODS: From 2017 to 2022, 206 consecutive patients with ATTRwt were diagnosed and followed prospectively to the time of death or the censoring date of September 1st, 2022. Patients with and without LD were compared, and the presence of LD was used along with the baseline clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic characteristics to predict hospitalization with worsening heart failure and death.
RESULTS: CTS surgery was performed in 34 % of the patients, 8 % were treated for LSS, and 10 % had experienced an STR. The median follow-up time was 706 days (312-1067). Hospitalization with worsening heart failure occurred more frequently in patients with LD compared to patients without LD (p = 0.035). Presence of LD or surgery for CTS were found to be independent predictors of worsening heart failure with a hazard ratio of 2.0 (p = 0.01). The mortality was comparable between patients with and without LD (p = 0.10).
CONCLUSION: Orthopedic disorders are prevalent in ATTRwt cardiomyopathy, and presence of LD was an independent predictor of hospitalization with worsening heart failure.
