Title: Atresia of the Midportion of the Coronary Sinus: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 12-year-old with a history of critical pulmonary stenosis and moderate right ventricular hypoplasia underwent neonatal pulmonary valve dilation, an aortopulmonary shunt, and an infant cavopulmonary anastomosis with aortopulmonary shunt takedown. During a diagnostic cardiac catheterization at 12 years of age, angiography showed interruption in the midportion of the coronary sinus, which required no intervention.
