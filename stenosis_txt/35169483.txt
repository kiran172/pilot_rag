Title: Granulation after stenting for tuberculous bronchial stenosis treated with tranilast: A case report.

Abstract: A 63-year-old woman was diagnosed with tuberculous bronchial stenosis of the left main bronchus following recurrent pneumonia. She underwent airway dilatation and stenting for long and severe stenosis. Initially, a Dumon Y-stent was implanted, but repeated granulation occurred at the distal end of the stent. The granulation reappeared repeatedly despite cauterization and stent replacement. An attempt at stent removal led to worsening of scar stenosis; therefore, it was reinstalled. Finally, two self-expandable metallic stents were implanted sequentially, and she remained asymptomatic for 14 months. After this, she presented with fever and a computed tomography showed obstructive pneumonia due to associated granulation at the distal end of the stent. She was then started on tranilast to treat the granulation with the stent in situ. Granulation almost completely disappeared after 4 months and no recurrence was noted at 12 months since the start of tranilast.
