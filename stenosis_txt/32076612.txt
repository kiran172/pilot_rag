Title: Primary versus Redo Urethroplasty: Results from a Single-Center Comparative Analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To explore the differences between primary and redo urethroplasty and to directly compare according stricture-free survival (SFS). Materials and Methods. Data of all male patients who underwent urethroplasty at Ghent University Hospital were collected between 2000 and 2018. Exclusion criteria for this analysis were age &lt;18 years and follow-up &lt;1 year. Two patient groups were created for further comparison: the primary urethroplasty (PU) group (no previous urethroplasty) and redo urethroplasty (RU) group (≥1 previous urethroplasty), irrespective of prior endoscopic treatments. A comparison between groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's Exact test. SFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier statistics. A functional definition of failure, being the need for further urethral manipulation, was used. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed on the entire patient cohort.
RESULTS: 805 patients were included. Median (IQR) follow-up of the PU (n = 556) and RU (n = 556) and RU (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (p=0.1). The RU group involved more penile strictures (.
CONCLUSIONS: Several differences between primary and redo urethroplasties exist. Redo urethroplasty entails a distinct patient population to treat and is, in general, associated with lower stricture-free survival than primary urethroplasty, although more homogeneous series are required to corroborate these results. Prior urethroplasty and diabetes are independent risk factors for urethroplasty failure.
