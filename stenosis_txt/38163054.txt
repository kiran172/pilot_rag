Title: A case study of pyloric stenosis caused by metastatic lobular carcinoma of breast.

Abstract: Metastasis to the gastrointestinal tract is rare. A 59-year-old woman who had a history of an invasive lobular carcinoma of breast with clinical complete response visited our hospital and complained of an upper abdominal pain and distension. We performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy which showed only a gastric ulcer without any malignant findings. She experienced a recurrence of symptoms 2 months after this visit. An endoscopy revealed pyloric stenosis, which did not improve with balloon dilatation. We performed a gastro-jejunal and cecal-transverse colonic bypass surgery. Diffuse wall thickening of the antrum was verified during the surgery, and a biopsy sample was collected. The diagnosis of gastric metastasis from breast was confirmed since it showed the same immunohistochemistry pattern as the prior breast lesion. Pyloric stenosis has still been confirmed with an endoscopy, she has been alive with satisfactory oral food intake for >10 years.
