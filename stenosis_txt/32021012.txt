Title: Lumbar microdecompression in elderly versus general adult patients: Comparable outcomes and costs despite group differences.

Abstract: This study investigated differences between patients <65 and ≥65 years of age following lumbar microdecompression. Differences between age groups were investigated with univariate analyses. A linear mixed effects model was fit to the study outcomes. 144 patients were studied. There was no difference in two-year outcomes between the age groups. Outcome measures showed improvement compared to baseline at one- and two-years (p < 0.001). Age group had a significant effect on back pain (p = 0.016). Patients ≥65 years of age may experience greater relief in back pain following microdecompression. Nonetheless, significant improvement is observed in both age groups at two-years.
