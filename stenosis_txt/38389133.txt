Title: Incidence and Risk Factors of Iliac Artery Rupture during Aortoiliac Stenting.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) is widely prevalent and leads to severe claudication or chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Stent placement for AIOD demonstrated excellent outcomes in terms of long-term patency. However, iliac artery rupture is the most fearful complication during the aortoiliac stenting (AIS). This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of iliac artery rupture during AIS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients with AIOD treated with AIS from 2009 to 2021 was completed. We excluded patients with instent restenosis. All types of stents, including self-expanding stent (SES), balloon-expandable stent (BES), or balloon-expandable covered stent (CS), were used. Angiographic characteristics and procedural outcomes were analyzed. Procedural success was defined as the residual stenosis <30%.
RESULTS: A total of 242 patients (86.8% male; mean age 68.8Â±10.0 years) with de novo AIOD were treated with AIS. The procedural success rate was 100%. Rupture occurred in six patients (2.5%) and all ruptures were occurred in the external iliac artery (EIA). Stenting of the EIA and less calcified lesion were risk factors for iliac rupture (P=0.028). All cases of iliac artery rupture were successfully treated with the CSs. Overall primary patency rates were 98.0% and 93.4% at 12 and 36 months, respectively. Primary patency rates of SES, BES, and CS were 87.7%, 88.4%, and 100% at 36 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of iliac artery rupture during AIS was 2.5%. Stent placement in the less calcified lesion and EIA was a risk factor for rupture during AIS. Placement of the CS can be the straightforward solution in case of iliac artery rupture during AIS.
