Title: Personalized tissue-engineered arteries as vascular graft transplants: A safety study in sheep.

Abstract: Patients with cardiovascular disease often need replacement or bypass of a diseased blood vessel. With disadvantages of both autologous blood vessels and synthetic grafts, tissue engineering is emerging as a promising alternative of advanced therapy medicinal products for individualized blood vessels. By reconditioning of a decellularized blood vessel with the recipient's own peripheral blood, we have been able to prevent rejection without using immunosuppressants and prime grafts for efficient recellularization in vivo. Recently, decellularized veins reconditioned with autologous peripheral blood were shown to be safe and functional in a porcine in vivo study as a potential alternative for vein grafting. In this study, personalized tissue engineered arteries (P-TEA) were developed using the same methodology and evaluated for safety in a sheep in vivo model of carotid artery transplantation. Five personalized arteries were transplanted to carotid arteries and analyzed for safety and patency as well as with histology after four months in vivo. All grafts were fully patent without any occlusion or stenosis. The tissue was well cellularized with a continuous endothelial cell layer covering the luminal surface, revascularized adventitia with capillaries and no sign of rejection or infection. In summary, the results indicate that P-TEA is safe to use and has potential as clinical grafts.
