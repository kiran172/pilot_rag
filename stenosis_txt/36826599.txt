Title: The effect of various options for decompression of degenerated lumbar spine motion segments on the range of motion: a biomechanical in vitro study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common disease in the aging population. Decompression surgery represents the treatment standard, however, a risk of segmental destabilization depending on the approach and extent of decompression is discussed. So far, biomechanical studies on techniques were mainly conducted on non-degenerated specimens. This biomechanical in vitro study aimed to investigate the increase in segmental range of motion (ROM) depending on the extent of decompression in degenerated segments.
METHODS: Ten fresh frozen lumbar specimens were embedded in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and loaded in a spine tester with pure moments of ± 7.5 Nm. The specimens were tested in their intact state for lateral bending (LB), flexion/extension (FE) and axial rotation (AR). Subsequently, four different decompression techniques were performed: unilateral interlaminar decompression (DC1), unilateral with "over the top" decompression (DC2), bilateral interlaminar decompression (DC3) and laminectomy (DC4). The ROM of the index segment was reported as percent (%) of the native state.
RESULTS: Specimens were measured in their intact state prior to decompression. The mean ROM was defined as 100% (FE:6.3 ± 2.3°; LB:5.4 ± 2.8°; AR:3.0 ± 1.6°). Interventions showed a continuous ROM increase: FE (DC1: + 4% ± 4.3; DC2: + 4% ± 4.5; DC3: + 8% ± 8.3;DC4: + 20% ± 15.9), LB(DC1: + 4% ± 6.0; DC2: + 5% ± 7.3; DC3: + 8% ± 8.3; DC4: + 11% ± 9.9), AR (DC1: + 7% ± 6.0; DC2: + 9% ± 7.9; DC3: + 15% ± 11.5; DC4: + 19% ± 10.5). Significant increases in ROM for all motion directions (p < 0.05) were only obtained after complete laminectomy (DC4).
CONCLUSION: Unilateral and/or bilateral decompressive surgery resulted in a statistically insignificant ROM increase, whereas complete laminectomy showed statistically significant ROM increase. If this ROM increase also has an impact on the clinical outcome and how to identify segments at risk for secondary lumbar instability should be evaluated in further studies.
