Title: Celiac axis stenosis and digestive disease: Diagnosis, consequences and management.

Abstract: Arterial blood flow to the organs of the upper abdomen is provided by the celiac axis (CA) and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) that communicate between each other via the gastro-duodenal artery, the anterior and posterior pancreatico-duodenal arcades, the branches of the dorsal pancreatic artery and inconsistently, though a supplementary arcade that connects the CA and the SMA (arcade of BÃ¼hler). Celiac axis stenosis may or may not have a hemodynamic impact on the splanchnic circulation. Hemodynamically significant CA stenosis can be asymptomatic, or symptomatic with variables clinical consequences. Management depends on whether the mechanism of stenosis is extrinsic or intrinsic. When upper gastrointestinal interventional radiology or surgery is indicated, stenosis can pose technical difficulties or create severe ischemia requiring good understanding of this entity in the planning of operative steps and adapted management. Management of CA stenosis is therefore multidisciplinary and may involve interventional radiologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, vascular surgeons as well as medical physicians. Even though the prevalence of CA stenosis is relatively low (between 5 and 10%) and irrespective of its etiology, surgeons, radiologists and physicians must be aware of it because it can intervene in the management of upper gastrointestinal disease. It must be sought, and treatment must be adapted to each particular situation to avoid potentially severe complications.
