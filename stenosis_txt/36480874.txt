Title: [Effect of low density carotid plaque on the development of cerebral small vessel disease in patients with carotid stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the correlation between cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and carotid low-density plaque on multi-slice spiral CT angiography (MSCTA) in patient with carotid stenosis. Methods: The clinical data of 221 patients with carotid stenosis who admitted to Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, from January 2016 to January 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 195 males and 26 females, with the age of (70.0±8.4) years (range: 48 to 88 years). According to MRI, the patients were divided into carotid stenosis combined with CSVD group (the CSVD group) and carotid stenosis without CSVD group (the non-CSVD group). Lowest density in the carotid atherosclerotic plaque area (CAPALD) was analyzed by MSCTA. The t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test were used for comparison between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analysis were performed on CAPALD and other clinical indicators with CSVD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of CAPALD and CAPALD combined with the demographics (sex, age and body mass index) were plotted for predicting CSVD, and the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results: There were 169 patients in the CSVD group and 52 patients in the non-CSVD group. In the CSVD group, 88.8% (150/169) were males and 11.2% (19/169) were females, with the age of (70.5±8.2) years (range: 48 to 88 years). In the non-CSVD group, 86.5% (45/52) were males and 13.5% (7/52) were females, with the age of (68.4±9.1) years (range: 51 to 85 years). CAPALD and the score of Montreal cognitive assessment were lower in the CSVD group than those in the non-CSVD group (21.0 HU vs. 35.0 HU, Z=-3.760, P&lt;0.01; 22.6±3.9 vs. 24.8±3.3, t=-2.064, P&lt;0.05). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that CAPALD was an independent factor for CSVD (OR=1.044, 95%CI:1.020 to 1.070, P&lt;0.01). The AUC of the ROC curve for CAPALD predicting carotid stenosis with CSVD was 0.672 (P&lt;0.01), with cut-off value of 34.5 HU, sensitivity of 82.8%, and specificity of 50.0%. The AUC of ROC curve for CAPALD combined with the demographics predicting CSVD was 0.733 (P&lt;0.01), with sensitivity of 82.9% and specificity of 64.0%. Conclusions: The decreased CAPALD is a risk factor for CSVD in patients with carotid stenosis. The analysis of carotid plaque density by MSCTA may help to identify the patients at high risk of CSVD.
