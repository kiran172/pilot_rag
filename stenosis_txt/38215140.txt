Title: Make your choice: Angiography or periodical health examination?

Abstract: Periodical health examination is one of the important factors influencing a healthy lifestyle. Patients undergoing routine physical examination in primary care are included in the scope of preventive medical services, which is the most basic principle of primary care. Identifying the risk factors enables individuals to adopt healthier lifestyle practices. In our study, we examined the correlation between patients undergoing coronary angiography for suspected coronary stenosis and the extent of primary care services they had received in their medical history, along with the severity of stenosis observed during the angiography. Patients were interviewed using a pre-structured questionnaire to gather information about their past utilization of primary healthcare services related to coronary matters and their cardiovascular (CV) risk profile as documented in their medical history. The necessary standard tests for angiography procedures were retrieved from patient records. The SYNTAX score, a tool that aids in the objective assessment of the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), was computed and documented. This score was then compared with the history of primary care utilization. The patients' utilization of services from the Primary Healthcare Center (PHC) was evaluated using a scoring system, with an average score of 29.27 ± 11.27 out of 100 points (minimum: 20; maximum: 60). The average SCORE Türkiye indicating the 10-year risk of CV events for all patients was calculated as 14.31% ± 8.65% (high-very high risk), while the average SYNTAX score was 15.20 ± 9.97. There was a positive and significant correlation found between fasting blood glucose and creatinine values with both SYNTAX score and SCORE Türkiye (respectively; R = 0.238, P = .013; R = 0.289, P = .002). Factors such as smoking and metabolic syndrome were associated with CAD severity. It important to highlight that individual recommended for angiography had a notably lower utilization of healthcare services from the PHC based on their medical histories. This circumstance has resulted in individuals who do not undergo CV event screenings at PHCs having higher SYNTAX scores, indicating more severe CAD that necessitates angiography. Conducting regular periodical health examinations at PHCs can help mitigate these statistics.
