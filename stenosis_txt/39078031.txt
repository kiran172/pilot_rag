Title: [Neurovascular pathology in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1. Case report].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Neurovascular involvement in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) presents with a wide spectrum of manifestations. Its frequency is low, albeit probably underestimated. There is currently no known specific treatment, and treatment is based on recommendations with limited evidence. This report describes a case of vascular dysplasia in a patient with NF1.
CASE REPORT: A 67-year-old woman with a genetic diagnosis of NF1 and a history of multiple exeresis of neurofibromas in the left cervical region. The patient presented with a painful flare-up and swelling in the region. A cervical magnetic resonance imaging was performed, which showed signs of plexiform neurinoma growth and a lesion suggestive of aneurysm in the left cervical internal carotid artery. A subsequent computed tomographic angiography confirmed the presence of a thrombosed aneurysm with associated critical stenosis, and identified three additional aneurysms in the proximal left vertebral artery. Given the asymptomatic presentation and adequate haemodynamic compensation, the patient was prescribed a conservative treatment and clinicoradiological follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurovascular alterations associated with NF1 are infrequent, and the optimal treatment for them is unknown. Studies to define its true prevalence, determine its pathophysiological substrate and estimate the risk of cerebrovascular complications more precisely are needed. This could provide more robust recommendations for the population of NF1 patients, especially in asymptomatic cases.
