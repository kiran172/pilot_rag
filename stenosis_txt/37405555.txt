Title: Lipoprotein(a): a Case for Universal Screening in Youth.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lipoprotein(a) has emerged as a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Targeted screening recommendations for Lp(a) measurement exist for adults and youth known to be at high-risk. However, Lp(a) measurements are not included in universal screening guidelines in the US; hence, most families in the US with high Lp(a) levels who are at risk of future atherosclerotic heart disease, stroke, or aortic stenosis are not recognized. Lp(a) measurement included as part of routine universal lipid screening in youth would identify those children at risk of ASCVD and enable family cascade screening with identification and early intervention for affected family members.
RECENT FINDINGS: Lp(a) levels can be reliably measured in children as young as two years of age. Lp(a) levels are genetically determined. The Lp(a) gene is inherited in a co-dominant fashion. Serum Lp(a) attains adult levels by two years of age and is stable for the lifetime of the individual. Novel therapies that aim to specifically target Lp(a) are in the pipeline, including nucleic acid-based molecules such as antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs. Inclusion of a single Lp(a) measurement performed as part of routine universal lipid screening in youth (ages 9-11; or at ages 17-21) is feasible and cost effective. Lp(a) screening would identify youth at-risk of ASCVD and enable family cascade screening with identification and early intervention for affected family members.
