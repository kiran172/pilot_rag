Title: Otolaryngologic Manifestations of Trisomy 13 and Trisomy 18 in Pediatric Patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The survival rate of patients with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 has increased dramatically over the past two decades. We sought to comprehensively describe the otolaryngologic clinical characteristics and procedures required for these patients at our institution.
METHODS: We performed algorithmic identification of patients with a diagnosis of trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 for whom the otolaryngology service provided inpatient or outpatient care at our institution between the dates of February 1997 and March 2021.
RESULTS: Of the 47 patients studied, 18 patients had a diagnosis of trisomy 13, and 29 had a diagnosis of trisomy 18. Complete trisomy was present in 44% (8/18) of trisomy 13 patients and 55% (16/29) of trisomy 18 patients. 81% of patients were living at the time of the study. About 94% (44/47) of patients required consultation with another specialty in addition to Otolaryngology. Overall, the most common diagnoses among this cohort were gastroesophageal reflux disease (47%), dysphagia (40%), otitis media (38%), and obstructive sleep apnea (34%). Nearly three-quarters (74%) of patients studied required an otolaryngologic procedure. The most common surgical procedure was tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Patients with trisomy 18 were significantly more likely to have external auditory canal stenosis and obstructive sleep apnea whereas patients with trisomy 13 were more likely to have cleft lip and palate.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a diagnosis of trisomy 13 or 18 often require multidisciplinary management and the range of required care spans the breadth of otolaryngology.
