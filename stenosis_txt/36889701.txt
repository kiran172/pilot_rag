Title: Complete Circumferential Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Esophageal Cancer Leaving an Island of Normal Mucosa.

Abstract: Esophageal stricture caused by complete circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of extensive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major concern and can result in a low quality of life. Normal mucosa may remain within a complete circumferential lesion of ESCC in some cases. We herein report a case of ESCC in which a complete circumferential lesion was treated with ESD while leaving an island of normal mucosa within it. This case demonstrates that preserving areas of normal mucosa within lesions during complete circumferential ESD is not technically difficult and may be an effective measure for preventing esophageal stricture.
