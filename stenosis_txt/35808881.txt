Title: Acquired Constriction Band Syndrome Affecting Multiple Digits - A Case Report.

Abstract: Rubber band syndrome is a condition that usually affects children because of wearing a rubber band on the wrist or the ankle. Depending on the degree of pressure caused by the band, patients may present acutely with ischemia and necrosis of the tissues distal to the bands or chronically with change in shape, oedema, loss of function, sensation and rarely amputation. This condition is very rare in adults and most reports in literature are in patients with cognitive impairment or psychiatric illness. We report 62-year-old lady with a background of a psychiatric illness who presented with an acquired constriction band syndrome affecting multiple digits of both hands. Level of Evidence: Level V (Therapeutic).
