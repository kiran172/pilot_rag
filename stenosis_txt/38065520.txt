Title: Bicuspid aortic stenosis: National three-year outcomes of transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement among Medicare beneficiaries.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Randomized trials of transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacements have excluded bicuspid anatomy. We compared 3-year outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients aged more than 65 years with bicuspid aortic stenosis.
METHODS: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid data were used to identify 6450 patients undergoing isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (n = 3771) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n = 2679) for bicuspid aortic stenosis (2012-2019). Propensity score matching with 21 baseline characteristics including frailty created 797 pairs.
RESULTS: Unmatched patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement were older than patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (78 vs 70 years), with more comorbidities and frailty (all P < .001). After matching, transcatheter aortic valve replacement was associated with a similar mortality risk compared with surgical aortic valve replacement within the first 6 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08, 95% CI, 0.67-1.69) but a higher mortality risk between 6 months and 3 years (HR, 2.16, 95% CI, 1.22-3.83). Additionally, transcatheter aortic valve replacement was associated with a lower risk of heart failure readmissions before 6 months (HR, 0.51, 95% CI, 0.31-0.87) but a higher risk between 6 months and 3 years (HR, 4.78, 95% CI, 2.21-10.36). The 3-year risks of aortic valve reintervention (HR, 1.03, 95% CI, 0.30-3.56) and stroke (HR, 1.21, 95% CI, 0.75-1.96) were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Among matched Medicare beneficiaries undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement or surgical aortic valve replacement for bicuspid aortic stenosis, 3-year mortality was higher after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement was associated with a similar risk of mortality and a lower risk of heart failure readmissions during the first 6 months after the intervention. Randomized comparative data are needed to best inform treatment choice.
