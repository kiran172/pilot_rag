Title: Echo HALT: do we really need a cardiac CT?

Abstract: Leaflet thrombosis is usually an incidental finding and Cardiac CT is the gold standard for its diagnosis, but the classic features of hypoattenuation leaflet thickening (HALT) and hypoattenuation affecting motion (HAM) can also be seen on echocardiography and more specifically on trans-esophageal echocardiography. We describe a case of transcatheter aortic valve thrombosis where both the diagnosis and treatment were based exclusively on the echocardiographic evaluation, without the need of cardiac CT, with good outcome for the patient.
