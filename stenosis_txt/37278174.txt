Title: [Pulmonary vein stenosis with pulmonary infarction secondary to primary mediastinal seminoma: a case report].

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis is a rare condition that is often underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed. The clinical and radiologic manifestations are unspecific such as cough, hemoptysis and pulmonary lesions and are therefore difficult to distinguished with pneumonia and tuberculosis. The present study is a successful case report of pulmonary vein stenosis and pulmonary infraction secondary to mediastinal seminoma. This case suggested that pulmonary vein stenosis should be considered when a mediastinal mass is accompanied by pulmonary opacites that cannot be explained by common causes such as infection.
