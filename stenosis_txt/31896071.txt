Title: Duodenal diverticulization as treatment of complex duodeno-pancreatic lesions: Case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Duodenal and pancreatic lesions are uncommon, but severe and responsible for high incidence in morbidity and mortality. Differences between the mechanisms of trauma, the severity of lesions and the time between trauma, diagnosis and treatment influence the evolution of the case.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a 20-year-old patient with several lesions in stomach, duodenum, pancreas and jejunum due to three gunshots treated at our service. Duodenal diverticulalization was used on treatment of complex duodeno-pancreatic lesions. The patient presented good evolution, with discharge conditions in the 10th PO.
DISCUSSION: We discussed the positives and negatives of this technique, with the approval of the Ethics Committee number 13736519.8.0000.5479.
CONCLUSION: The duodenal diverticulization leads to an irreversible change to the food transit. However, this is a feasible bypass option in cases of high chances of fistula and scar stenosis complex duodenal injury, particularly in the context of associated gastric injury.
