Title: Carotid to Left Subclavian Artery Bypass Grafting for the Treatment of Coronary Subclavian Steal Syndrome.

Abstract: Recurrent angina after coronary artery bypass grafting is rarely caused by left subclavian artery (LSCA) stenosis resulting in reduced left internal mammary artery blood flow. We present 2 cases of coronary-subclavian artery steal syndrome resulting from LSCA stenosis and their successful surgical management with left carotid to LSCA bypass. Based on the successful management described in this case report, and the limitations of other options in addressing coronary-subclavian artery steal syndrome, left carotid to LSCA bypass surgery should be considered for revascularization in patients who develop postoperative coronary-subclavian artery steal syndrome due to LSCA stenosis.
