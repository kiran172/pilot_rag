Title: [A case report of primary extubation by partial cricotracheal resection for severe subglottic stenosis].

Abstract: This patient suffered from severe subglottic stenosis(grade â…£b). During partial cricotracheal resection, we cut through the cricothyroid membrane and the cricoid arch along the line from the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage to 5 mm of the inferior thyroid cartilage corner anteromedially. This can protect the cricothyroid joint, effectively protect the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and also support the airway. Strictly adhere to airway separation, avoid excessive separation of scars, and combine with reasonable postoperative management to achieve a safe extubation.
