Title: Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Tracheostomy in Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery of South Korea: Retrospective Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety in Critically Ill Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In intensive care settings, the maintenance of ventilation is typically essential. Tracheostomy is frequently performed to facilitate long-term ventilation and to minimize associated complications. This procedure can be conducted using several techniques, including traditional surgery, endoscopic approaches, and ultrasound-guided methods.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined data from all patients admitted to the intensive care unit of our institution who underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous tracheostomy (UPCT) between March 2018 and April 2023. The study included a total of 81 patients aged 15 years or older. To assess the incidence of complications, we classified these issues as either minor or major, with major complications encompassing events such as bleeding necessitating blood transfusion.
RESULTS: The most frequent minor complication was bleeding that did not require blood transfusion, which occurred in 15 patients (18.5%). Major complications were identified in 7 patients (8.6%), all of whom experienced bleeding that necessitated transfusion. However, we noted no cases of infection, conversion to open surgery, or tracheal stenosis surgery. The complication rate did not significantly differ from those reported in previous studies.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that UPCT can be safely used in critically ill patients, although further research on this topic is needed.
