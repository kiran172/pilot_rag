Title: Balloon venoplasty for disdialysis syndrome due to pacemaker-related superior vena cava syndrome with chylothorax post-bacteraemia: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome has also been reported as a late complication of pacemaker (PM) implantation, acute onset of SVC syndrome caused by disdialysis syndrome in patients with PM implantation is very rare. There are no specific therapies or guidelines.
CASE SUMMARY: A 96-year-old woman receiving dialysis was implanted with a PM due to sick sinus syndrome. She was referred to our facility for chest discomfort experienced during dialysis. Upon examination, unilateral pleural effusion on the right side was cloudy with a foul odour. The patient was diagnosed with pyothorax and treated with antibiotics. After the effusion was reduced, it gradually reaggravated and remained cloudy. In this case, SVC syndrome, which is generally considered a late complication after PM implantation, rapidly developed following the bacteraemia, resulting in impaired venous return, chylothorax, and disdialysis syndrome. After catheter intervention for SVC stenosis, the patient's symptoms promptly improved. The patient has been recurrence-free for a year.
CONCLUSION: Acute SVC syndrome can cause dysdialysis in PM-implanted patients. Catheter intervention alone has improved this condition for a traceable period.
