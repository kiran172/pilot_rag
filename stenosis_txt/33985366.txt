Title: Fibrin sheath disruption during guidewire exchange for bacteremia: Low recurrence of infection and preservation of vascular access sites.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Catheter-associated bacteremia (CAB) often leads to removal of tunneled dialysis catheters with delayed insertion (RDI). Exchange over a guidewire (ExW) can be considered for access site preservation. Fibrin sheath disruption (FSD) during exchange is not standard practice for infected catheters. Here we present the first analysis of outcomes after such exchanges (ExW-FSD).
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of catheter exchanges and removals performed by interventional nephrology for bacteremia in 2008-2011 observed for 20.5 months. Charts were reviewed for recurrent or new bacteremia and death at 3 months, and for occurrence of thrombosis or stenosis along the catheter site. Catheter exchange with central venogram and fibrin sheath disruption was our standard of care in all patients presenting for CAB. RDI was performed either for tunnel infection, non-clearing of infection or at the request of referring physicians.
RESULTS: Over 4 years, 66 patients were treated for CAB. Forty-two patients underwent ExW-FSD, which was performed even for Staph. aureus, gram negative bacteremia or candidemia. RDI was performed in 24 cases. Bacteremia recurred in 3 (7%) patients after ExW-FSD, and in 7 (30%) cases after RDI (p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in new infections: 5 (12%) after ExW-FSD and 2 (8%) after RDI. There was no death within 3 months after ExW-FSD and 4 (27%) (p = 0.005) deaths in the RDI group.There was one new central venous stenosis in the ExW-FSD group (2%) with no loss of access site, and 8 (33%) patients developed thrombosis/stenosis along the prior catheter track after RDI (33%) (p = 0.006) with loss of access site in (21%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis of treatment of CAB, ExW-FSD was associated with lower recurrence of bacteremia, lower death rate and a lower incidence of access site loss compared to RDI. These data support ExW-FSD use in patients with CAB.
