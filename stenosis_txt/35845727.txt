Title: Risk Factors and Distribution Characteristics of Intracranial and Intracranial Artery Stenosis in Young Sufferers with Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: In order to explore the risk factors of intracranial and intracranial arterial stenosis, the distribution of young ischemic stroke sufferers with intracranial and intracranial arterial stenosis and the related are analyzed. In this study, a total of 213 young sufferers with ischemic stroke (IS) admitted to our hospital from February 2019 to September 2021 are selected. According to the CT diagnosis of intracranial artery stenosis (AS), 213 patients are divided into two groups, with 86 in the AS Group and 127 in the non-AS Group. To analyze the distribution of intracranial and intracranial AS in young patients with ischemic stroke, 86 patients with AS are examined by carotid B-mode ultrasound. Furthermore, a univariate analysis is performed on the relevant indicators of the sufferers in the cancer (CA) set and the two sets without CA, and then, the indicators with statistically extensive disparity were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis of the risk factors for CA symptoms. The results show 50% of the sufferers with moderate or severe ischemic CA in young adults and 63.95% of the sufferers with intracranial artery stenosis. It is clearly evident that the main risk factors affecting the occurrence of intracranial and intracranial arteries in young IS are hypertension and long-term smoking, long-term drinking, and hyperlipidemia.
