Title: Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 rs671 a/A Genotype is Associated with an Increased Risk of Early Onset Coronary Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in cardiovascular diseases has been gradually studied. However, it is unclear whether ALDH2 polymorphism is associated with the risk of early onset (onset age ≤55 years old in men and ≤65 years old in women) coronary artery stenosis (CAS). The association between ALDH2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs671 and risk in patients with early onset CAS was investigated in this study.
METHODS: The study included 213 early onset CAS patients and 352 individuals without CAS were set as controls. The ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - microarray. Differences in ALDH2 rs671 genotypes and alleles between patients and controls were compared. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed after adjusting for gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, drinking history, and diabetes mellitus to assess the relationship between ALDH2 rs671 genotypes and early onset CAS risk.
RESULTS: The frequency of the ALDH2 rs671 G/G genotype was lower in the early onset CAS patients (43.7% vs 55.3%, p=0.007) than that in the controls. The frequency of the ALDH2 rs671 A allele was higher (32.9% vs 25.0%) than that in the controls (p=0.005). After adjusting for other confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression showed that ALDH2 rs671 A/A genotype (A/A vs G/G: odds ratio (OR) 2.508, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.130-5.569, p=0.024), overweight (BMI≥24.0 vs 18.5-23.9: OR 5.047, 95% CI: 3.275-7.777, p&lt;0.001), history of smoking (yes vs no: OR 2.813, 95% CI: 1.595-4.961, p&lt;0.001), and diabetes mellitus (yes vs no: OR 2.191, 95% CI: 1.397-3.437, p=0.001) were the independent risk factors of early onset CAS.
CONCLUSION: In men ≤55 years old and women ≤65 years old, individuals with ALDH2 rs671 A/A genotype, overweight (BMI ≥24.0 kg/m2), smoking history, and diabetes mellitus increased risk of developing CAS.
