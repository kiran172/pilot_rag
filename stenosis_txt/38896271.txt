Title: Roles of Nontraditional Lipid Parameters for Predicting Restenosis in Patients with Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis After Endovascular Treatment.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Nontraditional lipid parameters are associated with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) progression. This study aimed to investigate the association of nontraditional lipid parameters with the risk of restenosis in patients with ICAS after endovascular treatment (EVT).
METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients with symptomatic ICAS after successful EVT followed by at least 3 months of angiography. Participants were divided into restenosis or non-restenosis groups based on the angiographic follow-up results. The nontraditional lipid parameters were calculated from conventional lipid parameters. The COX regression models and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to explore the association between nontraditional lipid parameters and restenosis.
RESULTS: This study recruited 222 cases with 224 lesions eligible for our study, of which 56 (25%) had restenosis. Compared with the non-restenosis group, patients in the restenosis group had higher levels of the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) (0.211, interquartile range, IQR, 0.065-0.404 vs. 0.083, IQR, -0.052-0.265, P = 0.001), remnant cholesterol (RC) (0.55, IQR, 0.33-0.77 vs. 0.30, IQR, 0.18-0.49, P < 0.001) and Castelli's index‑I (CRI-I) (4.13, IQR, 3.39-5.34 vs. 3.74, IQR, 2.94-4.81, P = 0.030). In the multivariable COX regression analysis, a 0.1 unit increase of AIP was an independent risk factor for restenosis (hazard ratio, HR = 1.20, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.05-1.35, P = 0.005) whereas such an association was not observed for RC (HR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.90-1.15, P = 0.835). The restricted cubic spline (RCS) plot revealed a linear relationship between AIP and restenosis (P for nonlinear = 0.835) but a nonlinear relationship for RC (P for nonlinear = 0.012). Patients were stratified according to tertiles (T) of AIP and RC and the risk of restenosis increased in T3 compared to T1 (HR = 3.21, 95% CI 1.35-7.62, P = 0.008 and HR = 2.99, 95% CI 1.11-8.03, P = 0.030, respectively). Furthermore, this association remained stable within each LDL‑C level subgroup.
CONCLUSION: The AIP and RC were positively and independently associated with restenosis in patients with ICAS after EVT.
