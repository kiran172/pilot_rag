Title: Diagnostic utility and safety of intracoronary nicorandil as a hyperemic agent for the measurement of fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: We investigated the diagnostic utility and safety of intracoronary bolus administration of nicorandil compared with intravenous administration of adenosine for evaluating FFR in patients with intermediate (40-70%) coronary stenosis. The FFR values obtained with nicorandil and adenosine showed linear relationship. This correlation is statistically significant with regression coefficient of 0.932 (R2 = 0.834, p < 0.001). The side effects such as bronchospasm, hypotension, and bradycardia were significantly higher after administration of adenosine compared to nicorandil (20% vs. 1.66%, p = 0.001). Intracoronary use of nicorandil seems to be promising in offering the advantages of lesser side effects, similar efficacy, and lesser cost as compared to adenosine.
