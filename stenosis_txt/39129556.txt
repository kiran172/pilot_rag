Title: [Upper gastro-intestinal tumour stenosis treated by a new endoscopic approach].

Abstract: Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a mechanical obstruction of the distal stomach or proximal duodenum. Surgical gastro-jejunostomy and self-expanding metal duodenal stents were the conventional treatments for GOO. In recent years, a new treatment option emerged using echo-guided endoscopic gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE). It appears to be a safe and effective technique with a clinical success rate of 85-90 % and a side effect rate of less than 18 %. Compared to metal duodenal prostheses, the risk of recurrence of GOO and of re-intervention is lower with EUS-GE. The rate of side effects also appears to be lower than with the surgical technique, with a shorter length of hospital stay. Randomised studies comparing these different techniques are still needed to determine a new treatment algorithm for GOO. We report a case of successful EUS-GE performed at our institution.
