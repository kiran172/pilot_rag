Title: Short- and long-term results of operative iliac artery release in endurance athletes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endurance athletes can develop intermittent claudication due to sports-related flow limitations of the iliac artery (FLIA) caused by arterial kinking. In the present study, we investigated the short- and long-term efficacy of an operative release for iliac artery kinking.
METHODS: Between 1996 and 2015, all patients with a diagnosis of FLIA due to iliac artery kinking without substantial arterial stenosis (<15%) or an excessive arterial length (vessel length to straight ratio, <1.25) who had undergone surgery were included. The short-term follow-up protocol consisted of cycling tests, the ankle brachial index with a flexed hip, and Doppler echography examinations to determine the peak systolic velocity before and 6 to 18 months after surgery. Additionally, the short- and long-term efficacy were evaluated using questionnaires.
RESULTS: A total of 142 endurance athletes (155 legs; 88.4% male; median age, 26 years; interquartile range [IQR], 22-31 years) were available for analysis. In the short term, the symptoms had decreased in 83.9% of the patients, with an overall 80.3% satisfaction rate. Power during a maximal cycling test had improved from 420 W (IQR, 378-465 W) to 437 W (IQR, 392-485 W; P < .001). The symptom-free workload had increased from 300 W (IQR, 240-340 W) to 400 W (IQR, 330-448 W; P < .001). The postexercise ankle brachial index with a flexed hip had increased from 0.53 (IQR, 0.40-0.61) to 0.57 (IQR, 0.47-0.64; P = .002), and the peak systolic velocity with a flexed hip had decreased from 1.88 m/s (IQR, 1.45-2.50 m/s) to 1.52 m/s (IQR, 1.19-2.07 m/s; P < .001). Postoperative imaging studies revealed some degree kinking in 33.9%, mostly asymptomatic. The long-term results were evaluated after a median of 15.2 years (IQR, 10.9-19.5 years). The athletes had cycled an additional 125.500 km (IQR, 72.00-227.500 km), which was approximately equal to the 131.000 km (IQR, 98.250-220.000 km) cycled before the diagnosis of FLIA. On the long term, 63.9% of the athletes reported persistent reduction of complaints, with an overall 59.1% satisfaction rate. Eight patients had required reintervention, six because of treatment failure and two because of newly developed FLIA.
CONCLUSIONS: Operative iliac artery release for sports-related functional kinking in the absence of stenosis or an excessive vessel length was effective for most athletes in the short and long term.
