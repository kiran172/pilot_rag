Title: [Sweet syndrome of childhood with acquired cutis laxa (Marshall syndrome) as primary manifestation of Takayasu arteritis].

Abstract: A special form of the rare infantile Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is facultative healing in the form of postinflammatory elastolysis with acquired cutis laxa, named "Marshall" syndrome after the authors who first described it. We report the case of a 3-year-old child in whom the cutaneous manifestation led to diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis. Postinflammatory elastolysis with acquired cutis laxa is a clinically relevant cutaneous indicator of life-threatening cardiovascular complications such as aortitis, aortic aneurysm, coronary stenosis and heart failure in children with Sweet's syndrome. Cutis laxa usually precedes cardiac complications or, as in our case, occurs simultaneously; thus, immediate cardiac and rheumatologic examinations are important to initiate systemic therapy with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents early to prevent complications.
