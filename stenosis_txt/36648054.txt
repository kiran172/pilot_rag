Title: Clinical Characteristics and Prognosis of MINOCA Caused by Atherosclerotic and Nonatherosclerotic Mechanisms Assessed by OCT.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary artery (MINOCA) is a heterogeneous syndrome caused by different pathophysiologic mechanisms. There is limited evidence regarding prognosis of patients with MINOCA caused by different mechanisms.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to assess the underlying mechanisms of MINOCA by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to correlate with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Patients with MINOCA were divided into 2 groups based on OCT findings: atherosclerotic MINOCA (Ath-MINOCA) and nonatherosclerotic MINOCA (non-Ath-MINOCA). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as cardiac death, nonfatal MI, target lesion revascularization, stroke, and rehospitalization for unstable or progressive angina.
RESULTS: Among 7,423 patients with a clinical diagnosis of MI who underwent angiography, 190 of 294 MINOCA were studied using OCT. The causes of Ath-MINOCA (n = 99, 52.1%) were plaque erosion (n = 64, 33.7%), plaque rupture (n = 33, 17.4%), and calcified nodule (n = 2, 1.1%) whereas the causes of non-Ath-MINOCA (n = 91, 47.9%) were spontaneous coronary artery dissection (n = 8, 4.2%), coronary spasm (n = 9, 4.7%), and unclassified cause (n = 74, 38.9%). The 1-year MACE was 15.3% for Ath-MINOCA vs 4.5% for non-Ath-MINOCA (P = 0.015). An atherosclerotic cause was an independent predictor of MACE (HR: 5.36 [95% CI: 1.08-26.55]; P = 0.040), mainly driven by target lesion revascularization and rehospitalization, despite the composite endpoint including cardiac death and MI showing no difference.
CONCLUSIONS: OCT identified a cause in 61.1% of MINOCA, in which Ath-MINOCA represents an important and distinct MINOCA subset. Ath-MINOCA were more common and associated with worse outcomes.
