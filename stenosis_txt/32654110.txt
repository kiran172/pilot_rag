Title: Appendiceal Conduit: A Novel Technique to be Applied After Radical Cystectomy: A Case Report.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel technique, known as appendiceal conduit. It could be used as an alternative for ileal conduit and cutaneous ureterostomy, ultimately applied after radical cystectomy. The six-month follow-up indicated that the patient had appendix-stoma as nipple without any stenosis, nor did he have any hydronephrosis, as confirmed by abdominal sonography.
