Title: A Case of CABG in a Patient with High Risk of Coronary Obstruction during TAV-in-TAV.

Abstract: A 94-year-old man who underwent transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) replacement 6 years ago was admitted because of exertional dyspnea. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation owing to TAV dysfunction. The patient was considered to have a high risk of occlusion of the sinus of Valsalva during TAV-in-TAV. Therefore, we performed TAV-in-TAV concomitant with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The postoperative course was uneventful, and computed tomography 9 months later revealed patency of both the grafts. Concomitant CABG could be considered as one of the options in patients with a high risk of coronary occlusion during TAV-in-TAV.
