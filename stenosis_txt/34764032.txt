Title: Predictors and Impact of Low Diastolic Blood Pressure and Widened Pulse Pressure Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The association between post-operative diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP) with outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unclear. We sought to assess the prevalence, predictors, and impact of post-operative DBP and PP on presence of post-procedural aortic insufficiency (AI) and mortality in adults undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: The study population included 194 patients who underwent TAVR from 2016 to 2017 at an academic tertiary medical center, of which 176 had invasive arterial pressures available postoperatively. Low DBP and widened PP were defined as ≤40 mmHg and ≥80 mmHg respectively on invasive arterial line on post-operative day 1. Clinical outcomes of interest included post-procedural AI and 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Post-operative low DBP and widened PP were noted in 32.4% and 58.5% of the study population. No significant association between post-operative AI and low DBP (p = 0.82) or widened PP (p = 0.32) was noted. There was a trend toward higher rates of mortality in patients with low DBP (19.3% vs 9.2%, p = 0.06) but no difference in mortality in patients with widened PP (10.7% vs 15.1%, p = 0.39) or those with ≥1+ post-procedural AI (16.7% vs 10.7%, p = 0.32). In multivariable analysis, low DBP was associated with a trend toward higher rates of 1-year mortality [odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-6.11, p = 0.06]. When excluding patients with a post-operative invasive systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg, low DBP was associated with significantly higher risk-adjusted mortality at 1 year [OR 2.75, 95% CI (1.07-7.07), p = 0.04].
CONCLUSIONS: In this contemporary study of adults undergoing TAVR, low DBP and widened PP were widely prevalent post TAVR. Low DBP was associated with a trend toward higher rates of 1-year mortality but not with post-procedural AI.
