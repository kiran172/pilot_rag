Title: Safety and Efficacy of Myval Implantation in Patients with Severe Bicuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis-A Multicenter Real-World Experience.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common valvular congenital anomaly and is apparent in nearly 50% of candidates for AV replacement. While transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a recommended treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) at all surgical risk levels, experience with TAVI in severe bicuspid AS is limited. TAVI in BAV is still a challenge due to its association with multiple and complex anatomical considerations. A retrospective study has been conducted to investigate TAVI's procedural and 30-day outcomes using the Myval transcatheter heart valve (THV) (Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd. Vapi, Gujarat, India) in patients with severe bicuspid AS. Data were collected on 68 patients with severe bicuspid AS who underwent TAVI with the Myval THV. Baseline characteristics, procedural, 30-day echocardiographic and clinical outcomes were collected. The mean age and STS PROM score were 72.6 ± 9.4 and 3.54 ± 2.1. Procedures were performed via the transfemoral route in 98.5%. Major vascular complications (1.5%) and life-threatening bleeding (1.5%) occurred infrequently. No patient had coronary obstruction, second valve implantation or conversion to surgery. On 30-day echocardiography, the mean transvalvular gradient and effective orifice area were 9.8 ± 4.5 mmHg and 1.8 ± 0.4 cm2, respectively. None/trace aortic regurgitation occurred in 76.5%, mild AR in 20.5% and moderate AR in 3%. The permanent pacemaker implantation rate was 8.5% and 30-day all-cause death occurred in 3.0% of cases. TAVI with the Myval THV in selected BAV anatomy is associated with favorable short-term hemodynamic and clinical outcomes.
