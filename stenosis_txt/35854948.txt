Title: Mechanical thrombectomy and carotid artery stenting for stenosis of the internal carotid artery with free-floating thrombosis: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The authors report a case in which mechanical thrombectomy and carotid artery stenting (CAS) were performed for acute cerebral infarction with free-floating thrombosis (FFT) in left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. Good results were obtained.
OBSERVATIONS: A 63-year-old man developed sudden disturbance of consciousness and right hemiplegia. He was transported to the authors' hospital by an emergency vehicle. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed acute cerebral infarction in the left middle cerebral artery region, and magnetic resonance angiography showed poor vascular flow beyond the left ICA. Emergency angiography revealed severe stenosis at the origin of the left ICA and a free-floating thrombus attached to the stenosis and extending to the peripheral side. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed on the stenosis with proximal protection, the thrombus was aspirated under reversal flow, and CAS was performed without exacerbation of clinical symptoms.
LESSONS: PTA, thrombus aspiration, and CAS under reversal flow may be effective treatments for FFT caused by ICA stenosis.
