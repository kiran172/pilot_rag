Title: Idiopathic subglottic stenosis in Saskatchewan Hutterite population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: By studying the odds of developing idiopathic subglottic stenosis in the isolated and genetically unique Hutterite population, this study sought to strengthen the hypothesis that an underlying genetic predisposition may exist for its development.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review examined the medical records of all adult patients treated for idiopathic subglottic stenosis in Saskatchewan between 2008 and 2018. Cases were segregated into Hutterite and non-Hutterite.
RESULTS: Four out of 36 cases of idiopathic subglottic stenosis occurred among Hutterites. The odds of a Hutterite developing idiopathic subglottic stenosis are 21.89 times higher than for non-Hutterites. Positive family history was only observed in the Hutterite population.
CONCLUSION: The study strengthens the hypothesis that genetics may play a role in the aetiology of idiopathic subglottic stenosis by demonstrating that the genetically and socially unique Hutterites are more likely to develop this rare disease. This study is the first to demonstrate that a specific subpopulation is at a higher risk for developing idiopathic subglottic stenosis.
