Title: Aortic Stenosis: New Insights in Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valvular heart diseases and the number of patients with AS is expected to increase globally as the older population is growing fast. Since the majority of patients are elderly, AS is no longer a simple valvular heart disease of left ventricular outflow obstruction but is accompanied by other cardiac and comorbid conditions. Because of the significant variations of the disease, identifying patients at high risk and even earlier detection of patients with AS before developing symptomatic severe AS is becoming increasingly important. With the proven of efficacy and safety of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the severe AS population, there is a growing interest in applying TAVR in those with less than severe AS. A medical therapy to reduce or prevent the progression in AS is actively investigated by several randomized control trials. In this review, we will summarize the most recent findings in AS and discuss potential future management strategies of patients with AS.
