Title: Impact of Valvulo-Arterial Impedance on Long-Term Quality of Life and Exercise Performance After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In aortic stenosis, valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva) estimates the overall left ventricular afterload (valve and arterial component). We investigated the association of Zva (≥5 versus &lt;5 mm Hg mL-1 m-2) on quality of life (QOL) and exercise performance (EP) ≥1 year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: The study population consists of 250 TAVR patients in whom baseline Zva and follow-up QOL was prospectively assessed using EuroQOL-5-dimensions instruments; EP was assessed in 192 patients who survived ≥1 year after TAVR using questionnaires related to daily activities. In 124 patients, Zva at 1-year was also available and was used to study the change in Zva (baseline to 1 year) on QOL/EP.
RESULTS: Elevated baseline Zva was present in 125 patients (50%). At a median of 28 (IQR, 17-40) months, patients with elevated baseline Zva were more limited in mobility (88% versus 71%; P=0.004), self-care (40% versus 25%; P=0.019), and independent daily activities (taking a shower: 53% versus 38%, P=0.030; walking 100 meter: 76% versus 54%, P=0.001; and walking stairs: 74% versus 54%, P=0.011). By multivariable analysis, elevated Zva predicted unfavorable QOL (lower EuroQOL-5-dimensions-Utility Index, odds ratio, 1.98; CI, 1.15-3.41) and unfavorable EP (any limitation in ≥3 daily activities, odds ratio, 2.55; CI, 1.41-4.62). After TAVR, the proportion of patients with elevated Zva fell from 50% to 21% and remained 21% at 1 year and was found to be associated with more limitations in mobility, self-care, and daily activities compared with patients with Zva &lt;5 mm Hg mL-1 m-2.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Zva was seen in half of patients and predicted unfavorable long-term QOL and EP. At 1 year after TAVR, the prevalence of elevated Zva was 21% but remained associated with poor QOL/EP.
