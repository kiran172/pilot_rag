Title: Cardiac exercise imaging using a 3-tesla magnetic resonance-conditional pedal ergometer: Preliminary results in healthy volunteers and patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) remains underutilized as an exercise imaging modality, mostly because of the limited availability of MR-compatible exercise equipment. This study prospectively evaluates the clinical feasibility of a newly developed MR-conditional pedal ergometer for exercise CMR METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers (mean age 44 ± 16 years) and 11 patients (mean age 60 ± 9 years) with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent rest and post-exercise cinematic 3T CMR. Visual analysis of wall motion abnormalities (WMA) was rated by 2 experienced radiologists, and volumes and ejection fractions (EF) were determined. Image quality was assessed by a 4-point Likert scale for visibility of endocardial borders.
RESULTS: Median subjective image quality of real-time cine at rest was 1 (interquartile range [IQR] 1-2) and 2 (IQR 2-2.5) for post-exercise real-time cine (p = 0.001). Exercise induced a significant increase in heart rate (62 [62-73] to 111 [104-143] bpm, p < 0.0001). Stroke volume and cardiac index increased from resting to post-exercise conditions (85 ± 21 to 101 ± 19 mL and 2.9 ± 0.7 to 6.6 ± 1.9 L/min/m2, respectively; both p < 0.0001), driven by a reduction in end-systolic volume (55 ± 20 to 42 ± 21 mL, p < 0.0001). Patients (2/11) with inducible regional WMA at high-resolution postexercise cine imaging revealed significant coronary artery stenosis in subsequently performed invasive coronary angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-CMR using our newly developed 3T MR-conditional pedal ergometer is clinically feasible. Imaging of both cardiac response and myocardial ischemia, triggered by dynamic stress, is rapidly conducted while the patient is near their peak heart rate.
