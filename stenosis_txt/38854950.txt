Title: Contrast-enhanced CT and PET-CT characteristics of primary tracheal lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma: case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary tracheal lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is extremely rare, with only a few cases reported so far, and few studies have focused on the radiological features. This study aimed to investigate contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) presentations of primary tracheal LELC to improve diagnosis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical and imaging data of 13 patients with confirmed primary tracheal LELC between December 2013 and August 2022. We analyzed the radiological profiles of lesions on the CECT and PET-CT images.
RESULTS: In 92.3% (12/13) of the cases, primary tracheal LELC lesions predominantly occurred in the thoracic segment. They manifested as singular, wide-based, eccentric, irregular nodules, or exhibited mass-like thickening of the tracheal wall with invasive growth both internally and externally along the wall. The thickest dimension of the lesion ranged from 9 to 28 mm, affecting a length of 30.8±13.5 mm. Luminal stenosis was evident in all patients, with the narrowest point reaching a stenosis rate of 85%. Lesion margins were clear in 69.2% (9/13), indistinct in 23.1% (3/13), and unclear in 7.7% (1/13) of all cases. Among the patients, 92.3% (12/13) exhibited a relatively uniform density on CT plain scans, with a CT value of 44.5±7.8 Hounsfield units (HU). Enhancement scans revealed moderate to marked enhancement in 75% (9/12) of cases. In 2 cases undergoing PET-CT examination, lesion standardized uptake values (SUVs) were 4.4 and 5.1, whereas enlarged lymph node SUVs were 7.7 and 6.3, respectively. Mediastinal lymph node enlargement was observed in 8 patients (61.5%, 8/13), with a maximum short axis of 11.1±5.5 mm. After treatment, 9 out of 12 patients (75%) showed no evidence of distant metastasis upon CT re-examination.
CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of primary tracheal LELC allows for curative resection and may lead to a favorable prognosis. It presents with characteristic CT findings, and the utilization of PET-CT improves diagnosis and staging.
