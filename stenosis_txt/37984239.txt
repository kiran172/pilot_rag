Title: [Bilateral sub-acute upper limb ischemia revealing Horton's disease, a rare presentation : A case report and literature review].

Abstract: STUDY'S GOAL: Our goal is to enrich the medical literature by sharing our experience in managing a case of sub-acute upper limb ischemia that revealed Horton's disease. This is particularly relevant given the current lack of well-established guidelines.
INTRODUCTION: Acute upper limb ischemia is rarely seen in Horton's disease.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 63-year-old female patient with sub-acute ischemia in both upper limbs, accompanied by jaw claudication and absence of bilateral temporal pulses. The CT Angiography scan revealed bilateral occlusions and stenosis of the axillary and sub-clavier arteries, as well as involvement of the external carotid arteries and its branches. The Arteriography confirmed abnormalities in the medium-sized arteries of the supra-aortic trunks. The histopathology examination of the temporal artery biopsy was negative. The patient received emergency corticosteroid therapy followed by an immunosuppressant. Due to the improved clinical condition of the upper limbs, surgical intervention was not performed.
