Title: Congenital Pulmonic Valve Dysfunction Treated With SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve (from the COMPASSION S3 Trial).

Abstract: Significant pulmonary regurgitation (PR) and pulmonary stenosis are common after surgical repair of some congenital heart defects. This prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial enrolled patients who underwent transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation with a SAPIEN 3 valve to treat dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) conduits or pulmonic surgical valves (≥ moderate PR and/or mean RVOT gradient ≥35 mm Hg). The primary end point was a nonhierarchical composite of THV dysfunction at 1 year comprising RVOT reintervention, ≥ moderate total PR, and mean RVOT gradient >40 mm Hg. A performance goal of <25% of upper confidence interval (CI) was prespecified for the primary end point, using a 95% exact binomial CI. Patients (n = 58) were enrolled between July 5, 2016 and July 17, 2018, with mean age of 32 years. Prestenting was performed in 53.4%. At discharge, the device success was 98.1% (single valve without explant, < moderate PR, gradient <35 mm Hg). At 30 days, there were no major adjudicated adverse clinical events. At 1 year, the primary end point composite was 4.3% (95% CI 0.5 to 14.5). The composite components were 0% (0 of 56) RVOT reintervention, 2.1% (1 of 47) ≥ moderate PR, and 2.1% (1 of 48) mean RVOT gradient >40 mm Hg. No mortality, endocarditis, thrombosis, or stent fracture were reported at 1 year. In conclusion, the SAPIEN 3 THV was safe and effective in patients with dysfunctional RVOT conduits or previously implanted valves in the pulmonic position to 1 year.
