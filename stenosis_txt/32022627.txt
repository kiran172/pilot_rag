Title: Modified meatotympanoplasty for external auditory canal stenosis and lateralized tympanic membrane: a preliminary study.

Abstract: Background: The surgical treatment of external auditory canal stenosis (EACS) and lateralized tympanic membrane (LTM) is challenging because there is a high risk of postoperative complications.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative hearing levels and other outcomes of 10 cases with EACS and LTM.Materials and methods: This was a retrospective preliminary study of patients with EACS and LTM who underwent meatotympanoplasty from 2008 to 2018. Their mean age at surgery was 31.6 years. The surgeries were performed taking into consideration the following: (1) creating a large EAC and functioning tympanic membrane (TM) and (2) avoiding complete mastoidectomy to prevent postoperative cavity problems.Results: The mean follow-up period was 3 years 10 months. The average preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) were 40.4 dB and 23.0 dB, respectively, and there was a significant difference. A postoperative ABG less than 30 dB was achieved in 80% (8/10) of patients. Four cases had postoperative complications (re-stenosis of the EAC and/or re-lateralization of the TM).Conclusions and significance: The postoperative results presented were comparable to those of previous surgical techniques; however, further development is needed to prevent postoperative complications and earn better hearing results.
