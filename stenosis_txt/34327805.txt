Title: Long-term Outcomes of Stent Placement Inside the Bile Duct for Biliary Strictures After Living Donor Liver Transplantation.

Abstract: In living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), anastomotic biliary stricture is a serious and refractory complication. In this study, we reviewed the transition of post-LDLT anastomotic biliary strictures and evaluated long-term outcomes of stent placement inside the bile duct, which is referred to as an "inside-stent." Of 805 consecutive adult LDLT recipients in our institution (2000-2018), we reviewed 639 patients with duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction and analyzed chronological changes of post-LDLT biliary strictures. Moreover, we focused on the year 2006 when various surgical modifications were introduced and compared the details of post-LDLT biliary strictures before and after 2006, especially focusing on the long-term outcome of inside-stent placement. The proportion of left lobe grafts had increased from 1.8% before 2005 to 39.3% after 2006 (P < 0.001) to maximize the living donor safety. Overall, post-LDLT anastomotic biliary strictures occurred in 21.3% of the patients with a median follow-up period of 106.1 months, which was decreased from 32.6% before 2005 to 12.8% after 2006 (P < 0.001). Anastomotic biliary strictures were less frequent in patients with left lobe grafts than with right lobe grafts (9.4% versus 25.4%; P < 0.001). The overall technical success rate of inside-stent placement was 82.4%, with an improvement from 75.3% before 2005 up to 95.7% after 2006 (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the stricture resolution rate remained high at approximately 90% throughout the observation period. Increased use of left lobe grafts with several surgical modifications significantly reduced post-LDLT anastomotic biliary strictures, leading to favorable long-term outcomes of inside-stent placements for this condition.
