Title: Migrated Pancreaticojejunal Stent Forming a Stent-Stone Complex in the Jejunum with Resultant Small Bowel Obstruction: A Case Report.

Abstract: Transanastomotic pancreatic duct stent placement during reconstruction following pancreaticoduodenectomy is widely performed to prevent postoperative pancreatic fistulas and duct stenosis. However, stent-related complications, such as stent occlusion and migration, may occur. Here, we report a rare case of a migrated pancreatic duct plastic stent. After pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, the stent migrated to the jejunum and served as a nidus of the stent-stone complex, which developed jejunal obstruction. The stent-stone complex was removed by explorative laparotomy.
