Title: Don't Trust the Imaging: Necrotic Bowel Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Through Aortic Stent Graft.

Abstract: Mesenteric ischemia is a rare but lethal complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We present a challenging case of an 80-year-old man who had abdominal pain few hours following TAVR. Repeated abdominal andÂ pelvic imaging showed no vascular obstruction, but exploratory laparoscopy revealed a necrotic bowel. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
