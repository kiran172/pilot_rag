Title: Hybrid angioplasty-catheter placement procedure performed in a hemodialysis patient with central venous obstruction disease. Presentation of a case.

Abstract: Obstruction or occlusion of the central veins (Central venous disease, CVD) represents a major complication in hemodialysis patients (HD) limiting central venous access available for a central venous catheter placement. Endovascular treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the first therapeutic option to restore patency and gain access. This case presents our initial experience of a HD patient with CVD treated with a combination therapy of a balloon PTA to the left brachiocephalic trunk, through the right hepatic vein and standard catheter placement technique to the previously occluded junction of the left internal jugular vein to the left subclavian vein.
