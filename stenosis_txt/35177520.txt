Title: Long-term Clinical Outcomes Following Endoscopic Foraminoplasty for Patients With Single-Level Foraminal Stenosis of the Lumbar Spine.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and long-term clinical outcomes of transforaminal endoscopic foraminoplasty using local anesthesia and total intravenous analgesia (TIVA) in patients with single-level lumbar foraminal stenosis and unilateral leg pain.
METHODS: Postoperative pain relief was self-evaluated by 46 consecutive patients using a visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Patient scores were obtained before the procedure and at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after surgery.
RESULTS: Pain reduction of at least 50% in the VAS score and a decrease of at least 50% or more in ODI score was achieved in 37 of 46 patients throughout the follow-up period. Median VAS score decreased from 7.5 preoperatively to 2.5 postoperatively. Median ODI score decreased from 62% preoperatively to 15% postoperatively. All patients reached 24-month follow-up and 37 patients reached 60-month follow-up. There were no surgery-related complications.
CONCLUSION: Transforaminal endoscopic foraminoplasty performed under local anesthesia and TIVA produces sustained reduction in pain and improves functionality in patients with single-level lumbar foraminal stenosis without complications even in patients with comorbidities.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Endoscopic foraminoplasty may be a useful adjunct to open micro decompressive surgery for patients with foraminal stenosis of the lumbar spine LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
