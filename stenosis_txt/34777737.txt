Title: Diagnosis of Cardiac Rehabilitation after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients by Emission Computed Tomography Image Features under Filtered Back Projection Reconstruction Algorithm.

Abstract: This study aimed to explore the application value of emission computed tomography (ECT) imaging technology based on filtered back projection reconstruction algorithm (FBP) in cardiac function examination after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Eighty patients with myocardial infarction diagnosed by medical history, electrocardiograph (ECG), and myocardial enzyme admitted to hospital from February 2018 to February 2019 were selected as the research objects. All patients underwent PCI seven days after the onset of myocardial infarction. ECT was performed for all patients before and after surgery. In addition, all ECT images were processed by the FBP reconstruction algorithm. On this basis, preoperative and postoperative cardiac surgery function and ischemia of the patients were diagnosed. Then, the diagnostic results were compared with the results of coronary angiography and echocardiogram. The results showed that all patients had a total of 541 segments before PCI surgery. ECT examination revealed 294 abnormal segments of the ventricular wall, with a total score of 585 points. A total of 100 segments were scored with 1 point, a total of 194 segments were scored with 2 points, and a total of 50 segments were scored with 3 points. After PCI, the number of abnormal segments was reduced to 58, with a total score of 193. There were 6 segments with a score of 1, 44 segments with a score of 2, and 5 segments with a score of 3. The left ventricular diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (CO), and ejection fraction (EF) of the patients before the operation were 148 ± 16 mL, 77 ± 14.5 mL, 4.29 ± 0.37 L/min, and 41.9 ± 8%, respectively. The EDV, ESV, CO, and EF of the patients after surgery were 132 ± 16 mL, 62 ± 13 mL, 4.89 ± 0.71, and 53 ± 6%, respectively. Significant changes occurred in various systolic function parameters before and after surgery, P &lt; 0.05. The standardized regression coefficients of the three groups were 0.32, 0.41, and 0.47, respectively, P &lt; 0.05, which indicated that the greater the coronary artery stenosis rate, the higher the diagnostic coincidence rate of left anterior descending limb (LAD), left circumflex branch (LCX), and left coronary artery (RCA). The conformity of ECT imaging in the LCX group for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia was higher than that of UCG, P &lt; 0.05. To sum up, the ECT technology based on the FBP reconstruction algorithm had a good application prospect in the diagnosis of cardiac function recovery in AMI patients after PCI.
