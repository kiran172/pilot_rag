Title: Expanding the Spectrum of TEER Suitability: Evidence From the EXPAND G4 Post Approval Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anatomical and clinical criteria to define mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) "unsuitability" have been proposed on the basis of a Heart Valve Collaboratory consensus opinion from physician experience with early-generation TEER devices but lacked an evidence-based approach.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the spectrum of TEER suitability using echocardiographic and clinical outcomes from the EXPAND G4 real-world postapproval study.
METHODS: EXPAND G4 is a global, prospective, multicenter, single-arm study that enrolled 1,164 subjects with mitral regurgitation (MR) treated with the MitraClip G4 System. Three groups were defined using the Heart Valve Collaboratory TEER unsuitability criteria: 1) risk of stenosis (RoS); 2) risk of inadequate MR reduction (RoIR); and 3) subjects with baseline moderate or less MR (MMR). A TEER-suitable (TS) group was defined by the absence of these characteristics. Endpoints included independent core laboratory-assessed echocardiographic characteristics, procedural outcomes, MR reduction, NYHA functional class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, and major adverse events through 30 days.
RESULTS: Subjects in the RoS (n = 56), RoIR (n = 54), MMR (n = 326), and TS (n = 303) groups had high 30-day MR reduction rates (≤1+: RoS 97%, MMR 93%, and TS 91%; ≤2+: RoIR 94%). Thirty-day improvements in functional capacity (NYHA functional class I or II at 30 days vs baseline: RoS 94% vs 29%, RoIR 88% vs 30%, MMR 79% vs 26%, and TS 83% vs 33%) and quality of life (change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score: RoS +27 ± 26, RoIR +16 ± 26, MMR +19 ± 26, and TS +19 ± 24) were safely achieved in all groups, with low major adverse events (<3%) and all-cause mortality (RoS 1.8%, RoIR 0%, MMR 1.5%, and TS 1.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients previously deemed TEER unsuitable can be safely and effectively treated with the mitral TEER fourth-generation device.
