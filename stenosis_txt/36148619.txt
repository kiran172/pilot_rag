Title: Experimental study of a heparin-coated venous stent fabricated by atomic layer deposition.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of heparin-coated venous stents in animals.
METHODS: We used atomic layer deposition technology to obtain a heparin coating with good stability and then prepared a heparin-coated venous stent based on this technology. The experimental stents were prepared according to the diameter of the rabbit inferior vena cava and were divided into Ni-Ti alloy stent group, Ni-Ti-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> stent group and Ni-Ti-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-Heparin stent group. 3 days, 7 days and 14 days after stent implantation, the materials were collected, and the three groups of stents were observed by hard tissue section pathology, immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscope to observe the differences in vascular wall inflammation, thrombosis, lumen stenosis and vascular intima regeneration.
RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The experiment confirmed the safety of the heparin-coated stent in vivo. Compared with the control group, the experimental group showed a high degree of vascular endothelialization and an intact neointimal structure 14 days after implantation. The long-term safety and biological effects of heparin-coated venous stents in animals require further study.
