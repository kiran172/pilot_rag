Title: Laparoscopic Davydov vs. laparoscopic Vecchietti neovaginoplasty in women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome; a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To summarize the available evidence on the laparoscopic Davydov and Vecchietti methods to create a neovagina and to compare these techniques with a focus on neovaginal length, sexual function, operative time, and complications.
DESIGN: A systematic electronic search up to August 2022 using PubMed and Embase is performed.
SETTING: Not applicable.
PATIENTS: Women with Mayer-Rokistansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome.
INTERVENTIONS: All published clinical studies concerning the laparoscopic Davydov and laparoscopic Vecchietti procedures as a surgical technique to create a neovagina in women with Mayer-Rokistansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome were obtained. The guidelines for the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis were followed. The following data were extracted: operative time, hospital stay, major early complications (within 3 months postsurgery), dilation therapy, neovaginal length, vaginal discharge, vaginal stenosis, time to sexual activity, sexual satisfaction, penetrative sexual activity, dyspareunia, score on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and duration of follow-up. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of articles.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neovaginal length, FSFI scores, operative time, and complications.
RESULTS: A total of 1,163 articles were identified, of which 33 studies were included in this systematic review. Of these, 12 studies (380 patients) are related to the Davydov method, 19 studies (1,126 patients) to the Vecchietti method, and 2 articles concern both. There is clinical heterogeneity and variety in the quality of the studies. Eighteen studies were included in the meta-analyses. The mean neovaginal length 12 months after the Davydov method is 8.3 cm (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.1-8.6), vs. 8.7 cm (95% CI 7.2-10.3) after the Vecchietti method. The mean FSFI score after the Davydov method is 28.9 (95% CI 26.8-31.1), compared with 27.5 (95% CI 25.0-30.1) after the Vecchietti method. The operative time of the Davydov method is 126 minutes (95% CI 109-143), compared with 40 minutes (95% CI 35-45) of the Vecchietti method.
CONCLUSIONS: The operations yield comparable neovaginal length, sexual function, and complication rates. The mean FSFI scores indicate no sexual dysfunction in either group. The operative time of the Davydov method is significantly longer. There is no superiority shown for one of the surgical techniques in functional terms.
