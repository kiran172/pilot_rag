Title: [Catheter-based and surgical treatment for aortic valve diseases].

Abstract: The pathophysiology of aortic valve diseases is of predominantly degenerative nature, characterized by calcific aortic valve stenosis, which is associated with a reduction in prognosis. The prevalence of aortic valve insufficiency also increases with advancing age. Timely causal treatment is crucial in the management of aortic valve diseases. Following the indication for intervention, the heart team plays a central role in evaluating the results and making therapeutic decisions that consider the patient's preferences. In the assessment of treatment options, considerations regarding the long-term perspective are particularly crucial, especially in younger patients. The most common therapeutic approach for aortic valve diseases is the introduction of a new valve prosthesis. In the majority of cases, this is now achieved through catheter-based implantation of a bioprosthetic heart valve, known as transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Open surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is favored in younger patients with low surgical risk or in the case that TAVI is not feasible. In AVR, both biological and the longest-lasting mechanical prosthesis types are used. Surgical repair techniques are primarily applied in cases of aortic valve regurgitation. Notably, TAVI, as well as surgical procedures for the treatment of aortic valve diseases, have undergone significant advancements in recent years, including expanded indications for TAVI and, on the surgical side, in particular the development of minimally invasive surgical techniques.
