Title: Diagnostic utility of sortilin & other biomarkers in the diagnosis of carotid & coronary atherosclerosis in individuals with arterial hypertension.

Abstract: Background & objectives Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The aim of this investigation was to study the role of biological markers in predicting the risk of carotid and coronary artery atherosclerosis. Methods A total of 161 males in the age group of 30-65 yr were included in this study. All participants underwent biochemical analyses [cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, glucose, (interleukin) IL-8, IL-10, (proprotein convertase inhibitors subtilisin/kexin type 9) PCSK9, sortilin, creatinine]; ECG; echocardiography; coronary angiography; ultrasound doppler of brachiocephalic arteries. Based on PCSK9 levels, participants were divided into four groups: group 1, n=41 individuals with PCSK9 level of 100-250 ng/ml; group 2, n=37 individuals with PCSK9 level of 251-400 ng/ml; group 3, n=51 individuals with PCSK9 level of 401-600 ng/ml and group 4, n=32 individuals with PCSK9 level of 601-900 ng/ml. Results Sortilin level was the highest in group 2. Group 3 individuals had the highest level of IL-8. Correlation analysis of the entire data set revealed the relationship of relative left ventricular thickness index with age, cardiovascular risk, body mass index, intima-media thickness and left ventricular mass index; sortilin had a negative relationship of weak strength with age and smoking, a direct relationship between the risk of cardiovascular complications and with IL-10. Interpretation & conclusions Sortilin is the innovative marker of CVDs. In the present investigation, we demonstrated the clear increase in the inflammatory markers (IL-8) in individuals with subclinical atherosclerosis. This fact can be explained by the oxygen stress activation. In individuals with coronary artery stenosis (50% and more), the increase in IL-10 levels demonstrates, to our opinion, the activation of antioxidant protection activation.
