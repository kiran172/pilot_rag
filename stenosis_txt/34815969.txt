Title: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (Dunbar syndrome).

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare condition which is due to the compression of celiac trunk by low riding of fibrous attachments of median arcuate ligament and diaphragmatic crura. Technically, MALS is a diagnosis of exclusion, consisting of vague symptoms comprising of postprandial epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting and unexplained weight loss. Different imaging modalities like Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and mesenteric angiogram are helpful to demonstrate celiac axis compression. The goal of treatment is decompression of celiac trunk either by open, laparoscopic or robotic method along with adjuvant interventional procedures like percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting. Surgical is the mainstay of treatment. This approach is based on open, laparoscopic or robotic release of compressed ligament along with celiac ganglionectomy and celiac artery revascularization. The role of interventional radiology is limited to angioplasty and stenting to open the stenosis rather than addressing the underlying compression of celiac trunk which has resulted in the symptoms. However, both the diagnosis and therapeutic intervention remains challenging. Extensive evaluation of etiology and pathophysiology of MALS and addressing the same through minimally invasive techniques may yield best prognosis in future. In this review article, we discuss briefly about the MALS in terms of etiology, diagnosis and its management including the role of interventional radiology.
