Title: Correlation between CT angiography and digital subtraction angiography in acute ischemic strokes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: CT angiography (CTA) is not necessarily performed for all acute ischemic strokes due to variations in national guidelines across different regions. It follows that in the absence of CTA, missed identification of large vessel occlusion (LVO) potentially leads to opportunity lost for endovascular thrombectomy. Although the accuracy of CTA is well validated in chronic arterial stenosis, it has not been adequately investigated in acute ischemic stroke. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of CTA compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in detecting LVO in acute ischemic stroke.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of acute ischemic strokes with large vessel occlusion which underwent endovascular thrombectomy. We included patients who had a CTA prior to DSA and did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. Images were reviewed by 2 blinded assessors. Positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTA were calculated against DSA.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included. The median age was 67 (IQR 57-78) and 46 (59.7 %) were male. Median NIHSS was 18 (IQR 12-22). There were 284 arterial segments categorized into 215 anterior arterial segments in 54 patients and 69 posterior arterial segments in 23 patients. The median time between CTA and DSA was 126 min (IQR 91-153 min). CTA showed PPV of 91.1 % and NPV of 95.1 % compared with DSA.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that CTA was reasonably accurate in identifying large vessel occlusion in acute ischemic stroke. We propose that current regional guidelines should include CTA for all acute ischemic strokes.
