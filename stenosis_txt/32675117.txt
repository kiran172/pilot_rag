Title: Successful curative surgery for postoperative oesophageal recurrence of oesophagogastric junction cancer.

Abstract: A man in his 70s had undergone total gastrectomy for oesophagogastric junction cancer. Three years and 11 months later, he began to vomit after meals and was diagnosed with mediastinal recurrence of oesophagogastric junction cancer. A CT scan showed that the tumour was suspected of infiltrating the aorta and lung. He received two cycles of chemotherapy with S-1 plus cisplatin, resulting in tumour reduction. The patient underwent resection of the lower oesophagus, including the tumour, the left lower lobe of the lung and the pericardium through a left thoracoabdominal incision. This is the first report of a patient surgically resected for postoperative oesophageal recurrence of oesophagogastric junction cancer. Although most postoperative recurrences of oesophagogastric junction cancer are far advanced at the time of diagnosis and prognosis is poor, chemotherapy followed by surgery may improve the prognosis of patients with locoregional recurrence.
