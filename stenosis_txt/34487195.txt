Title: Comprehensive Evaluation of Cerebral Hemodynamics and Oxygen Metabolism in Revascularization of Asymptomatic High-Grade Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Revascularization procedures in carotid artery stenosis have shown a positive effect in the restoration of cerebral oxygen metabolism as assessed by T2' (T2 prime) imaging as well as capillary homeostasis by measurement of capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH); however, data in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis without manifest brain lesions are scarce.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effect of revascularization on the hemodynamic profile and capillary homeostasis was evaluated in 13 patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis without ischemic brain lesions using dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging and oxygenation-sensitive T2' mapping before and 6-8 weeks after revascularization by endarterectomy or stenting. The cognitive performance at both timepoints was further assessed.
RESULTS: Perfusion impairment at baseline was accompanied by an increased CTH (p = 0.008) in areas with a time to peak delay ≥ 2 s in the affected hemisphere compared to contralateral regions. Carotid intervention improved the overall moderate hemodynamic impairment at baseline by leading to an increase in normalized cerebral blood flow (p = 0.017) and a decrease in mean transit time (p = 0.027), oxygen extraction capacity (OEC) (p = 0.033) and CTH (p = 0.048). The T2' values remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: This study presents novel evidence of a state of altered microvascular function in patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis in the absence of ischemic brain lesions, which shows sustained normalization after revascularization procedures.
