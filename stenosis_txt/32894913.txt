Title: [Efficacy and influencing factors of interventional bronchoscopy for the treatment of scarring airway stenosis: a multicenter retrospective investigation from China].

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of interventional bronchoscopy for the treatment of scarring airway stenosis and to analyze the influencing factors related to the success rate. Methods: Between January 2013 to December 2016, 301 patients with scarring airway stenosis treated by interventional bronchoscopy in 18 tertiary hospitals were reviewed retrospectively. The methods of interventional bronchoscopy included electric knife cutting, laser cauterization, balloon dilation, cryotherapy, local drug usage and/or stenting. Airway stenosis characteristics and patients' performance status at baseline and after interventional bronchoscopy were recorded. The interval days between the first two interventional bronchoscopy treatment (maintained patency time) and the final treatment efficacy were recorded. Results: The clinical stability rate of interventional bronchoscopy for the treatment of scarring tracheal stenosis was 67.8% (204/301) . Stenosis sites (OR 1.548; 95% CI: 1.038-2.307, P=0.032) , dyspnea index (OR 2.140; 95% CI: 1.604-2.855, P&lt;0.001) , and interventional method (OR 0.458; 95% CI: 0.267-0.787, P=0.005) were independent predictors associated with the efficacy of interventional bronchoscopy treatment. Stenosis sites (OR 1.508; 95% CI: 1.273-1.787, P&lt;0.001) , stenosis grade (OR 1.581; 95% CI: 1.029-2.067, P=0.001) , anesthesia method (OR 1.581; 95% CI: 1.029-2.067, P&lt;0.001) , and local drug usage (OR 1.304; 95% CI: 1.135-1.497, P&lt;0.001) were independent predictors associated with the maintained patency time after first interventional bronchoscopy treatment. Conclusion: Interventional bronchoscopy is a useful treatment method for scarring airway stenosis. Enough attention should be paid to influencing factors in order to improve treatment efficacy during the treatment process.
