Title: Early Adventitial Activation and Proliferation in a Mouse Model of Arteriovenous Stenosis: Opportunities for Intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) stenosis remains an important cause of AVF maturation failure, for which there are currently no effective therapies. We examined the pattern and phenotype of cellular proliferation at different timepoints in a mouse model characterized by a peri-anastomotic AVF stenosis.
METHODS: Standard immunohistochemical analyses for cellular proliferation and macrophage infiltration were performed at 2, 7 and 14 d on our validated mouse model of AVF stenosis to study the temporal profile, geographical location and cellular phenotype of proliferating and infiltrating cells in this model.
RESULTS: Adventitial proliferation and macrophage infiltration (into the adventitia) began at 2 d, peaked at 7 d and then declined over time. Surprisingly, there was minimal macrophage infiltration or proliferation in the neointimal region at either 7 or 14 d, although endothelial cell proliferation increased rapidly between 2 d and 7 d, and peaked at 14 d.
CONCLUSIONS: Early and rapid macrophage infiltration and cellular proliferation within the adventitia could play an important role in the downstream pathways of both neointimal hyperplasia and inward or outward remodelling.
