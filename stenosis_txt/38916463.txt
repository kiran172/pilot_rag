Title: [Cardiac amyloidosis and aortic stenosis: what do we know?].

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis and cardiac amyloidosis, particularly transthyretin-related, often coexist and share a common clinical and demographic profile. Several pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed regarding the causes of this association, neither of which fully substantiated in practice. The key to detect the coexistence of cardiac amyloidosis and aortic valve stenosis lies in clinical suspicion. It is possible to hypothesize concurrent cardiac amyloidosis in patients with aortic valve stenosis with the aid of clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and extracardiac "red flags". Subsequent non-invasive diagnostic steps are often sufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis. The early diagnosis of this condition is pivotal since the presence of dual pathology worsens patient's prognosis, especially without intervention. Available data on treatment show a better outcome in terms of survival and cardiovascular events in patients undergoing percutaneous correction of valvular heart disease rather than medical therapy alone, regardless of the presence of cardiac amyloidosis. Furthermore, it seems that cardiac amyloidosis does not impact survival after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, even if higher rates of rehospitalizations have been described. Indeed, percutaneous treatment of valvular heart disease is currently considered the primary therapeutic option. Subsequently a disease-modifying treatment for transthyretin amyloidosis may be considered in order to delay disease progression and improve outcomes, even if specific data are still lacking.
