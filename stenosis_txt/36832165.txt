Title: Spectral CT Imaging of Prosthetic Valve Embolization after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter heart valve (THV) embolization is a rare complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) generally caused by malpositioning, sizing inaccuracies and pacing failures. The consequences are related to the site of embolization, ranging from a silent clinical picture when the device is stably anchored in the descending aorta to potentially fatal outcomes (e.g., obstruction of flow to vital organs, aortic dissection, thrombosis, etc.). Here, we present the case of a 65-year-old severely obese woman affected by severe aortic valve stenosis who underwent TAVI complicated by embolization of the device. The patient underwent spectral CT angiography that allowed for improved image quality by means of virtual monoenergetic reconstructions, permitting optimal pre-procedural planning. She was successfully re-treated with implantation of a second prosthetic valve a few weeks later.
