Title: Expanding the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome: First patient from India.

Abstract: Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WWS) is a rare disorder characterized by hypotonia, postnatal growth restriction, striking facial dysmorphism, and hirsutism. It is caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in KMT2A. This gene has an established role in histone methylation, which explains the overlap of WWS with syndromes caused by genes involved in chromatin remodeling. We describe an infant with a novel single base pair deletion in KMT2A with features consistent with WWS, as well as additional features of stenosis of aqueduct of Sylvius and broad toes. The usefulness of Face2Gene as a tool for identification of dysmorphology syndromes is discussed, as in this patient, it suggested WWS as the top candidate disorder. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first patient of WWS reported from India, with a novel genotype and expanded phenotype.
