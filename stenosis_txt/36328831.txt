Title: Meta-Analysis on the Association Between Nutritional Status and Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Malnutrition is a common co-morbidity among candidates for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study aimed to investigate the association between nutritional status determined by objective nutritional indices and outcomes of patients who underwent TAVI. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library from inception until April 18, 2022 to identify studies examining the association of preprocedural nutritional status with post-TAVI outcomes. Malnutrition was defined by objective nutritional indices-controlling nutritional index, nutritional risk index, geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI). The primary end point was 1-year all-cause mortality. The review included 13 observational studies and 6,785 patients who underwent TAVI. Malnutrition was associated with a higher risk of 1-year all-cause mortality, as defined by either the controlling nutritional index (hazard ratio [HR] 2.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21 to 6.03, p = 0.015), GNRI (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.93, p = 0.021), or PNI (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.23, p <0.001). In the meta-analysis of adjusted results, lower GNRI was independently associated with higher 1-year mortality (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.50, p = 0.006). Lower GNRI was associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury (relative risk [RR] 2.21, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.99, p <0.001) and 1-year cardiovascular mortality (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.66 to 3.78, p <0.001). Lower PNI was associated with a higher risk of major vascular complications (RR 2.99, 95% CI 1.38 to 6.51, p = 0.006). In conclusion, baseline malnutrition, as assessed by objective indices, is associated with worse outcomes after TAVI. Future studies should focus on the value of nutritional assessment and interventions to improve nutritional status in patients who underwent TAVI.
