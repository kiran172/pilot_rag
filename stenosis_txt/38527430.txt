Title: Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty with or without Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Era.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The role of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) in the era of transcatheter aortic valve replacement remains a topic of debate. We sought to study the safety and feasibility of combined BAV and percutaneous coronary intervention (BAV-PCI).
METHODS: Between November 2009 and July 2020, all patients undergoing BAV were identified and divided into three groups: combined BAV-PCI (group A), BAV with significant unrevascularised CAD (group B), and BAV without significant CAD (group C). Procedural outcomes and 30-day and one-year mortality were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were studied (n = 84, 93, and 87 patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively). The STS score was 10.2 ± 8, 13.3 ± 19, and 8.1 ± 7, p = 0.026, in groups A, B, and C, respectively. VARC-3 adjudicated complications were similar among groups (11%, 13%, and 5%, respectively, p = 0.168, respectively). Thirty-day and one-year mortality were 9.8% (n = 26) and 32% (n = 86) of the entire cohort. The differences among groups did not reach statistical significance. Using univariate Cox regression analysis, group B patients were at higher risk of dying compared to group A patients (HR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.11-2.25, p = 0.010). With multivariate Cox regression analysis, the predictors of mortality were STS score, cardiogenic shock, mode of presentation, and lack of subsequent definitive valve intervention.
CONCLUSION: In high-risk patients with aortic valve stenosis, combined BAV-PCI is safe and feasible with comparable outcomes to BAV with and without significant CAD.
