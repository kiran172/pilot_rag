Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of Intestinal Ultrasound in the Detection of Intra-Abdominal Complications in Crohn's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease [CD] is frequently associated with the development of strictures and penetrating complications. Intestinal ultrasound [IUS] is a non-invasive imaging modality ideal for point-of-care assessment. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we provide a current overview on the diagnostic accuracy of IUS and its advanced modalities in the detection of intra-abdominal complications in CD compared to endoscopy, cross-sectional imaging, surgery, and pathology.
METHOD: We conducted a literature search for studies describing the diagnostic accuracy of IUS in adult patients with CD-related intra-abdominal complications. Quality of the included studies was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool. Meta-analysis was performed for both conventional IUS [B-mode] and oral contrast IUS [SICUS].
RESULTS: Of the 1498 studies we identified, 68 were included in this review and 23 studies [3863 patients] were used for the meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivities and specificities for strictures, inflammatory masses, and fistulas by B-mode IUS were 0.81 and 0.90, 0.87 [sensitivities] and 0.95, and 0.67 and 0.97 [specificities], respectively. Pooled overall log diagnostic odds ratios were 3.56, 3.97 and 3.84, respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of SICUS were 0.94 and 0.95, 0.91 and 0.97 [sensitivities], and 0.90 and 0.94 [specificities], respectively. The pooled overall log diagnostic odds ratios of SICUS were 4.51, 5.46, and 4.80, respectively.
CONCLUSION: IUS is accurate for the diagnosis of intra-abdominal complications in CD. As a non-invasive, point-of-care modality, IUS is recommended as the first-line imaging tool if there is a suspicion of CD-related intra-abdominal complications.
