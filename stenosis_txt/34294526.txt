Title: Long-term outcomes of delayed biliary strictures following cholecystectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delayed biliary strictures (DBS) after cholecystectomy are uncommon and little is known of their aetiology or long-term consequences. The aims of this study were to investigate the clinical and economic impact of DBS after cholecystectomy.
METHODS: Patients who developed DBS after cholecystectomy were identified from a prospectively collected and maintained database. Risk factors for stricture development, quality of life (QoL) and long-term biliary complication rates were explored. Costs of treatment and follow up were determined. The same outcomes among patients with minor or major bile duct injury (BDI) were used as a comparison.
RESULTS: Among 44 patients, a laparoscopic converted to open procedure or post cholecystectomy bile leak affected some 18 and 12 patients respectively. Most DBS required surgical treatment (40). Over a median follow-up of 8.9 years after DBS treatment, 16 (36%) patients developed biliary complications (similar to minor, 26%, and major BDI, 40%) and 1 patient died of causes related to the biliary stricture. Costs of treating DBS and its follow up (£14,309.26 per patient), were similar to previously reported costs for major BDI (£15,784).
CONCLUSION: DBS typically occur after a technically and/or complicated cholecystectomy. Clinical, economic and QoL outcomes are similar to patients with major BDI.
