Title: Challenging Decision-Making Between Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Aortic Valve Surgery: A Case of a Jehovah's Witness Patient With Severe Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis Coexisting With Severe Mitral Regurgitation and Bicuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: A 73-year-old Jehovah's witness man with a bicuspid aortic valve and a history of epilepsy presented to the emergency room with chest pain and dyspnea. Echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function, but also revealed severe aortic stenosis and severe mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography and computerized tomography angiography ruled out any significant coronary artery disease and aortic dissection, respectively. In view of his religious views, transcatheter aortic valve implantation was considered more suitable than aortic valve surgeryÂ and was successful with a stable postoperative state. This case reaffirms that autonomy should be maintained while considering the best interest of patients in decision-making.
