Title: Effect of Postoperative Stroke Timing on Perioperative Mortality After Carotid Revascularization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In-hospital stroke (IHS) has been associated with worse outcomes than out-of-hospital stroke (OHS) due to delays in diagnosis and treatment. A paucity of studies exists comparing the timing of postoperative stroke after carotid revascularization. We aimed to study the effect of IHS versus OHS on postoperative mortality in carotid revascularization patients in a large-scale national database.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) between 2011 and 2018 in the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Statistical analysis included chi-squared test and multivariable logistic regression. Patients were divided based on postoperative stroke timing (no stroke, IHS, or OHS) as well as procedure type (CEA or CAS).
RESULTS: A total of 31,304 carotid revascularizations were performed with 420 (1.3%) IHSs and 207 (0.7%) OHSs. On adjusted analysis, there was significantly higher perioperative mortality with both IHS [odds ratio (OR): 19.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 13.61-28.18, P < 0.001] and OHS [OR: 29.73, 95% CI: 18.76-45.82, P < 0.001]. There was no difference in mortality after OHS versus IHS [OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.89-2.55, P = 0.161].
CONCLUSIONS: Any postoperative stroke after carotid revascularization significantly increased the odds of 30-day mortality. In contrast to previous studies demonstrating worse outcomes after IHS than OHS, we observed similar 30-day mortality between the 2 stroke categories. Improved follow-up and early recognition with rescue within carotid revascularization patients compared to the general population could potentially contribute to these results. However, overall mortality remains high for any postoperative stroke following carotid revascularization, emphasizing the importance of vigilant in-hospital monitoring and follow-up even after discharging the patient.
