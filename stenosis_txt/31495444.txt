Title: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis: Diagnosis, management and technical considerations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) is a rare cause of nasal obstruction in neonates with respiratory distress manifestations. Diagnosis is made with craniofacial computed tomography, prompt and precise treatment creates good outcomes in these patients.
AIM: To present our experience in diagnosis and management considerations with this rare pathology and a case series of our surgically managed patients.
METHODS: A retrospective, analytical study of CNPAS patients surgically managed over a period of seven years. Evaluation and follow up was reviewed.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients were evaluated; pyriform aperture mean width was 5.5mm. Of these patients, 31% also had Congenital Midnasal Stenosis. Medical treatment failed for all the patients and they required surgical enlargement of the pyriform aperture. No complications were seen and all patients improved in symptoms and development.
CONCLUSIONS: Congenital nasal obstruction can be fatal in new-borns, CNPAS is a rare differential diagnosis that must be completely evaluated, properly treated with conservative management and if it fails, with well-planned and executed surgery. Follow-up shows high rates of success.
