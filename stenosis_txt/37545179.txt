Title: Long-term follow-up after endovascular treatment of aortic coarctation with bare and covered Cheatham platinum stents.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment of aortic coarctation (CoA) in children and adults frequently requires stent implantation. The aim of this study was to analyze long-term results after CoA treatment with bare and covered Cheatham-PlatinumTM (CP) stents in our institution and to derive recommendations for the differential use of these stent types.
METHODS: In this retrospective single institution study, 212 patients received endovascular CoA treatment with bare (n = 71) and covered (n = 141) CP stents between September 1999 and July 2021, respectively. The indications for treatment were native CoA in 110/212 patients (51.9%) and re-coarctation after primary surgical or interventional treatment in 102/212 patients (48.1%). Median patient age at endovascular CoA treatment was 18.8 years [IQR 11.9; 35.8]. Long-term follow-up was available in 158/212 patients (74.5%) with a median follow-up of 7.3 years [IQR 4.3; 12.6].
RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in 187/212 (88.2%) patients. Survival rate was 98.1% after 5, and 95.6% after 10 and 15 years, respectively. The probability of freedom from re-intervention was 93.0% after 5, 82.3% after 10 and 77.8% after 15 years, respectively. Freedom from re-interventions (44/158, 27.8%) did not differ between patients who received bare or covered CP stents (p = 0.715). Multivariable risk factor analysis identified previous CoA surgery (HR: 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-3,9, p = 0.029), postdilatation (HR: 2,9, 95% CI: 1.1-6.3, p = 0.028) and age at intervention (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99, p = 0.002) as independent risk factors for re-intervention. Peri-procedural complications occurred in 15/212 (7.1%) patients (dissection/thrombosis of vascular access vessel: n = 9; bleeding: n = 1; stent dislocation: n = 2; aortic dissection/aortic wall rupture: n = 3). Long-term complications were observed in 36 patients and included stent fracture (n = 19), aneurysm formation (n = 14), endoleak (n = 1) and subclavian artery stenosis (n = 2). Peri-procedural and long-term complications did not differ between patients who received CoA treatment with bare or covered CP stents (all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of CoA using bare or covered CP stents can be performed safely and effectively with excellent long-term results. Survival, re-intervention and complication rate did not significantly differ between both stent types. However, individual stent selection is advisable with regard to CoA morphology and severity as well as patient age.
