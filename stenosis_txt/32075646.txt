Title: Mitochondrial 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and coronary artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Little is known about whether mitochondria 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage, contributes to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) in diabetic patients. Here, we explored the associations of mtDNA 8-OHdG in leukocytes with obstructive CAD, coronary stenosis severity, cardiovascular biomarkers, and 1-year adverse outcomes after coronary revascularization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: In a total of 1920 consecutive patients with T2DM who underwent coronary angiography due to symptoms of angina or angina equivalents, the presence of obstructive CAD, the number of diseased vessels with ≥ 50% stenosis, and modified Gensini score were cross-sectionally evaluated; the level of mtDNA 8-OHdG was quantified by quantitative PCR. Then, 701 of 1920 diabetic patients who further received coronary revascularization completed 1-year prospective follow-up to document major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCEs). In vitro experiments were also performed to observe the effects of mtDNA oxidative damage in high glucose-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, greater mtDNA 8-OHdG was associated with increased odds of obstructive CAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.38, 95% CI confidence interval 1.24-1.52), higher degree of coronary stenosis (number of diseased vessels: OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.41; modified Gensini scores: OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39), and higher levels of C-reactive protein (β 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.31) after adjusting for confounders. Sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching yielded similar results. Stratification by smoking status showed that the association between mtDNA 8-OHdG and obstructive CAD was most evident in current smokers (P<sub>interation</sub> &lt; 0.01). Prospectively, the adjusted hazards ratio per 1-SD increase in mtDNA 8-OHdG was 1.59 (95% CI 1.33-1.90) for predicting 1-year MACCEs after revascularization. In HUVECs, exposure to antimycin A, an inducer for mtDNA oxidative damage, led to adverse alterations in markers of mitochondrial and endothelia function.
CONCLUSION: Greater mtDNA 8-OHdG in leukocytes may serve as an independent risk factor for CAD in patients with T2DM.
