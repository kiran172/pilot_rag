Title: [Cicatricial tracheal stenosis in elderly and senile patients: immediate and long-term results of treatment].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present treatment outcomes in elderly and senile patients with cicatricial tracheal stenosis (CTS) and features of their perioperative management.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 46 elderly and senile patients with CTS. We analyzed their gender and age, body mass index, etiology, extent and degree of stenosis, comorbidity index and ASA grade, postoperative complications according to TMM grading system.
RESULTS: Age of patients varied from 61 to 95 years (mean 66.38Â±8.65). Post-intubation stenosis was detected in 7 (15.2%) patients, post-tracheostomy CTS - in 39 (84.8%) patients (2 (4.3%) ones with tracheoesophageal fistula and 18 (39.1%) ones with tracheomalacia). CTS length ranged from 8 to 65 mm. The causes of invasive mechanical ventilation were traumatic brain and spinal trauma in 6 cases, emergency surgery in 11 cases and therapeutic diseases in 29 cases. CTS of cervical trachea was found in 21 patients, subglottic larynx and cervical trachea - 8 patients, cervical and upper thoracic trachea - 12 patients, thoracic segment - 3 patients, multifocal lesions - 2 patients. The Charlson index ranged from 5 to 12 points. ASA grade II was observed in 8 (17.4%) patients, III - 28 (60.9%), IV - in other ones. Circular resection was performed in 5 patients, laryngotracheoplasty - in 37 patients. CTS repair and tracheoesophageal fistula closure with laryngotracheoplasty were carried out in 2 patients. Postoperative complications occurred in 18 (39.1%) patients, mortality was 2.17%. In 21.7% of cases, complications were associated with tracheal suture. Endoscopic procedures, cryosurgery and hyperbaric oxygenation were used for correction. Good and satisfactory treatment outcomes were achieved in 86.5% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of CTS in elderly and senile patients requires participation of interdisciplinary team with special experience. Laryngotracheoplasty is safe and effective in these patients, and indications for circular resection are still limited.
