Title: The influence of non-thrombotic iliac vein stenosis on clinical course and recurrence of primary varicose veins.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To investigate the influence of iliac vein stenosis on clinical course and recurrence of primary varicose veins after surgeryMaterials and methods: Thirty-three patients with primary varicose veins qualified for great saphenous vein stripping were analysed. The stenosis of common (CIV) and external (EIV) iliac vein was measured by IVUS and defined in three categories as minimal lumen area &lt;90 mm2 for CIV and &lt;75 mm2 for EIV, minimal lumen diameter &lt;10 mm for CIV and &lt;7.5 mm for EIV and area reduction &gt;50%. The patients were assessed clinically and by Duplex ultrasound 48 to 72 months after the procedure. Any recurrence, the recurrence in the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ), change in Venous Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS), were analyzed in relation to the stenosis in the CIV and EIV.
RESULTS: The follow-up was completed in 27 patients. Any recurrence and the recurrence in the SFJ were observed in 70% and 18.5% of patients, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in any recurrence, the recurrence in the SFJ and VCSS in relation to CIV and EIV stenosis in any category.
CONCLUSIONS: Iliac vein stenosis does not influence the clinical course and recurrence of primary varicose veins after surgery.
