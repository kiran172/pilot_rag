Title: Contradictions between DAPT and PRECISE-DAPT scores with the severity of coronary lesion in acute coronary syndrome.

Abstract: This study aimed to identify the correlation of contradiction between DAPT score and PRECISE-DAPT score with the severity of coronary lesion in acute coronary syndromes (ACS).In total, 458 patients with ACS after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who had tolerated 1-year uneventful dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) were enrolled and divided into groups based on the Gensini score, number of stenosed vessels, and left main (LM) disease. Both DAPT score and PRECISE-DAPT score were calculated and the proportion of patients receiving conflicting recommendations from each score was compared among the groups.DAPT score as well as the proportion of patients with DAPT score ≥2 were associated with the Gensini score and the number of stenosed vessels. Similarly, PRECISE-DAPT score as well as the proportion of patients with PRECISE-DAPT score ≥25 were associated with the Gensini score and the number of stenosed vessels. The proportion of patients with DAPT score ≥2 along with PRECISE-DAPT score ≥25 were associated with Gensini score, but they had no significant association with the number of stenosed vessels (P = .006 and P = .075, respectively). None of those aforementioned items were associated with LM disease.The inconsistencies of DAPT scores and PRECISE-DAPT scores are frequent and associated with the severity of coronary disease, represented by the Gensini score. Appropriate clinical decisions should be individualized.
