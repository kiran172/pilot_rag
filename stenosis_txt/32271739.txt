Title: [Endovascular surgery for acute mesenteric ischemia].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the results of endovascular treatment of 15 patients with acute mesenteric ischemia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 15 patients with acute mesenteric ischemia who underwent surgery (9 men and 6 women). Mean age was 77Â±11 years. Acute intestinal ischemia was caused by thromboembolism of superior mesenteric artery (9 patients), thrombosis of superior mesenteric artery (5 patients) and critical stenosis of the ostia of superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk (1 patient). Mean time from clinical manifestation of disease to admission to the hospital was 13 hours (range 2-72 hours). In-hospital development of acute mesenteric ischemia was noted in 2 patients. Indications for endovascular intervention and techniques of endovascular revascularization of superior mesenteric artery are described in the article.
RESULTS: Blood flow restoration in superior mesenteric artery was achieved in 14 (93%) out of 15 patients. Laparotomy was required in 4 (27%) patients for extensive resection of necrotic intestine (n=1, 6.7%), local resection of small bowel (n=2, 13%). In another (6.7%) patient, intestine was recognized as viable after laparotomy. A bulk of intestine was preserved in most patients (n=14, 93%). In-hospital mortality rate was 47% (7 patients died). The main cause of nosocomial death (6 cases) was reperfusion syndrome followed by respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
CONCLUSION: New methods of prevention and treatment of reperfusion syndrome can improve the results of treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia.
