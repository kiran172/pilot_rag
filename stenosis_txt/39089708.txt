Title: Staged cerebral and brachiocephalic bypass in a patient with MCA and brachiocephalic steno-occlusion.

Abstract: Background: Brachiocephalic steal is a rare phenomenon that may lead to hemodynamic abnormalities in the ipsilateral vertebral and carotid arteries. Current treatment includes management of vascular risk factors, endovascular stenting, and surgical management depending on the severity of symptoms. Case Information: We describe a patient with multiple vascular risk factors who presented with mild neurological symptoms and chronic right arm weakness associated with concurrent brachiocephalic steal and right MCA M1 stenosis on neuroimaging. Use of right superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass and aorta-right subclavian bypass resulted in improved flow to the right hemisphere on quantitative magnetic resonance angiography and single-photon emission computed tomography, significantly lowering the risk of catastrophic ischemic stroke. Conclusion: Complex steal phenomena increase stroke risk. In cases of high-grade occlusion or advanced symptoms, endovascular or surgical management should be considered for optimal stroke prevention.
