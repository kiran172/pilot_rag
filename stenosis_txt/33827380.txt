Title: Cerebral embolic protection devices during transcatheter aortic valve implantation, the current state of the art.

Abstract: Stroke after transcatheter aortic valve (TAVI) is a devastating adverse event. The majority of these occur in the acute phase following TAVI where cerebral embolic events are frequent. Cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) have been developed to minimise the risk of peri-procedural ischaemic stroke during TAVI. CEPD have the potential to lower intraprocedural burden of new silent ischaemic brain injury. Several CEPD have been developed, but their clinical benefit remains unknown. Herein, we aimed to review the impact of the use of CEPD, in patients undergoing TAVI, on the reduction of strokes or the onset of new ischaemic lesions.
