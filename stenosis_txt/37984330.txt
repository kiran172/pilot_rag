Title: Acute iatrogenic aortic coarctation after balloon-expandable prosthesis pop-out during transcatheter aortic valve implantation intervention.

Abstract: An 80-year-old man was referred to our cath-lab for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. The intervention utilized a balloon-expandable prosthesis (Edwards Sapien 3 Ultra nÂ°26, Edwards Lifesciences).
