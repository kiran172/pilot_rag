Title: Willis Covered Stent for Treating Intracranial Pseudoaneurysms of the Internal Carotid Artery: A Multi-Institutional Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to retrospectively analyze Willis covered stent (WCS)'s therapeutic efficacy in intracranial pseudoaneurysms (PSAs) of the internal carotid artery (ICA).
METHODS: Between June 2018 and July 2021, 56 individuals with intracranial PSAs of the ICA treated with WCS in three centers were included to analyze information regarding medical records, operative parameters, imaging findings and follow-up data.
RESULTS: All WCSs were successfully targeted to the ICA lesions. Total exclusion of PSA was found in 53 cases (94.6%) right upon surgery, and mild endoleak into the aneurysm remained in 3 cases (5.4%). Intraoperative thrombosis occurred in 1 case (1.8%), and tirofiban was utilized for recanalization. Follow-up by angiography showed total aneurysm occlusion in the total number of individuals, including in the 3 above cases with residual endoleak. In-stent stenosis occurred in 7 (12.5%) patients. No stent-related ischemic event was encountered. Predictive factors of late in-stent stenosis following WCS implantation in this patient group were irregular post-operative antiplatelet treatment (p = 0.015) and C4-C5 segment of the ICA (p = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: WCSs are effective in treating intracranial PSAs of the ICA.
