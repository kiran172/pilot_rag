Title: Aortic Valve Stenosis and Cancer: Problems of Management.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis and malignancy frequently coexist and share the same risk factors as atherosclerotic disease. Data reporting the prognosis of patients with severe aortic stenosis and cancer are limited. Tailoring the correct and optimal care for cancer patients with severe aortic stenosis is complex. Cancer patients may be further disadvantaged by aortic stenosis if it interferes with their treatment by increasing the risk associated with oncologic surgery and compounding the risks associated with cardiotoxicity and heart failure (HF). Surgical valve replacement, transcatheter valve implantation, balloon valvuloplasty, and medical therapy are possible treatments for aortic valve stenosis, but when malignancy is present, the choice between these options must take into account the stage of cancer and associated treatment, expected outcome, and comorbidities. Physical examination and Doppler echocardiography are critical in the diagnosis and evaluation of aortic stenosis. The current review considers the available data on the association between aortic stenosis and cancer and the therapeutic options.
