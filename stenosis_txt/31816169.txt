Title: Laser atherectomy and drug-coated balloons for the treatment of femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis: 2-Year outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Femoropopliteal (FP) artery is one of the most anatomically challenging areas for sustained stent patency. The incidence of FP in-stent restenosis (ISR) is estimated at 50% at 24 months. Prior studies have shown that lesion debulking with laser atherectomy (LA) combined with drug coated balloon (DCB) have superior outcomes compared to LA + balloon angioplasty (BA) ISR, but there have not been studies evaluating 2-year outcomes.
METHODS: This was a dual-center retrospective cohort study that compared patients with FP-ISR treated with LA + DCB versus LA + BA. Cox regression analysis was used to examine 2-year outcomes of target lesion revascularization (TLR) and the composite outcome of TLR or restenosis. Multivariable analysis was performed for clinical and statistically significant (in the univariate analysis) variables.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen consecutive patients with Tosaka II (n = 32) and III (n = 85) ISR were analyzed. Sixty-six patients were treated with LA + DCB and 51 with LA + BA. The LA + DCB group had more lesions with moderate to severe calcification (58% vs. 13%; p < .0001). The LA + DCB group was more likely to be treated with the use of embolic protection devices (64% vs. 23%, p < .001) and cutting balloons (61% vs. 6%, p < .001). Bail-out stenting rates were lower in the LA + DCB group (32% vs. 57%, p = .008). LA + DCB was superior (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.34-0.9, p = .027) for the composite outcome of 2-year TLR or restenosis. The 12-month KM estimates for freedom from TLR or restenosis were 66% in the LA + DCB group versus 46% in the LA + BA group. The 24-month KM estimates were 45% in the LA + DCB group versus 24% in the LA + BA group.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of DCB + LA was associated with decreased rates of bail-out stenting and improved 2-year TLR or restenosis rates. Randomized clinical trials examining the DCB + LA combination for FP-ISR are needed.
