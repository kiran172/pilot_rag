Title: Oesophageal stenosis caused by giant multilevel anterior cervical osteophytosis.

Abstract: Dysphagia secondary to osteoarticular disorders is a rare entity. In this report, we present the case of a 76-year-old female patient with progressive dysphagia and recurrent aspiration pneumonia caused by large anterior cervical osteophytes. Osteophytectomy was performed without spinal fusion. The patient reported significant improvement post-operatively, and no recurrence was detected at the 1-year follow-up. Cervical osteophytosis should be suspected as a cause of dysphagia, especially in elderly patients with degenerative osteoarthritic disease when other causes have been excluded.
