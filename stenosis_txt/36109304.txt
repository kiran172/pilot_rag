Title: Simultaneous placement of fecal and urinary continent channel stomas in the umbilicus: Single-center experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: In patients with urinary continent channel (UCC) and Malone Antegrade Continent Enema (MACE) procedures, two separate abdominal stomas are needed. The umbilicus is a preferred site for single channel stomas given the ability to conceal the stoma. However, there are no studies describing outcomes of both stomas being created in the umbilicus. We aimed to describe our experience in patients who underwent UCC and MACE stomas both placed in the umbilicus.
METHODS: A retrospective review from 2009 to 2020 was performed in our institution for patients who underwent the creation of UCC and MACE stomas simultaneously in the umbilicus. The variation in the technique involves two V-skin shaped flaps in the umbilicus; the MACE and UCC stomas are delivered from both flaps and placed at the right and left side respectively. Patients with greater than 3 months of follow-up were included in the study.
RESULTS: There were 17 patients identified with the median age of 13.5 years and a median follow-up of 32.8 months. The mean BMI percentile was 89.5%. Monti technique and split appendix with cecal extension were utilized in 8 (47.1%) and 7 (41.2%) patients respectively and 13 (76.5%) patients required concurrent urological procedures. All channel-related complications occurred within a mean time of 15.7 months. Skin-level stenosis in the MACE occurred in 5 (29.4%) events, and all were successfully managed by placing an indwelling catheter for up to two weeks. There were 2 (11.8%) complications related to UCC, which required subfascial minor surgical revision. The rate of patients with symptomatic UTI decreased 35.3% postoperatively, and no new onset of UTI occurred in patients without a prior history of UTI. During follow-up, all patients remained dry between CIC, however one had occasional leakage related to delay in catheterization. Total fecal continence was achieved in 14 (82.3%) patients. Additionally, 3 (16.6%) patients experienced improvement in fecal continence with sporadic soiling episodes.
COMMENTS: Placement of UCC and MACE stomas in the umbilicus demonstrate a percentage of complication of 7/34 (20.6%) with only 2 patients requiring surgical intervention, comparable to the standard. UTI rate decreased in patients with a prior history of UTI. We believe the patients' perspective and degree of satisfaction will fully determine the benefits of this technique.
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous UCC and MACE stomas placed at the umbilicus showed good functional outcomes and similar complication rates to traditional approach where stomas were placed separately in the abdominal wall.
