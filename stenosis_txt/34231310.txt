Title: Factors influencing arteriovenous fistulas: A multicenter study.

Abstract: In this cross-sectional, descriptive study, the arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) of HD patients were evaluated by physical examination and factors associated with AVF function and longevity were investigated. Data were collected using a patient information form and the Arteriovenous Fistula Assessment Scale (AVF-AS). The study population included 279 patients under chronic HD treatment. Their mean age was 61.14 ± 14.00 years and 58.6% were men. Age, AVF location, and number of AVFs created were identified as factors associated with AVF needle entry site and flow problems, stenosis, and risk of developing ischemic complications (p = 0.005, p = 0.000, p = 0.006, respectively). AVF dysfunction adversely affected HD pump speed (p = 0.000) and HD adequacy (p = 0.000). It was determined that gender, AVF location, last AVF duration, and total number of previous AVF were identified as the risk of AVF complications. The results of this study revealed that regular follow-up and evaluation are needed to minimize the risk of dysfunction and failure due to AVF complications.
