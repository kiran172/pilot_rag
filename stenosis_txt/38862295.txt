Title: Meatal Surgery at the Time of Circumcision for Lichen Sclerosus (LS/BXO) Does Not Reduce the Need for Later Meatal Intervention: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We describe meatal outcomes for boys undergoing circumcision to treat Lichen Sclerosus (LS/BXO) with a focus on those who underwent meatotomy/meatoplasty at circumcision and factors associated with post-circumcision meatal intervention.
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients undergoing circumcision for histologically confirmed LS between 2011 and 2020. Statistical testing was by Chi2 and multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: 382 patients underwent circumcision at a mean of 9.1 years (SD 2.9). At circumcision, LS on the glans was documented in 213/365 (58%). Meatal involvement was documented in 74/382 (19%); 25/382 (6.5%) had a meatotomy, 94/382 (25%) had meatal calibration/dilatation and 234/367 (64%) were prescribed post-operative topical steroids. Patients with LS glans or meatal involvement were more likely to have a meatotomy (p = 0.0013) and to receive post-operative steroids (OR 5, p = 0.0001). Post circumcision, 40/382 (10%) required a median of 1 subsequent procedure (range 1-5), 10 (2.6%) underwent dilatation, 30 (7.4%) had a meatotomy. Patients undergoing meatotomy at circumcision had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 for subsequent meatotomy (p = 0.027). Analysis based on requirement for any subsequent procedure identified an OR of 3.1 for having had a meatotomy at circumcision (p = 0.022) and an OR of 6.0 of receiving post-operative steroids (p=<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Meatal stenosis following circumcision for LS requiring meatal intervention affected 10% of boys. Meatotomy at circumcision increased the likelihood of subsequent meatal intervention and is therefore not recommended.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.
