Title: A novel management strategy for treatment of pelvic venous disorders utilizing a clinical screening score and non-invasive imaging.

Abstract: Background: Treatment of pelvic venous disorders (PVD) including pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) are often delayed due to its varying clinical manifestations. Patients and methods: Patient referral was based on a literature- and personal experience-derived clinical "PCS screening score" (higher score points indicate greater likelihood with a maximum score of 10 points). We studied consecutive women who were (i) referred for vascular assessment and treatment to the University Hospital Zurich (2017-2021), (ii) had a PCS score â‰¥3 points, (iii) had evidence of obstructive or non-obstructive PVD by duplex sonography or cross-sectional imaging, and (iv) underwent endovascular therapy. The primary outcome was change in symptom severity after endovascular therapy: (i) freedom from symptoms, (ii) improvement with residual symptoms, (iii) no improvement. Results: We included 43 women (mean age 36 years): 81% had previous pregnancy, 19% endometriosis. The median PCS score was 7 (IQR 5-9) points. Chronic lower-abdominal pain was the leading symptom in 86% patients, followed by recurrent leg (9%) and vulvar (5%) varicosities. The main PVD pathologies were ovarian vein insufficiency (61%), internal iliac vein insufficiency (9%), or a combination of both (30%), whereas 42% had a deep venous obstruction of the inferior vena cava, common iliac or left renal veins. Endovascular therapy included ovarian vein embolization (86%), internal iliac vein embolization (9%), and venous stent placement (35%). After a median of 4 (IQR 1-8) months from endovascular treatment, 40 (93%) patients reported improvement of the leading symptom, and 14 (33%) were symptom-free. Complications included re-intervention for stent stenosis (13%, all post-thrombotic), coil-migration into the left renal vein (7%, all retrieved), and transient pelvic sclerotherapy-induced thrombophlebitis (2%). Conclusions: Endovascular therapy following a diagnostic approach, which included a PCS screening tool and non-invasive imaging, appeared to be highly effective and was associated with a low rate of complications.
