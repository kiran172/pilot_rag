Title: Regurgitant Bicuspid Aortopathy: Is Valve-Sparing Root Replacement Equivalent to Bentall Procedure?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Repair of aortic root aneurysms with nonstenotic bicuspid valves (NS-BAVs) is achieved either with valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR) or conventional Bentall procedure (ROOT). Procedural and long-term outcomes comparing these 2 techniques are sparse and need investigation.
METHODS: From March 2004 to January 2019, 158 patients with an aortic root aneurysm and NS-BAV underwent VSRR (n = 78, 49.3%) or ROOT (n = 80, 50.6%). VSRR involved optional aortic valve repair (n = 47, 60%), and ROOT was performed with bioprosthetic (81.3%) or mechanical valve replacement (18.7%). Procedural and postoperative outcomes were obtained, and univariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed.
RESULTS: VSRR patients were younger (42.7 ± 12.0 years of age) than ROOT (54.8 ± 13.6 years of age) (P < .001). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cross-clamp duration were longer in VSRR (CPB: 228.0 ± 39.1 minutes; cross-clamp: 200.1 ± 36.2 minutes) compared with ROOT (CPB: 199.5 ± 55 minutes; cross-clamp: 170.3 ± 39.5 minutes) (P < .001). Postoperative stroke, renal failure, pneumonia, and reoperation for bleeding were similar, but postoperative atrial and ventricular arrhythmias was lower in VSRR (15% vs 42%; P < .001). Length of stay and 30-day mortality were similar. At discharge, none had greater than trivial aortic insufficiency. Long-term 10-year survival and incidence of moderate-severe aortic insufficiency, aortic stenosis, and reoperation were equivalent between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for aortopathy associated with NS-BAV is safe and effective with either VSRR or ROOT. Despite its complexity, VSRR should be considered in the surgical treatment of this population.
