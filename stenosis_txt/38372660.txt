Title: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Drug Eluting Stents for Safety and Efficacy in Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Advancements in arterial stenting technology have challenged prior notions favoring medical management for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Where previous conclusions were drawn from bare metal stent (BMS) technology, recent studies suggest drug-eluting stents (DES) are favorable due to their anti-proliferative effect, which reduces vascular remodeling.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature prior to August 2023 reviewing all reports of ICAD treated with DES. Our target outcomes were incidence of any stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or death within 30 days (postprocedural complications), ischemic stroke in the territory of the qualifying artery beyond 30 days (long-term complications), radiographically detected in-stent restenosis rate (ISR), and symptomatic ISR during follow-up. A subgroup analysis further stratified preprocedural mean stenosis above and below 70% into severe and moderate cohorts, respectively.
RESULTS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and EMBASE query identified 527 candidate articles, from which 14 studies met inclusion criteria for a total of 607 patients and 640 ICAD lesions. Incidence of postprocedural complications was 7.3% (95% CI 3.9-11.7%) with subgroup analysis demonstrating significantly higher incidence in the severely stenotic group [9.0% (95% CI 4.7-14.5%)] than the moderately stenotic group [3.0% (95% CI 0.7-6.8%)]. Long-term complications were 1.2% (95% CI 0.4-2.3%). Radiographic ISR was 3.5% (95% CI 1.4-6.3%) and symptomatic ISR was 0.3% (95% CI 0.0-1.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that DES can effectively reduce the risk of ISR and may be a viable treatment modality to reduce long-term complications in refractory ICAD patients.
