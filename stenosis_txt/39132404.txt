Title: Trends and Outcomes in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease Undergoing TAVR: Insights From VA CART.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. The management and impact of obstructive CAD in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have not been fully evaluated. We aimed to determine the patient characteristics and clinical outcomes among veterans undergoing TAVR with and without obstructive CAD and to determine temporal trends and association of pre-TAVR percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We identified all patients who underwent TAVR from 2012 to 2021 in the VA Health Care System. The sample population was divided into patients with and without obstructive CAD and further stratified by coronary intervention status 1 year prior to TAVR. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was major bleeding.
RESULTS: During the study period, 759 patients underwent TAVR, and 282 (37%) had obstructive CAD. Obstructive CAD was associated with higher 1-year mortality (15.6% vs 7.1%; P &lt; .01) after TAVR. The rate of PCI prior to TAVR increased from 2012 until 2016, after which it steadily declined such that 144 patients (51%) underwent PCI pre-TAVR during the entire study period. There was no difference in 1-year mortality (16.0% vs 15.2%; P = .89) or bleeding (16.7% vs 12.3%; P = .33) between patients who underwent or did not undergo pre-TAVR PCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Among veterans undergoing TAVR, the presence of obstructive CAD is associated with higher mortality though pre-TAVR coronary intervention is not associated with improved outcomes. Further studies could identify a subset of patients who may benefit from coronary revascularization prior to TAVR.
