Title: Urological Complications Associated With Pyeloureterostomy Without Ipsilateral Nephrectomy in Renal Transplant Recipients.

Abstract: Background: The implications of ligating the native ureter without ipsilateral nephrectomy after primary kidney transplant pyeloureterostomy (PU) have been described previously. Methods: This single-center retrospective cohort study including 4,215 kidney transplants performed between February 2010 and December 2014, analyzed urological complications following primary (P-PU) and secondary (S-PU) pyeloureterostomy used to treat urological leaks (UL-PU) and ureteral stenosis (US-PU) without concomitant ipsilateral nephrectomy, in a large cohort of patients. Results: There were 495 (11.7%) pyeloureterostomy with native ureter ligation without nephrectomy, 409 P-PU (82.6%) and 86 S-PU (17.4%), of which 76 were UL-PU and 10 were US-PU. The median follow-up was 33.8 months. The incidence of native ipsilateral kidney complications requiring nephrectomy was 2.02% (n = 10). Urinary leak was diagnosed in 3.6% of patients after P-UP and 9.2% after UL-PU. Ureteral stenosis was diagnosed in 1.7% of patients after P-UP, 3.9% after UL-PU and 10% after US-PU. Conclusion: This cohort analysis suggests that native ureter ligation during pyeloureterostomy without native nephrectomy is associated with low incidence of clinically indicated ipsilateral native nephrectomy. Caution and awareness should be emphasized in patients with history of ADPKD and neurogenic augmented bladders.
