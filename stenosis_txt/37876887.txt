Title: Is Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Futile in Patients Over Ninety Years of Age?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes and quality of life (QoL) indices are not well described after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients aged ≥ 90 years.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of TAVR among nonagenarian patients between 2008 and 2020. The survival of TAVR patients among nonagenarians was compared to the provincial estimated survival for an age- and sex-matched general population. QoL was assessed up to 1 year postintervention, using standardized questionnaires.
RESULTS: During the study period, n = 268 patients aged ≥ 90 years were evaluated for severe aortic stenosis. TAVR was performed in n = 171 (48% female; median [IQR] Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale score: 4 [3-4]); n = 84 underwent medical therapy; and n = 13 underwent surgical aortic valve replacement. Survival was significantly better following TAVR, compared to that after MT (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]: 1.99 [1.37-2.88], P &lt; 0.001). TAVR patients demonstrated a survival advantage compared with the general population, with an estimated relative mortality of 0.86 (0.75-0.87). TAVR patients showed sustained improvements in functional status and QoL up to 1 year compared to baseline (all P &lt; 0.05): the 6-minute walk test results improved from 192 to 252 m; the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score improved from 64 to 81; the Duke Activity Status Index score improved from 13 to 16; and the health state scale result of the Euro Quality of life - 5 Dimensions improved from 63% to 74%.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonagenarians undergoing TAVR experience a slightly better survival rate, compared to that of an age- and sex-matched general population, and they have significant improvements in functional status and several QoL indices following the procedure.
