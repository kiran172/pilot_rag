Title: Risk Factors, Management, and Avoidance of Conduction System Disease after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter valve replacement (TAVR) is a rapidly developing modality to treat patients with aortic stenosis (AS). Conduction disease post TAVR is one of the most frequent and serious complications experienced by patients. Multiple factors contribute to the risk of conduction disease, including AS and the severity of valve calcification, patients' pre-existing conditions (i.e., conduction disease, anatomical variations, and short septum) in addition to procedure-related factors (e.g., self-expanding valves, implantation depth, valve-to-annulus ratio, and procedure technique). Detailed evaluation of risk profiles could allow us to better prevent, recognize, and treat this entity. Available evidence on management of conduction disease post TAVR is based on expert opinion and varies widely. Currently, conduction disease in TAVR patients is managed depending on patient risk, with minimal-to-no inpatient/outpatient observation, inpatient monitoring (24-48 h) followed by ambulatory monitoring, or either prolonged inpatient and outpatient monitoring or permanent pacemaker implantation. Herein, we review the incidence and risk factors of TAVR-associated conduction disease and discuss its management.
