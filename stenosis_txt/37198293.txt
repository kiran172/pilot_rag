Title: Single-Center Preliminary Experience with Gutter-Plugging Chimney Stent-Graft for Aortic Dissection.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report the early 2-year results and experience of a novel gutter-plugging chimney stent-graft in a single center that participated in the clinical trial of Prospective Study for Aortic Arch Therapy with stENt-graft for Chimney technology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with aortic dissection were treated with the novel chimney stent-grafts named Longuette™ for the left subclavian artery revascularization. Primary study outcomes were the incidence of freedom from major adverse events within 30 days and success rate of the operation over 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were enrolled between September 2019 and December 2020. The immediate technical success rate (stent-grafts successfully deployed without fast-flow type Ia or type III endoleak intraoperatively) was 100%, and there were no conversions to open repair. Type Ia and type II endoleaks were noted in three patients (8.8%) and one patient (2.9%) at discharge, respectively. One patient (2.9%) with type Ia endoleak underwent coil embolization at 12 months because of false lumen dilation, and one (2.9%) case of type Ia endoleak resolved spontaneously at 24 months. One chimney stent (2.9%) was revealed with stenosis at discharge and occluded with thrombosis at 6 months postoperatively. During the 2-year follow-up, there was no death, rupture, stroke, paraplegia, left arm ischemia, retrograde dissection, stent-graft induced new entry, or stent migration.
CONCLUSION: The initial results of the Longuette™ stent-graft for revascularization of the left subclavian artery are encouraging with a high technical success rate. Further multicenter follow-up outcomes are required to assess the long-term durability.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4, Case Series.
