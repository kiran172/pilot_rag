Title: Developmental venous anomaly causing obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis: а case report.

Abstract: Cerebral developmental venous anomalies are asymptomatic benign cerebrovascular malformations that are commonly found accidentally on brain magnetic resonance imaging. It is not uncommon for cerebrospinal fluid flow to be obstructed at the level of the aqueduct of Sylvius, causing an obstructive non-communicating hydrocephalus. Most notable reasons for such an obstruction at that level are tumors, congenital etiology, or post-inflammatory gliotic atresia.
