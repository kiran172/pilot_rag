Title: Pathogenicity of BK virus on the urinary system.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The polyomaviruses are omnipresent in nature. The major sites of BK virus appearance are the kidney tubular epithelial cells and urinary bladder surface transitional cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search according to PRISMA guidelines within the Medline database was conducted in July 2019 for articles presenting data about BK virus in urologic aspect without setting time limits, using the terms 'BK virus' in conjunction with transplantation, nephropathy, stenosis, cancer, bladder, prostate, kidney.
RESULTS: The BK virus usually stays latent, however, its replication may become active in various clinical situations of impaired immunocompetence such as solid organ transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, AIDS, pregnancy, multiple sclerosis, administration of chemotherapy or biologic therapy. BK virus is associated with two main complications after transplantation: polyomavirus-associated nephropathy in kidney transplant patients and polyomavirus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this article was to present available data on urologic aspects of BK virus infection, its detection methods and available treatment.
