Title: Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure Can Underestimate Direct Pulmonary Vein Pressure in Pediatric Pulmonary Vein Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) can underestimate directly measured pulmonary vein pressure (PVP) as demonstrated in animal studies and human case reports. This concept has not been validated in a larger cohort of pediatric patients with pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS).
METHODS: Pediatric patients who underwent cardiac catheterization for PVS at a single center from January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2023, were retrospectively reviewed. Mismatch between the PAWP and directly measured PVP or LA pressure was defined as >3 mm Hg. Preintervention angiography was reviewed and percent stenosis calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients met inclusion criteria; 51 lower pulmonary veins (34 left, 17 right) from 42 catheterizations were evaluated. Significant PVS (â‰¥30% stenosis) was seen in 38/51 (75%) veins, and 9/51 (18%) veins had no angiographic narrowing (0% stenosis). PAWP-PVP mismatch occurred in 37/51 (73%) veins with a median difference of 8 mm Hg (IQR, 6-12). Of these, PAWP was equal to LA pressure in 26 instances, all of which had significant PVS (median % stenosis 54 [IQR, 45-60]). Six of the cases with PAWP-PVP mismatch, PVS (range, 41%-70% stenosis), and no PAWP-LA mismatch reported both a proximal and distal segmental PAWP. In all 6 instances, there was no distal PAWP-PVP mismatch (median difference 1 mm Hg [range, 0-3]).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study of pediatric patients with PVS, PAWP significantly underestimated directly measured PVP in lower pulmonary veins. Balloon wedge or end hole catheter position in a distal lobar segment may more accurately estimate the PVP.
