Title: Real-time fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green during laparoscopic duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (LDPPHR) is a surgical method used to treat benign and low-grade malignant pancreatic head tumors. This study aimed to determine the protective effect of common bile duct in LDPPHR using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 30 patients treated with LDPPHR at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University between January 2015 and November 2022 was performed. Patients were divided into two groups based on ICG use: ICG and non-ICG.
RESULTS: Thirty patients received LDPPHR, 11 males and 19 females, and the age was 50.50 (M (IQR)) years (range: 19-76 years). LDPPHR was successfully performed in 27 (90 %) patients, LPD was performed in 1 (3 %) patient, and laparotomy conversion was performed in 2 (7 %) patients. One patient (3 %) died 21 days after surgery. The incidence of intraoperative bile duct injury in the ICG group was lower than that in the non-ICG group (10 % vs 60 %, P = 0.009), and the operation time in the ICG group was shorter than that in the non-ICG group (311.9 ± 14.97 vs 338.05 ± 18.75 min, P < 0.05). Postoperative pancreatic fistula occurred in 16 patients (53 %), including 10 with biochemical leakage (62.5 %), four with grade B (25 %), and two with grade C (12.5 %). Postoperative bile leakage occurred in four patients (13 %).
CONCLUSIONS: The ICG fluorescence imaging technology in LDPPHR helps protect the integrity of the common bile duct and reduce the occurrence of intraoperative bile duct injury, postoperative bile leakage, and bile duct stenosis.
