Title: Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum causing Brown-Séquard syndrome: a case report and literature review.

Abstract: Brown-Séquard syndrome (BSS) has many etiologies, including penetrating trauma, extramedullary tumors, and disc herniation. However, thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is an extremely rare cause of this syndrome. A 46-year-old woman with motor weakness in her right lower extremity and urinary retention was admitted to our department. Based on the results of physical examination, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, a diagnosis of BSS with OLF was considered. The patient underwent urgent conservative treatment. BSS is a rare condition characterized by hemisection or hemicompression of the spinal marrow. The herein-described case of incomplete BSS due to OLF responded to conservative treatment. However, the successful nonoperative management of this case is insufficient evidence to consider it as the standard of care. Therefore, emergency laminectomy decompression remains the standard of care for BSS.
