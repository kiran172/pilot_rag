Title: [Moyamoya disease and syndrome].

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare disease characterized by progressive stenosis of the terminal part of the internal carotid arteries (ICA) and the proximal part of their branches, which is accompanied by the formation of collateral network that look like smoke clouds on angiography (Japanese terminology - moyamoya). If the disease is comorbid to other diseases, usually associated with acute or chronic inflammation, including autoimmune processes, it is designated as moyamoy syndrome (MMS). MMD and MMS are one of the causes of ischemic stroke and chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency in young and middle age, less often they lead to hemorrhages. The review presents data on epidemiology, morphology, pathogenesis (the role of genetic predisposition, inflammation, proangiogenic factors and immune disorders), clinical manifestations, instrumental diagnostics and treatment.
