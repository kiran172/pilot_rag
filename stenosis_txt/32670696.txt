Title: Duodenal Stenosis: A Diagnostic Challenge in a Neonate With Poor Weight Gain.

Abstract: Cases of isolated duodenal stenosis in the neonatal period are minimally reported in pediatric literature. Causes of small bowel obstruction such as duodenal atresia or malrotation with midgut volvulus have been well documented and are often diagnosed due to their acute clinical presentation. Duodenal stenosis, however, causes an incomplete intestinal obstruction with a more indolent and varying clinical presentation thus making it a diagnostic challenge. We present a neonate with a unique case of congenital duodenal stenosis. The neonate presented with poor weight gain and frequent "spit-ups" as per the mother at the initial newborn visit. The clinical presentation was masked as the patient was being fed infrequently and with concentrated formula. We postulate that this may be due to the fact that the mother was an adolescent and relatively inexperienced with newborn care. During the hospital course, the patient had recurrent episodes of emesis with notable electrolyte abnormalities including hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis. Further investigation with an abdominal X-ray showed dilated loops of bowel. Pyloric stenosis was ruled out via abdominal ultrasound. An upper gastrointestinal (GI) series ultimately confirmed a diagnosis of duodenal stenosis and the infant underwent surgical repair with full recovery. Congenital duodenal stenosis may have atypical presentations in neonates requiring pediatricians to have a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and to ensure timely therapy.
