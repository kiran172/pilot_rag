Title: Cephalic arch stenosis in the arteriovenous fistula: A retrospective analysis of predisposing factors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cephalic Arch Stenosis (CAS) is a frequently observed complication in brachiocephalic and radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) associated with high morbidity and healthcare expenditure. The predisposing factors and preventative strategies for CAS remain unclear. Our aim was to examine predisposing factors for CAS development in the AVF.
METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed at Gold University Coast Hospital on patients with AVFs created from 2009 to 2018 with ⩾18 months follow-up. CAS was defined as a >50% narrowing on angiographic assessment with clinically significant symptoms (dialysis dysfunction, arm swelling, prolonged bleeding after access).
RESULTS: About 187 patients with AVF were included in the analysis (36 brachiocephalic, 151 radiocephalic). CAS developed in 22 of 36 (61%) of brachiocephalic AVF and 9 of 151 (6%) of radiocephalic AVFs. Brachiocephalic AVF were ⩾12 times more likely to develop CAS than radiocephalic AVF (Hazard Ratio (HR) 12.7, 95% CI [5.6-28.3], p &lt; 0.001). Each 1 mL/min increase in flow rate through the AVF, correlated with a 0.07% increase in the probability of development of CAS (HR 1.0007, 95% CI [1.0001-1.0012], p = 0.011). Brachiocephalic AVFs with CAS were associated with a higher number of interventional procedures per access-year compared with their non-CAS counterparts (Median [Interquartile range]: 1.76 [0.74, 3.97] vs 0.41 [0.27, 0.67], p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Brachiocephalic AVF with higher access flow rates are more likely to develop CAS and earlier than radiocephalic AVF, and in a dose dependent fashion. AVF flow rate is a major factor in CAS development within brachiocephalic AVF and has potential utility in surveillance thresholds for prophylactic blood flow reduction procedures. AVFs with CAS are associated with a greater number of interventional procedures per access-year, heralding higher patient morbidity and healthcare expenditure. Further prospective studies will help define an AVF access flow rate threshold in the implementation of prophylactic strategies for CAS.
