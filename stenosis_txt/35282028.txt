Title: Surgical repair of persistent fifth aortic arch coarctation and interrupted fourth aortic arch without cardiopulmonary bypass: a case report.

Abstract: Persistent fifth aortic arch (PFAA) is a rare congenital cardiovascular anomaly of the aortic arch, which can occur independently but is frequently associated with other cardiovascular malformations including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), interrupted aortic arch (IAA), pulmonary atresia, tetralogy of Fallot, and transposition of the great vessels. PFAA can be classified into three different types according to different abnormal vascular connections (type A, B and C). We report an infant diagnosed with PFAA along with interrupted fourth aortic arch (type B) and PDA. Several surgical methods have been delivered to patients diagnosed with PFAA. In our case, the correction of coarctation PFAA and the ligation of PDA were performed without cardiopulmonary bypass through left lateral thoracotomy. We removed the coarctation part of the PFAA, and then performed the end-to-end anastomosis between the fifth aortic arch and the descending aorta. Despite the stenosis at the site of anastomosis was observed 10 months after the operation, the patient resulted in good recovery by once balloon dilation procedure. Thus, we recommend it is more appropriable to select this procedure in the surgical treatment of PFAA for those patients whose fourth aortic arches were interrupted with fifth aortic arches well developed. Our experience can provide a beneficial reference for future cases.
