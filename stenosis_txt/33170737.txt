Title: Preprocedure CT Findings of Right Heart Failure as a Predictor of Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine whether imaging features of right heart failure seen on CT performed before transcatheter aorta valve replacement (TAVR) predict poor outcomes after the procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated findings on CT performed before TAVR for 505 consecutive patients seen from 2014 to 2018. Of these patients, 300 underwent TAVR. Patient demographic characteristics and clinical and procedural data were recorded. Imaging features, including signs of right heart failure, left heart failure, lung disease, coronary artery disease, and concomitant mitral valve and apparatus calcifications were evaluated. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1 year after TAVR. Patients were divided into two groups: those who were alive (group 1) and those who had died (group 2) by 1 year after TAVR. These groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact tests when applicable. Multivariate logistic regression with a backward stepwise approach was performed. Results were correlated with echo-cardiography findings.
RESULTS: A total of 31 patients (10.3%) died within 1 year of TAVR. The presence and size of pericardial effusions were strongly associated with mortality within 1 year after TAVR (p = 0.002). Pericardial effusion was noted in 25 patients in group 1 (9.3%) and eight patients in group 2 (25.8%). Increased size of the main pulmonary artery was associated with death (p = 0.024), with a median main pulmonary artery size of 2.9 cm (interquartile range, 2.6-3.3 cm) in group 1 and 3.2 cm (interquartile range, 2.9-3.5 cm) in group 2. In multivariate analysis, pericardial effusion size and pulmonary artery size, both of which are indicative of right heart failure, were predictors of death, independent of the routinely used clinical Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (AUC, 0.758; 95% CI, 0.671-0.845). Depressed right ventricular ejection fraction, as identified on echocardiography, was associated with mortality within 1 year after TAVR (p = 0.034), further corroborating the CT findings.
CONCLUSION: Features related to right heart failure on pre-TAVR CT were associated with increased all-cause mortality within the first year after TAVR, even after adjustment for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score. Such imaging findings can help in further risk stratification of patients before TAVR.
