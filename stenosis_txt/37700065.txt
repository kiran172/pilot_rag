Title: Anesthetic management of inguinal hernia in an ex-premature infant with subglottic stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We report the anesthetic management of inguinal hernia repair for an infant with subglottic stenosis. A previously scheduled operation had been cancelled due to unexpected airway trouble during the induction.
CASE PRESENTATION: A boy was born at 24 weeks of gestation and his trachea was intubated for 45 days. At 16 months old, surgery for inguinal hernia was planned, but cancelled due to unexpected narrow airway, and subglottic stenosis was first suspected. At 17 months old, he was transferred to us for inguinal hernia surgery. After careful discussion between the surgical team and the anesthesiologists, a strategy to manage this patient was developed. He underwent open hernia surgery under spinal anesthesia and diagnostic rigid bronchoscopy under tubeless general anesthesia separately, which revealed low-grade stenosis and some subglottic cysts. The postoperative course was uneventful.
CONCLUSION: Interdepartmental discussion weighing risks and benefits may deduce the safest and most appropriate anesthesia method.
