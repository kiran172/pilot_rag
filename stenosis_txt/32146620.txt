Title: Effect of Natural Cytokine Complex on Metabolism of Smooth Muscle Cells in Myocardial Arteries under Normal Conditions and during Hemodynamic Overload.

Abstract: Histoenzymological methods were employed to examine the effects of systemically administered natural cytokine complex including IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNFα, MIF, and TGFβ on metabolism of smooth muscle cells in intramural myocardial arteries under physiological conditions and during acute hemodynamic overload of the heart. Natural cytokine complex markedly inhibited metabolism of vascular smooth muscle cells under control conditions and during acute experimental aortal stenosis. In vascular smooth muscle cells, deceleration of tricarboxylic acid cycle, redistribution of the fluxes in glycolytic cascade and its inhibition, down-regulation of oxidation of free fatty acids and their metabolites, and inhibition of the shuttle systems and biosynthetic processes were observed. Inhibition of metabolism in the vascular wall of myocardial arteries correlated with a decrease in their tone and could be partially determined by a decrease in contractile activity of smooth muscle cells. These findings do not exclude the involvement of other factors and mechanisms in down-regulation of metabolism in vascular myocytes in response to increased cytokines levels of in the blood, including their direct effect on biochemical processes in cells.
