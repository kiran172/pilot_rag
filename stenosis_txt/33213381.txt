Title: Potential value of guard-wire technology in the interventional treatment for ostial coronary lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To explore potential value of guard-wire technology during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ostial coronary lesions.
METHODS: Patients, who underwent PCI, were collected between October 2011 and March 2017. Of the 141 patients, 63 (44.7%) have ostial lesions, and 78 (55.3%) have distal bifurcation sites. They were divided into group A (n = 71) and group B (n = 70). Group A received PCI after guard-wire technology. Group B were given balloon dilation and stent after placing guide wire through target lesion vessel. X-ray exposure time, contrast agent dosage, total PCI duration, pressure incarceration times, cases of malignant arrhythmia and cases of failed PCI of all patients were analyzed, respectively.
RESULTS: The general clinical characteristics includes patients age, sex ratio, the proportion of complications, smoking ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction of both groups was not significantly different. X-ray exposure time, contrast agent dosage, PCI total time, stent positioning time, pressure infestation frequency, arrhythmia frequency and complication number of group B were higher than those of group A. There is no case of malignant arrhythmia and case of failed PCI in group A, while there were five malignant arrhythmia and four failed PCI in group B. Contrast agent dosage and cases of failed PCI increased in group B compared with group A.
CONCLUSION: The guard wire technology is safer and more feasible to patients with ostial coronary lesions who underwent PCI.
