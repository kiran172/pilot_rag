Title: Percutaneous Intervention of Iatrogenic Iliac Artery Vascular Complication.

Abstract: The mortality of patients from a retroperitoneal hematoma remains high if treatment is delayed or inappropriate. Percutaneous endovascular repair of iatrogenic vascular complications is quickly becoming the treatment of choice. Here, we report a case of a 76-year-old female with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, whose cardiac catheterization revealed a 70% distal left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis. She underwent successful rotational atherectomy and deployment of drug-eluting stents of the distal LMCA. Following percutaneous coronary intervention, she suffered acute profound hypotension and was found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma. Given the high cardiac risk for vascular surgery due to recent intervention and overall comorbidities, she was immediately taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and had a diagnostic angiogram, which revealed a right external iliac artery perforation that was treated with a covered stent. She tolerated the procedure well. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis of retroperitoneal bleed, the prompt decision to take the patient to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and potential use of intravascular interventions to ensure a successful outcome.
