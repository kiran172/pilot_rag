Title: Laparoscopic continent cutaneous urinary diversion using a modified Yang-Monti technique in an adult: A case report including 5-year follow-up.

Abstract: Continuous cutaneous urinary diversion is challenging when the appendix is physically unavailable. The Yang-Monti channel is an alternative to the tunneled appendix for urinary diversion. We present a case involving a 49-year-old man who underwent total urethrectomy and cystostomy 10 months previously. No tumor recurrence was observed; however, the patient experienced severe catheter-related bladder irritation after the procedure. The patient was readmitted to the authors' hospital and underwent laparoscopic continent cutaneous urinary diversion using extracorporeal construction of a modified Yang-Monti channel. The operation lasted 232 minutes, with an estimated blood loss of 10 mL. The patient was discharged from hospital 6 days after surgery and removal of the cystostomy tube. After this, clean intermittent catheterization was performed every 3 hours for 4 weeks. Five years after the procedure, the modified Yang-Monti channel was still used for clean intermittent catheterization without any stomal stenosis being observed. The patient was satisfied with his postoperative quality of life.
