Title: Serum biomarkers of fibrostenotic Crohn's disease: Where are we now?

Abstract: Intestinal fibrosis and subsequent stricture formation are major clinical challenges in inflammatory bowel disease, resulting in an increased rate of operation and poor prognosis compared with those without. With the changing perception that intestinal fibrosis is irreversible to the point of view that it is reversible in recent years, various candidate serum biomarkers have been studied over the past decades, which may stratify patients based on their risks of developing stenosis and enable the detection of early stages of fibrosis. However, reliable and accurate biomarkers are still unavailable due to conflicting results and the lack of high-quality evidence. In this review we summarized the serum biomarkers that have been proposed for intestinal fibrosis in recent years, which includes gene polymorphisms or variants, epigenetic markers, extracellular matrix components, growth factors, and antibodies, aiming to provide clues for future research.
