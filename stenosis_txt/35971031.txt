Title: Diagnostic value of quantitative myocardial blood flow assessment by NaI(Tl) SPECT in detecting significant stenosis: a prospective, multi-center study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this prospective multi-center study was to investigate the diagnostic value of myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantification using NaI(Tl)-based single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for determining coronary artery disease (CAD) defined by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).
BACKGROUND: Absolute quantitation of MBF and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) using SPECT is clinically feasible; however, whether flow quantification using NaI(Tl) SPECT is superior to commonly performed SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in determining CAD has not been evaluated.
METHODS: Patients with suspected or known CAD underwent pharmacological stress/rest dynamic SPECT imaging and routine SPECT MPI followed by QCA. Obstructive disease was defined as ≥ 50% reduction in luminal diameter on QCA.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four patients (462 vessels) were included in the analysis. Obstructive CAD was detected in 76/154 patients (49.4%) and 112/462 vessels (24.2%). Optimal cut-off values were 1.86 mL/min/g for stress MBF and 1.95 for MFR, respectively. Stress MBF and MFR were more sensitive than MPI in both individual patients (stress MBF vs MPI: 81.6% vs 51.3%; MFR vs MPI: 72.4% vs 51.3%) and in coronary vascular regions (stress MBF vs MPI: 78.6% vs 31.3%; MFR vs MPI: 75.9% vs 31.3%; all P < .01). In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, quantification revealed a significantly greater area under the curve than MPI at the patient (stress MBF vs MPI: 0.761 vs 0.641; MFR vs MPI: 0.770 vs 0.641) and the vessel (stress MBF vs MPI: 0.745 vs 0.613; MFR vs MPI: 0.756 vs 0.613; all P < .05) levels. Integrating quantitative SPECT measures with MPI significantly increased the area under the curve and improved the discriminatory and reclassification capacity.
CONCLUSION: Flow quantification using NaI(Tl) SPECT provides superior sensitivity and discriminatory capacity to MPI in detecting significant stenosis. Clinical trial registration NCT03637725.
