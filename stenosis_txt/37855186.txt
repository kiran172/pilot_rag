Title: Impact of prolonged drug-coated balloon inflation on residual stenosis and clinical outcomes in coronary artery disease patients: A propensity score matched analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data regarding the optimal duration of drug-coated balloon (DCB) inflation for coronary lesions. We sought to explore the effect of DCB angioplasty with versus without long inflation time on residual stenosis and clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.
METHODS: This study included 314 consecutive patients with 445 lesions undergoing paclitaxel DCB angioplasty using different inflation time, divided according to whether the total inflation time of the DCB was ≥180 s (prolonged group) or <180 s (standard group). The primary clinical endpoint, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or target lesion revascularization, was examined in 92 propensity score matched pairs.
RESULTS: In the matched cohort, the median clinical follow-up period was 947 days. Postprocedural angiographic diameter stenosis was smaller in the prolonged group than in the standard group (30.0% [22.0-37.0] vs. 33.5% [25.5-40.5]; p = 0.042). Intravascular ultrasound measurements revealed that longer DCB inflation time resulted in smaller area stenosis (66.6 ± 7.8% vs. 69.4 ± 7.0%; p = 0.044) and a less mean increase in percent atheroma volume (-11.2 ± 7.1% vs. -7.4 ± 5.9%; p = 0.004) after angioplasty. The rate of the primary endpoint was lower in the prolonged group than in the standard group (log-rank p = 0.025). The efficacy of prolonged DCB inflation was prominent in patients with in-stent restenosis and longer lesions.
CONCLUSION: Prolonged DCB inflation was associated with reduced residual stenosis and improved clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Prospective randomized trials are warranted to validate the benefits of DCB angioplasty with long inflation time.
