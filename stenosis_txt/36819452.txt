Title: May-Thurner Syndrome: A Suspicion That Led to an Incidental Discovery.

Abstract: May-Thurner syndrome (MTS)/Iliac vein compression syndrome is characterized by left iliac vein stenosis secondary to compression by the right common iliac artery against the fifth-lumbar vertebra. It increases the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). We had a 43-year-old female presenting with left leg swelling and was found to have extensive DVT provoked by a long history of travel. Because of the extension of her thrombus, a catheter-guided thrombectomy (CDT) was planned and findings of MTS were identified incidentally. She had an endovascular stent placed and was discharged on long-term anticoagulation.
