Title: Exacerbation of Spinal Stenosis Symptoms Following Neuraxial Anesthesia in an Achondroplastic Cesarean Section.

Abstract: We report the case of an achondroplastic female who presented with acute neurologic decline following epidural anesthesia for an elective cesarean section. Achondroplasia presents unique anatomical challenges to anesthesiologists in perioperative management, and cesarean sections are standard for achondroplastic pregnancies. High rates of spinal stenosis and lumbar radiculopathy in this patient population make administration of epidural analgesia technically challenging and may increase the risk of neurologic injury. Ultrasound is an effective means of administering epidural anesthesia for most patients; however, its utility is user-dependent and more challenging for those with obesity and abnormal spinal anatomy, both of which are common in achondroplasia. Cephalic and thoracic anatomical features in achondroplasia can also make general anesthesia challenging. Therefore, preoperative imaging may help guide preoperative planning based on patient anatomy and individual risk factors to reduce the risks of complications in this patient population. This report includes details from the patient's prenatal care, cesarean section, and 18 months of follow-up.
