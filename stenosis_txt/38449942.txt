Title: Acute Cholecystitis Caused by Campylobacter jejuni Mimicking Acute Coronary Syndrome.

Abstract: Campylobacter spp. is a widely recognized pathogen accountable for acute enteritis, frequently linked to sepsis, primarily attributed to C. jejuni. Instances of Campylobacter-induced cholecystitis are infrequent, with only a limited number of documented case reports. Acute cholecystitis has been sporadically documented to induce electrocardiographic alterations, occasionally simulating an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Herein, we present an instance of cholecystitis induced by C. jejuni, posing a challenge in its differentiation from ACS due to electrocardiographic modifications. An 85-year-old Japanese male presented to our hospital with a complaint of chest discomfort lasting one hour. His medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, and effort angina pectoris, with a prior percutaneous coronary intervention. The chest discomfort, accompanied by pain and pressure, raised uncertainty about its similarity to a previous angina episode. Vital signs were in the normal range. Physical examination revealed no abnormal heart or lung sounds. ElectrocardiographyÂ indicated a right bundle branch block and new ST-segment elevation in V2-3. Echocardiography, chest X-rays, and blood tests showed no abnormalities. Emergency coronary angiography revealed no stenosis. Post-angiography, chest discomfort persisted, and the patient developed fever and chills. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed gallbladder lithiasis, prompting suspicion of sepsis. C. jejuni was detected, and antimicrobial therapy resolved symptoms.
