Title: [Carotid endarterectomy in a patient with bilateral restenosis of stents in internal carotid arteries].

Abstract: The article deals with the results of surgical treatment of a male patient presenting with bilateral restenosis of stents in the internal carotid arteries 11 years after carotid angioplasty with stenting. Described herein are literature reports reflecting the state of the art of the problem, scarcity of studies, as well as some important issues still unresolved. Defined are the main indications for and contraindications to performing this type of reconstruction. The main stages of the operation are demonstrated. This is followed by describing a method of intraoperative protection of the brain, including invasive measurement of retrograde pressure. Besides, the most optimal terms of carrying out the second stage of treatment were determined, eventually demonstrating efficacy and safety of carotid endarterectomy for correction of this condition.
