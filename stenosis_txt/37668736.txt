Title: Simulation to determine the approach of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The present study investigated potential access vessels in patients receiving hemodialysis who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement and determined which approaches were most suitable for performing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing hemodialysis with aortic valve stenosis who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement were included. Preoperative computed tomography data were analyzed to assess the vessel diameter and calcification. Simulations were conducted to determine the feasibility of inserting the 14-F eSheath of Sapien 3 via transfemoral, trans-cervical, trans-subclavian, and direct aorta approaches.
RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were included in this study. The access route was characterized by severe calcification of the common iliac artery. The transfemoral approach was feasible in 77.8% of the cases, but the rate decreased to 33% when the calculations were based on the maximum sheath extension diameter. The trans-cervical, trans-subclavian, and direct aortic approaches were suitable for many patients. Lower extremity artery disease was identified as a risk factor for the unsuitability of the transfemoral approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Common iliac artery calcification in patients undergoing hemodialysis restricts the use of the transfemoral approach. Therefore, some patients require alternative approaches.
