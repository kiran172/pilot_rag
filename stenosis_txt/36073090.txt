Title: A rare delayed complication after TAVR: Acute severe aortic insufficiency.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard of care for managing severe aortic stenosis (AS) in high surgical risk patients. Despite favorable outcomes, TAVR has been associated with complications, such as aortic regurgitation (AR). Post-TAVR aortic insufficiency, which can present at any time after the procedure, manifests as paravalvular leak, central leak, or a combination of the two. Herein, we describe a unique and atypical case of a patient who presented with heart failure and was found to have severe AR in the context of having had TAVR 5 years prior using an Evolut R prosthetic valve.
