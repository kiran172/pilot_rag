Title: A Rare Case of Pulmonic and Aortic Valve Infective Endocarditis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a microbial infection affecting cardiac valves. IE most often affects the aortic valve and is commonly caused by community-acquired, penicillin-sensitive streptococcus that enters through the oral cavity. In this report, we present a case of a 66-year-old man with a medical history of congenital pulmonic stenosis status after pulmonic valve (PV) repair. The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram showing a 1 cm × 0.7 cm mobile vegetation attached to the ventricular aspect of the right coronary aortic cusp and a 1.1 cm × 0.5 cm mobile vegetation attached to the arterial aspect of the PV cusp. In conclusion, concomitant right- and left-sided IE is an exceedingly rare condition. Due to its rarity and complexity of presentation, pulmonic valve endocarditis (PVE) requires a multidisciplinary approach to its perioperative management to prevent systemic complications.
