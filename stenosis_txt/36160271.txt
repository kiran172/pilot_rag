Title: Paracentral acute middle maculopathy following internal carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report a case of paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) that presented after internal carotid artery stenting despite the use of a filter embolic protection device.
OBSERVATIONS: A 74-year-old man presented one week following transfemoral stenting of the right internal carotid artery for high-grade stenosis. A filter-type embolic protection device was used during the stenting procedure to prevent distal embolization of atherosclerotic debris. Dilated examination of the right eye revealed a parafoveal gray lesion in the macula and optical coherence tomography showed a corresponding placoid hyperreflective band at the level of the inner nuclear layer consistent with PAMM. The patient was asymptomatic. At 10 weeks follow up the PAMM lesion was resolved.
CONCLUSIONS: PAMM occurred following internal carotid artery stenting despite the use of a filter embolic protection device, likely due to embolic debris passing through the filter device or debris released while the filter was in a collapsed state. The PAMM lesion was small and resolved without visual sequelae.
