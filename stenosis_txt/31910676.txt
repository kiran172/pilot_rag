Title: Rationale for screening selected patients for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Approximately 15% of all first-ever strokes occur due to atheroembolism from a previously undetected/untreated asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS). Despite that, international guidelines do not recommend screening for ACS. The rationale for not recommending screening include: (a) the harm associated with screening, (b) the questionable clinical benefit associated with surgery, (c) the lack of proven reduction in the risk of stroke, (d) the large number of false positive/false negative tests, and (e) the cost-effectiveness of such screening programs. A critical analysis of each of these arguments is presented. Patients with ACS have a very high risk of all-cause and cardiac mortality. Detection of ACS should not be viewed as an indication for surgery, but rather as an opportunity to implement best medical treatment (BMT) and lifestyle changes to prevent not only strokes, but also cardiac events. The implementation of screening programs for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) has led to a considerable reduction in the number of ruptured AAAs and AAA-related deaths. Similarly, screening high-risk individuals for ACS would enable timely identification of patients with ACS and implementation of BMT and lifestyle measures to prevent future strokes and cardiac events.
