Title: Herniated Disc Causing Foraminal Stenosis and Compression of the Unilateral Exiting Nerve Root at C5-C6: A Case Report.

Abstract: This case report describes the use of unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) for treating a 40-year-old female patient with cervical radiculopathy caused by a herniated disc at C5-C6, which had led to foraminal stenosis and nerve root compression. The patient presented with a one-year history of neck pain radiating to the right upper limb, accompanied by tingling sensations. Imaging revealed loss of cervical lordosis, disc dehydration, and a right-sided foraminal disc protrusion. The patient underwent a right-sided cervical UBE with C5-C6 discectomy and foraminotomy. Postoperatively, the pain was significantly reduced, with improvement in MacNab's grade and visual analog scaleÂ scores for neck pain and radiating pain of the upper limb at one- and three-month follow-ups. The procedure demonstrated the effectiveness of UBE in achieving good clinical outcomes with minimal complications, such as reduced soft tissue damage, minimal blood loss, and preserved spinal stability.
