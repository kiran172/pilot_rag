Title: Modified Brachio-basilic/brachial Arteriovenous Fistula Creation with Short-segment Elevation Preserving the Axilla.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Brachio-basilic/brachial transposition arteriovenous fistula has emerged as one of the autologous arteriovenous fistula options. However, there have not been many reports on the outcomes of basilic or brachial elevation of arteriovenous fistula compared with those of conventional transposition. We evaluated the efficacy of modified brachio-basilic and brachio-brachial arteriovenous fistula creation with short-segment elevation preserving the axillary area.
METHODS: From March 2016 to August 2018, medical records of the patients who underwent short-segment elevation of brachio-basilic or brachio-brachial arteriovenous fistula in the upper arm (sBAE or sBRE) were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Of the 51 patients, 37 underwent sBAE and 14 underwent sBRE. Maturation failure occurred in two patients (3.92%), who underwent sBAE. Stenosis was the most common complication, which developed in 13 patients (25.5%), and there was no significant difference between the sBAE and the sBRE. In the 51 patients, cumulative primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were 88.3% and 69.1%, respectively. Assisted primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were 97.8% and 90.7%, respectively. Secondary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were both 100%. There were no significant differences between the sBAE and the sBRE in 1-year primary patency (79.1% vs. 46.7%; P = 0.20), assisted primary patency (91.6% vs. 88.1%; P = 0.36), and secondary patency rates (100% vs. 100%).
CONCLUSIONS: Brachio-basilic/brachial arteriovenous fistula with short-segment elevation preserving the axilla showed excellent 1-year patency rate, easier cannulation, and other future advantages, and therefore, is a logical modification of conventional transposition of arteriovenous fistula.
