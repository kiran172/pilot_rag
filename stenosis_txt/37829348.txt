Title: Surgical intervention of Takayasu's arteritis with supraaortic arterial occlusive disease and critical ischemia of upper extremity: A case report.

Abstract: Type I Takayasu's arteritis is a rare form of large vessel vasculitis with an unknown etiopathogenesis. It is characterized by progressive chronic inflammation and occlusive thromboaortopathy affecting the aorta and its main branches. Type I Takayasu's arteritis predominantly affects women and is most commonly observed in their third decade of life. In this report, we present the case of a 32-year-old female patient who exhibited severe long-segment stenosis in the left common carotid artery and total occlusion of the left subclavian artery. The patient experienced significant ischemic symptoms of the left upper extremity and had previously been diagnosed with Takayasu's arteritis, being followed up under maintenance corticosteroid therapy. To address these complications, we conducted a surgical bypass using a prosthetic graft. The graft was inserted intrathoracically, extending from the patient's ascending aorta to both the left common carotid artery and the left distal subclavian artery. This approach was designed to closely mimic anatomical routes, promoting optimal graft patency. In the context of this case, we highlight the importance of surgical intervention in alleviating ischemia and explore potential surgical alternatives for treating patients with Takayasu's arteritis involving the supraaortic region.
