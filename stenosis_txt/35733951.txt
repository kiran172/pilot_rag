Title: Transient ischemic attack due to multiple spontaneous calcified embolus of the cerebral arteries on a calcified mitral and aortic stenosis.

Abstract: We report a case of calcified mitral and aortic stenosis revealed by a reversible ischemic stroke. A 59-year-old male patient, with background of hypertension, kidney failure, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, presented with neither acute onset of right-sided hemiparesis without aphasia nor any loss of consciousness. Head computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple rounded and amorph calcified high-density calcifications within the distal segments of both sylvian and posterior cerebral arteries. Angiographic CT of the carotids didn't reveal any stenosis or atherosclerotic plaques. Thoracic CT showed massive mitral and aortic valvular calcifications with a left ventricular hypertrophy.
