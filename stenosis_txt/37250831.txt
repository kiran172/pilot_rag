Title: Nasal Retainer 2.0: A New, Cheap, and Reliable Method to Prepare Custom-made Nostril Retainer for Nasal Reconstruction.

Abstract: Total nasal reconstruction always represents a challenge for the plastic surgeon, who must deal both with the reconstructive procedure and compliance of the patient. This kind of reconstruction often requires more than one step. Therefore, more prolonged and emphasized scarring than normal can occur, thus resulting in a higher risk of nostril stenosis. Although several nasal retainers have been described, traditional premade retainers could be poorly tolerated by patients and need to be adequately customized to improve patient compliance. Herein, the authors propose a new, cheap, and reliable method to prepare customized nasal retainers which can be used after every step of nasal reconstruction.
