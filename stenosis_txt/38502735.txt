Title: Diagnostic Performance of Angiography-Derived Quantitative Flow Ratio in Complex Coronary Lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Quantitative flow ratio derived from computed tomography angiography (CT-QFR) and invasive coronary angiography (Murray law-based quantitative flow ratio [μQFR]) are novel approaches enabling rapid computation of fractional flow reserve without the use of pressure guidewires and vasodilators. However, the feasibility and diagnostic performance of both CT-QFR and μQFR in evaluating complex coronary lesions remain unclear.
METHODS: Between September 2014 and September 2021, 240 patients with 30% to 90% coronary diameter stenosis who underwent both coronary computed tomography angiography and invasive coronary angiography with fractional flow reserve within 60 days were retrospectively enrolled. The diagnostic performance of CT-QFR and μQFR in detecting functional ischemia among all lesions, especially complex coronary lesions, was analyzed using fractional flow reserve as the reference standard.
RESULTS: CT-QFR and μQFR analyses were performed on 309 and 289 vessels, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for CT-QFR in all lesions at the per-vessel level were 91% (with a 95% CI of 84%-96%), 92% (95% CI, 88%-95%), 83% (95% CI, 75%-90%), 96% (95% CI, 93%-98%), and 92% (95% CI, 88%-95%), with values for μQFR of 90% (95% CI, 81%-95%), 97% (95% CI, 93%-99%), 92% (95% CI, 84%-97%), 96% (95% CI, 92%-98%), and 94% (95% CI, 91%-97%), respectively. Among bifurcation, tandem, and moderate-to-severe calcified lesions, the diagnostic values of CT-QFR and μQFR showed great correlation and agreement with those of invasive fractional flow reserve, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve exceeding 0.9 for each complex lesion at the vessel level. Furthermore, the accuracies of CT-QFR and μQFR in the gray zone were 85% and 84%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Angiography-derived quantitative flow ratio (CT-QFR and μQFR) demonstrated remarkable diagnostic performance in complex coronary lesions, indicating its pivotal role in the management of patients with coronary artery disease.
