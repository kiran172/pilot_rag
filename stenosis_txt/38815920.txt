Title: Percutaneous Mechanical Thrombectomy Using the AcoStream Thrombus Aspiration System for Acute Superior Mesenteric Artery Embolism.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study was performed to summarize our experience in treating acute superior mesenteric artery embolism (SMAE) by percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT).
METHODS: Between January 2023 and October 2023, 18 patients presenting with acute mesenteric ischemia were admitted to our center, including 11 cases of SMAE, 3 cases of superior mesenteric artery thrombosis, and 4 cases of superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. We retrospectively reviewed 8 patients (4 males and 4 females; range, 51-79 years; mean, 62.50 ± 9.67 years) who underwent treatment of acute SMAE using the AcoStream system. The patients had no obvious evidence of intestinal necrosis as shown by peritoneal puncture or computed tomography. Thrombectomy was performed on the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) using an 8F AcoStream thrombus aspiration system (Acotec, China). The demographics, risk factors, therapeutic effect, complications, mortality, and follow-up of the study population were assessed.
RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100%. After 1-3 passes (2.38 ± 0.92) and aspiration thrombectomy, complete thrombus removal was achieved in 7 (87.50%) patients. One patient received an adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis due to partial thrombus removal. Thrombolysis was conducted for 2 days, resulting in complete resolution of the thrombus. The other 7 patients did not receive adjunctive endovascular intervention due to complete thrombus removal and no residual stenosis. No distal embolization or device-related complications were noted during the procedure. After the procedure, sufficient clinical improvement was seen in 6 patients within 1-2 days. Two patients showed no significant improvement of their symptoms. Laparotomy was performed on day 1 and day 2 after thrombectomy in patients 3 and 7, respectively. Intestinal necrosis was diagnosed operatively and intestinal resection was performed. All patients were discharged 6-15 days (9.50 ± 3.07) after admission without perioperative complication or death. The mean follow-up period was 5.00 ± 3.30 months (range, 1-10 months), and the follow-up rate was 100%. During the follow-up, all patients remained symptom-free. Computed tomography angiography images showed good flow in the trunk and branches of the SMA in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: PMT using the AcoStream system is a minimally invasive, safe, and effective technique for acute SMAE. Early application of PMT can achieve immediate revascularization of the SMA and have the potential advantage of avoiding laparotomy or reducing the extension of enterectomy, as it could theoretically restore intestinal perfusion in less time than open revascularization. If the symptoms do not improve after PMT, exploratory laparotomy should be scheduled as soon as possible. Further studies are necessary on this field to confirm these findings.
