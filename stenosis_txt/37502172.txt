Title: Open Retrograde Stenting with a Sheathless Method Using a Balloon-guiding Catheter for Proximal Common Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy are relatively difficult for proximal common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis because of the difficulty in anatomical approach. We treated proximal CCA stenosis by retrograde stenting using a 9Fr Optimo for peripheral intervention with a sheathless method.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old woman was scheduled for total arch replacement (TAR) for an aortic arch aneurysm. Preoperative cervical MRI incidentally revealed tandem stenosis in the left CCA. We intended to treat CCA stenosis prior to aortic arch replacement. Under general anesthesia, distal left CCA was exposed. A 9Fr Optimo was introduced into CCA by retrograde with a sheathless method. The retrograde CAS was performed under distal balloon protection. Her postoperative course was uneventful.
CONCLUSION: Retrograde stenting using a 9Fr Optimo for peripheral intervention with a sheathless method was safe and useful for proximal CCA stenosis.
