Title: Complications of Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Spinal Surgery for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In recent years, unilateral biportal endoscopic spinal surgery has been used for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with good results. Some investigators counted the total incidence of complications in unilateral biportal endoscopic surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis, but none have analyzed the incidence of specific complications. The present study further counted the incidence of specific complications and gave the possible causes of the complications.
METHODS: English databases including PubMed were searched to collect relevant literature on unilateral biportal endoscopic spinal surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis. The inquiry period is from January 1, 2015, to July 1, 2022. The literature was screened, information extracted, and risk of bias evaluated by the researchers, followed by Meta analysis using R4.2.1 and RStudio statistical software.
RESULTS: In total, we included 14 studies involving 707 patients. The included studies were retrospective case series, The results of the single-arm rate meta-analysis showed that the total complication rate of unilateral biportal endoscopic surgery treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis was 8.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.060; 0.103]); of which, the highest incidence of dural tear was 4.5% (95% CI [0.030; 0.064]), the incidence of symptomatic postoperative spinal epidural hematoma was approximately 1.1% (95% CI [0.001; 0.027]), the incidence of incomplete decompression was 2.0% (95% CI [0.007; 0.038]), the incidence of transient palsy was 2.6% (95% CI [0.005; 0.057]).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of total complications of unilateral biportal endoscopic surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis was 8.1%, dural tear remained a major complication with an incidence of 4.5%, incomplete decompression was 2.0%, transient palsy was 2.6%, and, unexpectedly, symptomatic postoperative spinal epidural hematoma was only 1.1%.
