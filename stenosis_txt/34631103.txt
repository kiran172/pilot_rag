Title: A case of diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis due to oesophageal stenosis after radiation therapy.

Abstract: A 66-year-old woman was hospitalized for recurrent pneumonia twice in 1 year. After treatment for pneumonia, chronic coughing, sputum and low-grade fever continued, so she was referred and admitted to our hospital for investigation. Chest computed tomography revealed a lung infiltrative shadow and diffuse centrilobular micronodules. Histological findings from transbronchial lung biopsy showed chronic inflammation and giant cells in the bronchiole. These findings were compatible with diffuse aspiration bronchiolitis (DAB), which is characterized by chronic inflammation of the bronchioles caused by recurrent aspiration of foreign bodies. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed stenosis of the oesophageal entrance, which was thought to be caused by radiation therapy for hypopharyngeal cancer 20 years before. Antibiotic treatment ameliorated the centrilobular nodule shadow. After discharge, there was no recurrence. This is the first case report of DAB resulting from oesophageal stenosis associated with hypopharyngeal cancer and will serve as an educational case.
