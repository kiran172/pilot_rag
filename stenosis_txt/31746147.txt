Title: Isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis in Takayasu arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis is a chronic granulomatous vasculitis generally affecting large vessels including the thoracic aorta and its branches. Intimal proliferation subsequently causes segmental stenosis and occlusion, and frequently aneurysmal dilatation in the affected vessels. Although involvement of pulmonary arteries is not uncommon, isolated branch pulmonary stenosis is rarely encountered. Here, we report a patient presenting with isolated peripheral pulmonary stenosis as the primary manifestation of Takayasu arteritis.
