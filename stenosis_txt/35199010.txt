Title: Accessory Mitral Valve Tissue and Internal Mammary Artery Stenosis: Unique Considerations After Cardiac Arrest.

Abstract: A man with recurrent syncope and remote aortic coarctation repair experienced cardiac arrest with exercise stress testing. Critical coronary stenosis was discovered. Further evaluation revealed accessory mitral valve tissue and internal mammary artery occlusion. These rare abnormalities, not previously reported together, presented challenges to treatment. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
