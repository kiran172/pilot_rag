Title: Elevated Intrarenal Resistive Index Predicted Faster Renal Function Decline and Long-Term Mortality in Non-Proteinuric Chronic Kidney Disease.

Abstract: Background. Intrarenal resistive index (RI) ≥ 0.80 predicts renal outcomes in proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, this evidence in non-proteinuric patients with CKD of unknown etiology is lacking. In this study, we assessed the effect of intrarenal RI on renal function and all-cause mortality in non-proteinuric patients with CKD of unknown etiology despite an extensive diagnostic work-up. Methods. Non-proteinuric CKD patients were evaluated in a retrospective longitudinal study. Progression of renal disease was investigated by checking serum creatinine levels at 1, 3, and 5 years and defined by a creatinine level increase of at least 0.5 mg/dL. The discrimination performance of intrarenal RI in predicting the 5-year progression of renal disease was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results. One-hundred-thirty-one patients (76 ± 9 years, 56% males) were included. The median follow-up was 7.5 years (interquartile range 4.3−10.5) with a cumulative mortality of 53%, and 5-year renal disease progression occurred in 25%. Patients with intrarenal RI ≥ 0.80 had a faster increase of serum creatinine levels compared to those with RI < 0.80 (+0.06 mg/dL each year, 95% CI 0.02−0.10, p < 0.010). Each 0.1-unit increment of intrarenal RI was an independent determinant of 5-year renal disease progression (odds ratio 4.13, 95% CI 1.45−12.9, p = 0.010) and predictor of mortality (hazards ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.05−3.09, p = 0.034). AUROCs of intrarenal RI for predicting 5-year renal disease progression and mortality were 0.66 (95% CI 0.57−0.76) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.58−0.74), respectively. Conclusions. In non-proteinuric patients with CKD of unknown etiology, increased intrarenal RI predicted both a faster decline in renal function and higher long-term mortality, but as a single marker, it showed poor discrimination performance.
