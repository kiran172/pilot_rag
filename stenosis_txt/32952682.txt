Title: Interleukin-17 is Not Associated with Risk of Premature Coronary Artery Disease in Iranian Turks.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most important causes of death globally. Results of recent studies have indicated that cytokine dysregulation was associated with premature coronary artery disease (P-CAD). The majority of cytokine gene polymorphisms influence the level of cytokine production and secretion. This study aimed to analyse IL-17 gene expression in patients with P-CAD and healty individuals in an Iranian population. This case-control study, conducted in Urmia University of Medical Sciences, compared patients with P-CAD hospitalised for risk of coronary artery stenosis, those admitted for medical cares and healthy normal controls. Thirty patients with P-CAD and 30 healthy individuals entered the study. The tested individulas were selected according to strict criteria such as clinical, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram and coronary angiography findings. Individuals with diabetes type 1 or 2 were excluded from the study. Reducing the diameter of at least one of the coronary arteries with more than 50% obstruction was selected as P-CAD. The qRT-PCR technique was used to determine the level of IL-17 gene expression in the studied groups. IL-17 gene expression was compared between the tested groups using t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. Subjects' mean age (±SE) was 45(±5) and 44 (±4) among tested cases and related controls, respectively. The relative mRNA expression was 4.04±2.4 in patients with P-CAD and 2.75±1.3 in controls for IL-17. IL-17 gene expression was not significantly different in the tested groups (P> 0.05). IL-17 is not associated with risk of P-CAD in Iranian Turks.
