Title: Case report: Late-onset hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in a 3-year-old boy: It is never too late.

Abstract: Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS) represents a relatively rare occurrence beyond infancy. Here, we present the case of a barely 3-year-old boy diagnosed with late-onset HPS and successfully treated with extra-mucosal pyloromyotomy. We review the literature, challenging the principle that more aggressive surgical approaches should be preferred over less invasive ones.
