Title: Recovery of the Japanese orthopedic association back pain evaluation questionnaire score and walking ability following lumbar spinal stenosis surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We investigated the recovery of the Japanese orthopedic association back pain evaluation questionnaire (JOABPEQ) scores and 6 min walk distance (6MWD) in patients after surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis and identified the items among 25 questions of JOABPEQ that showed recovery.
METHODS: A total of 227 patients (average age 71.5 years; SD: 7.5; 121 men) were included from a single center. The outcome measures were JOABPEQ, visual analog scale (VAS), and 6MWD and obtained preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Mixed-model repeated measures were used to compare the variables at each time point between the surgery groups.
RESULTS: The JOABPEQ, VAS, and 6MWD scores generally improved at 1 month postoperatively compared with those obtained preoperatively, and some parameters further improved at 3 months. However, improvement in the lumbar spine dysfunction item of JOABPEQ was delayed, showing improvement at 3 months postoperatively for decompression surgery (average score: pre, 64.6; 3 months, 78.5) and 6 months postoperatively for fusion surgery (average score: Pre, 64.3; 6 months, 77.1). Responses to the individual JOABPEQ questions generally improved after surgery. No significant changes in lumbar spine dysfunction occurred in the fusion group.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the early postoperative recovery course of JOABPEQ and 6MWD. In the fusion group, significant changes in lumbar spine dysfunction started at 6 months postoperatively. These findings could help medical staff explain postoperative recovery to patients after lumbar spinal stenosis surgery and in their decision making regarding surgery.
