Title: Use of a Lumen-Apposing Metal Stent for Management of Pouch Outlet Stenosis After Vertical Banded Gastroplasty.

Abstract: Lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMSs) offer a novel alternative for the treatment of anastomotic strictures or short, benign gastrointestinal strictures. In the bariatric realm, LAMSs provide a potentially safer, efficacious, and nonsurgical approach to surgical revision. Here, we present a case where a LAMS was successfully used to manage pouch outlet stenosis from a previous vertical banded gastroplasty.
