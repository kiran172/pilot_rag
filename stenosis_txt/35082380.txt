Title: Choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing carotid angioplasty and stenting: a nationwide population-based study.

Abstract: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and carotid stenosis are important risk factors for stroke. Carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) is recommended for patients with symptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis. The optimal medical management for patients with NVAF after CAS remains unclear. We aimed to clarify this issue using real-world data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). In total, 2116 consecutive NVAF patients who received CAS between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016, from NHIRD were divided into groups based on post-procedure medication as follows: only antiplatelet agent (OAP, n = 587); only anticoagulation agent (OAC, n = 477); dual antiplatelet agents (DAP, n = 49); and a combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents (CAPAC, n = 304). Mortality, vascular events, and major bleeding episodes were compared after matching with the Charlson comorbidity index and CHA2DS2-VASc score. The CAPAC and the OAC groups had lower mortality rates than the OAP group (P = 0.0219), with no statistical differences in major bleeding, ischemic stroke, or vascular events. Conclusively, OAC therapy after CAS appears suitable for NVAF patients. CAPAC therapy might be considered as initial therapy or when there is concern about vascular events.
