Title: What are the Soft Tissue Risk Factors for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients with Down's Syndrome?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors and their respective magnitudes for developing Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in Down syndrome (DS) patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PATIENTS: The 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) was queried to identify all patients diagnosed with DS.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary predictor variables were tonsillar hypertrophy (TH), adenoidal hypertrophy (AH), Hypertrophy of Tonsils & Adenoids (HTA), Laryngeal Stenosis (LS), Hypotonia, Glossoptosis, Congenital Laryngomalacia (CL), and Overweight & Obesity (OO). The primary outcome variable was OSA.
RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 18,181 patients with a diagnosis of DS. Relative to patients aged 0-5, patients aged 6-10 (OR 3.5, P < 0.01), 11-5 (OR 3.4, P < 0.01), and 16 & above (OR 3.6, P < 0.01) were each independently associated with increased odds of OSA. Further, TH (OR 23.2, P < 0.01), AH (OR 20.3, P < 0.01), HTA (OR 64.2, P < 0.01), glossoptosis (OR 5.0, P < 0.01), CL (OR 4.3, P < 0.01), and OO (OR 3.7, P < 0.01) were all independent risk factors for OSA.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids together was the strongest risk factor for OSA. DS patients aged six and above were at risk for OSA development relative to younger patients. Patients with DS should be tested for OSA, which otherwise will deteriorate their existing comorbidities.
