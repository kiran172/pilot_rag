Title: Management and diagnosis of Nutcracker syndrome-a case report.

Abstract: Nutcracker syndrome (NCS), also known as left renal vein (LRV) entrapment syndrome is a condition that leads to stenosis of the aorto-mesenteric region of the LRV, with dilatation of the distal portion of the vessel. A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the Urology department with symptoms of intermittent painless hematuria and mild to moderate left lumbar pain for the last three months. The patient underwent cystoscopy under general anesthesia. Bloody urine was noticed to appear from the left ureter ostium and an intra-venous contrast CT of the abdomen was performed. The final diagnosis was anterior Nutcracker syndrome.
