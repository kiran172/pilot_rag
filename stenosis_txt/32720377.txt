Title: How to perform a late explantation of a Sapien XT transcatheter aortic prosthesis.

Abstract: Starting as a therapeutically option for high-risk surgical patients with degenerative aortic valve stenosis, the transcatheter aortic valve implantation method is probably going to become the method of choice for this pathology also in younger and low-risk patients. As bioprosthesis are prone to degeneration, requiring a redo procedure, whenever a valve in valve procedure is contraindicated, a surgical valve replacement will become necessary. We describe a simple surgical method for explantation of a Sapien XT prosthesis that was implanted 7 years previously in a calcified aortic valve.
