Title: Acute Coronary Artery Occlusion during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a Patient with an Anomalous Left Circumflex Coronary Artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute coronary artery occlusion (CAO) during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a rare but life-threatening complication during the procedure; there were a few case reports about an anomalous LCX during perioperative period. We report a case of successful coronary protection using the chimney stenting technique in a patient with a severely calcified aortic valve and an anomalous LCX. Case Summary. A 75-year-old man was found an anomalous left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) originating from the right coronary cusp with severely calcified aortic valve stenosis requiring TAVR. When a self-expanding aortic valve was deployed, we found flow compromise in the right coronary system and circumflex to TIMI-0 flow. By using the chimney stenting technique, we rapidly planted 2 stents from the proximal CX branch to the sinotubular junction and the coronary flow was maintained.
CONCLUSION: Chimney stenting protection as a bailout technique is safe and feasible and should be considered in patients deemed to be at high risk of coronary flow compromise, especially with an anomalous LCX.
