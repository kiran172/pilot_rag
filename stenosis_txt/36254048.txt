Title: Clinical significance of asymmetric venous vasculature on minimum-intensity projection in patients with moyamoya disease.

Abstract: This study analyzed the clinical significance and characteristics of asymmetric venous blood flow in patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD) using minimum intensity projection (minIP) susceptibility-weighted imaging. The minIP views of 30 patients diagnosed with MMD were retrospectively analyzed using clinical features, brain magnetic resonance angiography, electroencephalography, and brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Simultaneously, differences between patients with acute cerebral infarction and non-MMD causes were analyzed. Twelve (40.0%) of the 30 patients had asymmetrical venous flow, which is usually seen in patients with acute cerebral infarction (P = .146). They also had significantly higher Suzuki stages than symmetric patients (P = .014), with five (41.7%) and three (25.0%) of them in stages 4 and 5, respectively. When the Suzuki stages of both hemispheres were different, more veins were found in the stenotic hemisphere (88.9%). Brain SPECT showed more severe hypoperfusion on the side with prominent vascularity in the minIP view (100.0%). Additionally, asymmetric blood flow was observed in 66.7% of the patients with cerebral infarction caused by MMD, whereas only 11.1% of the children with cerebral infarction caused by non-MMD had asymmetry (P = .005). Patients with MMD showed asymmetric hypointensity of the cortical veins with a minIP appearance. The venous structure showed greater signal loss on SWI and was more prominent in the hemisphere where stenosis was advanced or infarction occurred in other examinations. Cerebral infarction in patients with MMD tended to occur with asymmetrically prominent venous patterns with damaged areas in minIP images, which had distinct characteristics from those of patients without MMD.
