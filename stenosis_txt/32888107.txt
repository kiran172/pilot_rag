Title: Are there any subclinical myocardial dysfunctions in subjects with aortic valve sclerosis? A 3D-speckle tracking echocardiography study.

Abstract: Aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) is defined as calcified and thickened aortic leaflets without restriction of leaflet motion. We have not found any studies that previously assessed the effect of AVS on myocardial functions with three dimensional-speckle tracking echocardiography (3D-STE). Therefore, we aimed to identify any early changes in left atrial (LA) myocardial dynamics and/or left ventricular (LV) systolic functions in patients with AVS using 3D-STE. Seventy-five patients with AVS and 80 age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled into the study. The baseline clinical characteristics of the study patients were recorded. Conventional 2D echocardiographic and 3D-STE analyses were performed. The LV-global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) and LV-global circumferential strain (LV-GCS) were significantly decreased in the AVS (+) group than in the control group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.013, respectively). In multivariate logistic regression analysis; LV-GLS (p < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-5.63) and Triglyceride (TG) (p = 0.033, OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.72) were found to be independent predictors of AVS. ROC analysis was performed to find out the ideal LV-GLS cut-off value for predicting the AVS. A LV-GLS value of > - 18 has 85.8% sensitivity, 67.5% specificity for the prediction of the AVS. Our results support that subjects with AVS may have subclinical LV deformation abnormalities even though they have not LV pressure overload. According to our findings, patients with AVS should be investigated in terms of atherosclerotic risk factors, their dysmetabolic status should be evaluated and closely followed up for their progression to calcific aortic stenosis.
