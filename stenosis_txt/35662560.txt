Title: Monitoring conduction disturbances following TAVR: Feasibility study of early discharge using a novel telemetry patch.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Despite the technological advances and increasing operator experience, the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not decreased over time. With a continuous downward trend in post-TAVR length of stay, prolonged home-monitoring may have a key role in detecting potentially serious conduction abnormalities after TAVR discharge.
METHODS: In this study, the ZioPatch-AT monitor was used to detect conduction abnormalities after TAVR discharge. The cardiac monitoring device was systematically provided to all patients having pre-existing right bundle branch block or developing intra-/peri-procedural conduction disturbances, in the absence of guideline indication for PPI at discharge.
RESULTS: From a total of 75 patients at high-risk of conduction disturbances, 8 (11%) of them underwent PPI and most of them (6/8) were detected before symptoms' occurrence. Paired analysis between baseline and discharge electrocardiograms detected a significant widening of the QRS in all patients; on the contrary, PR length was significantly increased only in the group experiencing HAVB after discharge (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In an early post-TAVR discharge era, 30-day outpatient cardiac rhythm monitoring is potentially a safe solution to allow timely recognition of new conduction disturbances requiring PPI.
