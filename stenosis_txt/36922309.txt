Title: Importance of imaging-acquisition protocol and post-processing analysis for extracellular volume fraction assessment by computed tomography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computed tomography angiography (CTA) assessment of myocardial extracellular volume fraction (CT-ECV) is feasible, although the protocols for imaging acquisition and post-processing methodology have varied. We aimed to identify a pragmatic protocol for CT-ECV assessment encompassing both imaging acquisition and post-processing methodologies to facilitate its clinical implementation.
METHODS: We evaluated consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing evaluation for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Pre-contrast and 3-min-delayed CTA were obtained in systole using either helical prospective-ECG-triggered (high-pitch) or axial sequential-ECG-gated acquisition, adding to standard TAVR CTA protocol. Using a dedicated software for co-registration of CTA datasets, three methodologies for ECV measurement were evaluated: (1) mid-septum region of interest (Septal ECV), (2) averaged-global ECV (Global ECV) encompassing 16-AHA segments, and (3) average of septal and lateral segments (Averaged ECVsep and Averaged ECVlat).
RESULTS: Among the 142 patients enrolled (median ​= ​81 years, 44% females), 8 were excluded due to significant imaging artifacts precluding Global ECV assessment. High-pitch scan mode was performed in 68 patients (48%). Suboptimal image quality for Global ECV assessment was associated with high-pitch scan mode (odds ratio: OR ​= ​2.26, p ​= ​0.036), along with the presence of intracardiac leads (OR ​= ​4.91, p ​= ​0.002), and BMI≥35 ​kg/m2 (OR ​= ​2.80, p ​= ​0.026). Septal ECV [median ​= ​29.4%] and Averaged ECVsep [29.0%] were similar (p ​= ​0.108), while Averaged ECVlat [27.5%] was lower than Averaged ECVsep (p ​&lt; ​0.001), resulting in lower Global ECV [28.6%].
CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial CT-ECV assessment is feasible using a systolic sequential acquisition pre-contrast, and similar additional 3-min delayed scan. Septal ECV measurement provides similar values to Global ECV and is equally reproducible.
