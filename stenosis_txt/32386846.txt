Title: Ultrasound Measurement of Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and Plaques in Predicting Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: Ultrasound measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and plaque thickness (PT) may be an additional tool for risk stratification of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the emergency department (ED). The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation of CIMT and PT with coronary artery disease (CAD) in risk stratification tests.This prospective observational study was conducted in an academic tertiary care ED. Carotid ultrasound measurements were obtained for emergency patients with suspected ACS. Carotid measurements included PT, mean CIMT and maximum CIMT. The correlations between carotid ultrasound and the results of coronary catheter angiography (CA), coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and stress tests were identified. The convenience sample included 58 patients comprising 39 men and 19 women with a mean age of 60 Â± 12 y. Twenty-two percent (13/58) of patients were positive for CAD, as indicated by results of the cardiac risk stratification tests. Presence of plaque correlated with CCTA findings, with a high specificity (92.8%) for a positive test. Max CIMT predicted abnormal CCTA (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.93, 95% confidence interval: 0.80-1). The correlations with stress test (0.78, 0.46-1) and CA (0.55, 0.28-0.82) were weaker. Presence of carotid plaque correlated significantly with findings of CAD on all risk stratification tests, but especially with CCTA. Carotid ultrasound could have a role in risk stratification in the ED, though more research is needed.
