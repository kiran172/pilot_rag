Title: Successful biliary self-expandable metallic stenting using an ultra-slim endoscope for cholangitis caused by pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Highlight Kida and colleagues described their method for successfully performing biliary self-expandable metallic stenting with the through-the-scope technique using an ultra-slim endoscope for malignant biliary obstruction with duodenal stenosis. This procedure may be useful in cases of duodenal stenosis in which it is difficult to reach the major duodenal papilla.
