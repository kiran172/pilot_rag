Title: Fetal aqueductal stenosis: Prenatal diagnosis and intervention.

Abstract: Fetal severe central nervous system ventriculomegaly is associated with poor neurologic outcomes, usually driven by a primary malformation, deformation, or disruption of brain parenchyma. In utero shunting of excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in hopes of improving neurologic outcomes was attempted in the 1980s but was abandoned due to perceived lack of effect, likely due to technological limitations of the time that precluded proper patient selection. Little progress on the antenatal management of severe ventriculomegaly has been made in the intervening decades. A multidisciplinary, evidence-based reassessment of ventriculoamniotic shunting for isolated fetal aqueductal stenosis (FAS), a unique form of severe ventriculomegaly (supratentorial intracranial hypertension), is currently underway. An accurate diagnosis of FAS must precede in utero intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be an excellent adjunct to high-resolution prenatal ultrasound and next-generation genetic testing to correctly diagnose FAS in a timely fashion while excluding other intracranial and extracranial anomalies. This manuscript will briefly discuss the history, current management, and future directions of the prenatal diagnosis and potential intervention for FAS.
