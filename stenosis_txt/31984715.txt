Title: [Surgical treatment of acquired tracheal stenosis in pediatrics].

Abstract: Acquired tracheal stenosis is a very infrequent lesion in the pediatric age group and may be due to diverse causes, being post-intubation stenosis and stenosis secondary to tracheostomy the most common ones. The management of acquired tracheal stenosis remains controversial. Endoscopic treatment provides immediate relief of symptoms but it is associated with a high recurrence rate, and the use of endoluminal prostheses can increase the length of the stricture complicating future surgery. Conversely, good long-term results have been documented with tracheal resection and primary anastomosis. We describe our experience with tracheal resection followed by end-to-end anastomosis for the treatment of post-intubation tracheal stenosis in 8 patients.
