Title: Management options of valvular heart diseases after heart transplantation: A scoping review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to outline the valvular changes following heart transplantation and describe the management options to address these conditions.
METHODS: A literature search using EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases was performed in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines in this study. Clinical studies involving patients who had their first heart transplant and articles that mentioned management for valvular heart disease were included. Treatment options were grouped into four categories: cardiac surgery other than retransplant and valve surgery, valve replacement and repairs, nonsurgical interventions, and conservative management.
RESULTS: Nine hundred and three (6.56%) patients out of 13,757 patients (10,529 males, 3,228 females; mean age: 60.3±10.4 years; range, 20 to 83 years) undergoing heart transplantation were identified with valvular disease affecting one or more valves. The mean interval between the transplant and the diagnosis of valve disease was 11.31±6.95 years. The most common valvular heart disease was tricuspid regurgitation, with 796 (94.09%) occurrences, followed by mitral regurgitation (n=22, 2.6%), aortic regurgitation (n=14, 1.65%), aortic stenosis (n=11, 1.3%), and mitral stenosis (n=3, 0.35%). Additionally, the number of surgical valve replacement and repairs (n=89) was higher than nonsurgical interventions (n=20).
CONCLUSION: Acquired valvular heart diseases after cardiac transplantation are an infrequent clinical presentation that can cause valvular changes in the recipient. According to the extracted data, there is no sole superior management option, and more research is needed in this area.
