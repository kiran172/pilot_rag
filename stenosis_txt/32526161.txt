Title: Long-Term Outcome and Quality of Life After Biological Aortic Valve Replacement in Nonelderly Adults.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a standard of care in the treatment of aortic stenosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term outcome and quality of life (QoL) after biological AVR in patients younger than 60 years of age.
METHODS: A total of 354 consecutive patients less than or equal to 60 years who underwent biological AVR at our institution (2005-2015) were included. The primary endpoint was actual freedom from AV reintervention, and secondary endpoints were actual freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) as well as mental and physical QoL.
RESULTS: Mean age was 52.3 ± 7.1 years and mean follow-up duration was 78.7 ± 38.1 months. Overall survival at 5, 10, and 12 years was 87.6%, 76.3%, and 63.5%, and actual freedom from AV reintervention was 85.5%, 67.8%, and 52.9%, respectively. Actual freedom from MACCE was 82.8%, 63.2%, and 50.4%, respectively. Cox regression revealed concomitant coronary artery disease (P < .001) and creatinine at baseline (P < .001) as independent predictors of survival, AV reintervention, and MACCE. Physical QoL was similar (P = .427) and mental QoL (P = .005) was significantly better compared with the published age-matched control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Biological AVR in patients less than or equal to 60 years of age is associated with a significant occurrence of actual AV reintervention and MACCE at 10 to 12 years. Mental QoL after biological AVR was superior compared with healthy control subjects. The effect of the most recently developed bioprosthesis, specifically for younger patients, needs to be evaluated. Therefore, a shared decision-making process in prosthetic AV selection is mandatory in AVR patients less than or equal to 60 years of age.
