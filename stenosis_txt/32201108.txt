Title: Long-term follow-up in surgical newborns: A single-institution experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To assess the actual experiences of long-term follow-up and discuss ways to improve care during the period from childhood to adulthood in newborns who have undergone surgery.
METHODS: A total of 306 patients with congenital anomalies requiring newborn surgery who survived to discharge from 1994 to 2013 were eligible for inclusion. Survivors with severe chromosomal and cardiac anomalies were excluded. Patients with myelomenigocele, urogenital anomalies and miscellaneous diagnoses were also excluded. Patients with Hirschsprung's disease were excluded since many of them underwent surgery after the neonatal period. Patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis were also excluded since their duration of follow-up was too short for this study.
RESULTS: According to the follow-up status, survivors were categorized into 4 groups: under follow-up as an outpatient (UF, n = 67), moved (MV, n = 60), follow-up suspended by doctor (Sus, n = 87), and lost to follow-up (LF, n = 92). The incidence of active medical problems was high, and the duration of follow-up was significantly longer in the survivors with esophageal atresia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and high-type anorectal malformations than in those with other anomalies. Survivors followed by pediatric surgeons alone, free from active medical problems or free from adverse events during the initial hospitalization were at risk of being LF.
CONCLUSIONS: More than 30% of the surgical newborn cases were LF. Disease-specific and standardized multidisciplinary follow-up programs that increase both children's and parents' satisfaction and compliance are needed. (230/250 words).
