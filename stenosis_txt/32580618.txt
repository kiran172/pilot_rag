Title: Comparison of Physician-Modified Fenestrated/Branched Stent-Grafts and Hybrid Visceral Debranching Plus Stent-Graft Placement for Complex Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair.

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the immediate postoperative and midterm outcomes of complex thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) treatment with fenestrated/branched physician-modified endovascular grafts (PMEGs) or open debranching of the visceral aorta with bypass graft revascularization plus endovascular aneurysm exclusion (hybrid repair). Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 88 patients (mean age 70.0±10.6 years; 73 men) with complex TAAAs who underwent treatment with PMEGs (60, 68%) or a hybrid technique (28, 32%) between 2016 and 2019. The mean aneurysm diameter was 64.5±11.7 mm, and 37 patients (42%) were symptomatic. The Zenith TX2 and Ankura were the main stent-grafts used in the PMEG group. The hybrid technique involved visceral debranching with extra-anatomical bypass graft revascularization and subsequent stent-graft deployment (1- or 2-stage procedure). Results: In the PMEG group, 35 patients received modified stent-grafts with 4 fenestrations, 8 patients had 4 branches per device, and 17 patients had combinations (50 fenestrations and 18 branches) that successfully revascularized 228 of the 240 targets (95%). In the 28 hybrid cases, all 110 target vessels were successfully revascularized with bypass grafts. The overall 30-day mortality was 3.4% (2 PMEG and 1 hybrid), and the early rate of target vessel stenosis/occlusion was 3.3% (5 in PMEG group and 6 in the hybrid repair group). The 30-day morbidity was mainly attributed to pulmonary complications (15%), lower limb ischemia (8%), or spinal cord ischemia with paraplegia (6%). Eleven patients (13%) had deteriorated renal function with a &gt;30% decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. The mean follow-up was 22.3±4.9 months, and mortality was 4.5% (3.3% in the PMEG group vs 7.1% in the hybrid repair group). Conclusion: PMEGs and hybrid techniques seem to be feasible treatment options for aortic aneurysms necessitating visceral vessel revascularization. PMEGs may have a lower morbidity than the hybrid technique, which nonetheless remains an important option available for complex aortic aneurysms.
