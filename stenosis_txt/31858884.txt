Title: Risk Scoring Systems to Predict Long-Term Mortality After Carotid Endarterectomy in Asymptomatic Patients: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: The present review was conducted to describe current published risk scoring systems to predict late mortality after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The aim of the study is to identify simple, clinical, and reproducible tools to predict life expectancy in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis candidates to CEA and therefore which patients may benefit from surgery, reaching the goal of life expectancy >3 to 5 years, recommended by guidelines. Advantages, disadvantages, feasibility, simplicity, and reproducibility of each selected score were analyzed. Rigorous statistical analysis and validation of the score are essential components to produce a calibrated and usable score. Future studies should address the impact of using these tools in CEA candidates for asymptomatic disease.
