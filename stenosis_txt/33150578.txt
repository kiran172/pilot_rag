Title: [Contrast induced encephalopathy; a rare but dramatic side effect of contrast media].

Abstract: Contrast induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare side effect to contrast media. The clinical presentation comprises cortical blindness, seizures and focal neurological aberrations. A 72-year old man with aortic stenosis underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). At the end of the procedure he suffered from sudden onset of seizures. Information from the medical charts revealed information about a similar seizure nine years earlier, also in conjunction with administration of intraarterial contrast. The man recovered within one hour without sequelae. Midazolam and similar agents can be used prophylactically in future exposures to contrast media to lower the risk of recurrence.
