Title: Cardiac Computed Tomography for Comprehensive Coronary Assessment: Beyond Diagnosis of Anatomic Stenosis.

Abstract: Cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has evolved into a versatile imaging modality that can depict atherosclerosis burden, determine functional significance of a stenotic lesion, and guide the management and treatment of stable coronary artery disease.1 With newer-generation scanners, diagnostic CCTA can be obtained in the majority of patients with a very acceptable radiation dose. We discuss the ability of CCTA to provide comprehensive assessment of a patient with suspected CAD, including functional techniques of stress-rest myocardial perfusion assessment using a vasodilator and a purely post-processing approach that assesses fractional flow reserve derived by CCTA. In addition, recent data validated the role of CCTA in managing stable patients with chest pain and suspected CAD, serving as a gatekeeper for invasive coronary angiogram as well as optimizing the preprocedural planning of percutaneous coronary revascularization and coronary artery bypass surgery.
