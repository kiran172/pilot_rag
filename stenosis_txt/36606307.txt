Title: Noninvasive assessment of carotid plaque with subharmonic aided pressure estimation from a US contrast agent: A preliminary study.

Abstract: Stroke is closely associated with carotid plaques. The assessment of carotid plaque is still the key issue of stroke prevention in clinical practice. This prospective cross-sectional study included patients with carotid plaque evaluated by ultrasonography (US). The intima-media thickness (IMT), lumen stenosis severity, thickness, and length of carotid plaque were measured by the routine US, and the amplitudes of subharmonics in the upstream shoulder, top, and downstream shoulder of all plaques and corresponding lumens were observed by Subharmonic Aided Pressure Estimation (SHAPE) US examination from the US contrast agent perflubutane microbubbles (Sonazoid), which analyzed the clinical parameters of patients, the subharmonic amplitude characteristics of all plaques and lumens, and the parameter differences between the ischemic stroke (IS) group and control group. From May 2021 to February 2022, 46 carotid plaques of 23 patients were included. For plaques, the subharmonic amplitude in the plaque (-60.52 ± 4.46) was lower than that in the opposing level lumen (-56.82 ± 5.68 dB), the subharmonic gradient across the plaque cap was negatively correlated with plaque thickness (r = -0.51, p < 0.001), and with the lumen stenosis severity (r = -0.42, p = 0.003). The median IMT of the IS group was thicker than the control group. The subharmonic gradient of the intraplaque of the IS group was larger than the control group (p = 0.004). In this analysis, we use the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to establish the cutoff value of the difference to predict a new monitoring method for plaque without invasion to predict IS. It still needs a large-scale study with long-term follow-up to validate these findings.
