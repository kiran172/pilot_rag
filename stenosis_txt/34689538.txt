Title: [Analysis of characteristics of collateral circulation pathways in dizziness patients caused by severe bilateral vertebral artery stenosis/occlusion].

Abstract: The clinical data of 47 patients [41 males, 6 females, aged (62Â±7) years] treated at the Department of Neurology of the Sixth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from October 2018 to October 2020 who were diagnosed with severe bilateral vertebral artery stenosis/occlusion through Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) were retrospectively collected, and the characteristics of the compensatory pathways of collateral circulation were determined. Results showed that there were 8 intracranial and extracranial compensatory pathways, with posterior communicating artery as the major type (21 cases) for intracranial ones and deep carotid artery as the major type (16 cases) for extracranial ones. As the establishment of the compensatory pathway is closely related to the lesion site, DSA assessment for patients with severe bilateral vertebral artery stenosis/occlusion is helpful for clinicians to make judgement on prognosis of patients and choose individualized treatment plans.
