Title: Real-world experience with concomitant or staged transcatheter aortic and mitral valve replacements using balloon-expandable valves.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes of patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in a native valve or failed bioprosthetic valve or transcatheter heart valve (THV) and a transcatheter mitral valve replacement procedure (TMVR; valve-in-valve [mViV], valve-in-ring [mViR], and valve in mitral annulus calcification [ViMAC]) either concomitantly (same procedure) or staged (different procedures).
BACKGROUND: Patient characteristics, procedural details, and outcomes of concomitant or staged TAVR and TMVR procedures are largely unknown.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the STS/ACC TVT Registry™ for patients undergoing concomitant or staged TAVR and TMVR with SAPIEN XT, SAPIEN 3, or SAPIEN 3 Ultra (Edwards Lifesciences) THVs. Descriptive results were reported for procedural, index hospitalization, 30-day, and 1-year outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 257 patients underwent TAVR and TMVR in concomitant (n = 135) or staged (n = 122) procedures. Device success was 82.9% and 83.9% for concomitant TAVR and TMVR procedures and 83.8% and 82.5% for staged TAVR and TMVR procedures. Significant improvements in aortic and mitral valve function remained stable through 1 year. All-cause mortality for concomitant and staged groups was 14.7% and 10.5% at 30 days, and 32.8% and 24.6% at 1 year, respectively. Stroke rate for concomitant and staged groups was 0.8% and 3.6% at 30 days and 3.9% and 5.6% at 1 year, respectively. Improvements from baseline to 1 year in NYHA class and KCCQ overall summary scores were observed for all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant or staged transcatheter treatment of patients with aortic and mitral valve disease can be performed in select high-risk patients in experienced centers.
