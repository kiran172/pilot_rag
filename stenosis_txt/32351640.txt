Title: Sleep Disturbance and Its Clinical Implication in Patients with Adult Spinal Deformity: Comparison with Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbance and its clinical implication in patients with ASD.
METHODS: A total of 44 patients with ASD and 137 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) were enrolled in the study. Forty four patients were selected from the LSS group after propensity score matching. Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score, demographic data, visual analog scale (VAS) score for back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) were compared between both groups. Multiple regression analysis was performed with VAS for back pain as the dependent variable and age, sex, PSQI, and VAS for leg pain as the independent variables in the ASD group.
RESULTS: 33 (75.0%) and 32 (72.7%) patients were classified as poor sleepers in the ASD group and the LSS group, respectively. In the ASD group, the VAS score for back pain was 7.7 ± 1.7 in the poor sleeper group and 5.6 ± 2.2 in the nonpoor sleeper group. In the LSS group, poor sleep quality was associated with the ODI score, ODI score without a sleep component, and EQ-5D. The regression model for predicting VAS for back pain in the ASD group suggested that poor sleep quality and increased leg pain were associated with increased back pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Because sleep quality is a critical factor in augmenting back pain in patients with ASD, this study underlines the need to investigate sleep quality during the routine examination of patients with ASD.
