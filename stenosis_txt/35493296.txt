Title: The Relationship between Intracarotid Plaque Neovascularization and Lp (a) and Lp-PLA2 in Elderly Patients with Carotid Plaque Stenosis.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between carotid plaque neovascularization and lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)], lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in elderly patients with carotid plaque stenosis. One hundred elderly patients with carotid plaque stenosis diagnosed in our hospital from January 2020 to January 2022 were retrospectively analyzed and divided into stable (n = 62) and unstable (n = 38) groups according to whether the plaque was stable or not. Plasma Lp (a), Lp-PLA2, apoA, and apoB levels were measured; intraplaque angiogenesis (IPN) scores were examined by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to assess IPN grade in patients; and Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationship between plasma Lp (a) and Lp-PLA2 levels and plaque characteristics and angiogenesis. The maximum thickness and total thickness of carotid plaque in the unstable group were significantly greater than those in the stable group (P &lt; 0.05); the IPN grade was mainly grade III and IV in the unstable group and grade II in the stable group, and the IPN score was significantly higher in the unstable group than in the stable group (P &lt; 0.05); there was no significant difference in the plasma apoA and apoB levels between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05), and the plasma Lp (a) and Lp-PLA2 levels were significantly higher in the unstable group than in the stable group (P &lt; 0.05); the neovascular grade, plasma Lp-PLA2, and Lp (a) levels were significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05); the plasma Lp (a) and Lp-PLA2 levels were positively correlated with the maximum plaque thickness, total plaque thickness, degree of stenosis, and angiogenesis (P &lt; 0.05). The plasma levels of Lp (a) and Lp-PLA2 are positively correlated with intraplaque angiogenesis, and their levels can reflect the stability of carotid plaques.
