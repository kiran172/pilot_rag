Title: Vascular Abnormalities and Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Paediatric Case Series.

Abstract: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystemic neurocutaneous disease caused by a heterozygous mutation of the NF1 gene that encodes neurofibromin. Complications include vascular and neurologic abnormalities such as moyamoya syndrome, a cerebrovascular disorder with progressive occlusion of the large intracranial arteries, leading to ischemic events and the formation of abnormal vascular networks. Stenosis of the renal artery is another frequent complication of neurofibromatosis type 1, and it represents the most common cause of secondary hypertension in these patients. The purpose of the article is to describe the clinical manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 vasculopathy in 4 patients presenting with a wide range of neurologic and reno-vascular manifestations, as well as to examine current diagnostic management and follow-up, current therapeutic options, and to discuss further perspectives in terms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment.
