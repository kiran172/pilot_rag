Title: The relationship between the serum uric acid/creatinine ratio and prognosis in patients with transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Aortic valve stenosis is a common valve disease in developed countries where the elderly population is high. Aortic valve stenosis is not a simple calcification; it is a dynamic process in which uric acid plays a serious role. We investigated the role of the serum uric acid/creatinine (SUA/Cr) ratio, which is an indicator of uric acid level independent of renal function, in determining the prognosis in patients who had undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 357 patients who underwent TAVI for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis between March 2019 and March 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. After applying exclusion criteria, the remaining 269 patients were included in the study. According to the Valve Academic Research Consortium criteria, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) defined the endpoint of the study. Therefore, patients were divided into two groups: the MACCE group and the no MACCE group.
RESULTS: Serum uric acid level was significantly higher in the MACCE group (7.0 ± 2.6) than in the no MACCE group (6.0 ± 1.7) (p = 0.008). SUA/Cr ratio was significantly higher in the MACCE group (6.7 ± 2.3) than in the no MACCE group (5.9 ± 1.1) (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: The serum UA/creatinine ratio is important in determining the prognosis of patients undergoing TAVI.
