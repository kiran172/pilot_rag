Title: Subthreshold Aortic Valve Calcium Scores in Severe Aortic Stenosis and Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis.

Abstract: We have clinically observed that some patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis and severe aortic stenosis may have lesser degrees of calcification than one might expect. We report a case series of 3 patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis and severe aortic stenosis despite discordant aortic valve calcium scores. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
