Title: Lumbar radiculopathy associated radicular schwannoma: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: Lumbar radiculopathy is a clinical condition defined by symptoms of pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling due to lumbar nerve root compression in levels L1-L4. Typically, it is characterized by a narrowing near the nerve root possibly caused by stenosis, bone osteophytes, disc herniation, and similar conditions. Reports of lumbar radiculopathy brought about by the presence of a radicular schwannoma are exceedingly rare. In this paper, we discuss the case of a 67-year-old female patient, presenting with complaints of low back pain, numbness, and antalgic gait for the past eight months. Her physical examination revealed motor and sensor neurological deficits affecting the left lower limb. The electromyoneurography evaluation showed neurogenic atrophy of the left radicular area, while the MRI revealed the presence of a giant, radicular schwannoma at L4-L5 level. This case report aims to underscore the clinical course and management of lumbar radiculopathy caused by a rare L4-L5 radicular schwannoma. Our patient had no significant risk factors or previous spinal pathology.
