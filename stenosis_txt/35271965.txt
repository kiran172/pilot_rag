Title: Treatment of Atherosclerotic Femoropopliteal Artery Disease with Supera Interwoven Nitinol Stent: A Real-World Study in China.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To analyze the outcomes of Supera stent deployment in Chinese patients with atherosclerotic femoropopliteal artery (FPA) disease in a real-world setting.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected and analyzed the medical records of 246 consecutive patients who received Supera stents for FPA disease at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Xiyuan Hospital between February 2017 and December 2019. All study patients underwent balloon angioplasty and were treated with Supera stents (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The primary outcome was the rate of primary patency 12 months after discharge.
RESULTS: The analyses included 246 consecutive patients and 260 lesions. The mean ± SD age was 73.2 ± 9.9 years and most patients (60.2%) were males. Of the 260 treated lesions, Supera stents were deployed in eight (3.1%) cases after a previous stent fracture. Critical limb ischemia was diagnosed in 87.3% of the limbs, and 84 (32.3%) and 83 (31.5%) cases were classified as TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) C and D, respectively. Most of the lesions were in situ (80.8%) and located in the superficial femoral artery (45.0%) or the FPA (45.8%). The mean lesion length was 147.7 mm. Nominal deployment (-10 to 10% compression) was the most common deployment scenario (84.1%). The 1-year primary patency rate was 80.6%. Lesions that occurred as restenosis (odds ratio [OR]: = 3.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-10.85, P = 0.045) or in-stent restenosis (OR: = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.03-8.07, P = 0.045) were independently associated with occlusion or stenosis after stent deployment. No stent fracture was observed in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the use of Supera stents is feasible for the treatment of Chinese patients with FPA disease. The long-term results reveal high primary patency.
