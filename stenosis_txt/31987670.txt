Title: Outcomes of fenestrated-branched endovascular aortic repair in patients with a solitary functional kidney.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of fenestrated-branched endovascular aortic repair (F-BEVAR) of pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) in patients with a solitary functional kidney (SFK).
METHODS: We analyzed the outcomes of 287 consecutive patients (206 male; mean age, 74 ± 8 years old) enrolled in a prospective nonrandomized study to investigate use of F-BEVAR for treatment of patients with pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms or TAAAs between 2013 and 2018. Outcomes were analyzed in patients with solitary kidney (functional or congenital) and compared with control patients who had two functioning kidneys. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined using Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage renal disease criteria, and renal function deterioration (RFD) was defined by a decline in estimated glomerular filtration the estimated glomerular filtration rate of more than 30% from baseline. End points included 30-day mortality and major adverse events, AKI, freedom from RFD, and patient survival.
RESULTS: There where 30 patients (10%) with a SFK and 257 patients with two functioning kidneys. Patients with a SFK were younger and had significantly (P &lt; .05) higher baseline creatinine (+0.3 mg/dL), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (-16 mL/minute/1.73 m2) and more often had stage III to V chronic kidney disease (73% vs 43%). There were no differences in cardiovascular risk factors and aneurysm extent. Technical success was achieved in 98.9% of patients with SFK and in 99.8% of controls (P = .10). At 30 days, there was no significant differences in mortality (0% vs 1%) and major adverse events (40% vs 24%; P = .08), including rates of AKI (20% vs 12%) and new-onset dialysis (3% vs 1%) between patients with a SFK and the control group, respectively. Mean follow-up was 18 ± 15 months. At 2 years, there was no difference (P = .36) in patient survival (92 ± 5% vs 84 ± 3%) and freedom from RFD (100 ± 0% vs 84 ± 3%) for patients with SFK and controls, respectively. Presence of a SFK was not a predictor for AKI or RFD. By multivariable analysis, estimated blood loss of more than 1 L (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; P = .04) and total fluoroscopy time (OR, 1.8; P = .05) were predictors for AKI, and postoperative AKI (OR, 4.9; P &lt; .001), renal branch occlusion/stenosis (OR, 3.1; P = .001), and Crawford extent II TAAA (OR, 2.4; P = .007) were predictors for RFD.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the worse baseline renal function, F-BEVAR is safe and effective with nearly identical outcomes in patients with a SFK as compared with patients with two functioning kidneys. Development of postoperative AKI is the most important predictor for RFD.
