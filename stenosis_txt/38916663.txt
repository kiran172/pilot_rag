Title: Effectiveness of two-dimensional shear-wave sonoelastography in the diagnosis and follow-up of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine the effectiveness and utility of two-dimensional shear-wave sonoelastography (2D-SW-SE) in the diagnosis and postoperative follow-up of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three infants were included in the study, 13 in the IHPS group and 10 in the control group (CG). Preoperative B-mode ultrasonography measurements (longitudinal length and single-wall thickness of the pylorus) and 2D-SW-SE measurements (pylorus tissue stiffness and shear-wave propagation speed) were compared between the groups. The infants with IHPS then underwent Ramstedt pyloromyotomy and were invited for follow-ups on the tenth day and the first, third, and sixth months postoperatively. Measurements taken at the follow-ups were compared with the preoperative values.
RESULTS: No differences were found between the groups regarding age, gender, body weight, or week of birth. The pyloric lengths in the IHPS group were longer than in the CG (p < 0.001), and the single-wall thicknesses were thicker (p < 0.001). The pylorus in the IHPS group was four times stiffer than in the CG (27.4 kPa versus 7.66 kPa), and the shear-wave propagation speed in the tissue was higher (1.34 m/s versus 2.69 m/s; p < 0.001). Both values decreased over time in the IHPS group and were normal by the third postoperative month.
CONCLUSIONS: 2D-SW-SE can be used as an assistive imaging tool alongside B-mode ultrasound for diagnosing IHPS. It can also be used to identify inadequate surgery by detecting whether the pyloric tissue has softened at follow-up.
