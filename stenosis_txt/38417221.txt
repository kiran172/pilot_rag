Title: Performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T at 90 days among patients with known coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 0/1-h high sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT) algorithm does not differentiate risk based on known coronary artery disease (CAD: prior myocardial infarction [MI], coronary revascularization, or ≥ 70% coronary stenosis). We recently evaluated its performance among patients with known CAD at 30-days, but little is known about its longer-term risk prediction. The objective of this study is to determine and compare the performance of the algorithm at 90-days among patients with and without known CAD.
METHODS: We performed a pre-planned subgroup analysis of the STOP-CP cohort, which prospectively enrolled ED patients ≥21 years old with symptoms suggestive of ACS without ST-elevation on initial ECG across 8 US sites (1/25/2017-9/6/2018). Participants with 0- and 1-h hs-cTnT measures (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were stratified into rule-out, observe, and rule-in groups using the ESC 0/1-h algorithm. Algorithm performance was tested among patients with or without known CAD, as determined by the treating provider. The primary outcome was cardiac death or MI at 90-days. Fisher's exact tests were used to compare 90-day event and rule-out rates between patients with and without known CAD. Negative predictive values (NPVs) for 90-day cardiac death or MI with exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated and compared using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: The STOP-CP study accrued 1430 patients, of which 31.4% (449/1430) had known CAD. Cardiac death or MI at 90 days was more common in patients with known CAD than in those without [21.2% (95/449) vs. 10.0% (98/981); p < 0.001]. Using the ESC 0/1-h algorithm, 39.6% (178/449) of patients with known CAD and 66.1% (648/981) of patients without known CAD were ruled-out (p < 0.001). Among rule-out patients, 90-day cardiac death or MI occurred in 3.4% (6/178) of patients with known CAD and 1.2% (8/648) without known CAD (p = 0.09). NPV for 90-day cardiac death or MI was 96.6% (95%CI 92.8-98.8) among patients with known CAD and 98.8% (95%CI 97.6-99.5) in patients without known CAD (p = 0.09).
CONCLUSION: Patients with known CAD who were ruled-out using the ESC 0/1-h hs-cTnT algorithm had a high rate of missed 90-day cardiac events, suggesting that the ESC 0/1-h hs-cTnT algorithm may not be safe for use among patients with known CAD.
