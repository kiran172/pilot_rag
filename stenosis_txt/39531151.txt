Title: RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys Variant Is Associated with Higher Stenosis Progression in Asymptomatic Intracranial Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Intracranial artery stenosis (ICAS) is a significant contributor to ischemic stroke, with the RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys variant identified as a related genetic factor. We explored the clinical outcomes of the RNF213 genotype in patients with asymptomatic ICAS. Between November 2011 and March 2019, 139 patients with asymptomatic ICAS were enrolled in this study. Genotyping for RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys was performed using Sanger sequencing. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to compare the RNF213 genotype with background characteristics and clinical outcomes such as ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular events and stenosis progression. RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys was found in 25% of cases, revealing distinct clinical features between carriers and non-carriers. The incidence of ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular events was 4.3% (6/139 cases), and stenosis progression was observed in 13% (18/139 cases) during a mean follow-up period of 58 months. Stenosis progression rates were notably higher in the RNF213 variant group (25.7%; 9/35 cases) than in the RNF213 wild-type group (8.7%; 9/104 cases). Cumulative stenosis progression rate was significantly higher in the RNF213 variant group than in the RNF213 wild-type group (log-rank test, P = 0.0004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated a significant association between the RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys variant and an increased risk of stenosis progression (P = 0.03, odds ratio 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.0). The RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys variant exhibits clinical disparities in asymptomatic ICAS and is notably linked to a heightened risk of stenosis progression. These results suggest a distinct difference in the vascular stenosis mechanism associated with this variant, warranting further investigation into its clinical implications and potential mechanistic insights.
