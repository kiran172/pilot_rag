Title: Outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection in patients who develop metachronous superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma close to a post-endoscopic submucosal dissection scar.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The presence of post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) scars renders complete metachronous superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma resection difficult. We aimed to identify the risk factors for incomplete resection of metachronous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma close to the post-ESD scar by ESD.
METHODS: We enrolled patients who developed post-ESD superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at Hiroshima University Hospital between January 2006 and March 2020. We analyzed the outcomes and risk factors of incomplete resection between patients whose lesions were close to (close-to group) and away from (away-from group) the post-ESD scar.
RESULTS: We included 111 patients with 212 lesions. The close-to group had a significantly lower complete resection rate (88.6% [62/70] vs. 98.6% [69/70], p = 0.033), longer procedure time (80.2 ± 47.2 min vs. 60.4 ± 29.3 min, p < 0.01), higher proportion of lesions with severe fibrosis (72.9% [51/70] vs. 5.7% [4/70], p < 0.01), and higher intraoperative bleeding rate (78.6% [55/70] vs. 60.0% [42/70], p = 0.027) than the away-from group. There was no significant difference in the rate of local recurrence, muscle injury, perforation, and stenosis as well as the pathological tumor depth between the groups. Of the 92 lesions in the close-to group, the proportion of lesions located on the oral side of the post-ESD scar significantly affected the incidence of incomplete resection (91.7% [11/12] vs. 53.8% [43/80], p = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Complete resection was more difficult for lesions located on the oral side of the post-ESD scar.
