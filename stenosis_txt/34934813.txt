Title: Laparoscopic Transgastric Resection of a Large Gastric GIST: A Case Report and Review of Literature.

Abstract: Introduction  Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Their primary treatment is surgical. Case Report  Here we report a case of a 36-year-old male patient who was being evaluated for weakness, anemia, and melena. Upper GI endoscopy showed a mass projecting into the lumen and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) confirmed a well-defined mass close to the lesser curvature on the posterior wall. An endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration suggested a diagnosis of GIST. After optimization, the patient was taken up for a laparoscopic transgastric resection of the GIST. The resected specimen measured 9.5 × 8.5 × 7.5 cm. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well and was discharged by the fifth postoperative day. Discussion  While traditionally, open surgery has been advocated for GISTs, for fear of spillage and peritoneal seeding, the role of minimal access surgery has been growing in recent years. The use of a transgastric approach avoids the potential complication of luminal stenosis following a wedge resection of a tumor close to the cardia. Because lymphadenectomies are rarely required and local invasion is uncommon, a wide local resection is usually curative. Thus, a laparoscopic approach can be considered as the first line in uncomplicated GISTs, irrespective of tumor size.
