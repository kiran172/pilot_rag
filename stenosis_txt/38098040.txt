Title: Interaction between CETP Taq1B polymorphism and dietary patterns on lipid profile and severity of coronary arteries stenosis in patients under coronary angiography: a cross-sectional study.

Abstract: AIM: Evidence indicates there are still conflicts regarding CETP Taq1B polymorphism and coronary artery disease risk factors. Current findings about whether dietary patterns can change the relationship of the Taq1B on lipid profile and the severity of coronary arteries stenosis appears to be limited. The present research made an attempt to investigate this possible relationship.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 453 male and female participants with a mean age of 57 years. A validated 178-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess dietary usual intake. Dietary patterns were extracted through principal component analysis (PCA). Taq1B variant was genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Two-way ANOVA was used to test the interaction between Taq1B polymorphism and dietary patterns.
RESULTS: Two dietary patterns were detected: the western dietary pattern (WDP) and the traditional dietary pattern (TDP). The frequency of Taq1B genotypes turned out to be 10.4, 72.4, and 17.2% for B1B1, B1B2, and B2B2, respectively. A significant difference was observed in TG and TG/HDL-C levels among TaqIB genotypes in higher adherence to TDP (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively). Taq1B showed a significant interaction with TDP for modulating TG levels and TG/HDL-C ratio (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively). Greater compliance to WDP demonstrated a significant difference in TG and TG/HDL-C levels across rs708272 genotypes (P = 0.03) after adjusting for confounding factors. Other lipid components and coronary arteries stenosis scores failed to show any relationship or significant difference across Taq1B genotypes or dietary patterns.
CONCLUSION: Adherence to TDP may adjust the association between the Taq1B variant and TG and TG/HDL-C levels in patients undergoing coronary angiography. To better understand the relationships, we suggest prospective studies in different race groups with multivariate approaches.
