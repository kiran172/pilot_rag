Title: Comparison of oral morbidity and mid-term efficacy of anterior urethroplasty using an autologous tissue-engineered graft (MukoCell®) versus native oral mucosa graft.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to compare surgical success rate (SR) and oral morbidity of augmentation urethroplasty for anterior urethral strictures using autologous tissue-engineered oral mucosa graft (TEOMG) named MukoCell® versus native oral mucosa graft (NOMG).
METHODS: We conducted a single-institution observational study on patients undergoing TEOMG and NOMG urethroplasty for anterior urethral strictures >2 cm in length from January 2016 to July 2020. SR, oral morbidity, and potential risk factors of recurrence were compared between groups were analyzed. A decrease of maximum uroflow rate < 15 mL/s or further instrumentation was considered a failure.
RESULTS: Overall, TEOMG (n = 77) and NOMG (n = 76) groups had comparable SR (68.8% vs. 78.9%, p = 0.155) after a median follow-up of 52 (interquartile range [IQR] 45-60) months for TEOMG and 53.5 (IQR 43-58) months for NOMG. Subgroup analysis revealed comparable SR according to surgical technique, stricture localization, and length. Only following repetitive urethral dilatations, TEOMG achieved lower SR (31.3% vs. 81.3%, p = 0.003). Surgical time was significantly shorter by TEOMG use (median 104 vs. 182 min, p < 0.001). Oral morbidity and the associated "burden" in patients' quality of life were significantly less at 3 weeks following the biopsy required for TEOMG manufacture, compared to NOMG harvesting and totally absent at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The SR of TEOMG urethroplasty appeared to be comparable to NOMG at a mid-term follow-up but taking into account the uneven distribution of stricture site and the surgical techniques used in both groups. Surgical time was significantly shortened, since no intraoperative mucosa harvesting was required, and oral complications were diminished through the preoperative biopsy for MukoCell® manufacture.
