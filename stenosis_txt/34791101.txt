Title: Association of baseline and change in global longitudinal strain by computed tomography with post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement outcomes.

Abstract: AIMS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedural planning requires computed tomography angiography (CTA) which allows for the assessment of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (CTA-LVGLS). There is, however, limited data on the feasibility of CTA-LVGLS, and its prognostic value. This study sought to evaluate the incremental prognostic value of baseline CTA-LVGLS, change in CTA-LVGLS after TAVR, and their association with post-TAVR outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 431 patients who underwent multiphasic gated CTA using dual-source system for TAVR planning at baseline and 1-month follow-up were included [median (interquartile range) age, 83 (77-87) years; 44% female, STS-PROM score: 3.3 (2.3-5.1)%, Echo-left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 60 (55-65)%, CTA-LVGLS: -18.0 (-21.6 to -14.2)%, feasible in 97% of patients]. CTA-LVGLS was measured using dedicated feature-tracking software. Over a median follow-up of 19 (13-27) months, 99 endpoints of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization occurred. The relative hazard of the endpoint increased as baseline CTA-LVGLS worsened with -18.2% as the threshold for higher events (P = 0.005). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, CTA-LVGLS remained associated with the endpoint [hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval, CI), 1.08 (1.03-1.14); P = 0.005] and incrementally improved prognostication (C-index difference, 0.026). Although CTA-LVGLS improved after TAVR [-18.3 (-21.6 to -14.3)% vs. -18.7 (-21.9 to -15.4)%, P < 0.001], patients without CTA-LVGLS improvement had higher risk of the endpoint than those with improvement or preserved baseline global longitudinal strain [HR (95% CI), 1.92 (1.19-3.12); P = 0.008].
CONCLUSIONS: In this predominantly low-risk TAVR cohort of patients, mostly with normal LVEF, assessment of CTA-LVGLS is highly feasible improving risk stratification by providing independent and incremental prognostic value over clinical and echocardiographic characteristics.
