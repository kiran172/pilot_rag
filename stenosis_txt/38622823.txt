Title: Japanese survey of perioperative complications and ureteral stricture after ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy for upper urinary tract stones in multicenter collaborative study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate perioperative complications and the details of postoperative ureteral stricture after ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy (URS-L) for upper urinary tract stones in Japan.
METHODS: Patient data on intra- and postoperative complications after ureteroscopy using URS-L were retrospectively collected from multiple centers in Japan between April 2017 and March 2020 with the cooperation of the Japanese Society of Endourology and Robotics. Data included the number of patients undergoing URS-L, number and type of intra- and postoperative complications, and detailed characteristics of postoperative ureteral stricture.
RESULTS: In total, 14 125 patients underwent URS-L over 3 years at 82 institutions. Annual URS-L numbers gradually increased from 4419 in 2017, to 4760 in 2018, and 4946 in 2019. The total complication rate was 10.5%, which was divided into intra-operative complications in 1.40% and postoperative complications in 9.18%. The annual incidences of intra- and postoperative complications were not significantly different from year to year (p = 0.314 and p = 0.112). Ureteral perforation, ureteral avulsion, and the intra-operative conversion rate were 1.35%, 0.03%, and 0.02%, respectively. Fever >38°C, septic shock, blood transfusion, and postoperative mortality were 7.44%, 0.81%, 0.07%, and 0.04%, respectively. Ureteral stricture occurred in 0.8% of cases. The median length of stricture site was 10.0 mm and the success rate of stricture treatment was 54.6%.
CONCLUSION: Although URS-L utilization has increased in Japan, the annual complication rate has remained steady. Although URS-L is a useful and less invasive procedure, devastating complications can still occur.
