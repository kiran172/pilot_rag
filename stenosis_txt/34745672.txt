Title: Multiple Cranial Nerve Palsies in a Pediatric Case of Lemierre's Syndrome due to Streptococcus viridans.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lemierre's syndrome is a rare condition of internal jugular vein thrombosis following oropharyngeal infection. While it usually results from Fusobacterium necrophorum infection, atypical cases associated with other pathogens have been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a unique case of pediatric Lemierre's syndrome with Streptococcus viridans infection resulting in cavernous sinus thrombosis and oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsies. Case Report. A 14-year-old female initially presented after six days of fever, myalgias, and sore throat and was admitted for hyperbilirubinemia and acute kidney injury. She developed a fixed, dilated pupil with complete ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and severe pain. Imaging revealed retromandibular space abscess, external and internal jugular vein thrombosis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, internal carotid artery stenosis, pulmonary embolism, and bilateral pneumonia. She was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome with cultures positive for Streptococcus viridans and treated with a combination of antibiotics and anticoagulation. Conclusion and Relevance. Both antibiotics and anticoagulation were effective management for this Lemierre's syndrome patient with cavernous sinus thrombosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of Lemierre's syndrome is essential. A multidisciplinary treatment team is beneficial for managing the sequelae of this condition.
