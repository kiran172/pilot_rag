Title: Percutaneous transhepatic sclerotherapy for ascending colonic varices due to left-sided portal hypertension.

Abstract: Left-sided portal hypertension (LSPH) causes varices and splenomegaly due to splenic vein issues. Colonic varices are rare and lack standardized treatment. We report the successful treatment of colonic varices caused by LSPH, by addressing both the afferent and efferent veins. A 70-year-old man with distal cholangiocarcinoma had surgery without splenic vein resection, leading to proximal splenic vein stenosis and varices at multiple locations. Percutaneous transhepatic splenic venography revealed that collateral veins flowed into the ascending colonic varices and returned to the portal vein. Complete thrombosis of the varices was achieved by injecting sclerosants and placing coils in both the afferent and efferent veins. The procedure was safe and effective, with no variceal recurrence. This approach provides a minimally invasive option for treating colonic varices associated with LSPH.
