Title: Impact of Transjugular Intracardiac Echocardiography-Guided Self-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Reduction of Conduction Disturbances.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A high permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) risk remains a concern of self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve implantation, despite the continued improvements in implantation methodology. We aimed to assess the impact of real-time direct visualization of the membranous septum using transjugular intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) during transcatheter aortic valve implantation on reducing the rates of conduction disturbances including the need for PPI.
METHODS: Consecutive patients treated with Evolut R and Evolut PRO/PRO+ from February 2017 to September 2022 were included in this study. We compared outcomes between the conventional implantation method using the 3-cusps view (3 cusps without ICE group), the recent method using cusp-overlap view (cusp overlap without ICE group), and our novel method using ICE (cusp overlap with ICE group).
RESULTS: Of the 446 patients eligible for analysis, 211 (47.3%) were categorized as the 3 cusps without ICE group, 129 (28.9%) were in the cusp overlap without ICE group, and 106 (23.8%) comprised the cusp overlap with ICE group. Compared with the 3 cusps without ICE group, the cusp overlap without ICE group had a smaller implantation depth (2.2 [interquartile range, 1.0-3.5] mm versus 4.3 [interquartile range, 3.3-5.4] mm; P&lt;0.001) and lower 30-day PPI rates (7.0% versus 14.2%; P=0.035). Compared with the cusp overlap without ICE group, the cusp overlap with ICE group had lower 30-day PPI rates (0.9%; P=0.014), albeit with comparable implantation depths (1.9 [interquartile range, 0.9-2.9] mm; P=0.150). Multivariable analysis showed that our novel method using ICE with the cusp-overlap view was independently associated with a 30-day PPI rate reduction. There were no group differences in 30-day all-cause mortality (1.4% versus 1.6% versus 0%; P=0.608).
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel implantation method using transjugular ICE, which enable real-time direct visualization of the membranous septum, achieved a predictably high position of prostheses, resulting in a substantial reduction of conduction disturbances requiring PPI after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
