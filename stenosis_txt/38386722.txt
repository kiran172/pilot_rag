Title: Surgically Treated Degenerative Lumbar Spine Diseases in Twins.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence to suggest a potential genetic component underlying the development and progression of lumbar spine diseases. However, the heritability and the concordance rates for the phenotypes requiring surgery for the common spine diseases lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and lumbar disc herniation (LDH) are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the heritability and the concordance rates for LSS and LDH requiring surgery by studying monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs.
METHODS: Patients between 18 and 85 years of age who underwent surgery for LSS or LDH between 1996 and 2022 were identified in the national Swedish spine registry (LSS: 45,110 patients; LDH: 39,272 patients), and matched with the Swedish Twin Registry to identify MZ and DZ twins. Pairwise and probandwise concordance rates, heritability estimates, and MZ/DZ concordance ratios were calculated.
RESULTS: We identified 414 twin pairs (92 MZ and 322 DZ pairs) of whom 1 or both twins underwent surgery for LSS. The corresponding number for LDH was 387 twin pairs (118 MZ and 269 DZ pairs). The probandwise concordance rate for LSS requiring surgery was 0.25 (26 of 105) (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14 to 0.34) for MZ twins and 0.04 (12 of 328) (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.07) for DZ twins. The corresponding values for LDH requiring surgery were 0.03 (4 of 120) (95% CI, 0 to 0.08) and 0.01 (4 of 271) (95% CI, 0 to 0.04), respectively. The probandwise MZ/DZ concordance ratio was 6.8 (95% CI, 2.9 to 21.5) for LSS and 2.3 (95% CI, 0 to 8.9) for LDH. The heritability was significantly higher in LSS compared with LDH (0.64 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.74] versus 0.19 [95% CI, 0.08 to 0.35]).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genetic factors may play an important role in the risk of developing LSS requiring surgery, whereas heredity seems to be of less importance in LDH requiring surgery.
