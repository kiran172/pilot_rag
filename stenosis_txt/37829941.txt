Title: Referral for Cardiac Amyloidosis in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Results of the Quality Outcome Project.

Abstract: Background Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR) is an important comorbidity present in severe aortic stenosis (AS). The purpose of this study was to raise awareness of ATTR in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe AS among healthcare providers and patients. Methodology We reviewed 197 consecutive TAVR cases performed from 2019 to 2020. Adapting predefined high-risk features for ATTR based on prior literature, we contacted the patients to discuss our clinical suspicion of ATTR and offered a referral to a cardiac amyloid specialist. Results We identified 125 (69.4%) patients who had high-risk features of ATTR. Of the 105 patients contacted, 44 patients agreed to referral, 46 patients were not able to be contacted after several attempts, and 15 patients declined referral. Of the 44 patients who agreed to the referral, 20 patients completed the evaluation for cardiac amyloidosis, all of whom were negative for transthyretin and light-chain cardiac amyloidosis. Conclusions Our attempt to detect ATTR in prior TAVR patients was unsuccessful two to three years post-TAVR. We believe that early detection of cardiac amyloidosis close to the timing of TAVR is important and the most effective means.
