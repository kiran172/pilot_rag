Title: Varying ENT practices in adult post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis after the COVID epidemic in France: A CHERRIES analysis.

Abstract: AIM: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may increase the incidence of iatrogenic laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS), whereas management is not well defined. The aim of this study was to survey a panel of French otorhinolaryngologists about their practices and to evaluate their needs.
METHOD: A national-level survey of the management of iatrogenic LTS was conducted using a 41-item questionnaire, in 4 sections, sent to a panel of French otorhinolaryngologists between July and December 2022. The main endpoint was heterogeneity in responses between 55 proposals on LTS management.
RESULTS: The response rate was 20% (52/263). The response heterogeneity rate was 69% (38/55). Heterogeneity concerned general questions on diagnosis (7/12, 58%) and management (7/10, 70%), LTS case management (22/27, 81%), and otorhinolaryngologists' expectations (33%, 2/6). Quality of training was considered good or excellent by only 21% of respondents. More than 80% were strongly in favor of creating national guidelines, expert centers and a national database.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated the heterogeneity of adult post-intubation LTS management between otorhinolaryngologists in France. Training quality was deemed poor or mediocre by a majority of respondents. They were in favor of creating national guidelines and expert centers in LTS.
