Title: Carotid ultrasound to identify head and neck cancer survivors with high cardiovascular risk after radiation therapy: rationale and design of a prospective, cross-sectional pilot study.

Abstract: Background: Radiation therapy is an integral component of treatment that can predispose to carotid artery stenosis (CAS) and increase the risk of cerebrovascular events for head and neck cancer survivors. The utility of screening for CAS with carotid ultrasound in asymptomatic head and neck cancer survivors is unclear.Methods: In this prospective, cross-sectional pilot study, 60 patients who have no evidence of cancer at least 2Â years from completion of RT will undergo screening carotid ultrasound to identify patients with high risk of cardiovascular events.Results: Outcomes will include clinically significant CAS, carotid intima-media thickness, acceptability/feasibility of screening, barriers to care and preliminary data on changes to medical management because of screening. Correlative multi-omics analyses will examine biomarkers of CAS after radiation therapy.Conclusion: The results of this study will provide valuable data on the prevalence of CAS and preliminary patient-centered data that will inform the design of a future large-scale, multi-site clinical trial.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05490875 (ClinicalTrials.gov).
