Title: Congenital aortic and truncal valve reconstruction using the Ozaki technique: Short-term clinical results.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Aortic valve reconstruction (AVRec) with neocuspidization or the Ozaki procedure with complete cusp replacement for aortic valve disease has excellent mid-term results in adults. Limited results of AVRec in pediatric patients have been reported. We report our early outcomes of the Ozaki procedure for congenital aortic and truncal valve disease.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all 57 patients with congenital aortic and truncal valve disease who had a 3-leaflet Ozaki procedure at a single institution from August 2015 to February 2019. Outcome measures included mortality, surgical or catheter-based reinterventions, and echocardiographic measurements.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had aortic regurgitation (AR), 6 had aortic stenosis (AS), and 27 patients had AS/AR. Two patients had quadricuspid valves, 26 had tricuspid, 20 had bicuspid, and 9 had unicusp aortic valves. Four patients had truncus arteriosus. Thirty-four patients had previous aortic valve repairs and 5 had replacements. Preoperative echocardiography mean annular diameter was 20.90 ± 4.98 cm and peak gradient for patients with AS/AR was 53.62 ± 22.20 mm Hg. Autologous, Photofix, and CardioCel bovine pericardia were used in 20, 35, and 2 patients. Eight patients required aortic root enlargement and 20 had sinus enlargement. Fifty-one patients had concomitant procedures. Median intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were 1.87 and 6.38 days. There were no hospital mortalities or early conversions to valve replacement. At discharge, 98% of patients had mild or less regurgitation and peak aortic gradient was 16.9 ± 9.5 mm Hg. Two patients underwent aortic valve replacement. At median follow-up of 8.1 months, 96% and 91% of patients had less than moderate regurgitation and stenosis, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The AVRec procedure has acceptable short-term results and should be considered for valve reconstruction in pediatric patients with congenital aortic and truncal valve disease. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to determine the optimal patch material and late valve function and continued annular growth.
