Title: Congenital Esophageal Atresia Long-Term Follow-Up-The Pediatric Surgeon's Duty to Focus on Quality of Life.

Abstract: Esophageal atresia (EA) is the most common congenital esophageal malformation. An improvement in survival led to a focus on functional outcomes and quality of life (QoL). We analyzed the long-term outcomes and QoL of patients submitted to surgery for EA. Perinatal characteristics, surgical procedures, gastrointestinal and respiratory current symptoms and QoL were investigated. Thirty-nine patients were included. Long Gap patients had a higher rate of prematurity and low birth weight. The prevalent surgical procedure was primary esophageal anastomosis, followed by gastric pull-up. Twenty-four patients had post-operative stenosis, while gastroesophageal reflux (GER) required fundoplication in eleven cases. Auxological parameters were lower in Long Gap patients. The lowest scores of QoL were in the Long Gap group, especially in younger patients, which was the group with the highest number of symptoms. In the long term, the QoL appeared to be more dependent on the type of esophageal atresia rather than on associated malformations. Surgical management of GER was indicated in all patients with Long Gap EA, supposedly due to the prevalence of gastric pull-up for this type of EA. The assessment of QoL is part of surgeon's management and needs to be performed in each phase of a child's development.
