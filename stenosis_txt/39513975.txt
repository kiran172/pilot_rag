Title: Right mini-thoracotomy for concomitant aortic valve replacement and right coronary artery bypass graft.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Full sternotomy is the standard approach for combined surgery. Evidence of the minimally invasive approach's advantages for aortic and mitral valve surgery has been reported. Our aim was to report our experience with minithoracotomy for elective patients presenting with aortic valve stenosis associated with right coronary artery disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2016 and August 2021, 17 patients underwent concomitant aortic valve replacement and right coronary artery bypass grafting by right anterior thoracotomy.
RESULTS: The mean age was 73.3 years and the mean EuroSCORE 2 was 2.07 ± 1.24. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 148 ± 29 min and 111 ± 20 min. Thirteen patients (76.0%) had femoral cannulation. Nine saphenous veins (53%), seven right internal thoracic arteries (41%), and one radial artery (6%) were used as a graft. Twelve patients benefited from ultrasonic flow measurements to control the graft. The mean flow rate was 47 ± 39 ml/min, and the mean pulsatility index was 2.4 ± 1.2. The mean postoperative transvalvular gradient was 10.9 ± 4 mmHg. Two patients presented with Grade 1 aortic insufficiency (12%). There was no 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined aortic valve replacement and right coronary artery bypass grafting through right anterior thoracotomy is reliable and reproducible in selected patients.
