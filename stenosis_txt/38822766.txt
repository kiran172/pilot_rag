Title: Symptom-Free Intervals Following Laser Wedge Excision for Recurrent Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Analyze the duration of symptom-free intervals following laser wedge excision (LWE) for recurrent idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS). Secondary aim includes evaluating the influence of patient-related or disease factors.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
SETTING: Tertiary center.
METHODS: Review of iSGS patients who underwent LWE between 2002 and 2021. LWE patients without prior airway surgery were labeled LWE primary (LWEP) and those with prior history of dilation were labeled LWE secondary (LWES). A conditional frailty repeated events model was used to analyze the median time to recurrence (MTR) for each nth recurrence. Secondary analysis included stratification by use of medical therapy and initial preoperative characteristics of scar (Myer-Cotton grade, distance between the glottis and superior-most aspect of scar, D<sub>GS</sub>; length of scar, D<sub>L</sub>).
RESULTS: Two hundred and ten iSGS patients underwent LWE (131 LWEP, 79 LWES). The proportion of patients experiencing at least 1, 3, 6, and 12 recurrences, respectively, was 68.0% (n = 143), 40.7% (n = 85), 20.0% (n = 42), and 5.2% (n = 11). There was exponential time-shortening from the 1st to 12th recurrence (P &lt; .0001). While MTR was 4.1 years after the first LWE, this fell to 2.8, 1.7, 1.0, and 0.7 years for the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 12th recurrences. Furthermore, LWEP patients experienced longer MTR than LWES counterparts within the first 6 recurrences (P &lt; .01). There was no significant relationship between intersurgical interval and medication adherence, D<sub>L</sub>, D<sub>GS</sub>, or grade for recurrences beyond the first (P = .207, P = .20, P = .43, P = .16).
CONCLUSION: Symptom-free intervals in iSGS shorten with each subsequent recurrence and LWE. The difference in MTR between LWEP and LWES groups was significant within the first 6 recurrences with LWEP having longer MTR.
