Title: A case of superior mesenteric artery stenting for small intestinal ischaemia caused by superior mesenteric artery invasion of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) invasion by a malignant tumour is a serious condition leading to intestinal ischaemia. Although SMA stenting has been reported to be useful for SMA dissection and stenosis caused by atherosclerotic plaque, SMA stenting for stenosis caused by malignant tumour invasion is rarely reported and uncertain. A 75-year-old woman presented intestinal ulcer and melena caused by SMA invasion of unresectable pancreatic cancer. The bare metal stent was implanted for the vessel stenosis, and a small intestinal ulcer was markedly improved after stenting. However, one and a half months after stenting the stent was occluded and a thrombectomy was performed. After thrombectomy, residual stenosis caused by tumour invasion was observed in the stent. The patient suddenly died 2 days after thrombectomy before additional covered stenting for residual stenosis. Stent implantation may be a treatment option for intestinal ischaemia caused by vessel invasion of malignant tumours. On the other hand, re-stenosis of the stent due to tumour ingrowth is a problem, and covered stenting is considered for long-term stent patency.
