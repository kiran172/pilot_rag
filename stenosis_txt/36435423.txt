Title: Risk Factors for Stroke After Carotid Paraganglioma Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Carotid Paraganglioma Cooperative International Registry (CAPACITY) is an international registry composed of 1,432 patients with carotid body tumors (CBT) from 11 centers from 4 countries. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for patients who presented stroke after carotid paraganglioma resection.
METHODS: Clinical characteristics and demographics of patients who presented transoperatively and postoperatively stroke from the CAPACITY database were retrospectively gathered. Regression analysis was performed using single logistic regression with Omnibus' test for possible factors that might contribute to present stroke.
RESULTS: Out of 1,432 patients, 8 (0.5%) female patients presented stroke. Median age was 53 years (range: 41-70 years). Six strokes occurred transoperatively, diagnosed clinically in the immediate postoperative period. Of them, none of the patients received any further treatment. Three of them died on postoperative day 2, 3, and 4. Two patients developed stroke during the first 24 postoperative hours, patients showed dysarthria, and aphasia. One of them was reintervened with thrombectomy due to thrombosis of the common carotid artery the other patient was treated conservatively. Median follow-up was 16 months (range: 2-72 months). Single logistic regression analysis revealed a history of diabetes mellitus (odds ratio (OR) 7.62), carotid artery disease (OR 17.51), and vascular lesion (OR 2.37) to have significantly increased odds of stroke during CBT surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study history of diabetes mellitus, carotid artery disease, and vascular lesion had increased odds of stroke during CBT surgery. Findings are limited by low event rate and even larger cohorts are needed to fully define preventive preoperative strategies for preventing stroke.
