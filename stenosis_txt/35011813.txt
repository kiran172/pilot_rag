Title: Carotid Artery Disease in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes: Risk Factors and Biomarkers.

Abstract: Carotid atherosclerosis (CA) and, especially, carotid artery stenosis (CAS), are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors and biomarkers of subclinical CA and CAS in T2D individuals. High-resolution ultrasonography of carotid arteries was performed in 389 patients. Ninety-five clinical parameters were evaluated, including diabetic complications and comorbidities; antihyperglycemic, hypolipidemic, and antihypertensive therapy; indices of glycemic control and glucose variability (GV); lipid panels; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); albuminuria; blood cell count; and coagulation. Additionally, serum levels of calponin-1, relaxin, L-citrulline, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -3 (MMP-2, -3) were measured by ELISA. In univariate analysis, older age, male sex, diabetes duration, GV, diabetic retinopathy, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and MMP-3 were associated with subclinical CA. In addition to these factors, long-term arterial hypertension, high daily insulin doses, eGFR, and L-citrulline were associated with CAS. In multivariate logistic regression, age, male sex, BMI, GV, and eGFR predicted CA independently; male sex, BMI, diabetes duration, eGFR, and L-citrulline were predictors of CAS. These results can be used to develop screening and prevention programs for CA and CAS in T2D subjects.
