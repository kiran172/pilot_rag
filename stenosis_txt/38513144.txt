Title: Percutaneous placement of a retrievable fully covered metal stent with anchoring flaps for the treatment of biliary anastomotic stricture following LDLT.

Abstract: To investigate the outcomes following percutaneous placement of a retrievable fully covered self-expanding metal stent (fcSEMS) with anchoring flaps at proximal and distal ends for the treatment of biliary anastomotic strictures following living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of nine patients who underwent this procedure at our centre between April 2020 and March 2021. Percutaneous stent placement was technically successful in 100% patients, and all stents were successfully retrieved. No proximal or distal stent migration or occlusion was observed during the mean (±SD) stent indwelling period of 191(± 77) days. Clinical success was 89%. There was one major bleeding complication related to the biliary approach and one minor stent-related complication of calculus/sludge. During the mean (±SD) follow-up period of 595 ± 207 days after stent retrieval, only one patient developed recurrent clinical biliary stricture and symptoms. Percutaneous placement of a retrievable fcSEMS with anchoring flaps is safe and feasible for the treatment of biliary anastomotic strictures following LDLT.
