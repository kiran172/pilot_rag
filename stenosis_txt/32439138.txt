Title: Performance of endoscopic repair with endonasal flaps for congenital choanal atresia. A systematic review.

Abstract: Endoscopic repair of congenital choanal atresia is the gold standard surgical treatment today. Though several controversies on treatment have been reported, surgical techniques for better outcomes are still in discussion. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of endoscopic choanal atresia repair with endonasal flaps and no stents. Publications in English in the last 5 years were searched in the PUBMED database and were systematically reviewed. A total of 9 articles were included according to the inclusion criteria, obtaining a total of 266 patients managed for congenital choanal atresia with endoscopic surgery, endonasal flaps, and no stents. Surgical results, type of atresia, atresia laterality, associated pathologies and follow up were evaluated. Successful surgery was obtained in 237 (89%) patients while 29 (11%) patients required a new surgical intervention during the follow-up period. Fourteen percent of the patients were diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome and 5% of the patients had some associated heart disease. Bony-Membranous stenosis was observed in 74% of the patients, while a total bony obstruction was recognized in 26% of the patients. Unilateral atresia was observed in 37% of the cases and 63% of the cases had bilateral atresia. The mean follow-up period was 39.5 months (range 3-168 months). An important functional success rate can be accomplished by correcting congenital choanal atresia using functional endoscopic surgery, covering raw areas with endonasal vascularized flaps, avoiding postoperative endonasal stenting.
