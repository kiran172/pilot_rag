Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement 24 years after cardiac transplantation.

Abstract: As patient survival after cardiac transplantation has improved over the course of the last several decades, clinicians are now faced with late complications. This includes aortic stenosis which, traditionally, has been treated with reoperative sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. Transcather aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a minimally invasive alternative in this high-risk population. A small but growing number of cases of TAVR after heart transplantation in high-risk patients have been reported in the last 10 years; we now present a case of aortic valve replacement via a transcatheter approach 24 years after cardiac transplantation.
