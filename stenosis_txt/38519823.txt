Title: Lesion of slit-like stenosis underestimated by fractional flow reserve based on computed tomography images.

Abstract: This case report discusses a 74-year-old man presenting with angina pectoris. Coronary computed tomography angiography suggested only mild stenosis in the mid left anterior descending artery (LAD), with fractional flow reserve based on computed tomography images (FFRct) value of 0.87. However, coronary angiography revealed slit-like stenosis in the mid LAD, and the invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) was measured at 0.72, demonstrating a deviation from the FFRct value.
