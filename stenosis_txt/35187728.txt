Title: Aortic valve reconstruction surgery using autologous pericardium: The experience in Vietnam.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the indications and describe the aortic valve reconstruction techniques by Ozaki's procedure in Vietnam and report mid-term outcomes of this technique in Vietnam.
METHODS: Between June 2017 and December 2019, 72 patients diagnosed with isolated aortic valve disease, with a mean age of 52.9 (19-79 years old), and a male:female ratio of 3:1 underwent aortic valve reconstruction surgery by Ozaki's technique at Cardiovascular Center, E Hospital, Vietnam.
RESULTS: The aortic valve diseases consisted of aortic stenosis (42%), aortic regurgitation (28%), and a combination of both (30%). In addition, the proportion of aortic valves with bicuspid morphology and small annulus (≤21 mm) was 28% and 38.9%, respectively. The mean aortic cross-clamp time was 106 ± 13.8 min, mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 136.7 ± 18.5 min, and 2.8% of all patients required conversion to prosthetic valve replacement surgery. The mean follow-up time was 26.4 months (12-42 months), the survival rate was 95.8%, the reoperation rate was 2.8%, and rate of postoperative moderate or higher aortic valve regurgitation was 4.2%. Postoperative valvular hemodynamics was favorable, with a peak pressure gradient of 16.1 mmHg and an effective orifice area index of 2.3 cm2 .
CONCLUSIONS: This procedure was safe and effective, with favorable valvular hemodynamics and a low rate of valvular degeneration. However, more long-term follow-up data are needed.
