Title: Looking for Optimal Implantation Height in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Case Series.

Abstract: TAVR in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) represents a challenging scenario. Valve sizing and positioning are the most important determinants of procedural success. In BAV the maximal prosthesis-anatomy interference occurs at the supra-annular level. Supra-annular prosthesis implantation may improve valve sealing and hemodynamic result. In this case series, we propose a new site for prosthesis implantation, guided CT scan supra-annular sizing for BAV undergoing TAVR.
