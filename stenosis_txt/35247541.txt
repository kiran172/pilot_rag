Title: Clinical and Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Vascular Surgery at a Tertiary University "Hub" Hospital of Italy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since the first cases of a novel respiratory disease were reported in December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Emergency State (Cov-ES) caused a worldwide outbreak requiring a complete reorganization of the healthcare system and new management of its personnel; aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and financial impact of Cov-ES in the Department of Vascular Surgery at a Tertiary University "Hub" Hospital in northeast Italy.
METHODS: Differences in clinical practice according to Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Related Health Problems and the financial impact of Cov-ES were considered. Vascular procedures performed between March 2019 and December 2019 (Prepandemic) were compared to those performed in the period March-December 2020 (Pandemic). Prepandemic and pandemic reimbursements of all vascular activities and the top 3 vascular diagnoses were evaluated.
RESULTS: Prepandemic versus pandemic era documented a decrease of vascular consultations performed (2,882 vs. 2,270, -21.2%). The number of total vascular procedures decreased from 997 to 797 (-20.1%) with a higher reduction observed in outpatient surgical activities (247 to 136, -45.0%, P = 0.0005) rather than inpatient surgical activities (750 vs. 661, 11.9%, P = 0.02). Length of hospital stay (LOS) increased from 3.3 ± 2.7 days in prepandemic to 5.3 ± 3.9 in the pandemic era (P = 0.004). Among patients with limb-threatening ischemia, the rate of major limb amputation was higher in the pandemic (3.3% vs. 5.4%, respectively, P = 0.02), and a higher rate of elective hospitalization procedures was performed as urgent/emerging setting after clinical deterioration (2.8 % vs. 6.4%, P = 0.0002). According to DRG classification, an increase of "complicated" limb-threatening ischemia (DRG 554) and aortic aneurysm (DRG 110) was observed prepandemic to pandemic (+84.2% and +25.0%, respectively). Total reimbursement for vascular activities between pandemic versus prepandemic was 4,646,108€ vs. 5,054,398€, respectively (-8.0%). Management of "complicated" limb-threatening ischemia (DRG 554) and aortic aneurysm (DRG 110) required a higher clinical and financial support that was translated into higher economic reimbursement during the pandemic (273,035€ vs. 150,005€, +82.0% and 749,250€ vs. 603,680€, +24.1%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, the main resources were employed for the treatment of limb-threatening ischemia, aortic aneurysm, and carotid stenosis. Inpatient activities documented an increase in major limb amputation and LOS. An increased reimbursement for each vascular procedure and for all "complicated" diagnoses revealed that the more serious and resource-demanding pathology occurred in this period.
