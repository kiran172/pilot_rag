Title: Extended hockey stick aortotomy for Perceval valve implantation: How to reshape the aortic root.

Abstract: The Perceval valve is a true sutureless aortic bioprosthesis. Overall, excellent performances have been demonstrated in terms of hemodynamic outcomes, safety, and versatility of use; furthermore, as a sutureless valve option, it has shown to reduce the surgical burden, shortening the operative times, and simplifying minimally invasive procedures. Since the valve has got a high frame profile, the recommended implantation technique requires a high and transverse aortotomy. In case of unplanned Perceval valve implantation, when an extended aortotomy is required, we have come up with a simple technique to reshape the aortic root before the valve is delivered in place: symmetry is pivotal to prevent folding issues and to improve the annular sealing. Although we discuss an out-of-recommendation use, in our experience that technique has shown to be safe and effective.
