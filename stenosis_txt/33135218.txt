Title: Is this a bridge too far?

Abstract: Maeda et al. present what may be the second reported case of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) followed by staged open surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in a high-risk patient. The authors propose that TAVR may serve as a bridge procedure before SAVR for aortic stenosis in selected younger patients with high surgical risk. Further experience may clarify how long to wait after TAVR to perform SAVR. Timing will be a balance between improving surgical risk versus increasing difficulty removing the prosthesis. Knowledge of TAVR durability will ultimately be needed to decide between "destination" TAVR versus bridging to SAVR with a more durable device.
