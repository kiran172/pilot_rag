Title: The association between ABO blood groups and TASC II classification in patients with peripheral artery disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between blood groups and severity of peripheral artery disease (PAD) using TASC II classification.
METHODS: The patients who were diagnosed with PAD were retrospectively analyzed. The patients with 50% or more stenosis in the aorto-iliac or femoro-popliteal region detected by conventional or CT angiography were included in the study. These patients were divided into TASC II A, B, C, and D groups considering the severity of PAD. All patients' blood groups were recorded and compared between TASC II groups.
RESULTS: While 38% of the study population was O blood group, 61% were non-O group. On the other hand, 90% of the entire study population were RH positive and 10% were RH negative. Non-O blood ratio was found to be significantly higher in patients with higher TASC II groups. (TASC IIA 51.6% vs. TASC IIB 57.9% vs. TASC IIC 61.3% vs. TASC IID 76.6%, p&lt; .001) However, the frequencies of Rh types were similar in all groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied for determining the predictors of severity and complexity of PAD (TASC II C and TASC II D lesions).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results revealed a clear association between ABO blood groups and severity of peripheral arterial disease. Non-O blood group was found to be the independent predictor of severe and complex PAD.
