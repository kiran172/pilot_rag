Title: A Word of Caution Before Treating Aortic Stenosis in Patients With Concomitant LVOT Obstruction.

Abstract: Patients with aortic stenosis and concomitant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement are at risk of hemodynamic collapse after the procedure due to worsening left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. We present 3 cases highlighting the important interplay between these 2 disease states and associated diagnostic and treatment challenges. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
