Title: Histologic evidence of tracheal stenosis directly resulting from SARS-CoV-2 tissue infiltration, a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There has been an anecdotal increase in the incidence of tracheal stenosis that has coincided with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case series in which we report clinical and pathologic findings of two patients who subsequently developed subglottic tracheal stenosis after having been hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Histopathologic analysis of tissue from these patients shows features consistent with tissue infiltrated with SARS-CoV-2 virus, namely multinucleated syncytial cells with prominent nucleoli.
CONCLUSION: Our findings directly implicate SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis of tracheal stenosis.
