Title: Preoperative Patient-reported Outcomes are not Associated With Sagittal and Spinopelvic Alignment in Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether sagittal and spinopelvic alignment correlate with preoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) with spinal stenosis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Positive global sagittal balance and spinopelvic malalignment are strongly correlated with symptom severity in adult spinal deformity, but this correlation has not been evaluated in DLS.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled in the Canadian Spine Outcomes Research Network (CSORN) prospective DLS study at seven centers between January 2015 and May 2018. Correlation was assessed between the following preoperative PROs: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), numeric rating scale (NRS) leg pain, and NRS back pain and the following preoperative sagittal radiographic parameters SS, PT, PI, SVA, LL, TK, T1SPI, T9SPI, and PI-LL. Patients were further divided into groups based on spinopelvic alignment: Group 1 PI-LL<10°; Group 2 PI-LL ≥10° with PT <30°; and Group 3 PI-LL ≥10° with PT ≥30°. Preoperative PROs were compared among these three groups and were further stratified by those with SVA <50 mm and SVA ≥50 mm.
RESULTS: A total of 320 patients (61% female) with mean age of 66.1 years were included. Mean (SD) preoperative PROs were: NRS leg pain 7.4 (2.1), NRS back pain 7.1 (2.0), and ODI 45.5 (14.5). Preoperative radiographic parameters included: SVA 27.1 (33.4) mm, LL 45.7 (13.4°), PI 57.6 (11.9), and PI-LL 11.8 (14.0°). Weak but statistically significant correlations were observed between leg pain and PT (r = -0.114) and PI (ρ = -0.130), and T9SPI with back pain ( r  = 0.130). No significant differences were observed among the three groups stratified by PI-LL and PT. No significant differences in PROs were observed between patients with SVA <50 mm compared to those with SVA ≥50 mm.
CONCLUSION: Sagittal and spinopelvic malalignment do not appear to significantly influence baseline PROs in patients with DLS.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic level II.
