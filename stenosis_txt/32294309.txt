Title: Coronary artery disease management and cost implications with fractional flow reserve guided coronary intervention in Indian patients with stable ischemic coronary artery disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To study the safety of stent avoidance, frequency of change in management decisions, and its cost implications while using a fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided treatment strategy for intermediate-grade coronary artery stenosis.
BACKGROUND: The impact of FFR in guiding management decisions and its cost implications has not been studied after imposition of a ceiling on stent prices by the Government of India.
METHODS: In 400 patients with 477 intermediate-grade coronary lesions for whom coronary intervention was planned, functional assessment using FFR was done. Incidence of the primary composite endpoint (major adverse cardiac event [MACE], cardiac death, myocardial infarction, objective evidence of ischemia, and target vessel revascularization) in the stent avoided subset was compared with the stented group at follow-up. Micro-costing analysis was done using a computed model with current stent and FFR wire prices.
RESULTS: The overall incidence of MACE was 4.9%, 0.9% in the stent-avoided subset and 6.9% in stented group (p = 0.04, comparing the latter two) at a median follow-up of 21 months (interquartile range 12-31 months). Serious adverse events occurred only in 1% of patients receiving adenosine. The average cost saving was Indian rupees (INR) 51,847 [United States Dollar (USD) 746] per patient, resulting in total savings of INR 15,813,379 (USD 227,530). Cost savings persisted but were lower by 36% (INR 18,613/USD 268 per patient) after the ceiling of stent prices.
CONCLUSION: FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy is safe and cost-effective in countries where majority of patients self-finance their health care, resulting in stent and PCI avoidance in approximately one in three patients referred for coronary angioplasty.
