Title: Anchoring fins of fully covered self-expandable metal stents affect pull-out force and stent migration.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Stent migration and subsequent adverse events are frequently observed in the use of fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMSs) for distal biliary stenosis. In this study, we identified predictors for stent migration based on biomechanical stent characteristics and associated these findings with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: The migration resistance of FCSEMSs was quantified by measuring the pull-out force. We analyzed a single-center retrospective cohort of 178 FCSEMSs for treatment success and adverse events occurring during 180 days of follow-up.
RESULTS: Biomechanical measurements revealed a 4-fold higher migration resistance of FCSEMSs with anchoring fins (AF-FCSEMSs; F<sub>max</sub> = 14.2 ± .1 N) compared with FCSEMSs with flared ends (FE-FCSEMSs; F<sub>max</sub> = 3.8 ± 1.0 N; P &lt; .0001). Clinically, AF-FCSEMSs showed lower rates of migration compared with FE-FCSEMSs (5% vs 34%, P &lt; .0001). Unscheduled ERCP procedures because of stent dysfunction were less frequent in the AF group compared with the FE group (15% vs 29%, P = .046). Cholangitis because of stent dysfunction was observed in 5% of the AF group compared with 19% in the FE group (P = .02). Stent patency rates at 1, 3, and 6 months were higher in the AF group (96%, 90%, and 80%, respectively) compared with the FE group (90%, 74%, and 66%; log-rank test: P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: The pull-out force as a biomechanical stent property predicts the migration resistance of FCSEMSs in distal biliary stenosis and may thus be used to classify stents for this application. AF-FCSEMSs showed a significantly lower rate of migration and adverse events compared with FE-FCSEMSs.
