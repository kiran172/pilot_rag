Title: Contribution of single-gene defects to congenital cardiac left-sided lesions in the prenatal setting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To explore the contribution of single-gene defects to the genetic cause of cardiac left-sided lesions (LSLs), and to evaluate the incremental diagnostic yield of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for single-gene defects in fetuses with LSLs without aneuploidy or a pathogenic copy-number variant (pCNV).
METHODS: Between 10 April 2015 and 30 October 2018, we recruited 80 pregnant women diagnosed with a LSL who had termination of pregnancy and genetic testing. Eligible LSLs were aortic valve atresia or stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, mitral atresia or stenosis and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). CNV sequencing (CNV-seq) and WES were performed sequentially on specimens from these fetuses and their parents. CNV-seq was used to identify aneuploidies and pCNVs, while WES was used to identify diagnostic genetic variants in cases without aneuploidy or pCNV.
RESULTS: Of 80 pregnancies included in the study, 27 (33.8%) had a genetic diagnosis. CNV-seq analysis identified six (7.5%) fetuses with aneuploidy and eight (10.0%) with pCNVs. WES analysis of the remaining 66 cases revealed diagnostic genetic variants in 13 (19.7%) cases, indicating that the diagnostic yield of WES for the entire cohort was 16.3% (13/80). KMT2D was the most frequently mutated gene (7/66 (10.6%)) in fetuses with LSL without aneuploidy or pCNVs, followed by NOTCH1 (4/66 (6.1%)). HLHS was the most prevalent cardiac phenotype (4/7) in cases with a KMT2D mutation in this cohort. An additional six (9.1%) cases were found to have potentially deleterious variants in candidate genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Single-gene defects contribute substantially to the genetic etiology of fetal LSLs. KMT2D mutations accounted for approximately 10% of LSLs in our fetal cohort. WES has the potential to provide genetic diagnoses in fetuses with LSLs without aneuploidy or pCNVs. Copyright Â© 2019 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
