Title: Two-year clinical outcomes and predictors of restenosis following the use of polymer-coated paclitaxel-eluting stents or drug-coated balloons in patients with femoropopliteal artery disease.

Abstract: We aimed to assess the clinical performance and risk factors for patency loss within 2 years following the use of polymer-coated paclitaxel-eluting stents (PC-PESs) and drug-coated balloons (DCBs) in patients with lower extremity artery disease. Multi-center registry data from 151 patients (65 and 86 treated with PC-PES and DCB, respectively) were retrospectively investigated. Two-year primary patency (PP) and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Predictors of restenosis within 2 years of the procedures were analyzed using the random survival forest method. The consistent predictors of restenosis within 1 and 2 years were assessed and validated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Two-year PP was 77.2 and 57.2% (log rank p = 0.047) and freedom from CD-TLR was 84.4 and 84.8% in the PC-PES and DCB groups, respectively (log rank p = 0.89). In the DCB group, most of the patients (n = 77, 89.5%) were treated with high-dose DCB. Consistent predictors of restenosis were lower vessel diameter and severity of Clinical Frailty Scale in the PC-PES group, and severity of peripheral artery calcification scoring system grade, severity of post dissection pattern, and smaller vessel diameter in the DCB group. The validation analysis revealed that patients with consistent predictors had significantly worse PP values than that of those without in the PC-PES (87.9% vs. 55.3%, log rank p = 0.003) and DCB groups (75.9% vs. 35.2%, log rank p = 0.001). The 2-year PP of DCBs was lower than that of PC-PESs. A smaller vessel diameter could predict restenosis in both devices. Vessel calcification and dissection should be considered when using DCB to ensure longer term patency.
