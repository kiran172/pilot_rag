Title: Coronary Artery Stenosis Caused by Primary Malignant Pericardial Mesothelioma in a 76-Year-Old Man.

Abstract: This report describes a 76-year-old man with diabetes mellitus who developed coronary artery stenosis from infiltration of a primary malignant pericardial mesothelioma. Three months before referral to the treating hospital, elevated liver function values and cardiac enzymes led to echocardiography, which revealed a motion abnormality in the anterior wall of the heart. The patient was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and admitted to the hospital, where chest computed tomography showed a tumor above the left atrial appendage that compressed the origin of the left anterior descending artery. He was referred to the treating hospital for surgery. Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting was performed, but the mass was not resected because of its infiltrating nature and the potential for medical complications. Histologic examination of a biopsy specimen confirmed a primary malignant pericardial mesothelioma. The bypass procedure resolved the coronary artery stenosis caused by the tumor. Although the optimal treatment for primary malignant pericardial mesothelioma is controversial, minimally invasive methods, such as minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting, may be used successfully.
