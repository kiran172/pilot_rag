Title: Endoscopic or percutaneous biliary drainage in hilar cholangiocarcinoma: When and how?

Abstract: Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (hCCA) is a primary liver tumor associated with a dim prognosis. The role of preoperative and palliative biliary drainage has long been debated. The most common techniques are endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD); however, recently developed endoscopic ultrasound-assisted methods are gaining more atention. Selecting the best available method in any specific scenario is crucial, yet sometimes challenging. Thus, this review aimed to discuss the available techniques, indications, perks, pitfalls, and timing-related issues in the management of hCCA. In a preoperative setting, PTBD appears to have some advantages: low risk of postprocedural complications (namely cholangitis) and better priming for surgery. For palliative purposes, we propose ERCP/PTBD depending on the experience of the operators, but also on other factors: the level of bilirubin (if very high, rather PTBD), length of the stenosis and the presence of cholangitis (PTBD), ERCP failure, or altered biliary anatomy.
