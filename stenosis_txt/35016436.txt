Title: Laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct exploration in patients with a nondilated common bile duct.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic transcystic common bile duct exploration (LTCBDE) is the minimally traumatic surgical method for the treatment of choledocholithiasis secondary to cholecystolithiasis with dilated common bile duct (CBD). However, no report exists concerning LTCBDE in patients with nondilated CBD. The purpose of this study was thus to explore the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of LTCBDE in patients with choledocholithiasis secondary to cholecystolithiasis with nondilatation of the CBD.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 47 patients with choledocholithiasis secondary to cholecystolithiasis who were treated with LTCBDE at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2017 to August 2021 (all the patients had undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography treatment, but this failed due to various reasons). Clinical data on disease characteristics, methods for cystic duct incision and CBD stone extraction, and surgical outcomes were collected and reviewed. Each patient was followed up for more than 3 months.
RESULTS: There were 47 patients in this study, including 21 females and 26 males, with their ages ranging from 15 to 82 years (51±15 years). All patients were treated with surgery, and the CBD stones were removed successfully. Among these patients, 45 underwent LTCBDE for the removal of stones in the CBD, with failure occurring in 2 patients who then accepted laparoscopic common bile duct stone removal (LCBDE) + T tube drainage. The diameter of the cystic duct was 0.30-0.73 cm (0.60±0.07 cm), the diameter of the CBD was 0.60-0.80 cm (0.73±0.05 cm), the operation time was 75-220 minutes (159±33 minutes), and the postoperative hospital stay was 2-13 days (6±2 days). None of the patients experience any serious postoperative complications, and all were discharged safely. During the follow-up, no postoperative biliary stenosis, bile leakage, or other complications occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: LTCBDE is feasible to treat patients with choledocholithiasis secondary to cholecystolithiasis with nondilatation of the CBD. This choice of treatment plan reduces the length of hospital stay and the occurrence of postoperative complications. However, it is recommended that this be attempted on the basis of the experience of LTCBDE with dilated CBD.
