Title: Coexistence and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm and coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and coronary atherosclerosis share common risk factors. In this study, a single-center management experience of patients with a coexistence of AAA and coronary artery disease (CAD) is presented.
METHODS: 271 consecutive patients who underwent elective AAA repair were reviewed. Coronary imaging in 118 patients was considered suitable for exploration of AAA coexistence with CAD.
RESULTS: Significant coronary stenosis (> 70%) were found in 65.3% of patients. History of cardiac revascularization was present in 26.3% of patients, myocardial infarction (MI) in 31.4%, and 39.8% had both. In a subgroup analysis, prior history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (OR = 6.9, 95% CI 2.6-18.2, p < 0.001) and patients' age (OR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2, p = 0.007) were independent predictors of significant coronary stenosis. Only 52.0% (40/77) of patients with significant coronary stenosis underwent immediate coronary revascularization prior to aneurysm repair: PCI in 32 cases (4 drug-eluting stents and 27 bare metal stents), coronary artery bypass graft in 8 cases. Patients undergoing revascularization prior to surgery had longer mean time from coronary imaging to AAA repair (123.6 vs. 58.1 days, p < 0.001). Patients undergoing coronary artery evaluation prior to AAA repair had shorter median hospitalization (7 [2-70] vs. 7 [3-181] days, p = 0.007) and intensive care unit stay (1 [0-9] vs. 1 [0-70] days, p = 0.014) and also had a lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events or multiple organ failure (0% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.035). A total of 11.0% of patients had coronary artery aneurysms.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AAA might benefit from an early coronary artery evaluation strategy.
