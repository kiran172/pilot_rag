Title: Extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm as initial presentation in Takayasu arteritis: case series and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysm as a presenting feature in Takayasu's arteritis is very rare. Here, we report three cases of extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in Takayasu's arteritis as initial presentation.
CASE SUMMARY: All three cases were males and presented with complaints of abdominal pain and refractory hypertension. The diagnosis was made from the finding of thickened and calcified aortic wall, stenosis of visceral arteries, and age < 40 years at diagnosis. Case 1 was a 34 years male with aortic aneurysm extending from left subclavian artery to infrarenal aorta. He underwent endovascular repair of aneurysm by sandwich chimney technique in view of impending aneurysm rupture. Case 2, a 37 years male had aortic aneurysm from descending thoracic aorta (D4 vertebral body) to infrarenal aorta (L4 level). While being evaluated for repair, he had sudden death probably due to ruptured aneurysm. Case three, a 40 years male had aortic aneurysm extending from left subclavian artery to aortic bifurcation and stenosis of visceral arteries. He did not consent for repair and died one year later due to chronic kidney disease and related complications.
DISCUSSION: Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm is a very rare manifestation in Takayasu's arteritis; more common in males. Endovascular repair is challenging but feasible. Long-term monitoring and repeat intervention may be needed due to young age of patients and disease progression.
