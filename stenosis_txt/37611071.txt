Title: Bicuspid aortic valve: long-term morbidity and mortality.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart anomaly. Lifetime morbidity and whether long-term survival varies according to BAV patient-sub-groups are unknown. This study aimed to assess lifetime morbidity and long-term survival in BAV patients in the community.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively identified all Olmsted County (Minnesota) residents with an echocardiographic diagnosis of BAV from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2009, including patients with typical valvulo-aortopathy (BAV without accelerated valvulo-aortopathy or associated disorders), and those with complex valvulo-aortopathy (BAV with accelerated valvulo-aortopathy or associated disorders).
RESULTS: 652 consecutive diagnosed BAV patients [median (IQR) age 37 (22-53) years; 525 (81%) adult and 127 (19%) paediatric] were followed for a median (IQR) of 19.1 (12.9-25.8) years. The total cumulative lifetime morbidity burden (from birth to age 90) was 86% (95% CI 82.5-89.7); cumulative lifetime progression to ≥ moderate aortic stenosis or regurgitation, aortic valve surgery, aortic aneurysm ≥45 mm or z-score ≥3, aorta surgery, infective endocarditis and aortic dissection was 80.3%, 68.5%, 75.4%, 27%, 6% and 1.6%, respectively. Survival of patients with typical valvulo-aortopathy [562 (86%), age 40 (28-55) years, 86% adults] was similar to age-sex-matched Minnesota population (P = .12). Conversely, survival of patients with complex valvulo-aortopathy [90 (14%), age 14 (3-26) years, 57% paediatric] was lower than expected, with a relative excess mortality risk of 2.25 (95% CI 1.21-4.19) (P = .01).
CONCLUSION: The BAV condition exhibits a high lifetime morbidity burden where valvulo-aortopathy is close to unavoidable by age 90. The lifetime incidence of infective endocarditis is higher than that of aortic dissection. The most common BAV clinical presentation is the typical valvulo-aortopathy with preserved expected long-term survival, while the complex valvulo-aortopathy presentation incurs higher mortality.
