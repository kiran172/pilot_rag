Title: Risk of new cerebral ischemic events in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis while awaiting carotid stent placement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although there is an emphasis on performing carotid artery stent (CAS) placement within 2 weeks after index event of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke in patients with significant extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, the risks and characteristics of recurrent cerebral ischemic event while waiting for CAS placement are not well defined.
METHOD: We analyzed patients admitted to our institution over a 45-month period with symptomatic extracranial ICA stenosis. We identified any new cerebral ischemic events that occurred between index cerebral or retinal ischemic event and CAS placement and categorized them as TIA and minor or major ischemic strokes. We calculated the risk of new ipsilateral cerebral ischemic events between index cerebral or retinal ischemic event and CAS placement.
RESULTS: The mean age of 131 patients analyzed was 67 years (range: 47-94 years; 92 were men), and 94 and 37 patients had 70%-99% and 50%-69% severity of stenosis, respectively. The mean and median time intervals between index cerebral or retinal ischemic event and CAS performance were 28 (standard deviation [SD] 30) and 7 (interquartile range 33) days, respectively. A total of 9 of 131 patients (6.9%, 95% confidence interval 2.5%-11.2%) experienced new cerebral ischemic events over 3637 patient days of observation. The risk of new ipsilateral cerebral ischemic events was 2.5 per 1000 patient days of observation.
CONCLUSION: We estimated the risk of new ipsilateral cerebral ischemic events in patients with ICA stenosis ≥50% in severity while waiting for CAS placement to guide appropriate timing of procedure.
