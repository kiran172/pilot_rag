Title: Acute Coronary Syndrome in an Anomalous Left Main Coronary Artery.

Abstract: Anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) from the right sinus of Valsalva (RSV) is a rare congenital anomaly that can cause myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. We report the case of a 74-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). On coronary angiogram, the patient was found to have LMCA originating from the RSV and a 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient subsequently underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the course of the LMCA, which was found to be intramyocardial with no compression. The echocardiogram reported a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall. The patient had a successful staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient on follow-up reported no symptoms and EF improved to 50%. Anomalous origin of the LMCA from the RSV is a rare but potentially life-threatening congenital anomaly. Once the course of the anomalous artery is established, immediate reperfusion using PCI is being increasingly used in place of surgical unroofing, noting a change in clinical practice. Further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment for this anomaly and to improve the long-term outcomes of affected individuals.
