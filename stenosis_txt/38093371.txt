Title: Association of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease with systemic atherosclerosis: a community-based cross-sectional study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data are limited on the association of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with systemic atherosclerosis. This study aimed to examine the relationship between MAFLD and the extent of atherosclerotic plaques and stenosis, and presence of polyvascular disease (PolyVD).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, MAFLD was diagnosed based on the presence of metabolic dysfunction (MD) and fatty liver disease (FLD). MAFLD was divided into three subtypes: MAFLD with diabetes mellitus (DM), MAFLD with overweight or obesity (OW), as well as MAFLD with lean/normal weight and at least two metabolic abnormalities. Atherosclerosis was evaluated, with vascular magnetic resonance imaging for intracranial and extracranial arteries, thoracoabdominal computed tomography angiography for coronary, subclavian, aorta, renal, iliofemoral arteries, and ankle-brachial index for peripheral arteries. The extent of plaques and stenosis was defined according to the number of these eight vascular sites affected. PolyVD was defined as the presence of stenosis in at least two vascular sites.
RESULTS: This study included 3047 participants, with the mean age of 61.2 ± 6.7 years and 46.6% of male (n = 1420). After adjusting for potential confounders, MAFLD was associated with higher extent of plaques (cOR, 2.14, 95% CI 1.85-2.48) and stenosis (cOR, 1.47, 95% CI 1.26-1.71), and higher odds of presence of PolyVD (OR, 1.55, 95% CI 1.24-1.94) as compared with Non-MAFLD. In addition, DM-MAFLD and OW-MAFLD were associated with the extent of atherosclerotic plaques and stenosis, and presence of PolyVD (All P < 0.05). However, lean-MAFLD was only associated with the extent of atherosclerotic plaques (cOR, 1.63, 95% CI 1.14-2.34). As one component of MAFLD, FLD per se was associated with the extent of plaques and stenosis in participants with MAFLD. Furthermore, FLD interacted with MD to increase the odds of presence of systemic atherosclerosis (P for interaction ≤ 0.055).
CONCLUSIONS: MAFLD and its subtypes of DM-MAFLD and OW-MAFLD were associated with the extent of atherosclerotic plaques and stenosis, and presence of PolyVD. This study implicated that FLD might be a potential target of intervention for reducing the deleterious effects of MAFLD on systemic atherosclerosis.
