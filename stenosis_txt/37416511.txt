Title: Pulmonary Valve Stenosis: From Diagnosis to Current Management Techniques and Future Prospects.

Abstract: Pulmonary stenosis (PS) is mainly a congenital defect that accounts for 7-12% of congenital heart diseases (CHD). It can be isolated or, more frequently, associated with other congenital defects (25-30%) involving anomalies of the pulmonary vascular tree. For the diagnosis of PS an integrated approach with echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is of paramount importance for the planning of the interventional treatment. In recent years, transcatheter approaches for the treatment of PS have increased however, meaning surgery is a possible option for complicated cases with anatomy not suitable for percutaneous treatment. The present review aims to summarize current knowledge regarding diagnosis and treatment of PS.
