Title: Purtscher-like retinopathy following carotid angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of severe carotid stenosis.

Abstract: We present a case of Purtscher-like retinopathy (PLR) following carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). A 56-year-old man with a history of severe stenosis of the left carotid artery and treated by CAS refers acute and painless visual loss on the left eye (OS) 48â€…h after the procedure. Funduscopic examination showed cotton wool spots and intraretinal hemorrhages confined to the peripapillary and posterior pole of the OS. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed retinal thickening and hyperintense lesions in the inner nuclear layer retina.
