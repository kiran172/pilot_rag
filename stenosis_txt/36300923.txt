Title: Chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation in a patient with Takayasu arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a large-vessel vasculitis that predominantly affects the aorta and although it usually causes stenosis, aneurysms have been reported in âˆ¼10-25% of the patients. Here, we present a male TA patient with chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) as a rare complication of endovascular grafted aortic aneurysm (AA). Chronic DIC usually presents as mild or even hidden clinical symptoms, and early diagnosis of this condition can only be possible with laboratory tests. Due to the silent clinical scenario, this complication should be kept in mind among AA patients with unexplained thrombocytopenia or coagulation abnormalities.
