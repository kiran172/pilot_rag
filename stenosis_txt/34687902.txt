Title: Review of Surgical Neovagina Techniques and Management of Vaginal Stricture.

Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: To review the currently available methods for surgical and nonsurgical neovaginal creation with an additional focus on situations requiring vaginal stretching, replacement, or augmentation and the management of vaginal stenosis or stricture.
DESIGN: Review of the existing literature METHODS: PUBMED search with key words vaginal agenesis, neovaginal creation, vaginoplasty, vaginal stretching, vaginal augmentation, vaginal stenosis, outcomes of vaginoplasty, Mullerian anomalies, vaginal anomalies RESULTS: The need to perform vaginal stretching, replacement, or augmentation will vary depending on the underlying reproductive tract condition.
CONCLUSIONS: A variety of techniques have been described to performed vaginal stretching, replacement, or augmentation. There are risks and benefits to each technique. Vaginal stricture and stenosis remain difficult problems given the high rates of these complications in patients undergoing these procedures. Although several techniques can alleviate this problem, they rely on the thickness of the stenosis and the location of the stenosis within the vagina.
