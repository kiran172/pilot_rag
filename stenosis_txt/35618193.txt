Title: Outcomes of early transcarotid artery revascularization versus carotid endarterectomy after acute neurologic events.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid revascularization within 14 days of a neurologic event has been recommended by society guidelines. Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) carries the lowest overall stroke rate for any carotid artery stenting technique. However, the outcomes of TCAR within 14 days of a neurologic event have not been directly compared with those after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: We compared the 30-day outcomes of symptomatic patients who had undergone TCAR and CEA within 14 days of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) from January 2016 to February 2020 using the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative carotid artery stenting and CEA databases. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for patient risk factors. The primary outcome was a composite of postoperative ipsilateral stroke, death, and myocardial infarction (MI).
RESULTS: A total of 1281 symptomatic patients had undergone TCAR and 13,429 patients had undergone CEA within 14 days of a neurologic event. After 1:1 propensity matching, 728 matched pairs were included for analysis. The primary composite outcome of stroke, death, or MI was more frequent in the TCAR group (4.7% vs 2.6%; P = .04). This was driven by a higher rate of postoperative ipsilateral stroke in the TCAR group (3.8% vs 1.8%; P = .005). No differences were found between TCAR and CEA in terms of death (0.7% vs 0.8%; P = .8) or MI (0.8% vs 1%; P = .7). Although TCAR procedures were shorter (median, 69 minutes [interquartile range, 53-85 minutes]; vs median, 120 minutes [interquartile range, 93-150 minutes]; P < .001) and the postoperative length of stay was similar (2 days; P = .3) compared with CEA, the TCAR patients were more likely to be discharged to a facility other than home (26% vs 19%; P < .01). Performing TCAR within 48 hours of a stroke was an independent predictor of postoperative stoke or TIA (odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-16). This increased risk of postoperative stroke or TIA was not found when performing TCAR within 48 hours of a TIA.
CONCLUSIONS: TCAR within 14 days of a neurologic event resulted in higher ipsilateral postoperative stroke rates compared with CEA, especially when performed within 48 hours after a stroke.
