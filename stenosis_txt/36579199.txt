Title: Custom Nasal Stent Fabrication for Post-traumatic Nasal Obstruction - A Case Report.

Abstract: Deformities of the nose can be of congenital, traumatic, or iatrogenic etiology. The aim of treating nasal/nostril stenosis is to establish an adequate airway and restore facial profile;Â this may be achieved by surgical correction or prosthetic means. This case report presents the fabrication of a customized rigid acrylic stent for alar stenosis in an 18-year-old girl occurring as a result of trauma. The functional and aesthetic result is evaluated at six months. Thus, customized acrylic nasal stents provide an easy-to-fabricate, economical option for the maintenance of nasal contour and patency of the airway.
