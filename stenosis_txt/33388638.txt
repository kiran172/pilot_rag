Title: Diagnosis and management of benign biliary strictures post liver transplantation in adults.

Abstract: Benign biliary strictures after liver transplantation are common and can lead to graft dysfunction and decreased patient survival. Post-transplant strictures are classified as anastomotic or non-anastomotic which differ in response to therapy. Risk factors for biliary strictures following transplantation include impaired blood supply, surgical factors, and biliary anomalies. Patients can present with biliary obstruction but most will be asymptomatic, with only abnormal graft function. MRCP is the most sensitive noninvasive tool for diagnosing biliary complications. In most centres worldwide endoscopy is used first-line in the management of anastomotic strictures, although there is significant variation in endoscopic technique employed; including dilation, placing a single or multiple plastic stents, a fully covered metal stent and most recently using intra-ductal fully covered metal stents. With the introduction of fully covered metal stents the number of interventions patients require has reduced and overall the clinical success of the endoscopic approach has steadily improved. Percutaneous and surgical treatments are now reserved for patients in whom endoscopic management fails or who have had Roux-en-Y anastomoses. However even in these cases, combined procedures with interventional radiology, or implementation of enteroscopy and EUS-guided approaches now means very few patients ultimately require surgical revision.
