Title: Basic fibroblast growth factor inhibits aortic valvular interstitial cells calcification via Notch1 pathway.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an active pathological process mediated by abnormal activation and transdifferentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). The present study aims to investigate the function and underlying mechanism of the basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) on osteogenic differentiation of VICs. Porcine VICs cultured with osteogenic induction medium are supplemented with or without BFGF. Morphology of VICs is identified by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, the cell viability is assessed by the cell counting kit-8 method, and protein and mRNA expression level of osteogenic differentiation markers, including Runx2, osteopontin, and Sp7, are verified by western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. RNA sequencing is used to identify changes in gene profiles. Alizarin Red S staining is used to measure calcium deposition. The results demonstrate that the content of calcium deposition and the expression level of osteogenic markers are downregulated by supplementing BFGF. Notch1 signaling pathway is extracted as a candidate target after bioinformatics analysis by RNA sequencing. The transfection of si-Notch1 abolishes the calcification inhibitory effect of BFGF. Taken together, our findings shed the light on the mechanism and potential therapeutics of BFGF for CAVD.
