Title: [Endoscopic Dilation to Treat One Case of Severe Intestinal Stenosis Caused by Endometriosis].

Abstract: A 46-year-old woman was admitted for repeated abdominal distention and constipation for more than 10 years and further deterioration for 5 years. Colonoscopy showed, in the sigmoid colon, nodular neoplasm protruding into the cavity, resulting in local intestinal stenosis, through which the endoscopy could not pass. Pathological findings of the biopsy sample revealed changes caused by intestinal endometriosis. The patient underwent multiple endoscopic dilatation treatments in our hospital and the interval between recurrences of intestinal stenosis was extended from 6 months to 4 years. Intestinal endometriosis can cause repeated intractable stenosis caused by the infiltration of ectopic glands in the intestinal wall, which usually requires surgical intervention. Herein, we report a case of severe intestinal stenosis caused by endometriosis in the sigmoid colon. Good results have been achieved through endoscopic dilatation treatment. This case suggests that endoscopic dilation has good application value in the treatment of this kind of disease, which needs further exploration and promotion.
