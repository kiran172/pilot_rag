Title: Detecting elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure from simultaneously measured femoral pressure waveform and electrocardiogram.

Abstract: Objective.Instantaneous, non-invasive evaluation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) would have significant value in the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure. A new approach called cardiac triangle mapping (CTM) has been recently proposed, which can provide a non-invasive estimate of LVEDP. We hypothesized that a hybrid machine-learning (ML) method based on CTM can instantaneously identify an elevated LVEDP using simultaneously measured femoral pressure waveform and electrocardiogram (ECG).Approach.We studied 46 patients (Age: 39-90 (66.4 ± 9.9), BMI: 20.2-36.8 (27.6 ± 4.1), 12 females) scheduled for clinical left heart catheterizations or coronary angiograms at University of Southern California Keck Medical Center. Exclusion criteria included severe mitral/aortic valve disease; severe carotid stenosis; aortic abnormalities; ventricular paced rhythm; left bundle branch and anterior fascicular blocks; interventricular conduction delay; and atrial fibrillation. Invasive LVEDP and pressure waveforms at the iliac bifurcation were measured using transducer-tipped Millar catheters with simultaneous ECG. LVEDP range was 9.3-40.5 mmHg. LVEDP = 18 mmHg was used as cutoff. Random forest (RF) classifiers were trained using data from 36 patients and blindly tested on 10 patients.Main results.Our proposed ML classifier models accurately predict true LVEDP classes using appropriate physics-based features, where the most accurate demonstrates 100.0% (elevated) and 80.0% (normal) success in predicting true LVEDP classes on blind data.Significance.We demonstrated that physics-based ML models can instantaneously classify LVEDP using information from femoral waveforms and ECGs. Although an invasive validation, the required ML inputs can be potentially obtained non-invasively.
