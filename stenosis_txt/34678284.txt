Title: Impact of Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Asian Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Little is known about the incidence of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) and its impact after transcatheter aortic valve replacement with self-expanding valves in an Asian population. We aimed to assess postprocedural effective orifice area with standardized methods and the impact of PPM on midterm outcomes after CoreValve or Evolut R (Medtronic) implantation in an Asian population.
METHODS: Among 201 consecutive patients undergoing CoreValve or Evolut R implantation, PPM was assessed at 30 days and defined based on core laboratory measured indexed effective orifice area as severe (less than 0.65 cm2/m2) or moderate (0.65 to 0.85 cm2/m2). Multivariable regression models were utilized to examine predictors of PPM as well as mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure at midterm follow-up.
RESULTS: Moderate and severe PPM were observed after self-expanding valves in 37 patients (18.4%) and 3 patients (1.5%), respectively. These 40 patients were included in the PPM group. Predictors of PPM included female sex, larger body surface area, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. At midterm (median 30.4 months; interquartile range, 17 to 57.8) follow-up, patients with PPM had an increased risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 3.53; P = .027), cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 3.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 10.99; P = .043), and rehospitalization for heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 5.17; P = .025).
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-prosthesis mismatch was associated with higher midterm mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure in an Asian population. The expected postprocedural effective orifice area for any given valve size may be helpful in preprocedural decision making to avoid PPM.
