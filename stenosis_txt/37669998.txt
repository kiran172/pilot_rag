Title: Interaction of dietary patterns with rs28362491 on severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients undergoing coronary angiography.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most important cardiovascular diseases. Lifestyle and genetic factors play important roles in the development of CAD. The aim of the study is to examine the interaction of dietary patterns and genes on the likelihood of abnormal lipid profile and coronary artery stenosis in Iranians undergoing coronary angiography. This cross-sectional study was performed on 440 patients who underwent coronary angiography. The factor analysis method was used to extract dietary patterns. Commercial kits have been used to assess biochemical parameters. The detection of the rs28362491 genotype was carried out by the method of restriction fragment length polymorphism. Traditional (TDP) and western dietary pattern (WDP) were extracted. We observed an interaction of adherence to TDP and rs28362491 on the odds of having a high Gensini score. These interactions indicated that higher adherence to TDP was associated with higher odds of having a high Gensini score for patients with DD genotype than for those with II genotype. (OR 2.33, 95%CI 1.00-5.44; P = 0.05). These interactions remained statistically significant even after confounder variables. We observed an interaction between higher adherence to TDP and rs28362491 variants on the odds of high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P = 0.04) in the unadjusted model. We found a significant interaction of this polymorphism and higher adherence to WDP on the odds of having a high Gensini score in the unadjusted model (P = 0.04). This study provides a basis for future research on NF-KB1 gene and diet interaction. More large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to validate these findings.
