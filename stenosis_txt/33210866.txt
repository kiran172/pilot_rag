Title: [Related risk factors of PET/CT detected coronary microvascular disease in patients with chest pain and no obstructive coronary artery disease].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the related factors of the coronary microvascular disease (CMD) diagnosed with positron emission tomography(PET)/CT in patients with chest pain and without obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCA). Methods: This study was a single-center retrospective cross-sectional study. Consecutive patients with chest pain and NOCA on coronary angiography, who underwent PET/CT quantitative myocardial blood flow measurements at TEDA International Cardiovascular Hospital from August 2018 to January 2019, were enrolled for this study. The diagnostic criteria for NOCA was the absence of coronary artery diameter stenosis ≥50% on coronary angiography. Clinical data, global left ventricular myocardial blood flow on stress and rest, and the coronary flow reserve (CFR) were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to CFR. Patients with CFR&lt;2 were defined as CMD group, and the rest were classified as control group. Pearson correlation analysis and Logistics regression analysis were used for exploring the risk factors of the CMD. Results: A total of 66 patients, with an mean age of (56.7±9.6) years, were included in the study, including 41 females (62%). There were 20 patients with CMD (30%). Body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in CND group than in control group ((28.1±3.6) kg/m2 vs. (25.6±3.5) kg/m2, P=0.01). Total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were also significantly higher in CMD group than in control group ((4.89±1.03) mmol/L vs. (4.30±1.02) mmol/L and (3.23±0.81) mmol/L vs. (2.71±0.95) mmol/L respectively, P=0.038). Pearson correlation analysis showed that CFR was moderately correlated with BMI (r=-0.45, P&lt;0.001), and was weakly correlated with TC and LDL-C (r=-0.271 and r=-0.280, respectively, P&lt;0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that BMI (the risk of CMD increased by 1.528 times for every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI, 95%CI 1.083-5.897, P&lt;0.05) was an independent risk factor of CMD after adjusted by gender, hypertension, diabetic mellites and LDL-C. Conclusion: For patients with NOCA and chest pain, high BMI is independent risk factor of CMD diagnosed by PET/CT.
