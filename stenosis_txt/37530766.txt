Title: Endoscopic intraluminal treatment of early biliary complications after orthotopic liver transplantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To improve the outcomes after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) followed by early biliary complications via endoscopic bilioduodenal stenting.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study enrolled 41 patients with early biliary complications within 90 days after OLT. All patients underwent endoscopic treatment between 2001 and 2021. There were 34 (82.9%) men and 7 (17.1%) women aged 48.5±12.5 years. Strictures and failure of biliary anastomosis occurred in 33 (80.5%) and 8 (19.5%) patients, respectively.
RESULTS: After endoscopic treatment, serum bilirubin normalized in 3.3±0.86 days in patients with strictures (23.7 (16.4; 34.5) mmol/l, p&lt;0.001). Diameter of lobar ducts as a criterion of biliary hypertension was normalized after 4 (2.5; 5.5) days (p&lt;0.001). Bile leakage after stenting with a covered self-expanding stent regressed in all 7 patients after 3 (2; 5) days. In 1 patient, bile output through the drainage stopped in 8 days after bilioduodenal stenting with a plastic stent.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic bilioduodenal stenting is always effective and minimally invasive treatment after liver transplantation followed by early biliary complications (failure or stricture of anastomosis). This approach minimizes postoperative complications (9.8%) that do not require surgical intervention (Clavien-Dindo grade I).
