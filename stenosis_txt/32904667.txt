Title: Totally laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double tract reconstruction: outcomes of 37 consecutive cases.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Proximal gastrectomy is an alternative treatment modality for gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach. Though several reconstruction methods have been introduced, there is no standardization. We investigated the outcomes of laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double tract reconstruction (LPG-DTR).
AIM: To investigate the outcomes of LPG-DTR.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated 37 patients who underwent curative LPG with DTR between December 2013 and December 2018. Less than half of the proximal stomach was laparoscopically resected. We performed LPG-DTR after resection.
RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were included in this study, 25 (70%) of whom were male and 12 (30%) of whom were female. Overall, 31 (83.7%) patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer, 5 (13.5%) with gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and 1 (2.8%) with leiomyoma. There were 3 (9.6%) complications. However, there were no complications of grade 3 or above. We did not observe postoperative mortality or recurrence after surgery. All patients underwent postoperative endoscopic surveillance successfully. None of the patients had postoperative reflux esophagitis or stenosis. The body weight and hemoglobin levels of the patients were lowest 12 months after surgery and gradually increased thereafter. Similarly, their vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels were lowest 6 months after surgery. However, iron been increased after surgery until 24 months after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: LPG-DTR is a favorable treatment modality for gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach.
