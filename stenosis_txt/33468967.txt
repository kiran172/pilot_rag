Title: [A Resected Case of Metachronous Solitary Metastasis of Jejunum after Surgery of Triple Colon Cancers].

Abstract: A 68-year-old man underwent partial colectomy and double-barrel colostomy for an obstructive colon cancer of the splenic flexure at another hospital 10 years before. He was referred to us with an examination of anemia pointed out in human dock. Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the tumor occupied the remnant descending colon. We performed remnant left hemicolectomy and diagnosed as triple colon cancers. Six months after the initial operation, he was admitted to us with the chief complaints of abdominal fulness and vomit. Abdominal CT and radiologic enteroclysis after decompression used the ileus tube revealed complete stenosis at the small intestine. We performed surgery with a suspicion of obstruction of the small intestine. The tumor, 5 cm in diameter, occupied the jejunum was detected, and partial resection of the jejunum was performed. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as solitary metastasis of jejunum.
