Title: Association of aortic distensibility and left ventricular function in patients with stenotic bicuspid aortic valve and preserved ejection fraction: a CMR study.

Abstract: To determine the relationship between aortic distensibility and left ventricular (LV) remodeling, myocardial strain and blood biomarkers in patients with stenotic bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and preserved ejection fraction (EF) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). 43 stenotic BAV patients were prospectively selected for 3.0 T CMR. Patients were divided into LV remodeling group (LV mass/volume ≥ 1.15, n = 21) and non-remodeling group (LV mass/volume &lt; 1.15, n = 22). Clinical characteristics, biochemical data including cardiac troponin T(cTNT), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) were noted. Distensibility of middle ascending aorta (mid-AA) and proximal descending aorta, LV structural and functional parameters, global and regional myocardial strain were measured. Compared to non-remodeling group, LV remodeling group had significantly decreased LV global strain (radial: 26.04 ± 8.70% vs. 32.92 ± 7.81%, P = 0.009; circumferential: - 17.20 ± 3.38% vs. - 19.65 ± 2.34%, P = 0.008; longitudinal: - 9.13 ± 2.34% vs. - 11.63 ± 1.99%, P &lt; 0.001) and decreased mid-AA distensibility (1.22 ± 0.24 10-3 mm/Hg vs 1.60 ± 0.41 10-3 mm/Hg, P = 0.001). In addition, mid-AA distensibility was independently associated with LV remodeling (β =  - 0.282, P = 0.003), and it was also significantly correlated with LV global strain (radial: r = 0.392, P = 0.009; circumferential: r =  - 0.348, P = 0.022; longitudinal: r =  - 0.333, P = 0.029), cTNT (r =  - 0.333, P = 0.029) and NT-proBNP (r =  - 0.440, P = 0.003). In this cohort with stenotic BAV and preserved EF, mid-AA distensibility is found significantly associated with LV remolding, which encouraging to better understand mechanism of ventricular vascular coupling.
