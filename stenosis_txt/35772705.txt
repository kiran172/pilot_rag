Title: Characteristics and Management of Dilated Mastoid Emissary Veins: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The mastoid emissary vein (MEV) describes a transosseous connection between the sigmoid dural venous sinus and the suboccipital venous plexus. In cases of outflow stenosis or malformation, the MEV may become dilated and a source of pulsatile tinnitus (PT) amenable to treatment. We describe a case of PT secondary to MEV treated successfully via endovascular coil embolization and conduct a systematic review of the literature.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review without meta-analysis of studies involving management of dilated MEV on January 14, 2022, and describe a case of PT secondary to an enlarged MEV treated via coil embolization.
RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were selected for full review. Reports identified MEV presenting as PT in 60% (12 of 20) of cases, intraoperative hemorrhage in mastoid surgery in 15% (3 of 20), a compressive scalp mass in 10% (2 of 20), and thrombophlebitis, facial swelling, or an incidental finding in 5% (1 of 20) each. Forty-five percent (9 of 20) underwent treatment, with all experiencing symptom resolution or improvement. Surgery included transvenous coil embolization in 33.3% (3 of 9), flap reconstruction in 22.2% (2 of 9), and surgical packing, ligation, and thrombectomy in 11.1% (1 of 9) each. Dilated MEV was reported concurrently with impeded drainage pathways in 35% (7 of 20) of reports.
CONCLUSIONS: Dilated MEV has been reported as an etiology of pulsatile tinnitus and appears amenable to treatment via open and endovascular means. Endovascular coil embolization appears to offer effective symptom resolution, however, available literature exists only in case reports and small series. Further investigation is highly warranted.
