Title: Shockwave lithotripsy for treatment of calcific renal artery stenosis after an inadequately expanded renal artery stent.

Abstract: Renal artery calcifications can be associated with insufficient stent expansion and in-stent restenosis. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) uses shockwaves to disrupt calcium and treat calcific renal in-stent restenosis. Herein, the authors present a case to treat resistant reno-vascular hypertension and in-stent restenosis of an inadequately expanded renal stent in a patient with severe calcific renal artery stenosis. The patient was treated with IVL and stent dilation. The patient was followed subsequently, and her home blood pressure was well controlled on anti-hypertensive medications. In conclusion, IVL promises pronounced success in the modification of severely calcified renal artery lesions and can be used to treat renal artery stenosis even in the context of inadequately expanding renal artery stents.
