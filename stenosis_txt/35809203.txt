Title: Supravalvular mitral stenosis in a cat: clinical, diagnostic and pathologic findings.

Abstract: The present case report describes a rare case of a cardiac abnormality diagnosed as Supravalvular Mitral Stenosis in an asymptomatic cat. An 11-years old cat was presented for orthopedic evaluation, and during general clinical examination a heart rate of 180Â bpm and left diastolic cardiac murmur grade III-IV/VI, between the mitral and aortic foci, were found. Radiographic, echocardiographic, angiocardiographic and post-mortem (the patient died during anesthesia performed to diagnose the orthopedic condition) magnetic resonance and pathologic findings are reported herein.
