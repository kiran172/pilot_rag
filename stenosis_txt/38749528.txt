Title: Scimitar syndrome with vein stenosis in an infant.

Abstract: Scimitar syndrome is characterised by right lung hypoplasia and abnormal pulmonary venous return, known as the 'scimitar vein'. We report the case of an infant girl with scimitar syndrome who developed a severe respiratory distress mimicking asthma. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was diagnosed, attributed to scimitar vein stenosis and a left-to-right shunt. Scimitar vein stenosis, a rare complication of scimitar syndrome, can lead to severe PH, highlighting the importance of prompt management in specialised care centres.
