Title: Clinico-radiological correlation of magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Although several studies have reported imaging findings associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), less is known about the correlation between imaging findings and IIH-related symptoms or signs. Our study aimed to determine if clinical features of IIH are correlated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on consecutive patients presenting at the neuro-ophthalmology department over the last 15 years. All patients diagnosed with IIH were identified and those with available MRI were included in the final analysis. All MRI images were reviewed by a neuroradiologist blinded to the presenting symptoms and signs. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the correlation between the MRI findings with each clinical symptom or sign.
RESULTS: Thirty-one out of 88 patients with the initial diagnosis of IIH had MRI available and were included in the study. Significant correlations were observed between colour vision and amount of perineural fluid around the optic nerve on MRI (r = - 0.382; p = 0.004), disc assessment and intraocular optic nerve protrusion (r = 0.364; p = 0.004), disc assessment and perineural fluid around the optic nerve (r = 0.276; p = 0.033) and disc assessment and venous sinus stenosis (r = 0.351; p = 0.009).
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights correlations between imaging and clinical findings of IIH. MRI findings in IIH may be useful in ruling out ominous causes of intracranial pressure and risk stratifying ophthalmologic intervention and management of patients with headaches possibly due to IIH.
