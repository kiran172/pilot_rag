Title: Complex Aortic Arch Atherosclerosis in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation.

Abstract: AIM: Aortic arch atherosclerosis, particularly complex aortic arch plaques (CAPs), is an important source of cerebral emboli. CAPs and atrial fibrillation (AF) often co-exist; however, the prevalence and risk of CAPs in acute ischemic stroke patients with AF is unclear.
METHODS: In patients with acute ischemic stroke with non-valvular AF admitted to Jichi Medical University Hospital during April 2016 to September 2019, we retrospectively evaluated the presence of CAPs on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).
RESULTS: CAPs were observed in 41 (38.7 %) of 106 patients with non-valvular AF. Older age, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, higher levels of glycohemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), higher CHADS<sub>2</sub> and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores, and intracranial or carotid artery stenosis were more frequently observed in CAPs-positive than in CAPs-negative patients. In multivariable analyses, older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.2 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.24; P＜0.0001), diabetes mellitus (OR: 4.7; 95%CI: 1.27-17.35; P＜0.05), and low HDL-C (OR: 0.95 per 1 mg/dl increase; 95%CI: 0.92-0.99; P＜0.01) were independent risk factors for CAPs. The prevalence of CAPs was age-dependent, and there was a significantly higher risk in patients aged either 75-84 years or ＞84 years than in those aged ＜65 (OR: 7.6; 95%CI: 1.50-38.62, and OR: 32.1; 95%CI: 5.14-200.11, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Even in patients with ischemic stroke with non-valvular AF, concomitant CAPs should be considered in older individuals and those who have diabetes or low HDL-C.
