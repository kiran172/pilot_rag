Title: Long-Term Results of Surgical Treatment for Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is a rare disease of the lower limbs, mainly affecting young patients, due to extrinsic compression of the neurovascular bundle at the popliteal fossa. The aim of this study was to describe our experience during a median 15-year period.
METHODS: Patients treated for PAES in our institution from 1979 to 2024 were included. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 47 patients with a total of 78 limbs were treated. Duplex ultrasound with active maneuvers was performed in all limbs (100%). Angiography was performed in almost all patients (97.4%), computed tomography angiography in 56 (71.8%), and magnetic resonance angiography in 22 (28.2%). Concerning surgical treatment, musculotendinous section was performed in 60 limbs (76.9%), and autologous venous bypass was achieved in 18 limbs (23.1%). The rates for freedom from target lesion revascularization-meaning that no significant stenosis or occlusion during follow-up required revascularization-and 15-year primary patency were 92.4% and 98%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Long-term results of surgical treatment for PAES seem to be very satisfying. Myotomy with or without arterial reconstruction using venous bypass can lead to good patency at 15 years of follow-up.
