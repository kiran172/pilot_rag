Title: Impact of Albuminuria on the Prognosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: The impact of preoperative albuminuria on the prognosis after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has not been studied. A total of 228 patients who underwent TAVI for severe aortic stenosis (AS) and for whom preoperative urinary data was available were retrospectively investigated. Patients were divided into two groups according to the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR): high (ACRâ‰¥ 30 mg/g) and low (ACR<30 mg/g). The urinary total protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) and dipstick proteinuria were also evaluated. The primary outcome was the composite outcome of all-cause death and readmission for heart failure. In total, 117 patients had a high ACR and 111 patients had a low ACR. During the median follow-up period of 467 days, patients with a high ACR had a higher incidence of the primary outcome than those with a low ACR (p<0.001). Patients with a high PCR or positive dipstick proteinuria were also at a higher risk for the primary outcome (p<0.001 and p=0.008, respectively). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis showed a high ACR was independently associated with a primary outcome (hazard ratio, 4.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.84-13.49; p=0.002). In conclusion, preoperative albuminuria is an independent predictor of cardiac events in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI.
