Title: Progression of a Rare Disease, Takayasu Arteritis, With Hematologic and Gastrointestinal Manifestations: A Four-Year Follow-Up Study.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a heterogeneous disease whose presentation and progression have not yet been well described. An elderly female was diagnosed with TA after presenting with bilateral arm claudication, elevated ESR, and bilateral subclavian arterial stenosis. In the first two years after diagnosis, she was diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and alpha thalassemia minor. For the next two years, she presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, three oozing Dieulafoy lesions, and eosinophilic esophagitis. As we observed, TA can have an unusual and unpredictable progression. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach and clinical surveillance are paramount.
