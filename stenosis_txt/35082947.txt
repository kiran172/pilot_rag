Title: Acute Limb Ischemia in a COVID-19 Patient: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 63-year-old man with a confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 and having complaints of severe pain and paralysis in his right lower limb was transported to our hospital in an ambulance. Because of thrombosis, a computed tomography angiogram revealed the occlusion of right common iliac artery and stenosis of abdominal aorta. Emergency angiography and thrombectomy were performed; after surgery, the patient was managed in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis for renal failure. However, on postoperative day 7, thrombosis recurred, and he died because of multiple organ failure.
