Title: N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels pre-transcatheter aortic valve implantation and relationship with long-term outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Blood levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has been suggested as a future guidance tool for the selection of patients for aortic valve replacement. This study aimed to examine how levels of NT-proBNP pre-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with one-year rates of heart failure (HF) admission and mortality following TAVI.
METHODS: With Danish nationwide registries, we identified all patients undergoing TAVI from 2014 to 2021 who had at least one recorded NT-pro-BNP measurement within one year before TAVI. Patients were compared by quartiles of pre-TAVI NT-proBNP: quartile 4 (high NT-proBNP group) vs quartile 1-3 (low NT-proBNP group). Comparisons of all-cause mortality and HF-admissions were conducted using Kaplan-Meier analysis, cumulative incidence, and Cox analysis, as appropriate.
RESULTS: We identified 1,140 patients undergoing first-time TAVI with a recorded NT-pro-BNP; 846 (74.2 %) with a low NT-proBNP (<420 pmol/L) (55.0 % male, median age 81 year) and 294 (25.8 %) with a high NT-proBNP (≥420 pmol/L) (53.1 % male, median age 82 year). A high versus low NT-proBNP was associated with increased one-year cumulative incidence of HF-admissions (9.1 % vs. 23.1 %, adjusted HR 2.00 [95 % CI, 1.40-2.85]) and all-cause mortality (6.0 % vs. 14.6 %, adjusted HR 1.95 [95 % CI: 1.24-3.07]). A high NT-proBNP was associated with higher rates of outcomes irrespective of previously known atrial fibrillation, HF, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension.
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TAVI, a baseline NT-proBNP ≥ 420 pmol/L was associated with increased one-year rates of HF-admission and mortality post-TAVI and may be utilized to identify a high-risk population.
