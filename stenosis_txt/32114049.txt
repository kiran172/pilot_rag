Title: Valve-in-Valve After Edwards INTUITY Valve Implantation in Small Aortic Annulus.

Abstract: The Edwards INTUITY aortic valve has in recent years played a significant role in facilitating surgical aortic valve replacement. Owing to the excellent hemodynamic characteristics and relatively new usage of this bioprosthetic aortic valve, the structural valve deterioration is an extremely rare complication; therefore, the treatment options of degenerated INTUITY valve with stenotic features have not been studied. We report the feasibility and safety of transcatheter valve-in-valve treatment for degenerated, stenotic INTUITY valve using the balloon expanding transcatheter aortic valve SAPIEN 3 in a small aortic annulus.
