Title: A High Resolution MRI Study of the Relationship Between Plaque Enhancement and Perforator Stroke after Stenting for Symptomatic Vertebrobasilar Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perforator stroke is one of the most common complications of vertebrobasilar arterial stenting. We investigated whether perforator stroke after vertebrobasilar arterial stenting is associated with plaque enhancement in patients with severe vertebrobasilar artery stenosis.
METHODS: We studied patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar arterial stenosis who underwent stenting from January 2017 to July 2020. Patients who underwent high resolution magnetic resonance imaging were recruited among them. Demographic data, risk factors of atherosclerosis, procedure details, and characteristics of imaging were extracted from electronic health records and imaging data. Plaque features were investigated by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: 136 patients were enrolled in this study, 39 of whom fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 18 patients (46.2%) had obvious plaque enhancement among the 39 patients, and 21 (53.8%) had plaque non-enhancement. 21 patients (53.8%) had diffuse distribution, and 22 patients (56.4%) had irregular plaques surface. Patients were divided into plaque enhanced and plaque non-enhanced groups according to the degree of plaque enhancement. Clinical characteristics and other plaque features were similar between two groups. Procedure-related perforator stroke was identified in 4 patients (10.3%). Patients with plaque enhancement were more likely to have perforator stroke after stenting compared with those with plaque non-enhancement (22.2% versus 0%, P = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: Plaque enhancement in high resolution magnetic resonance imaging may be associated with perforator stroke after vertebrobasilar artery stenting.
