Title: A Propensity-Matched Comparison of Ischemic Brain Lesions on Postprocedural MRI in Endovascular versus Open Carotid Artery Reconstruction.

Abstract: (1) Study purpose: The aim of our prospective single-center, matched case-control study was to compare the number and volume of acute ischemic brain lesions following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) versus carotid artery stenting (CAS) using a propensity-matched design. (2) Methods: Carotid bifurcation plaques were analyzed by using VascuCAP software on CT angiography (CTA) images. The number and volume of acute and chronic ischemic brain lesions were assessed on MRI scans taken 12-48 h after the procedures. Propensity score-based matching was performed at a 1:1 ratio to compare the ischemic lesions on postinterventional MR. (3) Results: A total of 107 patients (CAS, N = 33; CEA, N = 74) were included in the study. There were significant differences in smoking (p = 0.003), total calcification plaque volume (p = 0.004), and lengths of the lesion (p = 0.045) between the CAS and CEA groups. Propensity score matching resulted in 21 matched pairs of patients. Acute ischemic brain lesions were detected in ten patients (47.6%) of the matched CAS group and in three patients (14.2%) in the matched CEA group (p = 0.02). The volume of acute ischemic brain lesions was significantly larger (p = 0.04) in the CAS group than in the CEA group. New ischemic brain lesions were not associated with neurological symptoms in either group. (4) Conclusions: Procedure-related new acute ischemic brain lesions occurred significantly more frequently in the propensity-matched CAS group.
