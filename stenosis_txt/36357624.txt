Title: Normalization of low frontal regional cerebral oxygenation after evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma in a patient with bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology is frequently used to measure regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>). The measurement of rSO<sub>2</sub> has diverse range of clinical application for its easy bed-side applicability, continuous monitoring, interpretation and valuable information on cerebral oxygenation. However, it also has few technical limitations; absorption by skull tissues, presence of hematomas, and other pigments such as melanin, bilirubin can affect the rSO<sub>2</sub> measurements and thus interfere with the accuracy of monitoring. We report a case wherein low values of frontal rSO<sub>2</sub> normalized after evacuation of bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal (FTP) chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) in a patient with bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis.
