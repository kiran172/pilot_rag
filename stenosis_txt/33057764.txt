Title: Metabolomic profiling of patients with high gradient aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIM: Aim of our study was to evaluate metabolic changes in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) before and after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and to assess whether this procedure reverses metabolomic alterations.
METHODS: 188 plasma metabolites of 30 patients with severe high-gradient aortic valve stenosis (pre-TAVR and 6 weeks post-TAVR) as well as 20 healthy controls (HC) were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Significantly altered metabolites were then correlated to an extensive patient database of clinical parameters at the time of measurement.
RESULTS: Out of the determined metabolites, 26.6% (n = 50) were significantly altered in patients with AS pre-TAVR compared to HC. In detail, 5/40 acylcarnitines as well as 10/42 amino acids and biogenic amines were mainly increased in AS, whereas 29/90 glycerophospholipids and 6/15 sphingomyelins were mainly reduced. In the post-TAVR group, 10.1% (n = 19) of metabolites showed significant differences when compared to pre-TAVR. Moreover, we found nine metabolites revealing reversible concentration levels. Correlation with clinically important parameters revealed strong correlations between sphingomyelins and cholesterol (r = 0.847), acylcarnitines and brain natriuretic peptide (r = 0.664) and showed correlation of acylcarnitine with an improvement of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (r = - 0.513) and phosphatidylcholines with an improvement of LV mass (r = - 0.637).
CONCLUSION: Metabolic profiling identified significant and reversible changes in circulating metabolites of patients with AS. The correlation of circulating metabolites with clinical parameters supports the use of these data to identify novel diagnostic as well as prognostic markers for disease screening, pathophysiological studies as well as patient surveillance.
