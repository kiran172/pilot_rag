Title: Insight on Efficacy of Renal Artery Denervation for Refractory Hypertension with Chronic Kidney Diseases: A Long-Term Follow-Up of 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure.

Abstract: AIMS: To explore the long-term efficacy and safety of renal denervation in patients with RHT and CKD, a post hoc analysis of eGFR subgroups was completed.
METHODS: Fifty-four patients with refractory hypertension with chronic kidney disease were treated with RDN and enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into three groups according to eGFR: eGFR 46-90 ml/min group, eGFR 15-45 ml/min group, and eGFR <15 ml/min group. The planned follow-up period was 48 months to assess 24 h ambulatory blood pressure, renal function, type of antihypertensive medication, and RDN complications.
RESULTS: The ablation sites of the GFR 46-90 ml/min group and GFR 15-45 ml/min group were 32.57 ± 2.99 and 29.53 ± 5.47, respectively. No complications occurred in the GFR 46-90 ml/min group. The GFR<15 ml/min group was treated with 27.07 ± 5.59  ablation. Renal artery dissection occurred in each group of GFR 15-45 ml/min and GFR <15 ml/min. And renal stent implantation artery was performed on these two patients. No severe renal artery stenosis occurred. There were no significant differences in Scr and eGFR between the three groups at each follow-up point. Compared with baseline, SBP was significantly of each group decreased to varying degrees at each follow-up time point. SBP decreased most in the GFR 46-90 ml/min group. Compared with baseline, the type of antihypertensive drugs used in the GFR46-90 ml/min group decreased significantly except for 36 and 48 months. At 48 months' postadmission, there was a significant decrease in the type of antihypertensive medication used in the GFR15-45 ml/min group, and there was no significant decrease in the type of antihypertensive medication used in the GFR<15 ml/min group.
CONCLUSIONS: RDN can safely reduce SBP in CKD patients combined with RHT for 48 months, with the most pronounced reduction in the GFR15-45 ml/min group. The variety of antihypertensive drugs was significantly reduced after RDN. This was particularly evident in patients with GFR 15-45 ml/min.
