Title: Development and Validation of a Flow-Dependent Endothelialized 3D Model of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease.

Abstract: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a major cause of stroke globally, with mechanisms presumed to be shared with atherosclerosis in other vascular regions. Due to the scarcity of relevant animal models, testing biological hypotheses specific to ICAD is challenging. We developed a workflow to create patient-specific models of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) from neuroimaging studies, such as CT angiography. These models, which can be endothelialized with human endothelial cells and subjected to flow forces, provide a reproducible ICAD model. Using imaging from the SAMMPRIS clinical trial, we validated this novel model. Computational fluid dynamics flow velocities correlated strongly with particle-derived flow, regardless of stenosis degree. Post-stenotic flow disruption varied with stenosis severity. Single-cell RNA-seq identified flow-dependent endothelial gene expression and specific endothelial subclusters in diseased MCA segments, including upregulated genes linked to atherosclerosis. Confocal microscopy revealed flow-dependent changes in endothelial cell proliferation and morphology in vessel segments related to stenosis. This platform, rooted in the specific anatomy of cerebral circulation, enables detailed modeling of ICAD lesions and pathways. Given the high stroke risk associated with ICAD and the lack of effective treatments, these experimental models are crucial for developing new ICAD-related stroke therapies.
