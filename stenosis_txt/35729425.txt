Title: Diagnostic accuracy of coronary computed tomography angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) in patients before liver transplantation using CT-FFR machine learning algorithm.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Liver transplantation (LT) is associated with high stress on the cardiovascular system. Ruling out coronary artery disease (CAD) is an important part of evaluation for LT. The aim of our study was to assess whether CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) allows for differentiation of hemodynamically significant and non-significant coronary stenosis in patients evaluated for LT.
METHODS: In total, 201 patients undergoing LT evaluation were included in the study. The patients received coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to rule out CAD and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) to further evaluate coronary lesions found in CCTA if a significant (≥ 50 % on CCTA) stenosis was suspected. CT-FFR was computed from CCTA datasets using a machine learning-based algorithm and compared to ICA as a standard of reference. Coronary lesions with CT-FFR ≤ 0.80 were defined as hemodynamically significant.
RESULTS: In 127 of 201 patients (63%), an obstructive CAD was ruled out by CCTA. In the remaining 74 patients (37%), at least one significant stenosis was suspected in CCTA. Compared to ICA, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the CT-FFR measurements were 71% (49-92%), 90% (82-98%), 67% (45-88%), and 91% (84-99%), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was 85% (85-86%). In 69% of cases (52 of 75 lesions), additional analysis by CT-FFR correctly excluded the hemodynamic significance of the stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based CT-FFR seems to be a very promising noninvasive approach for exclusion of hemodynamic significant coronary stenoses in patients undergoing evaluation for LT and could help to reduce the rate of invasive coronary angiography in this high-risk population.
