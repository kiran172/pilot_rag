Title: Aortopulmonary artery fistula: A rare complication of balloon dilatation of the pulmonary artery.

Abstract: Acquired aortopulmonary fistula (APF) in the setting of repaired congenital heart disease is extremely rare but potentially fatal, so timely diagnosis and treatment are critical. We present a case of an 8-year-old female with a history of complex Taussig-Bing anomaly, who underwent an arterial switch procedure with LeCompte maneuver and ventricular septal defect closure early in life. The patient developed neopulmonary stenosis and branch pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis, for which she underwent patch augmentation and balloon dilatation of the left PA. The patient presented with a fistula between the ascending aorta and the left branch PA, confirmed by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. She underwent repair of the APF with a homograft patch reconstruction of the ascending aorta.
