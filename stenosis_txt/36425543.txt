Title: [Urological emergencies in a regional hospital in Senegal: a 20-month retrospective study].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: urological emergencies are diverse and varied, and are frequently encountered in urological practices. The purpose of this work was to study the epidemiological features and management of urological emergencies at the regional hospital of Kolda, Senegal.
METHODS: we conducted a retrospective and descriptive study collecting data from the medical records of all patients admitted as a urological emergency for 20 months (January 2020 and August 31, 2021).
RESULTS: urological emergencies accounted for 3.6% of admissions to the Emergency Department and for 20.4% of urological consultations. The average age of patients was 51.9 Â± 21.5 years, ranging from 1 to 98 years. Urinary retention was the most common urological emergency, observed in 249 cases (57.3%), followed by urogenital infections 89 (20.5%). Renal colic affected 48 (11%) of patients. Emergency management was based on urinary catheterization, which was performed in 193 patients (44.3%). The most common surgical procedures were suprapubic catheterization (42 patients; 51.9%) and emergency scrotal exploration (15 patients; 18.6%).
CONCLUSION: in our context, urological emergencies are dominated by urinary retention due to prostatic disorders and urethral stenosis. Traumatic emergencies are uncommon.
