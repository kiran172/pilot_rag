Title: [Anomalous Origin of Right Coronary Artery with Intramural Course, Aortic Valve Stenosis and Coronary Artery Stenosis:Report of a Case].

Abstract: Anomalous origin of the coronary artery is a rare congenital malformation that can cause myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia in patients with or without atherosclerotic lesions. We present a case of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery stenosis complicated by anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the aortic valve sinus and its intramural course. The patient was a 66-year-old woman who was diagnosed with AS 4 years prior, and scheduled for surgery owing to gradual progression of stenosis. Preoperative coronary angiography revealed an abnormal origin of the RCA, and during the surgery, the RCA was found located within the aortic wall close to the aortotomy. Thus, bypass surgery was performed using a great saphenous vein, to prevent ischemia of the RCA territory. The patient had good intraoperative and postoperative course, and a coronary computed tomography scan clearly showed the reconstructed RCA.
