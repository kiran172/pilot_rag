Title: Transcatheter Mitral Valve-in-Valve Implantation in Pediatric Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter implantation of the Edwards Sapien 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine CA) within the bioprosthetic mitral valve (MV) is an established method of treatment in adults. However, it has not been well studied in the pediatric age group.
METHODS: Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation was attempted in 4 symptomatic pediatric patients with a dysfunctional MV bioprosthesis implanted at an earlier stage due to severe MV stenosis or regurgitation. We reviewed our experience with MV implantation in this cohort.
RESULTS: The mean age and weight of the patients at the time of the procedure were 11.4 years (range: 10-14 years) and 36 kg (range: 31-44 kg), respectively. The transmitral mean gradient dropped from a mean of 19.75 mm Hg (range: 15-22 mm Hg) to a mean of 1 mm Hg (range: 0-3 mm Hg) after the procedure. The mean fluoroscopy time was 55.25 minutes (range: 40-72 minutes), and the mean hospital length of stay was 4 days (range: 3-7 days). The patients' functional class improved from New York Heart Association class IV to class I during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation can be performed safely for dysfunctional bioprosthetic MVs in the pediatric age group with favorable early and midterm outcomes. This procedure offers a viable alternative in patients who have high surgical risk or are deemed unfit for conventional surgery. However, we still recommend a long-term study of this approach in a large cohort, multicentre study.
