Title: Subtotal ureteral substitution with ileum for patients with multiple ureteral stenosis.

Abstract: The use of small bowel for ureteral substitution in patients with ureteral stenosis can, nowadays, be safely performed with a laparoscopic or robotic mini-invasive approach. To date, this technique required a complete substitution of the ureter with ileum. In this work we present our robotic intracorporeal sub-total ureteral substitution preserving the distal part of the ureter with the aim to reduce the risk of vescico-ureteral reflux. We report the case of a 65-years old male with a "functional" right single kidney and multiple recurrent stenosis. Our technique seems to be feasible and safe, no intra or postoperative complication were recorded. At 3 months of follow-up the trans-nephrostomic enhanced CT showed a completely opacification of ileal ureter, thus the nephrostomic tube was removed. At 6 and 12 months the patient was asymptomatic and with a level of serum creatinine 1.9 and 1.6 mg/dL, respectively. In conclusion the sub-total ureteral substitution with ileum can be a safety and effective procedure for patients who require a mandatory preservation of homolateral renal function.
