Title: Outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in older patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis is increasing due to the continuously growing geriatric population. Data on procedural success and mortality of very old patients are sparse, raising the question of when this population may be deemed as "too old even for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)." We, therefore, sought to evaluate the influence of age on outcome after TAVR and the impact of direct implantation.
METHODS: The data of 394 consecutive patients undergoing TF-TAVR were analyzed. Patients were divided into four age groups: ≤75 (group 1, n = 28), 76-80 (group 2, n = 107), 81-85 (group 3, n = 148), and >85 (group 4, n = 111) years. Direct implantation was performed when possible according to current recommendations. Survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Mortality at 30 days and 1 year was not significantly different between the four age groups (3.6 vs. 6.7 vs. 5.4 vs. 2.7% and 7.6 vs. 17 vs. 14.5 vs. 13%m respectively, log-rank p = 0.59). Direct implantation without balloon aortic valvuloplasty was more frequently performed on patients aged >85 vs. ≤85 years (33.3 vs. 14.1%, p < 0.001). the incidence of procedural complications frequently associated with advanced age (stroke, vascular complications) was not significantly increased in group 4.
CONCLUSION: Outcome after TF-TAVR is comparable among different age cohorts, even in very old patients. Direct implantation simplifies the procedure and could therefore play a role in reducing the incidence of peri-interventional complications in patients of advanced age.
