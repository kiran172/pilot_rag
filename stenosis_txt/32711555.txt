Title: Efficacy of acupuncture for treatment of intermittent claudication in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis: protocol for a randomized controlled trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) is a common condition secondary to degenerative changes. Acupuncture may be effective for treating DLSS. However, there is a lack of sufficient evidence showing the efficacy of acupuncture. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for relieving neurogenic claudication in patients with DLSS.
METHODS: A total of 196 patients will be randomly assigned to an acupuncture group or a sham acupuncture group at a ratio of 1:1. Patients will receive 18 sessions of treatment for 6 continuous weeks. The primary outcome will be the change in the Modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score from baseline to week 6. The secondary outcomes will include the change in the scores from baseline for the Numerical Rating Scale, Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire, and Anxiety and Depression Scale. Additionally, the expectancy of acupuncture, blinding, and safety will also be assessed. All analysis will be performed based on intention-to-treat.
DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of neurogenic claudication in patients with DLSS. A limitation of this study is that acupuncturists cannot be blinded according to the characteristics of acupuncture, which may introduce some bias.
