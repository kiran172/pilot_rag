Title: Single-institution outcomes of surgical repair of infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This contemporary study sought to describe the outcomes of patients undergoing biventricular repair of infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on patients with infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection who underwent sutureless technique or conventional repair between 2006 and 2018. Risk factors for survival and post-repair pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) were assessed with Cox regression model. Time-to-event analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates.
RESULTS: This study included 82 consecutive patients with the median age of 21 days (interquartile range, 9-40 days). The median follow-up was 29 months (interquartile range, 12.5-59 months) and was available in 95% of the survivors at the end of the study period in 2019. Overall, 8 deaths (8.5%) occurred in the conventional repair group. There was a trend of higher mortality in the conventional repair group, although it did not reach a statistical difference (P = .2). Postrepair PVS occurred at a median of 2 months (interquartile range, 1.2-3.6 months) postoperatively and all occurred in the conventional repair group. Time-to-event analysis with the event of postrepair PVS showed significantly higher freedom from restenosis in the sutureless technique group (P = .0004). Adjusted hazard ratios from time-dependent Cox model described the association between postrepair PVS and pulmonary venous confluence of antler configuration (hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-5.47; P = .002) and the use of sutureless technique (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.97; P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS: Sutureless technique is associated with a lower risk of postrepair PVS in patients with infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. pulmonary venous confluence configuration of antler appearance appears to be associated with restenosis and mortality.
