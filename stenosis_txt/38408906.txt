Title: Angiographic characteristics of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography at a tertiary hospital in Tanzania.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is an important cause of global burden of disease. There is a paucity of data on the burden and risk factors for CAD in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), despite the rising trends in the shared risk factors across regions. The recent introduction of cardiac catheterization laboratory services in SSA could shed light on the burden of CAD in the region. We aimed to assess the angiographic characteristics among patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG) at a single tertiary care hospital in Tanzania.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review. A total of 728 patients  ≥ 18 years of age who underwent CAG from January 2020 to December 2022 were recruited into the study. Basic demographic variables, risk factors and clinical characteristics including CAG findings were obtained from the registry. In addition, CAG images were retrieved for assessment of angiographic features. The luminal vessel stenosis was assessed based on eyeballing and the degree of obstruction was agreed by two independent and experienced cardiologists. The coronary stenosis of ≥ 50% was considered significant for obstructive CAD. The study was approved by the local ethics committee.
RESULTS: Of patients who were recruited into the study, 384 (52.23%) were female. The study participants had a mean age of 59.46 ± 10.83 standard deviation (SD) and mean body mass index (BMI) of 31.18 kg/m2. The prevalence of CAD of any degree was estimated at 24.43% (34.18% in male, 15.50% in female), while that of obstructive CAD was 18.27%. Forty six percent of those with obstructive CAD had multiple vessel disease (MVD). Nearly 77% of patients were found to have ≥ 50-70% luminal stenosis and while those with ≥ 70% luminal coronary artery stenosis constituted 56.65%. Right coronary artery (RCA) was the most commonly affected vessel, accounting for 36.84% when any vessel disease or 56% when single vessel disease were considered. Being 65 years or older and comorbidity with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were independent risk factors for developing CAD.
CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of obstructive CAD among patients undergoing diagnostic CAG in Tanzania, with male gender preponderance and increasingly higher in older age, often with severe disease. A large, prospective study is needed to provide epidemiological and clinical data for developing a locally-relevant cardio-preventive strategy for CAD intervention in Tanzania.
