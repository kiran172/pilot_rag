Title: Percutaneous coronary intervention in unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis: Mid-term outcomes of a single-center observational study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an appropriate alternative to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for revascularization of unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease in patients with low-to-intermediate anatomic complexity or when the patient refuses CABG even after adequate counselling by heart team. We assessed the safety, in-hospital and mid-term outcomes of ULMCA stenting with drug-eluting stents (DES) in Indian patients.
METHODS: Our study was a retrospective analysis of patients who had undergone ULMCA PCI at a tertiary center, between March 2011 and February 2020. Clinical characteristics, procedural data, and follow-up data were analyzed. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) during the hospital stay and at follow-up. The median follow-up was 2.8 years (interquartile range: 1.5-4.1 years).
RESULTS: 661 patients (mean age, 63.5 ± 10.9 years) had undergone ULMCA PCI. The mean SYNTAX score was 27.9 ± 10.4 and the mean LVEF was 58.0 ± 11.1%. 3-vessel disease and distal lesions were noted in 54% and 70.6% patients, respectively. The incidence of in-hospital MACCE was 1.8% and the MACCE during follow-up was 11.5% (including 48 [8.4%] cardiac deaths). The overall survival rates after one, three, five, and nine years were 94%, 88%, 84%, and 82%, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that age >65 years and high SYNTAX scores were independent predictors of mid to long-term mortality.
CONCLUSION: ULMCA PCI with DES is safe and has acceptable in-hospital and mid-term outcomes among patients with low-to-intermediate SYNTAX score.
