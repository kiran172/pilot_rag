Title: Secondary tracheal distortion in an adult patient after therapy for diphtheria at childhood.

Abstract: We report a rare case of difficult intubation because of trachea deformation after therapy for diphtheria and subsequent tracheostomy at childhood. The patient was admitted to be subjected to a Bentall procedure, because of ascending aorta dilatation. With a detailed preanesthetic assessment and simulation for intubation by using three-dimensional technology, he was successfully intubated and the operation was accomplished uneventfully. 3D-printed models of the difficult airway enhance imaging of difficult anatomy, assist in simulation and management of potentially problematic intubation, and can be a valuable tool when dealing with airways with potential anatomical malformations.
