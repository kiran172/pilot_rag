Title: Unrecognized digestive toxicities of radiation therapy.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to review unrecognized toxicities resulting from radiation therapy of digestive neoplasms. Due to their precocious occurrence, acute toxicities are well-known by radiation oncologist, and their treatment well-established. Thus, acute toxicities will not be described in this review. We will focus on incidence, diagnosis, and management of late and uncommon toxicities occurring in the digestive tract and digestive organs. Prevention, by respecting healthy tissues constraints, is the main tool to reduce incidence of those rare complications. Nonetheless, once installed, late toxicities remain a major burden in terms of quality of life and can even be life threatening. Hence, information and education about their diagnosis and management is important.
