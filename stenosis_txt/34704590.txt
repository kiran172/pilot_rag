Title: Epicardial fat thickness assessment by multi-slice computed tomography for predicting cardiac outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Chronic inflammation promotes aortic valve calcification. It is known that epicardial fat is a source of inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between epicardial fat thickness, cardiac conduction disorders and outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: During a three-year period, 45 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI were recruited to the study. Data were collected retrospectively. Epicardial fat was defined as the adipose tissue between the epicardium and the visceral pericardium. Mean epicardial fat thickness was determined by multi-slice computed tomography, which was performed before the procedure.
RESULTS: The average thickness of epicardial fat was 13.06 ± 3.29 mm. This study failed to reveal a significant correlation between epicardial fat thickness and post-procedural left bundle branch block, right bundle branch block, paravalvular aortic regurgitation and pacemaker implantation rates (p &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study failed to show a significant relationship between epicardial fat thickness, cardiac conduction disorders and outcomes, however further studies with larger sample numbers are required to explore the relationship.
