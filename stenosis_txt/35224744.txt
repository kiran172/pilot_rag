Title: Adult distal hypospadias repair is safe and easy.

Abstract: The success level of hypospadias repair in adults still needs to be established on a more extensive scaled study. Therefore, we conducted this study to document the success level of hypospadias repair in adults. This study presents the results of 620 adult distal hypospadias patients treated with TIPU operation. A retrospective study was performed for adult patients who underwent TIPU operations from February 2016 to September 2020. Patients who had distal hypospadias after the age of 16 were included in our study. The average operation time was between 35 and 65 min (50 min.). Complications developed in 79 (12.7%) patients: 37 urethral fistulas, 24 meatal stenosis, 11 anastomotic stenosis and 7 had a complete failure. In conclusion, primary adult distal hypospadias surgery is safe and easy. The complication rates are similar when compared to the paediatric group. As the surgical experience advances, the success of the operation increases in direct proportion.
