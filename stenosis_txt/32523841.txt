Title: Renal Injury in All-Comers After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) following aortic valve replacement is associated with poor prognosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a novel strategy with a percutaneous approach and early recovery time. We conducted this meta-analysis to compare TAVR to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and their respective renal outcomes. Methods We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using MEDLINE, PUBMED, and Google Scholar databases from their inception till April 6, 2019, and included eight trials comparing TAVR to SAVR in cases that reported AKIs. Results We found a significant reduction in AKI after TAVR compared to SAVR at 30 days [n = 66 vs. n = 160, respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.28-0.51; p: &lt;0.00001, I2 = 0%]. At one year, a trend towards reduced renal failure was noted in the TAVR arm compared to the SAVR arm (n = 74 vs. n = 129, respectively; OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.32-1.01; p = 0.05, I2 = 69%). Conclusion Based on our findings and analysis, we have concluded that TAVR is associated withÂ significantly reduced renal injury at 30 days when compared to SAVR.
