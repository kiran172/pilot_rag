Title: [Interventional bronchoscopy-an overview].

Abstract: In addition to lung function testing and radiological imaging, bronchoscopy is the most important diagnostic tool in patients with bronchial and pulmonary diseases. Through the combined use of flexible and rigid bronchoscopes, nowadays bronchoscopy can be increasingly used as an endoscopic treatment procedure for pulmonary diseases. In cases of thoracic tumors interventional bronchoscopy provides palliative and curative treatment modalities. Apart from bronchoscopic tumor treatment, techniques for endoscopic lung volume reduction have increasingly come into focus in recent years. Furthermore, treatment options for asthma and chronic bronchitis as well as airway stenosis and fistulas are available.
