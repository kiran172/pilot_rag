Title: An Uncommon Cause of Biliary Obstruction in a Patient With Budd-Chiari Syndrome.

Abstract: Biliary varices (BVs) are an infrequent complication of chronic portal hypertension. Most cases of BVs are asymptomatic and are likely underdiagnosed. We present a case of a 34-year-old woman with Budd-Chiari syndrome who was found to have BVs caused by a significant inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis. This case demonstrates that preprocedure imaging for variceal screening should be considered before biliary tract procedures to prevent complications.
