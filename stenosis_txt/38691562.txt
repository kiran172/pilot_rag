Title: Interventricular septal thickness on cardiac computed tomography as a novel risk factor for conduction disturbances in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIMS: We examined whether thickness of the basal muscular interventricular septum (IVS), as measured by pre-procedural computed tomography (CT), could be used to identify the risk of conduction disturbances following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The IVS is a pivotal region of the electrical conduction system of the heart where the atrioventricular conduction axis is located.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Included were 78 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent CT imaging prior to TAVR. The thickness of muscular IVS was measured in the coronal view, in systolic phases, at 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm below the membranous septum (MS). The primary endpoint was a composite of conduction disturbance following TAVR. Conduction disturbances occurred in 24 out of 78 patients (30.8%). Those with conduction disturbances were significantly more likely to have a thinner IVS than those without conduction disturbances at every measured IVS level (2.98 ± 0.52 mm vs. 3.38 ± 0.52 mm, 4.10 ± 1.02 mm vs. 4.65 ± 0.78 mm, 6.11 ± 1.12 mm vs. 6.88 ± 1.03 mm, and 9.72 ± 1.95 mm vs. 10.70 ± 1.55 mm for 1, 2, 5 and 10 mm below MS, respectively, P < 0.05 for all). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that pre-procedural IVS thickness (<4 mm at 2 mm below the MS) was a significant independent predictor of post-procedural conduction disturbance (adjOR 7.387, 95% CI: 2.003-27.244, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Pre-procedural CT assessment of basal IVS thickness is a novel predictive marker for the risk of conduction disturbances following TAVR. The IVS thickness potentially acts as an anatomical barrier protecting the underlying conduction system from mechanical compression during TAVR.
