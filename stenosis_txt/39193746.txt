Title: [Application of free forearm flap in reconstruction of postoperative defect of external nasal malignant tumor].

Abstract: Objective:To investigate the therapeutic effect of free forearm flaps in repairing the postoperative defect of external nasal malignant tumor. Methods:Six patients with nasal malignant tumor were treated with radical operation of external nasal malignant tumor and simultaneous reconstruction of external nasal defects with free forearm flap. Preoperative Allen experiment, ultrasonic Doppler blood flow meter or CT angiography confirmed that the forearm blood vessels were in good condition. Results:The free forearm flaps were obtained from six patients, and completely survived. During the follow-up period of 6-12months, all patients had good external nasal morphology, good nasal function, no nasal obstruction and anterior nostril stenosis, no obvious complications in donor hand and no local cancer recurrence. Conclusion:The free forearm flap is a reliable method to reconstruction the postoperative defect of external nasal malignant tumor, with a high success rate and good recovery of morphology and function recovery.
