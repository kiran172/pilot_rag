Title: Value of rest 18F-FDG myocardial imaging in the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease in Chinese patients with suspected unstable angina: A prospective real-world clinical study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the clinical value of rest 18F-FDG imaging in Chinese patients with non-acute chest pain, normal ECG, negative troponin, and suspected UA.
METHODS: 136 patients were prospectively included and underwent rest 18F-FDG PET imaging and coronary arteriography within 1 week.
RESULTS: Obstructive CAD was diagnosed in 71 patients, and stenosis ≥ 70% was confirmed in 130 vascular territories. At patients and vascular level, rest 18F-FDG imaging showed sensitivity of 62.0%, 47.7%, specificity of 92.3%, 94.2%, accuracy of 76.5%, 79.4%, PPV of 89.8% and 79.5%, and NPV of 69.0% and 79.4%. The AUCs were 0.771 and 0.710. Of 71 patients with obstructive CAD, rest 18F-FDG imaging showed sensitivity of 47.7% and 58.8%, specificity of 91.6% and 91.2%, accuracy of 64.8% and 80.4%, PPV of 89.9% and 76.9% and NPV of 52.8% and 81.6% in all vascular level and single-vessel disease. In patients with two- or three-vessel disease, rest 18F-FDG imaging had a diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of 43.8%, 93.3%, 50.5%, 97.7%, and 20.6%. The AUCs were 0.696, 0.750, and 0.685.
CONCLUSION: Rest 18F-FDG imaging performed certain overall diagnostic efficiency for obstructive CAD in Chinese patients with suspected UA, especially the excellent high PPV in identifying culprit ischemic territory in patients with multivessel disease.
