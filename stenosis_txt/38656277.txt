Title: Baseline coronary artery stenosis severity is an independent predictor of subsequent poor sleep quality in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Abstract: AIM: To investigate the relationship between coronary artery lesion severity determined using the baseline SYNTAX score and sleep problems that might occur after discharge determined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
METHODS: This prospective study included patients with first acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary angiography between February 2019 and August 2019. The severity of coronary artery stenosis was classified according to coronary angiography and SYNTAX scores. Patients were grouped as those with a SYNTAX score of ≤22 and >22. Sleep quality after discharge was classified according to the PSQI. PSQI ≤5 represented good sleep quality, and PSQI >5 represented poor sleep quality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between sleep quality and coronary artery stenosis severity.
RESULTS: A total of 424 patients were included in the study. Of these, 294 (69.34%) had a SYNTAX score of ≤22 and 130 (30.66%) had a SYNTAX score of >22. The mean age of all patients was 60.37 ± 12.23 years, 59.69 ± 11.85 years in the SYNTAX ≤22 groups and 61.90 ± 12.98 years in the SYNTAX >22 group (P = 0.086). The majority (78.54%) of the patients were male and there was no significant difference between the SYNTAX ≤22 group and the SYNTAX >22 group in terms of sex distribution (P = 0.383). According to the univariate logistic regression analysis, age (P = 0.014), diabetes (P = 0.027), left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.001), estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.039), creatine kinase MB (P = 0.040) and SYNTAX scores (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with high PSQI global scores (>5). However, according to the multivariate logistic regression analysis results, high (>22) SYNTAX scores were the only factor independently associated with the high (>5) PSQI global scores [odds ratio, 3.477; 95% confidence interval (CI), (2.190-5.522); P < 0.001]. Complete revascularization group had significantly higher sleep latency and sleep duration time, sleep efficiency and the percentage of patients with PSQI global score of ≤5 than the incomplete revascularization group (P < 0.001 for all).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with ACS, those with high SYNTAX scores should be monitored more carefully for sleep disorders that may occur later.
