Title: Cardiovascular imaging research and innovation in 2023.

Abstract: In 2023, cardiovascular imaging has made significant advancements, in terms of technology, pathophysiology, and clinical application. In this review, the most recent research findings in the field of cardiovascular imaging are discussed. Artificial intelligence and large population cohorts, together with several technical improvements, have had a crucial impact on the technological advancements of echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, computed tomography (CT), and nuclear medicine. In the field of ischaemic heart disease, it has been demonstrated that appropriate non-invasive imaging strategies improve patients' management and reduce invasive procedures and the need for additional testing at follow-up. Moreover, improvements in plaque characterization with CT are an expanding field of research with relevant implications for the prediction of disease severity, evolution, and response to treatment. In the field of valvular heart disease, imaging techniques have advanced alongside improvements in transcatheter treatment for aortic stenosis, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitation. Finally, in the field of heart failure and cardiomyopathies, cardiovascular imaging has reinforced its crucial role in early diagnosis and risk evaluation, showcasing advanced techniques that outperform traditional methods in predicting adverse outcomes.
