Title: Right Parasternal Approach for Aortic Valve Replacement After Presternal Gastropexy.

Abstract: Due to bicuspid aortic valve aortic stenosis, a 78-year-old man with a history of esophagectomy and presternal gastric tube reconstruction required aortic valve replacement (AVR). AVR with a bioprosthetic valve was performed through a right parasternal thoracotomy. Despite the unfavorable conditions for conventional median sternotomy, AVR was successfully performed through an alternate approach. The right parasternal approach was excellent for AVR in patients with presternal gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer (EC).
