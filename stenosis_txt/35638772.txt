Title: Crack cocaine abuse as an undescribed cause of gastric outlet obstruction.

Abstract: A 32-year-old male with crack-cocaine abuse for 10 years, 300 g/day. He started with epigastric abdominal pain, intensity 10/10, he went to another hospital where a perforated peptic ulcer was suspected and a laparotomy was performed, with no findings. Subsequently, he started with vomiting and weight loss, on admission, a gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) was suspected and CT scan showed a concentric duodenal growth. An upper endoscopy identified a duodenal bulb stenosis with a Forrest-III ulcer. Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis was performed, identifying duodenal thickening, without malignancy.
