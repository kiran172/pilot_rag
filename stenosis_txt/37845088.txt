Title: Idiopathic dilatation of the submandibular gland duct.

Abstract: Lithiasis and stenosis may cause salivary duct dilatation due to the increased pressure in the duct upstream of the obstruction. Idiopathic dilatations, also called megaducts, with no associated increase in pressure, have only been described in the parotid gland. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of submandibular duct dilatation unrelated to lithiasis, stenosis, or an imperforate duct, to report the existence of submandibular megaducts. This retrospective single-centre study included patients treated at La Conception University Hospital, Marseille, France, between 2007 and 2019. Patients with submandibular duct dilatation of ≥4 mm confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging sialography (sialo-MRI), who also underwent sialendoscopy to identify any associated stenosis, were included. Patients with lithiasis, stenosis, an imperforate ostium, or a history of trauma or surgery to the floor of the mouth were excluded. Five patients (three female, two male) aged 30-76 years with idiopathic duct dilatations in nine submandibular glands were included. The most commonly reported symptoms were submandibular swelling, pruritus, and discomfort, mostly outside mealtimes. Recurrence of symptoms after treatment was frequent. This study is novel in describing submandibular megaducts as opposed to dilatation caused by high pressure associated with stenosis, with confirmation by sialo-MRI and sialendoscopy.
