Title: Cannulation of pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis with a novel controllable catheter.

Abstract: Anastomotic stenosis of hepaticojejunostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy are common adverse events after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Kuraoka and colleagues describe their method of cannulating the bile and pancreatic ducts using a novel catheter with a controllable tip, which is useful when it is difficult to align the axis of the forceps port and the anastomosis.
