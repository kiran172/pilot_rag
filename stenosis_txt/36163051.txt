Title: Anatomical and Clinical Factors Associated With Valvulopathy and Aortopathy in Mexican Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valves.

Abstract: The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with significant aortic valve dysfunction. We aimed to study Mexican patients with BAV to assess phenotypic expressions of BAV, and associations of valvulopathy and aortopathy and their predictors. A cross-sectional, retrospective study was designed. The patients were divided according to (1) normally or minimally dysfunctional BAV, (2) predominant aortic regurgitation (AR), and (3) predominant aortic stenosis (AS). A total of 189 patients were included with a high prevalence of males (68%). The overall median age was 42 (23 to 52) years. The distribution of fused BAV phenotypes was right-left fusion (77%), right noncoronary fusion (17%) and left noncoronary fusion (6%). AS-predominant group was the oldest with a high prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and raphe. In multivariable analysis T2DM (odds ratio [OR] 10.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1 to 52], p <0.01) and presence of raphe (OR 2.58 [95% CI 1.02 to 6.52], p = 0.04) were independently associated with AS. The AR-predominant group was composed mostly of males with significantly fewer cardiovascular risk factors. Male gender (OR 2.84 [95%CI 121 to 6.68], p = 0.01) and aortic dilatation (OR 3.58 [95% CI 1.73 to 7.39], p <0.01) were associated with AR-predominance in multivariable analysis. Aortic dilatation was associated with age (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.008 to 1.05], p <0.01) and AR (OR 4.31 [95% CI 2.05 to 9.06], p <0.01). Independent factors associated with the root phenotype were male gender (OR 12.4 [95% CI 1.6 to 95], p <0.01) and AR (OR 5.25 [95% CI 2.18 to 12.6], p <0.01).In conclusion, in a mestizo population, the distribution of BAV-fused phenotypes was similar to European and North American populations, the presence of raphe and T2DM were independently associated with AS-predominance, and male gender and aortic dilatation were independently associated with AR-predominance.
