Title: [Moyamoya in Aragon: epidemiology and self-perception of quality of life].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Moyamoya angiopathy is a vasculopathy caused by stenosis/occlusion of one or both intracranial internal carotid arteries. Although more common in Eastern countries, its prevalence is increasing in the West. An angioresonance or angiography is essential for its diagnosis. There are two options for treatment: conservative (medical) treatment or surgical bypass techniques.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients were selected using International Classification of Diseases codes, and their demographic characteristics and health outcomes were studied. They were administered a scale for the screening of anxious-depressive syndrome (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HADS) and another scale for self-perceived quality of life (SF-36). After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, eight of these patients were studied.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients were studied (52.63% male, 57.89% European) and the Aragonese prevalence was estimated at 1.37/100,000 inhabitants. The most frequent clinical presentation was ischaemic stroke (73.68%). The HADS detected two positive cases of anxiety and one case of depression. According to the SF-36, the worst self-rated aspects were vitality (median: 35/100) and general health (median: 42.5/100), while the best rated was physical function (mean: 93.57/100).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the Spanish series with the highest prevalence and the only one that addresses self-perceived health and screening of the anxious-depressive syndrome. Further research is needed to address this entity and determine its true prevalence in the West.
