Title: Venovo Venous Stent in Treating Iliac Vein Compression: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Venovo venous stent (BD/Bard Peripheral Vascular) is indicated to treat iliofemoral veno-occlusive disease. We present our own experience with the Venovo venous stent in treating iliac vein compression (ILVC).
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort, we included consecutive patients treated with the Venovo venous stent for ILVC at our center. Stent deployment and sizing were guided by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Minimal luminal areas at the compression before and after treatment were measured by IVUS. Clinical improvement was determined by symptoms reported by patients and the Clinical Etiologic Anatomic and Pathophysiologic (CEAP) score. The primary safety endpoint was freedom from acute venothromboembolic disease, stent migration, perforation, acute/subacute closure, and vascular complications. The primary safety endpoint was target-lesion revascularization at 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 50 consecutive patients (57 Venovo stents, 36 women, mean age, 59.8 ± 16.3 years) were included. IVUS-measured mean percent stenosis at the compression site was 64.8% ± 12.8%. Mean total stent length and diameter were 78.0 ± 54.0 mm and 17.1 ± 1.9 mm, respectively. The primary safety endpoint was met in all subjects. Procedural technical success was 100% (successful deployment with no complications). At 1 year, 83.8% of patients reported improvement in their symptoms. Freedom from total occlusion at 1 year was 100% (data available for n = 30 patients). Target-lesion revascularization (TLR) was 2% at 1 year due to 1 patient who had stent explantation from worsening ipsilateral left leg and back pain.
CONCLUSION: In this single-center experience, the Venovo venous stent was safe and effective in treating ILVC with 98% freedom from TLR at a follow-up of 1 year. Improvement in symptoms was reported in the majority of patients.
