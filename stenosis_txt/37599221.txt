Title: [Safety and efficacy analysis of the removal of refractory esophageal self-expandable metal stents by stent-in-stent technique].

Abstract: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of esophageal stent-in-stent (SIS) in patients with refractory esophageal self-expandable metal stents (SEMS). Case series study. Retrospective analysis was made on the patients with refractory esophageal SEMS treated with SIS technology in Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University from June 2015 to June 2021. The success rate of stent removal and the incidence of adverse events were analyzed. A total of 12 patients were included, including 7 males and 5 females, aged 50-73 (62.7Â±8.5) years. The clinical success rate of the internal stents was 12/12, with the median retention time of [M(Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>), 64.5 (52.0, 90.8)] days. The postoperative displacement rate and severe stenosis incidence were 1/12 and 3/12, respectively. The esophageal stents were successfully removed in one endoscopic session in all patients. A small amount of mucous membrane extravasation occurred in all patients after SIS, and no patients died after 90 days of follow-up.
