Title: Maternal prepregnancy weight as an independent risk factor for congenital heart defect: systematic review and meta-analysis stratified by subtype and severity of defect.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between increased maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and the risk of congenital heart defect (CHD) in offspring.
METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus from inception to 20 April 2023. Risk estimates were abstracted or calculated for increased BMI categories (overweight, obesity, moderate obesity and severe obesity) compared with normal weight (reference). Fixed-effects or random-effects models were used to combine individual study risk estimates based on the degree of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to weight pooled estimates for relevant moderators, particularly diabetes before and during pregnancy. Subgroup analyses for specific CHD subtypes were conducted if there were at least two studies with available data. Findings were presented for groups of defects, categorized using severity and topographic-functional criteria, and for individual defects. The certainty of the evidence for each effect estimate was evaluated according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines.
RESULTS: Overall, 31 studies comprising 4 861 693 patients and 86 136 CHD cases were included. The risk of CHD increased progressively from moderate to severe obesity (pooled odds ratio (OR), 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.20) and 1.39 (95% CI, 1.27-1.53), respectively). Sensitivity analysis indicated that this effect persisted independently of maternal diabetes status before or during pregnancy. In the subgroup analysis, obesity was associated with up to a 1.5-fold increase in the risk of severe CHD (pooled OR, 1.48 (95% CI, 1.03-2.13)). Severe obesity was associated with an even higher risk, with 1.8-times higher odds compared with the reference group for specific CHD subtypes, including tetralogy of Fallot (pooled OR, 1.72 (95% CI, 1.38-2.16)), pulmonary valve stenosis (pooled OR, 1.79 (95% CI, 1.39-2.30)) and atrial septal defect (pooled OR, 1.71 (95% CI, 1.48-1.97)).
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal weight is a crucial modifiable risk factor for CHD, particularly for severe forms of defect. Further research is needed to investigate whether weight management before pregnancy might serve as a preventive measure against CHD. In pregnant women with obesity, fetal echocardiography should be a routine diagnostic procedure. © 2024 The Authors.
