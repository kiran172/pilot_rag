Title: Effectiveness and safety of a 26-week taper regimen of glucocorticoid in GCA patients: Results from a prospective cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of the 26-week tapering regimen of glucocorticoids (GC) used in the GiACTA trial in a prospective cohort of treatment-naive, biopsy-proven GCA patients.
METHODS: Patients with a new diagnosis of biopsy-proven GCA enrolled in the GC arm of the START project (molecular stratification of patients with GCA to tailor GC and tocilizumab therapy) were included. All patients were treated with the 26-week taper regimen of GC used in the GiACTA trial. The primary endpoint was the rate of relapse-free remission at week 52. The secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with incident aortic damage, cumulative GC doses and GC-related adverse events (AE).
RESULTS: 22 patients were included between December 2018 and February 2022. At week 52, 10 patients (45 %, 95 % CI 24-68) were in relapse-free remission. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 35 (22-40) months, 7 patients (32 %, 95 % CI 14-55) were in relapse-free remission. 18 patients with baseline large-vessel imaging underwent CT angiography at the end of the follow-up. No patients had evidence of new aortic dilation, significant progression of aortic damage or large vessel stenosis. 15/22 patients (68 %) had at least one relapse during follow-up. No patients developed visual or cerebrovascular manifestations during relapses. 15/22 (68 %) patients had at least one GC-related AE.
CONCLUSIONS: A 26 week taper regimen of GC was effective and safe in inducing and maintaining remission in a sizeable proportion of newly diagnosed GCA patients. However, the frequency of GC-related adverse events was high.
