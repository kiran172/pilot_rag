Title: Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Unprotected Left Main Disease: A Single-Center Study.

Abstract: Background: Hemodynamically significant unprotected left main (LM) coronary artery disease is a high-risk clinical condition because of the large area of myocardium at risk, and it requires prompt revascularization. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an appropriate alternative to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for revascularization of unprotected LM disease in patients with low-to-intermediate anatomic complexity or when the patient refuses CABG after adequate counseling by the heart team. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 201 patients receiving left main (LM) provisional one-stent or two-stent procedures, and we assessed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing unprotected LM PCI. Results: The mean age was 66.5 ± 9.9 years, and 72% were male. The majority of the subjects presented several cardiovascular risk factors, among which arterial hypertension (179 patients, 89.5%) and dyslipidemia (173 patients, 86.5%) were the most frequent. Out of all patients, 162 (81.8%) underwent revascularization by using the one-stent technique, while the two-stent technique was used in 36 patients (18.2%). The median value of fractional flow reserve (FFR) of the side branch was 0.9 [0.85-0.95], and 135 patients (67.1%) showed a value of FFR &gt; 0.8. One hundred nine patients (54.2%) had a stent enhancement side branch length (SESBL) &gt; 2, with median values of 2.5 mm2 [2.1-3]. Regarding angiographic parameters, the LM area as assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) and the grade of stenosis as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) were similar between groups. However, patients who required revascularization by using the two-stent technique presented more frequently with intermediate rather than low SYNTAX scores (69.4% vs. 28.4%, p &lt; 0.0001). Also, the same group required kissing balloon inflation (KBI) more frequently (69.4% vs. 30%, p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences regarding the success of revascularization between the use of the one-stent or two-stent technique. FFR was able to predict a SESBL &gt; 2 mm. The cut-off value for FFR to afford the highest degree of sensitivity (74.5%) and specificity (47%) for a SESBL &gt; 2 was &gt;0.86, indicating a moderate accuracy (AUC = 0.61, 95% CI 0.525-0.690, p = 0.036). Conclusions: Unprotected left main PCI is a safe and effective revascularization option amongst a complex and morbid population. There were no differences regarding the success of revascularization between the use of the one-stent or two-stent technique, and there was no significant impact of KBI on side branch FFR measurements but lower side branch FFR values were correlated with angiographic side branch compromise.
