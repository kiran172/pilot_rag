Title: Diagnostic Performance of PET Versus SPECT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in Patients with Smaller Left Ventricles: A Substudy of the 18F-Flurpiridaz Phase III Clinical Trial.

Abstract: The performance of SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) may deteriorate in smaller hearts, primarily because of the lower resolution of conventional Anger cameras. 18F-flurpiridaz is a novel PET MPI agent with superior image and defect resolution. We sought to determine the diagnostic performance of 99mTc-labeled SPECT MPI compared with 18F-flurpiridaz PET MPI according to left ventricle (LV) size. Methods: We conducted a substudy of the phase III clinical trial of flurpiridaz (n = 750) and stratified diagnostic performance according to the median PET LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), with smaller LVs defined as having an LVEDV of less than 113 mL (n = 369) and larger LVs defined as having an LVEDV of at least 113 mL (n = 381). Images were interpreted by the majority rule of 3 independent masked readers. The reference standard was quantitative invasive angiography, with at least 50% stenosis in at least 1 coronary artery considered significant. Results: SPECT performance decreased significantly from an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75 in larger LVs to 0.67 in smaller LVs (P = 0.03), whereas PET performance was similar in larger and smaller LVs (AUC, 0.79 vs. 0.77, P = 0.49). Accordingly, in smaller LVs, PET had a higher AUC (0.77) than the SPECT AUC (0.67) (P &lt; 0.0001), a phenomenon driven by female patients (P &lt; 0.0001). In smaller LVs, there was a degradation of SPECT sensitivity that was highly significant (P &lt; 0.001), whereas there was no significant change in PET sensitivity according to LV size (P = 0.07). Overall, PET had significantly higher sensitivity than SPECT in both smaller LVs (67% vs. 43%, P &lt; 0.001) and larger LVs (76% vs. 61%, P &lt; 0.001). The specificities of PET and SPECT were similar in larger LVs (76% vs. 83%, P = 0.11). Although SPECT specificity improved in smaller compared with larger LVs (90% vs. 83%, P = 0.03), the PET specificity did not change with LV size (76% vs. 76%, P = 0.9). Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of 18F-flurpiridaz PET MPI is not affected by LV size and is superior to SPECT MPI in patients with smaller LVs, highlighting the importance of appropriate test selection in these patients.
