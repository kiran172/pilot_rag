Title: Impact of severe left ventricular outflow tract calcification on device failure and short-term mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the impact of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) calcification on the incidence of device failure and mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: Of 690 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI in our center from January 2013 to December 2015, 600 presented with non-severe (NSCA<sub>LVOT</sub>) and 90 (13.0%) with severe (SCA<sub>LVOT</sub>) LVOT calcification. Primary outcome of interest was device failure defined as a composite of procedural death, prosthesis dislocation, annulus rupture or significant para-valvular leakage (PVL). Secondary outcome of interest was 30-day and one-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean age of the population was 80.8 ± 7.2 years, mean STS score was 5.7 ± 4.6% and 50.6% of the patients were women. Patients with SCA<sub>LVOT</sub> more frequently experienced device failure (10.0% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.009) and were at higher risk of 30 day (10.0% vs. 2.8%, p &lt; 0.001) all cause mortality as compared to those with NSCA<sub>LVOT</sub>. Furthermore, patients with SCA<sub>LVOT</sub> were more frequently in need of post-dilation (15.6% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.032) and showed higher incidence of significant PVL (7.8% vs. 2.5%, p = 0.007). In multivariate analysis, SCA<sub>LVOT</sub> (hazard ratio 2.87; 95% CI 1.20 to 6.34) and use of balloon-expandable prosthesis (hazard ratio 0.32; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.73) were identified as independent predictors of device failure.
CONCLUSION: Presence of severe LVOT calcification in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI is associated with a higher risk of device failure and short-term mortality.
