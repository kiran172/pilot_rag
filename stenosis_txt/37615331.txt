Title: Co-existence of hepatic and pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis patients including associated risk factors: a magnetic resonance elastography study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the co-existence of hepatic and pancreatic fibrosis using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) in chronic pancreatitis (CP), including the association between hepatic and pancreatic MRE-derived stiffness and exploration of potential etiological risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four CP patients and 35 healthy controls underwent hepatic and pancreatic MRE with measurements of tissue stiffness. Clinical parameters including stage (probable or definite CP), etiology of CP, the presence of diabetes or exocrine insufficiency, and previous history of common bile duct stenosis were assessed. Uni- and multivariate regression models were used to investigate risk factors associated with hepatic fibrosis/stiffness in CP patients.
RESULTS: Fifteen percent of CP patients and none of the controls had abnormal liver stiffness (&gt;2.5 kPa), p = 0.02. 5.6% of CP patients had liver stiffness indicating F1 fibrosis (&gt;2.93 kPa). However, hepatic stiffness was not higher in patients than in healthy controls (2.20 ± 0.41 vs 2.08 ± 0.21 kPa, p = 0.10). In patients, a positive association was seen between hepatic and pancreatic stiffness (r = 0.270, p = 0.048). In the multivariate analysis (adjusted for age, gender and BMI), liver stiffness was significantly associated with alcoholic etiology of CP (p = 0.029). In contrast, stage of CP, history of common bile duct stenosis, and the presence of diabetes or exocrine insufficiency were not associated with liver stiffness (all p &gt; 0.14).
CONCLUSIONS: Only a modest co-existence of hepatic and pancreatic fibrosis was observed in CP. However, the positive association between hepatic and pancreatic stiffness indicates some level of common pathophysiology. Especially, alcoholic etiology of CP was related to increased hepatic stiffness.
