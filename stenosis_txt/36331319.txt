Abstract: Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is characterized by clinical evidence of myocardial infarction with normal or near-normal coronary arteries on angiography (less-than 50% stenosis). MINOCA is a group of heterogeneous diseases with different pathophysiologic mechanism which all can cause ischaemia. MINOCA is considered a "working diagnosis" after angiography until further evaluation regarding its underlying cause is made. The aim of this review is to assess the literature on clinical features, aetiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of patients with MINOCA.
