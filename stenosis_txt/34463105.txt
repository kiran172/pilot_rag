Title: Contrast-induced encephalopathy.

Abstract: Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare complication of the intravascular application of a contrast agent. CIE can be manifested by headache, cortical blindness, consciousness disorders, seizures, or focal neurological deficit. Neurological symptoms are typically transient with temporary abnormal findings on a brain scan. Urgent neuroimaging is important to obtain the correct diagnosis, especially in cases that require an acute management and treatment. We present aÂ case of CIE after a digital subtraction angiography of the vertebral arteries in the patient with a symptomatic pre-occlusive stenosis of the posterior cerebral artery (Ref. 36).
