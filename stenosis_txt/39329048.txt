Title: Unilateral dystrophic circumferential calcified ureteral stenosis with hydronephrosis associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults following coronavirus disease 2019.

Abstract: •COVID-19-related MIS-A developed in a Japanese patient.•Acute MIS-A symptoms improved with steroid and immunoglobulin therapy.•Unilateral ureteral calcified stenosis observed in the late phase of MIS-A.•Ureteral calcification suggests microvasculopathy and multiorgan ischemia from MIS-A.
