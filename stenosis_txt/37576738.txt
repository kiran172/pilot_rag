Title: Dunbar syndrome - case report.

Abstract: Dunbar syndrome is diagnosed by excluding other possible causes of abdominal pains. Surgical treatment comprises complete dissection of the ligament and the surrounding nerve ganglion. This report describes the case of a previously healthy 45-year-old male patient who presented with epigastric abdominal pain irradiating to the back and weakness. Initially, abdominal computed tomography was ordered, showing arteriopathy of the celiac trunk and mesenteric artery with stenosis. The patient underwent surgical treatment because of the refractory pain, but findings were nonspecific. It was necessary to continue workup with serial angiotomography to follow the case. After around 6 months, thickening of the arcuate ligament was found, with compression of the proximal third of the celiac trunk and 80% stenosis. The patient therefore underwent laparoscopy to relieve celiac trunk compression, with satisfactory postoperative recovery.
