Title: [Early effects of unilateral biportal endoscopic posterior total laminectomy decompression in the treatment of cervical stenosis].

Abstract: To investigate the early efficacy and safety of unilateral biportal endoscopic posterior total laminectomy decompression in the treatment of cervical stenosis (CS). The clinical data of 28 patients with CS treated by unilateral biportal endoscopic posterior total laminectomy decompression from January 2021 to October 2022 in the Henan NO.3 Provincial People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Of the patients, 16 were male and 12 were female, the mean age was (55.6±9.6) years. The CS occurred at C<sub>3-4</sub> level in 1 cases, at C<sub>4-5</sub> level in 3 cases, at C<sub>5-6</sub> level in 16 cases and at C<sub>6-7</sub> level in 8 cases. Each case was compared at the moment of pre-operation and final follow-up by the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score. The postoperative complications were recorded. The JOA improvement rate was computed at the final follow-up. As a result, all patients underwent successful surgery and were followed up for (11.6±4.7) months. The operation time was (43.0±5.3) min. Intraoperative blood loss (7.9±2.8) ml; Postoperative drainage volume (8.1±2.3) ml. The JOA score increased from 7.9±1.2 before surgery to 13.5±1.3 six months after surgery, and it was 13.7±1.2 at the last follow-up, the differences between postoperative and preoperative were both statistically significant (both P&lt;0.001). No complications occurred, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage, nerve injury and intraspinal hematoma. At the last follow-up, cervical spine X-ray or CT evaluation showed no instability in the operative segment. The overall curative effect was evaluated according to JOA score at the last follow-up: 16 cases got excellent outcome, 7 cases got good and 2 cases got medium outcome, with an excellent and good rate of 89.3% (25/28). This study shows that unilateral biportal endoscopic posterior total laminectomy decompression in the treatment of single-level cervical stenosis can achieve satisfactory efficacy, has no impact on spinal stability, and has a high safety.
