Title: Early Multicenter Experience With the Neuroform Atlas Stent: Feasibility, Safety, and Efficacy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Neuroform Atlas stentâ„¢ (by Stryker, Fremont, California) represents the most recent widely available upgrade to intracranial stenting, providing a laser cut open cell stent with a diameter of 3.0 to 4.5 mm that is delivered through an 0.017-inch microcatheter.
OBJECTIVE: To report our initial multicenter experience of the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of the Atlas stent used for treating aneurysms, as well as one case of intracranial stenosis and one carotid artery dissection as well as other pathologies.
METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study of subjects treated with Atlas stent during the period 2018 to 2019.
RESULTS: The total number of patients included in our analysis was 71 patients. The stent was utilized to treat 69 aneurysm cases. Of the aneurysms, 36% presented with acute rupture and 56% of the ruptured aneurysms were high grade. Mean aneurysm dimension was 7 mm with an average neck width of 4.1 mm. Around 30% had received prior treatment. Telescoping or Y-stent was used in 16% of cases. We did not observe any symptomatic major complications in our series. Asymptomatic major complications were seen in 7 patients (10.1%); technical complications occurred in 4.3%. Immediate modified Raymond-Roy-occlusion-outcome class I/II was observed in 87%, and this increased to 97.7% at latest follow-up, which was at 4 mo; 91.8% of patients achieved favorable clinical outcome, and mortality rate was 1.4%.
CONCLUSION: Our series demonstrates the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of the Atlas stent. The low complication rate and the high obliteration rate managing complex aneurysms, even in an acute ruptured setting, are notable.
