Title: A case of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma accompanied by pancreatic and bile duct metastases: Successful treatment starts with an accurate diagnosis.

Abstract: Pancreatic and bile duct metastases from esophageal cancer are extremely rare. We report a case of advanced esophageal cancer successfully treated with chemotherapy, selected on the basis of an accurate pathologic diagnosis. A 69-year-old man with chronic renal dysfunction presented with persistent abdominal pain and anorexia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an irregular-shaped tumor in the lower esophagus. Computed tomography and ultrasonography revealed swollen para-aortic lymph nodes, a pancreatic mass, and distal bile duct stenosis. Histopathological examination showed that all of the lesions were squamous cell carcinoma with unique immunohistochemical characteristics of p40+ and cytokeratin 7+. The final diagnosis was esophageal squamous cell carcinoma accompanied by lymph node, pancreas, and bile duct metastases. Taking his renal dysfunction into consideration, modified FOLFOX was administered as the first-line chemotherapy. The patient survived for 15 months since his first presentation. The favorable outcome was attributed to the accurate diagnosis based on comprehensive tissue sampling.
