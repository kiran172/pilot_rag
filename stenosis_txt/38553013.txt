Title: Coronary artery disease and outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis is a life-limiting condition for which transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established therapy. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is frequently found in this patient group and optimal management in these patients remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the association of coexistent CAD on mortality and hospital readmission in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we examined patients who underwent TAVI and segregated them by the presence of obstructive epicardial CAD. The primary outcome was 3-year mortality with secondary outcomes being readmission for (1) all-causes, (2) a MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event) composite endpoint and (3) acute coronary syndrome. Subsidiary outcomes included patient angina and breathlessness scores.
RESULTS: 898 patients underwent TAVI, of which 488 (54.3%) had unobstructed coronary arteries and 410 (45.7%) had obstructive CAD. Overall, n=298 (33.2%) patients experienced the primary mortality endpoint with no significant difference when stratified according to CAD (n=160 (32.9%) vs n=136 (33.2%), HR 0.98, CI 0.78 to 1.24). After multivariate analysis, the presence of CAD had no effect on the primary outcome (HR 0.98, CI 0.68 to 1.40). There was no significant difference in readmission for any cause (n=181, 37.1% (CAD) vs n=169, 41.2% (no CAD), p=0.23), including no significant difference on readmission for MACE (n=48, 9.8% (CAD) vs n=45, 11.0% (no CAD), p=0.11). CAD at the time of TAVI also did not alter breathlessness or angina scores before/after TAVI (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Coexistent CAD had no significant association with mortality, any-cause readmission or symptoms for patients undergoing TAVI in our cohort.
