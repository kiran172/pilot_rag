Title: Right Ventricular Free Wall Rupture Due to Displaced Automatic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (AICD) Lead.

Abstract: The implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) carries a risk for major complications, one of which is ventricular free wall rupture secondary to a lead perforation. This known complication, although rare, has estimated incidence rates between 0.1% and 3%. Predictive factors of such an event include temporary leads, steroid use, active fixation leads, low body mass index (&lt;20 kg/m2), age greater than 80 years, female gender, and concurrent anticoagulation. Right ventricular systolic pressure &gt;35 mmHg is considered a protective factor likely due to associated right ventricular hypertrophy. We present a case of a 73-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis status post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and atrial fibrillation (AFib) who met the criteria for an ICD after suffering ventricular fibrillation arrest (after TAVR procedure) ultimately resulting in lead perforation.
