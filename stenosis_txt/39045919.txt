Title: Esophageal replacement in children - 27 years of experience in a University Hospital.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: esophageal replacement in children is indicated when it is impossible to maintain the native esophagus, which in the pediatric population includes patients with esophageal atresia and esophageal caustic stenosis. The objective of this communication is to report the experience of a university service with two techniques of esophageal replacement.
METHODS: this is a retrospective study based on the revision of hospital files. The study population consisted of patients who underwent esophageal replacement from 1995 to 2022, at the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas of the State University of Campinas. The analyzed data were age, sex, underlying disease, technical aspects, complications, and long-term results.
RESULTS: during the study period, 30 patients underwent esophageal replacement. The most common underlying diseases were esophageal atresia (73.33%) and caustic stenosis (26.67%). Twenty-one patients underwent gastric transposition (70%), and nine underwent esophagocoloplasty (30%). The most frequent postoperative complication was fistula of the proximal anastomosis, which occurred in 14 patients. Most of the patients with fistulas had a spontaneous recovery. There were three deaths. Of the 27 survivors, 24 can feed exclusively by mouth.
CONCLUSION: esophageal replacement in children is a procedure with high morbidity and mortality. Esophagocoloplasty and gastric transposition have similar results and complications, with the exception of proximal anastomotic fistulas, which are generally self-resolving and are more common in esophagocoloplasty. The choice of the best surgical technique must be individualized according to the patients characteristics and the surgeons experience, as both techniques offer the ability to feed orally in the short or medium term.
