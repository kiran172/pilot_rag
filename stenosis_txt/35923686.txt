Title: Stroke in Patients with Schistosomiasis: Review of Cases in Literature.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cerebral vascular comorbidities may occur in patients with schistosomiasis, as described in case reports. Aim and Methods. We have summarized general clinical and neurological features in patients with stroke associated with schistosomiasis, through a review of case reports in the literature. Investigation Outcomes. A total of eight case reports were retrieved. The mean age of patients was 36.42 ± 16.7 (19 to 56 years), four females, three males, and one anonymous sex. Eosinophilia was the most frequent feature at presentation, followed by cardiac abnormalities, confusion, fever, ataxia, hemiplegia, headache, urticaria, dysphasia, and memory impairment. Patients usually present with watershed infarction or intracranial vasculitis. In one case, extracranial carotid arteries presented with inflammation and stenosis. The patient's serology was positive on admission in five cases. Full neurological recovery was reported in three cases, and partial improvement in another three. In two cases, information on neurological outcomes was incomplete. Stroke in schistosomiasis can be caused by haemodynamic impairment, direct lesion to the arterial wall, vasa vasorum obliterative endarteritis, contiguity with a focus of inflamed tissue, or inflammatory intimal damage. Schistosomiasis needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of stroke in people living or coming back from endemic areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Further studies addressing the noncommunicable comorbidity issues related to this condition are needed.
