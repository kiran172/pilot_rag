Title: Transient reduction in ejection fraction following aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In patients following aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic regurgitation, a transient reduction in ejection fraction (TREF) sometimes occurs in the postoperative period without a clear remediable cause, which leads to a spontaneous improvement without the need for a specific treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence and risk factors of TREF following AVR for aortic regurgitation.
METHODS: We designed a single-centre retrospective observational study. A total of 164 patients were enrolled in the study: 82 in the regurgitation group and 82 in the stenosis group. Data were obtained from international registries and patient documentation.
RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in TREF between the regurgitation and stenosis groups (9.76 % and 0 %, respectively, p = 0.004). There was zero hospital mortality in both regurgitation and stenosis groups. The presence of TREF had no impact on long-term survival.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that transient reduction in ejection fraction is a relatively common phenomenon following aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation and that in our study population it had no effect on short- and long-term survival (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 15).
