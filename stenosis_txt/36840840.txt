Title: Residual middle lobectomy after right upper or lower lobectomy: indications and outcome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Residual middle lobectomy after upper lobectomy and lower lobectomy differs in their indications and perioperative outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the indications and perioperative outcomes of residual middle lobectomy after upper and lower lobectomy.
METHODS: The data of 14 patients who underwent residual middle lobectomy after upper or lower lobectomy between January 1997 and December 2021 were extracted and analyzed.
RESULTS: Overall, six patients underwent residual middle lobectomy after upper lobectomy. The indication was second primary lung cancer in five patients and local recurrence in the hilar lymph node between the middle and lower lobar bronchi in one patient. However, one patient was treated with the R2 operation. The remaining eight patients underwent residual middle lobectomy after lower lobectomy. The indication was second primary lung cancer and bronchopleural fistula or stenosis in two and six patients, respectively. No postoperative 90-day mortality was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Residual middle lobectomy for second lung cancer after upper lobectomy is difficult because of severe hilar adhesions. Simultaneous resection of hilar structures or pulmonary artery and parenchyma might be an option. Residual middle lobectomy could be a treatment option for bronchopleural fistula or stenosis after lower lobectomy.
