Title: Long-term clinical and ultrasound follow-up after transient perivascular inflammation of the carotid artery (TIPIC) syndrome: a multicenter study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to describe the clinical and ultrasound (US) long-term follow-up of patients with transient perivascular inflammation of the carotid artery (TIPIC) syndrome and the risk of recurrence.
METHODS: We enrolled patients with a definitive diagnosis of TIPIC syndrome who were included in a retrospective multicenter study. These patients were recontacted at least six months after the first TIPIC episode for a clinical and imaging follow-up. Each patient underwent a clinical evaluation through a tailored questionnaire as well as US imaging.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 58.7 months (interquartile range = 8-121). Nineteen out of the 28 patients (67.8%) had residual pain, eight (28.6%) had experienced a clinical recurrence and 12 (42.9%) had a thickening of the carotid wall on US. No patients had neurological complication or other associated diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TIPIC syndrome have often residual pain and recurrence in about one quarter of cases but the long-term follow-up is in favor a benign self-limited pathology.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT03804112).
