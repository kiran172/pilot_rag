Title: The critical period for development of secondary restenosis following post-intubation tracheal stenosis surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Determining a predictable duration to restenosis very essential for reducing mortality and morbidity for tracheal stenosis surgery.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the critical periods for secondary restenosis risk for operated patients with post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS) during the initial healing period.
METHODS: A total of 61 patients with a diagnosis of surgically treated PITS were included in the study. Treatment groups were carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser and tracheal resection with primary anastomosis (TRPA). Duration to restenosis was compared with Kaplan-Meier curves between study groups.
RESULTS: Restenosis developed in 11 (18.0%) patients and was diagnosed after a mean of 39.3 ± 38.5 (range, 22 to 155) days. Gender or Cotton-Myer grade of the PITS was not found to be risk factors for the development of stenosis. Restenosis rate was 33.3% in CO<sub>2</sub> laser group and 10% in the TRPA group (p = .036). Duration to restenosis was detected at a median of 28 days in patients treated with CO<sub>2</sub> laser, and a median of 30 days in patients treated with TRPA (p = .024).
CONCLUSIONS: The most critical period for the development of restenosis after PITS treatment is the third and fourth weeks, especially in patients treated with CO<sub>2</sub> laser.
