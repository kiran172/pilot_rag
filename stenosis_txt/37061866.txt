Title: Cutting balloon for femoral arterial and venus obstructions due to suture-based closure devices: Case series.

Abstract: Suture-based vascular closure devices have been shown to be effective in hemostasis for procedures with vascular access. However, iatrogenic vascular occlusion may occur. The cutting balloon (CB) is a noncompliant balloon wrapped with 3-4 microsurgical blades that are intended to modify vascular lesions, but it may also be utilized to cut and release endovascular sutures. We report two cases in which the CB was employed as a bailout strategy to alleviate suture-related vascular occlusion after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The CB can be effectively utilized to resolve suture-related vascular occlusion.
