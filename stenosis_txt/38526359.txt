Title: [Ten questions about myocardial infarction with non-obstructed coronary arteries].

Abstract: The term "MINOCA" refers to myocardial infarction with non-obstructed coronary arteries and has been used to define acute myocardial infarction with no angiographic evidence of significant epicardial coronary artery stenosis. Patients with MINOCA represent a rather heterogeneous group of acute coronary syndrome, and this may account for the wide variation in the incidence of MINOCA in different studies. Several pathogenic mechanisms have been suggested to underlie MINOCA, but the condition continues to represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the cardiologist. Therefore, an adequate diagnostic assessment, carefully characterizing the pathogenic mechanisms, and a selection of more targeted treatments are needed to improve clinical outcomes. In this focused review, we will try to provide answers to the most common questions on the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of MINOCA.
