Title: Evaluation of renovated double J stents using ureter models with and without stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Commercial double J stents (DJS) have a uniform shape regardless of the specific nature of various ureteral diseases. We tested renovated DJS and compared them with conventional DJS using ureter models.
METHODS: One straight ureter model included stenosis at the distal ureter near the ureterovesical junction and the other did not. We used conventional DJS and renovated 5- and 6-Fr soft DJS for ureter stones and 6-, 7-, and 8.5-Fr hard DJS for tumors. The DJS comprised holes in the upper, middle, or lower one-third of the shaft (length, 24 cm; 2-cm-diameter coils at both ends). More holes were created along the shaft based on the ureteral disease location. Conventional DJS had holes spaced 1 cm apart along the shaft. Renovated DJS had holes spaced 1 cm apart along the shaft with 0.5-cm intervals on the upper, middle, or lower one-third of the shaft. Urine flow was evaluated.
RESULTS: As the DJS diameter increased, the flow rate decreased. The flow rates of DJS with holes in the lower shaft were relatively lower than those of conventional DJS and DJS with holes in the upper and middle shafts. In the ureter model without stenosis, 6-, 7-, and 8.5-Fr renovated stents exhibited significantly higher flow rates than conventional stents. In the ureter model with stenosis, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8.5-Fr renovated stents did not exhibit significantly higher flow rates than conventional stents.
CONCLUSION: Renovated stents and conventional stents did not exhibit significant differences in urine flow with stenosis.
