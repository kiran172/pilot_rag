Title: Unusual Anterior Choroidal Artery Occlusion in Pediatric Type 1 Diabetes: A Case Report Highlighting Atypical Presentation.

Abstract: Anterior choroidal artery (AChA) occlusion is a rare but significant vascular event that can lead to severe neurological deficits. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for various vascular complications, although its association with AChA occlusion in pediatric patients is not commonly seen. A 13-year-old girl, a known case of type 1 diabetes for three years, presented with right-sided headache, visual disturbance in the right eye, and nausea. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed subacute-chronic infarct in the entire left AChA. Internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or cardioembolism are the most common causes of complete AChA ischemic strokes. On the other hand, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia usually cause smaller strokes that only affect a part of AChA territory. However, in our case, there was infarct in the entire AChA territory without any cardioembolic risk factor and in the absence of ICA stenosis.
