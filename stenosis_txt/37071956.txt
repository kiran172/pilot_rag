Title: EUS-guided management of anastomotic stricture: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Anastomotic stenosis after low anterior resection is a serious complication and at times even requires surgical revision of the anastomosis.
CASE PRESENTATION AND CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The patient presented with a 4.0Â cm tubulovillous adenoma of the proximal rectum and underwent low anterior resection with loop ileostomy and subsequent reversal. The case was complicated by complete anastomotic stenosis. A novel technique was utilized to create an Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-guided neo-anastomosis endoscopically.
CONCLUSION: EUS-guided creation of a neo-colorectal anastomosis is a safe and effective alternative to surgical anastomosis revision of a completely stenosed anastomosis.
