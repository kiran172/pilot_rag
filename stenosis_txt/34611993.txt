Title: Impact of diabetes mellitus on outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Identifying high-risk diabetic population from the OCEAN-TAVI registry.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To identify the vulnerable diabetic cohort in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUNDS: Considerable controversy remains about whether specific cohort exists in which presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) carries adverse risk of mortality after TAVR.
METHODS: Of the 2588 patients who were enrolled in the OCEAN-TAVI registry, 2526 patients with glycohemoglobin data were analyzed. The individuals were divided into DM and non-DM groups according to previous medical history of DM or using diabetic medicine, and increased HbA1c values (≥6.5%) at baseline. The primary endpoint of this study was 2-year all-cause mortality after TAVR.
RESULTS: The follow up rate of clinical outcome at 1-year was 2514/2526 (99.5%) and median follow-up period was 22.5 months. DM group had 699 (27.7%) patients, in which 153 (21.9%) was diagnosed by increased HbA1c levels without previous medical history of DM. Kaplan-Meier curve of 2-year all-cause mortality presented significant difference between patients with and without DM (p = 0.029). In addition, patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > 100 mg/dl and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% had great risk of mortality after TAVR (LDL-C: hazard ratio [HR] 1.82, p < 0.001; LVEF: HR 2.61, p = 0.002, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Presence of DM was significantly associated with poor outcome after TAVR and adverse effect of DM was remarkable in patients with relatively higher LDL-C levels and reduced LVEF under 40%. These subtypes may need intensive control of cardiovascular risk factors, including DM, before and after TAVR.
