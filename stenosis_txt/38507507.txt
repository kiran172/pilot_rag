Title: Renal Autotransplantation for Uncontrolled Hypertension in Nonatherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis-2 Case Reports and a Brief Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause of renovascular hypertension in young adults under 40 years old. It is potentially amenable to renal artery angioplasty, which frequently normalizes blood pressure. However, limited options exist if angioplasty is not technically possible, or restenosis occurs. Here, we describe 2 patients who presented with hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis. In the first case, a young adult with hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis (fibromuscular dysplasia), developed restenosis 11 weeks after an initially successful renal artery angioplasty. In the second case, a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 was diagnosed with hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis. Angioplasty was not possible due to multiple branch occlusions. Both individuals went on to have successful renal autotransplantations, which ultimately cured their hypertension. In this article, we review the background, indications, and blood pressure outcomes in relation to renal autotransplantation in nonatherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.
