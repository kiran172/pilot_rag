Title: Bilateral ballism as limb-shaking transient ischemic attacks treated with unilateral carotid artery stent placement.

Abstract: Bilateral limb-shaking transient ischemic attack (LS-TIA) is a rare disease involving carotid artery stenosis, characterized by ballism-like involuntary movements of the arms and legs. We describe the case report of a male patient in his 80s presented with continuous bilateral ballism in the arms and legs and tongue dyskinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no ischemic lesions, while cerebral angiography revealed right internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and 80% stenosis of the left ICA. 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography demonstrated hypoperfusion in the right cerebral cortex but hyperperfusion in both basal ganglia. Left ICA stenting was performed, and involuntary limb shaking disappeared. This case report highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment of bilateral ballism as LS-TIA.
