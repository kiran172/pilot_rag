Title: Cervical Total Disc Replacement: Long-Term Outcomes.

Abstract: Degenerative disc disease and associated cervical spondylosis or stenosis are common conditions encountered in clinical practice. These conditions may cause progressive cervical radicular or myelopathic symptoms leading to significant impairment. Although anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been a reliable surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy, but limitations include loss of cervical range of motion, the concern for adjacent segment degeneration and disease, pseudoarthrosis, complications related to the choice of intervertebral graft, dysphagia, as well as standard anterior cervical approach risk. Cervical total disc arthroplasty has emerged as an alternative operative procedure to ACDF.
