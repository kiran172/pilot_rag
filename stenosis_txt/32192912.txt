Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes Based on the Presence of Chronic Total Occlusion.

Abstract: AIMS: Chronic total occlusion (CTO) has been linked to worse survival. While controversial and limited to observational data, successful CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been associated with improved left ventricular (LV) function and mortality. However, the role of CTO PCI prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is not clear. We sought to explore the prognostic impact of a pre-TAVR CTO on post-TAVR outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed 783 consecutive TAVR cases performed at a single tertiary care medical center. Pre-TAVR angiograms were analyzed for the presence of a CTO. At the time of TAVR, 12.6% (n = 99) patients had a CTO. At one-year post-TAVR, there was no significant association between the presence of a CTO and death (14.2% vs 13.1%, p = 0.75), functional status, quality of life, or adverse events. There was also no difference in long-term survival (4.1 years vs 4.1 years, p = 0.55). LV ejection fraction was lower in the CTO group at baseline and one year (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a CTO did not have any prognostic impact on mortality, change in LV function, or improvement in functional status and angina scores following TAVR in our cohort of elderly, high-risk patients. CTO before TAVR was associated with decreased ejection fraction at baseline and at one year.
