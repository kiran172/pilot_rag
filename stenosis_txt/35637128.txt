Title: Systolic or diastolic CT image acquisition for transcatheter aortic valve replacement - An outcome analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the standard of care before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The aortic annulus undergoes conformational changes during the heart cycle. Therefore, the image acquisition time point can impact prosthesis sizing and fit. Clinical outcome data are lacking. The aim of this study was to compare systolic and diastolic cardiac CT data acquisition with regard to procedural and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: Preprocedural high-pitch helical CT datasets were analyzed in 1954 patients undergoing TAVR between 2013 and 2018 ​at our center. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the acquisition heart phase (979 systolic and 975 diastolic). The study was approved by the local ethics committee.
RESULTS: Median age was 81.6 [interquartile range 77.5-85.8] years and 964 (49.3%) patients were male. No significant difference was found for the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 (VARC-3) endpoints of technical failure (systolic, 5.1% vs. diastolic, 5.2%, p ​= ​0.94) or device failure (systolic, 13.7% vs. diastolic, 13.5%, p ​= ​0.92). There was no difference in paravalvular regurgitation. All-cause 30-day mortality was comparable (systolic, 3.6% [95% confidence interval, 2.4-4.7%] vs. diastolic, 3.6% [2.4-4.8%], p ​= ​1.00), while 3-year mortality rates were higher in the diastolic group (Society of Thoracic Surgeons score adjusted hazard ratio, 1.25 [1.07-1.46], p ​< ​0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: While the 30-day technical and clinical outcomes after TAVR are comparable between systolic and diastolic CT imaging, diastolic imaging was associated with higher long-term mortality. Therefore, the data support the guideline recommendation of systolic imaging.
