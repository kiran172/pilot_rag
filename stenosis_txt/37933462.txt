Title: Comparing Predictors Influencing Restenosis Following High-Dose Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty and Fluoropolymer-Based Drug-Eluting Stenting in Femoropopliteal Artery Lesions.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Despite widespread use of anti-restenosis devices, drug-coated balloons (DCBs) and drug-eluting stents (DESs), their appropriate use for femoropopliteal (FP) lesions has not been well investigated and the risk factors for restenosis have not been compared. To investigate risk factors associated with restenosis after endovascular therapy using DCB and DES for contemporary FP lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, retrospective, observational study evaluated 378 FP lesions in 273 patients treated with DCB (278 lesions in 193 patients) or DES (120 lesions in 106 patients). The DCB used was high-dose DCB (IN.PACT, Admiral. Medtronic, Inc.) and DES was fluoropolymer-based DES (ELUVIA, Boston Scientific). Vessel preparation failure was defined as a residual stenosis of ≥50% and a dissection grade of D or greater on pre-dilatation angiography. The outcome measure was restenosis, and factors associated with restenosis in the DCB and DES groups were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: The 2-year restenosis rate was not significantly different between the DCB and DES groups (29%±4% vs. 24%±5%, p=0.42). Interaction analysis demonstrated that popliteal lesions and plaque burden of ≥50% were restenosis-related factors for DES but not for DCB, whereas vessel preparation failure was a factor for DCB but not for DES (p<0.05). Vessel diameter of <6 mm and nodular calcification were risk factors in both groups (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: In contemporary FP lesions, smaller vessels and nodular calcification were shared restenosis-related factors for high-dose DCB and fluoropolymer-based DES. Popliteal lesions and plaque burden of ≥50% were restenosis-related factors for fluoropolymer-based DES and vessel preparation failure for high-dose DCB.
CLINICAL IMPACT: Shared and differential restenosis-related factors after endovascular therapy using high-dose drug-coated balloons (DCBs) and fluoropolymer-based drug-eluting stents (DESs) in contemporary femoropopliteal (FP) lesions are unclear. This single-center retrospective study included 378 FP lesions in 273 patients with lower-extremity arterial disease (high-dose DCB, 278 lesions in 193 patients; fluoropolymer-based DES, 120 lesions in 106 patients). Smaller vessels and calcified nodules were shared restenosis-related factors for both high-dose DCB and fluoropolymer-based DES, whereas popliteal lesions and plaque burden of ≥50% were restenosis-related factors for fluoropolymer-based DES and vessel preparation failure for high-dose DCB.
