Title: ACURATE neo: How Is This TAVR Valve Doing to Fit into an Increasingly Crowded Field?

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Critical appraisal of the available evidence on the self-expanding ACURATE neo transcatheter heart valve (THV) for the treatment of aortic valve disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: In an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized non-inferiority trial with broad inclusion criteria, ACURATE neo failed to meet non-inferiority compared with SAPIEN 3 with regard to a primary composite safety and efficacy endpoint at 30Â days. The difference was driven by higher rates of moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation and higher rates of acute kidney injury. In turn, registry data suggest that the safety and efficacy profile of the ACURATE neo is comparable to that of other commercially available devices. Randomized evidence indicated favorable hemodynamic results with large effective orifice areas and low residual gradients. The self-expanding ACURATE neo THV is associated with higher rates of residual aortic regurgitation compared to the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 THV. The supra-annular design with low residual gradients may be advantageous in patients with small anatomy and mild degree of calcification.
