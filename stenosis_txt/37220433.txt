Title: Moyamoya Disease and Steno-Occlusive Disease in a Young Stroke Patient: A Case Report.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis and occlusion of the intracranial arteries, resulting in the formation of collateral vessels. We present a case of a 24-year-old South Asian female with no prior medical history who presented with persistent headaches, right-hand numbness and pain, and global aphasia. Imaging revealed severe steno-occlusive disease involving the left internal carotid artery terminus, the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA), and the anterior cerebral artery. The patient underwent a hemicraniectomy due to malignant MCA syndrome and was prescribed aspirin and fluoxetine. Further evaluation with a cerebral angiogram revealed severe steno-occlusive disease involving the left internal carotid artery terminus, the proximal middle cerebral artery, and the anterior cerebral artery. The patient had Moyamoya disease. This case emphasizes the necessity of including Moyamoya disease in the differential diagnosis, as it can result in serious neurological impairments.
