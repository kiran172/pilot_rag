Title: Aqueductal developmental venous anomaly causing obstructive hydrocephalus: A case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: A developmental venous anomaly (DVA) is a venous drainage of the associated parenchyma that is normally asymptomatic. However, a DVA located adjacent to the aqueduct can cause obstructive hydrocephalus by blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. We describe a rare case of obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis secondary to a DVA. A 43-year-old man presented with sudden bilateral temporal pain during weight training. Using a 3-Tesla scanner, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and hydrocephalus was found with mild enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles. Susceptibility-weighted imaging and postcontrast MRI revealed that the DVA from the bilateral thalami narrowed the orifice of the aqueduct on its drainage route towards the vein of Galen. We assumed that force exerted during weight training may have caused dilation of the anomalous veins, leading to his symptom. A review of the relevant English-language literature yielded only 19 cases of aqueductal stenosis due to DVA. In comparison to these cases, the duration of symptom in our case was extremely short because the patient had a history of ventriculomegaly detected on plain computed tomography and was diagnosed quickly based on the characteristic finding of DVA: the caput medusae appearance.
