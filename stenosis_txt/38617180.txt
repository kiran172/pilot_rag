Title: Accuracy of 3.0T magnetic resonance angiography for the detection of arteriovenous fistula dysfunction in hemodialysis patients requiring interventional therapy: a prospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) is feasible to detect arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction in hemodialysis patients but is not sufficient to map the structure of fistula required for interventions. This study is designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) at 3.0T versus CDUS for AVF dysfunction, by using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as reference.
METHODS: This prospective study enrolled 68 consecutive patients with dysfunctional AVF who underwent both CDUS and TOF-MRA at Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The analysis of the dysfunctional AVFs was divided into three regions: the feeding artery, fistula and draining veins. In the whole- and per-regional-based analyses, two observers who were blinded to the clinical and DSA results independently analyzed all CDUS and TOF-MRA datasets. The image quality and stenosis severity of the lesions on TOF-MRA were evaluated. A receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to analyze the detection of AVF dysfunction with TOF-MRA.
RESULTS: A total of 204 vessel regions were evaluated. The whole-region-based image quality of TOF-MRA was poorer in patients with a total occlusion (1.8±0.8) than in those with stenosis (2.7±0.6, P&lt;0.001). In the whole-region analyses, TOF-MRA had higher sensitivity [99.1% (94.6-100.0%) vs. 82.9% (74.6-89.0%), P&lt;0.001] and similar specificity [93.1% (85.0-97.1%) vs. 94.3% (86.5-97.9%), P=0.755] than CDUS. The per-region-based analyses showed that TOF-MRA yielded higher sensitivity [fistula region, 98.1% (88.4-99.9%) vs. 80.8% (67.0-89.9%); P=0.004; draining vein region, 100.0% (92.5-100.0%) vs. 85.0% (72.9-2.5%); P=0.003] and similar specificity [fistula region, 88.2% (62.3-97.8%) vs. 88.2% (62.3-97.9%); P&gt;0.99; draining vein region, 100.0% (59.8-100.0%) vs. 87.5% (46.7-99.3%); P&gt;0.99] than CDUS. Sensitivity and specificity of TOF-MRA were comparable to those of CDUS in feeding artery region.
CONCLUSIONS: TOF-MRA is a feasible and accurate method to display AVF dysfunction in hemodialysis patients, and this method might fulfill the endovascular treatment planning requirements.
