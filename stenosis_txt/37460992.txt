Title: Endovascular treatment of symptomatic hepatic venous outflow obstruction post major liver resection.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate efficacy, safety, and outcomes of endovascular treatment of hepatic vein stenosis post major liver resection.
METHODS: A retrospective data analysis was performed including all interventional treatments of hepatic vein stenosis post major liver resection since 2010. Post procedural course and clinical parameters including amount of ascites accumulation and relevant laboratory values were assessed during the follow-up period. Primary and primary assisted hepatic venous patency time were calculated.
RESULTS: Twelve patients (median age 55.5, IQR 49.75 to 61.5 years) undergoing a total of 16 interventions were included. Interventions were primary stent placement (n = 3), primary balloon angioplasty (n = 8), three re-interventions and two aborted interventions (no significant pressure gradient). Technical success was 100% (16/16). Permanent reduction and / or complete resolution of ascites was achieved in 72% (8/11). Laboratory parameters related to liver function did not show significant improvement after intervention. Median follow-up period was 6 months (IQR: 1.5 to 18 months). The median primary patency time for patients with balloon angioplasty was 11 months (IQR: 1.375 to 22.25 months) and assisted patency time was 13.25 months (IQR: 4.5 to 22.25 months). The median primary patency time for patients with angioplasty and stent placement was 1 months (IQR: 1.0 to 1.5 months) and assisted patency time was 2.0 months (IQR: 1.5 to 2.5months).
CONCLUSION: An endovascular approach for the treatment of hepatic venous stenosis post major liver resection is safe and efficient to reduce and / or resolve refractory ascites. However, liver function parameters seem not to be improved by the procedure. Stent placement can be a reasonable option in patients with significant residual stenotic disease post angioplasty.
