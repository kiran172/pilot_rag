Title: Comparative Evaluation of Postoperative Epidural Hematoma after Lumbar Microendoscopic Laminotomy: The Utility of Ultrasonography versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Postoperative spinal epidural hematoma (PSEH) is a severe complication of spinal surgery that necessitates accurate and timely diagnosis. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of ultrasonography as an alternative diagnostic tool for PSEH after microendoscopic laminotomy (MEL) for lumbar spinal stenosis, comparing it with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: A total of 65 patients who underwent MEL were evaluated using both ultrasound- and MRI-based classifications for PSEH. Intra- and interrater reliabilities were analyzed. Furthermore, ethical standards were strictly followed, with spine surgeons certified by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association performing evaluations.
RESULTS: Among the 65 patients, 91 vertebral segments were assessed. The intra- and interrater agreements for PSEH classification were almost perfect for both ultrasound (κ=0.824 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.729-0.918] and κ=0.810 [95% CI 0.712-0.909], respectively) and MRI (κ=0.839 [95% CI 0.748-0.931] and κ=0.853 [95% CI 0.764-0.942], respectively). The results showed high concordance between ultrasound- and MRI-based classifications, validating the reliability of ultrasound in postoperative PSEH evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a significant advancement by introducing ultrasound as a precise and practical alternative to MRI for PSEH evaluation. The comparable accuracy of ultrasound to MRI, rapid bedside assessments, and radiation-free nature make it valuable for routine postoperative evaluations. Despite the limitations related to specific surgical contexts and clinical outcome assessment, the clinical potential of ultrasound is evident. It offers clinicians a faster, cost-effective, and repeatable diagnostic option, potentially enhancing patient care. This study establishes the utility of ultrasound in evaluating postoperative spinal epidural hematomas after MEL. With high concordance to MRI, ultrasound emerges as a reliable, practical, and innovative tool, promising improved diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes. Further studies should explore its clinical impact across diverse surgical scenarios.
