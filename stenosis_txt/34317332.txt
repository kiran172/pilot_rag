Title: Massive TAVR: Complex Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Setting of an Enormous Adnexal Mass.

Abstract: A 65-year-old woman with a large adnexal mass was found to have severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement was chosen rather than surgical aortic valve replacement because of concerns over risks. We demonstrate the value of pre-operative transcatheter aortic valve replacement before prompt noncardiac surgery. Furthermore, it illustrates some useful bailout techniques in this challenging scenario. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
