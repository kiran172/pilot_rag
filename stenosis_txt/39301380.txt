Title: Four-Vessel Umbilical Cord: Supernumerary Right Umbilical Vein With No Associated Congenital Anomalies.

Abstract: A four-vessel umbilical cord is a rare anomaly that can occur with abnormal persistence of the caudal portion of the vessel. Although supernumerary vessels can present as an isolated finding, they are known to be associated with multiple significant congenital anomalies. Ectopia cordis, pulmonary stenosis, cleft lip, cleft palate, situs inversus, tetralogy of Fallot, and gastroschisis are some anomalies associated with four-vessel cords. This is a case of a 22-year-old multigravida with a four-vessel umbilical cord initially found on sonography. The patient was sent to Maternal Fetal Medicine for evaluation. It was determined that the patient had a right supernumerary umbilical vein that did not require further workup. The patient presented to labor and delivery at 36 weeks and five days with regular contractions. After normal vaginal delivery without complications, the four-vessel-umbilical cord was visualized and confirmed by pathology. The patient and neonate both did well with no complications.
