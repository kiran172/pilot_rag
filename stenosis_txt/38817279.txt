Title: Is there a place for endoscopic management in post-cholecystectomy iatrogenic bile duct injuries?

Abstract: In this editorial we comment on the article by Emara et al published in the recent issue of the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery. Previously, surgery was the primary treatment for bile duct injuries (BDI). The treatment of BDI has advanced due to technological breakthroughs and minimally invasive procedures. Endoscopic and percutaneous treatments have largely supplanted surgery as the primary treatment for most instances in recent years. Patient management, including the specific technique, is typically impacted by local knowledge and the kind and severity of the injury. Endoscopic therapy is a highly successful treatment for postoperative benign bile duct stenosis and offers superior long-term outcomes compared to surgical correction. Based on the damage features of BDI, therapeutic options include endoscopic duodenal papillary sphincterotomy, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage, and endoscopic biliary stent implantation.
