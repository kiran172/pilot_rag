Title: 7 T MRI of the Cervical Neuroforamen: Assessment of Nerve Root Compression and Dorsal Root Ganglia in Patients With Radiculopathy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of 3-dimensional dual-echo steady-state (DESS) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine at 7 T compared with 3 T in patients with cervical radiculopathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy were prospectively recruited between March 2020 and January 2023 before undergoing surgical decompression and received 3-dimensional DESS imaging at 3 T and 7 T MRI. Cervical nerve root compression and the dimensions of the dorsal root ganglia were assessed by 2 radiologists independently. Signal intensity, visibility of nerve anatomy, diagnostic confidence, and image artifacts were evaluated with Likert scales. The degree of neuroforaminal stenosis was assessed on standard clinical 3 T scans. Statistics included the analysis of the diagnostic accuracy and interreader reliability. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess differences between the groups.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients (mean age, 57 Â± 12 years; 22 women) were included in the study with the highest prevalence of severe neuroforaminal stenosis observed at C6 (n = 68) followed by C7 (n = 43). Direct evaluation of nerve root compression showed significantly higher diagnostic confidence and visibility of cervical nerve rootlets, roots, and dorsal root ganglia on 7 T DESS than on 3 T DESS (diagnostic confidence: P = 0.01, visibility: P < 0.01). Assessment of nerve root compression using 7 T DESS allowed more sensitive grading than standard clinical MRI ( P < 0.01) and improved the performance in predicting sensory or motor dysfunction (area under the curve combined: 0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: 7 T DESS imaging allows direct assessment of cervical nerve root compression in patients with radiculopathy, with a better prediction of sensory or motor dysfunction than standard clinical MRI. Diagnostic confidence and image quality of 7 T DESS were superior to 3 T DESS.
