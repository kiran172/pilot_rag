Title: A novel MBTPS2 variant associated with BRESHECK syndrome impairs sterol-regulated transcription and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.

Abstract: Ichthyosis follicularis, atrichia, and photophobia syndrome (IFAP syndrome) is a rare, X-linked disorder caused by pathogenic variants in membrane-bound transcription factor protease, site 2 (MBTPS2). Pathogenic MBTPS2 variants also cause BRESHECK syndrome, characterized by the IFAP triad plus intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies. Here we present a patient with ichthyosis, sparse hair, pulmonic stenosis, kidney dysplasia, hypospadias, growth failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, bone marrow fibrosis, and chronic diarrhea found by research-based exome sequencing to harbor a novel, maternally inherited MBTPS2 missense variant (c.766â€‰G>A; (p.Val256Leu)). In vitro modeling supports variant pathogenicity, with impaired cell growth in cholesterol-depleted media, attenuated activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway, and failure to activate the endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway. Our case expands both the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of BRESHECK syndrome to include a novel MBTPS2 variant and cytopenias, bone marrow fibrosis, and chronic diarrhea.
