Title: Comparison of Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Versus Without Mitral Annular Calcium.

Abstract: There are limited data regarding the impact of mitral annular calcium (MAC) on the outcomes of patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent TAVI in 2018 and divided them into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of MAC, using a validated MAC computed tomography-based scoring system. Among 468 patients who underwent TAVI in 2018, 271 patients (58%) had MAC present compared with 197 patients (42%) without MAC. Compared with patients without MAC, patients in the MAC group were older (81 vs 79, p = 0.012), had a higher body mass index (29.30 vs 28.05, p = 0.031), lower left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (4.47 vs 4.80, p &lt;0.001), higher mitral valve mean gradient (4.54 vs 3.01, p = 0.031), and a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score (5.69 vs 4.91, p = 0.127). There was no significant difference in the with versus without MAC groups in the all-cause mortality (at 1 year: 9% vs 6%, p = 0.8; at 2 years: 15% vs 13%, p = 0.47), incidence of myocardial infarction (1% vs 2%, p = 0.417), stroke (1% vs 3%, p = 0.4), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (17% vs 19%, p = 0.53) at 1 year. Although the rate of new-onset left bundle branch block was higher in patients with MAC, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the rates of complete atrioventricular block (5% vs 3%, p = 0.483) or the need for pacemaker implantation (6% vs 3%, p = 0.168). The post-TAVI peak aortic valve gradient was comparable between the groups with and without MAC (22.52 vs 22.60, p = 0.931). In conclusion, TAVI is a safe alternative for patients with severe aortic stenosis and concomitant MAC, with comparable outcomes to patients without MAC.
