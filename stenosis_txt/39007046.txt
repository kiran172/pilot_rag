Title: A case of hybrid robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting and valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: We report a hybrid procedure of robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting and transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation for left main disease and prosthetic aortic valve stenosis. Robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting using a left internal mammary artery graft was preferred to percutaneous coronary intervention because of the complex anatomy of the coronary lesion and concerns about dual antiplatelet therapy tolerance. This was followed by a valve-in-valve procedure five days later, allowing the patient to be discharged the next day. This innovative, less invasive approach demonstrates the feasibility and potential for early recovery in appropriately selected patients with complex coronary and aortic valve disease.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Hybrid robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a feasible and less invasive approach for appropriately selected patients with complex coronary and aortic valve disease who are not good candidates for percutaneous coronary intervention or conventional CABG and surgical AVR.
