Title: Full endoscopic unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression of the cervical spine: surgical technique and early experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Full-endoscopic decompression surgery has been shown to be safe and efficacious in the lumbar spine, while its role remains to be determined in the cervical spine. We describe the utility of cervical endoscopic unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (CE-ULBD) in a series of elderly patients with severe central stenosis, significant medical comorbidity, and existing cervical deformity.
METHODS: A prospectively collected spine surgery registry at the University of Washington was retrospectively queried for patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy receiving CE-ULBD. Demographic data, operative details, imaging, and patient reported outcomes, including visual analogue scale (VAS) for neck and upper extremity pain, Nurick grade, and the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score, were reviewed. Description of the surgical technique is provided. Descriptive statistics were calculated.
RESULTS: From 2014 through 2018, 10 patients with an average age of 70.2±5.0 years underwent CE-ULBD for symptomatic upper cervical stenosis due to ligamentum flavum buckling. Half of these patients had one stenotic segment, the other half had two stenotic segments. The most commonly affected segment was C3/4 (5/10 patients). Average length of surgery was 128±18.4 minutes. Average length of stay was 1.2±0.2 days. Average clinical follow-up time was 22.0±4.7 months; clinical outcomes at most recent follow-up were improved via both the Nurick grade (1.2±0.4, P<0.01) and modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (14.6±1.0, P<0.001) compared with pre-operative values. One patient experienced a transient loss of motor evoked potentials intraoperatively, but there were no cases of permanent neurological deficit.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe central cervical stenosis is a safe and viable target for full-endoscopic decompression via an interlaminar approach.
