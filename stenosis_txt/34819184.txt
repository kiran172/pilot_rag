Title: The end of tracheostomal stenosis? Introducing the fish mouth technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Post-laryngectomy tracheostomal stenosis is common and often results in an inadequate airway. Several techniques have been described to minimise tracheostomal stenosis. The star technique involves an 'X' incision with four flaps sutured into the trachea. The petal technique involves two inferior flaps on either side being sutured into the trachea. The authors combined the star and petal techniques, resulting in an innovative fish mouth technique.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This innovation involves two lateral skin flaps being sutured into an incision on either side of the lateral wall of the trachea. This results in an elongated, broadened and elliptical tracheostoma, mimicking that of a fish mouth.
CONCLUSION: Benefits of the fish mouth technique include adequate stoma size for respiration, easier clearing of secretions, self-sufficiency without a stent, easier cleaning of a tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis, and stoma occlusion for voice production. The fish mouth technique is easily reproducible and suitable for those with a voice prosthesis.
