Title: Adverse Respiratory Events After Pediatric Endoscopic Airway Surgeries.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Perioperative risk stratification of pediatric patients undergoing airway intervention remains crucial in identifying those at a higher risk of requiring postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) care. Here we determined the likelihood of and possible risk factors for developing perioperative adverse respiratory events (PAREs) requiring ICU care after various pediatric endoscopic airway surgeries (EASs).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who were aged <18 years and underwent EAS between 2015 and 2021. Early postoperative adverse events within 24 h of surgery were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: Overall, 99 patients who underwent EAS were included. The age at the time of the intervention ranged from 8 months to 18 years. Fifty-eight patients, median age was 4.83 years, underwent papilloma debulking with no high likelihood of PARE in this patient subgroup (OR = 0.48; 0.16-1.44). Twenty-five patients, median age was 9.72 years, underwent balloon dilation of laryngotracheal stenosis with no increase in the likelihood of PARE in this patient population (OR = 2.02; 0.65-6.28). Early postoperative respiratory events occurred in 16 patients (16.2%). Most of these events (75%) manifested within 4 h after surgery. In a univariate analysis, intervention at the level of the subglottis or 2 or more laryngeal subsites increased the risk of PARE (OR = 6.57; 1.11-12.52 and OR = 3.73; 1.93-22.34, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, only intervention in the subglottic area maintained its effect (OR = 6.84; 1.82-25.65).
CONCLUSION: Respiratory adverse events following pediatric EAS are not uncommon, and the majority are encountered shortly after surgery. Intervention in the subglottic area was an independent predictor of PARE.
