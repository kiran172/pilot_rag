Title: Vertebral Artery Stenoses Contribute to the Development of Diffuse Plaques in the Basilar Artery.

Abstract: Vertebral artery (VA) stenosis is relevant to a high early risk of recurrent stroke and basilar artery (BA) is the most common intracranial site of atherosclerotic lesions. It is important to show predictive risk factors for transient ischemic attack (TIA) or posterior infarctions. The aim of the study is to investigate morphometry and hemodynamics in intracranial vertebral and basilar arteries of health and diseased patients to enhance the risk assessment. Based on the geometrical model reconstructed from CTA images in 343 patients, a transient three-dimensional computational model was used to determine the hemodynamics. Patients were classified in symmetric, asymmetric, hypoplastic, and stenotic groups while patients in the stenotic group were divided into unilateral, bilateral, bifurcation, and tandem stenotic sub-groups. Patients in bilateral, bifurcation, and tandem stenotic sub-groups had significantly lower basilar artery diameters than other groups. Patients in the stenotic group had significantly higher surface area ratio (SAR) of high time-averaged wall shear stress gradient (TAWSSG) and higher incidence of TIAs or posterior infarctions than other groups while patients in the tandem stenotic sub-group had the highest values (SAR-TAWSSG of 57 Â± 22% and TIAs or posterior infarction incidence of 54%). The high SAR-TAWSSG is predisposed to induce TIAs or posterior infarction.
