Title: Lumbar spinal stenosis is a risk factor for the development of dementia: locomotive syndrome and health outcomes in the Aizu cohort study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: It remains unclear whether musculoskeletal diseases are risk factors for dementia development. This prospective cohort study of community-dwelling residents aimed to clarify the impact of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) on dementia development.
METHODS: We included participants aged ≥ 65 years from the Locomotive Syndrome and Health Outcomes in the Aizu cohort study. LSS was diagnosed using the validated LSS diagnostic support tool. Dementia development between 2008 and 2015 was investigated using official long-term care insurance certification data. We analysed the effects of LSS on dementia development after adjusting for potential confounders, like age, sex, diabetes, depressive symptoms, hip and knee joint osteoarthritis, daily activity, and smoking habit.
RESULTS: We included 1220 patients in the final analysis. The incidence of dementia was significantly higher in the LSS group [48 of 444 (10.8%)] than in the control group [34 of 776 (4.4%)]. Multivariable analysis using multiple imputations revealed that the confidence interval for the adjusted odds ratio of LSS for dementia development was 1.87 (95% confidence interval; 1.14-3.07).
CONCLUSION: We clarified that LSS is an independent risk factor for dementia development. Our findings suggest the importance of considering the risk of dementia in the decision-making process for the treatment of LSS.
