Title: Echocardiographic diagnosis of Shone's syndrome.

Abstract: Shone's syndrome is a rare congenital heart disease that includes 4 cardiovascular anomalies: supravalvular mitral ring, parachute mitral valve, subaortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. Early diagnosis and treatment result in better outcomes. Echocardiography plays an important role in the diagnosis and is the optimal examination for detecting this disease. Pressure gradients are often unreliable and inaccurate; thus, careful anatomical observation of the left ventricular inflow and outflow tracts, particularly the mitral valve, is vital for accurate diagnosis and planning appropriate management. Herein, we describe 9 cases of Shone's syndrome, diagnosed with echocardiography and treated surgically.
