Title: Loss of Baz1b in mice causes perinatal lethality, growth failure, and variable multi-system outcomes.

Abstract: BAZ1B is one of 25-27 coding genes deleted in canonical Williams syndrome, a multi-system disorder causing slow growth, vascular stenosis, and gastrointestinal complaints, including constipation. BAZ1B is involved in (among other processes) chromatin organization, DNA damage repair, and mitosis, suggesting reduced BAZ1B may contribute to Williams syndrome symptoms. In mice, loss of Baz1b causes early neonatal death. 89.6% of Baz1b-/- mice die within 24Â h of birth without vascular anomalies or congenital heart disease (except for patent ductus arteriosus). Some (&lt;50%) Baz1b-/- were noted to have prolonged neonatal cyanosis, patent ductus arteriosus, or reduced lung aeration, and none developed a milk spot. Meanwhile, 35.5% of Baz1b+/- mice die over the first three weeks after birth. Surviving Baz1b heterozygotes grow slowly (with variable severity). 66.7% of Baz1b+/- mice develop bowel dilation, compared to 37.8% of wild-type mice, but small bowel and colon transit studies were normal. Additionally, enteric neuron density appeared normal in Baz1b-/- mice except in distal colon myenteric plexus, where neuron density was modestly elevated. Combined with several rare phenotypes (agnathia, microphthalmia, bowel dilation) recovered, our work confirms the importance of BAZ1B in survival and growth and suggests that reduced copy number of BAZ1B may contribute to the variability in Williams syndrome phenotypes.
