Title: Presepsin predicts 1-year all-cause mortality better than N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Aim: Presepsin is a sensitive biomarker for the diagnosis and estimation of prognosis in septic patients. The prognostic role of presepsin in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has never been investigated. Patients, materials &amp; methods: In 343 patients, presepsin and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were measured before TAVI. One-year all-cause mortality was used as outcome measure. Results: Patients with high presepsin levels were more likely to succumb than patients with low presepsin values (16.9% vs 12.3%; p = 0.015). Elevated presepsin remained a significant predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (odds ratio: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.12-4.29]; p = 0.022) after adjustment. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide did not predict 1-year all-cause mortality. Conclusion: Elevated baseline presepsin levels are an independent predictor of 1-year mortality in TAVI patients.
