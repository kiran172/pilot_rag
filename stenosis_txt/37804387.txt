Title: Association of LDL-C level with neoatherosclerosis and plaque vulnerability in patients with late restenosis: an optical coherence tomography study.

Abstract: Neoatherosclerosis (NA) is a significant contributor to late stent failure; however, predictors of late in-stent restenosis (ISR) with NA have not been systematically reported. This study aimed to identify predictors of NA incidence and plaque vulnerability in patients with late ISR and the role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in this process. A total of 216 patients with 216 lesions who underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) before interventional procedure for late drug-eluting stent ISR were enrolled and divided into NA and non-NA groups based on OCT findings. Results showed that higher LDL-C levels were associated with NA, thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), intimal disruption, plaque erosion, and thrombosis. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the LDL-C level was an independent risk factor for NA and TCFA. The LDL-C levels exhibited a significant predictive value for NA and TCFA, surpassing other factors such as stent age and other lipid types. In conclusion, a high LDL-C level is an independent predictor of NA incidence and plaque vulnerability in patients with late ISR.
