Title: Prevalence and associated factors of atrial fibrillation among patients with rheumatic heart disease attending public referral hospitals in Bahir Dar city, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a supraventricular arrhythmia associated with uncoordinated atrial activation. Atrial fibrillation is complication of rheumatic heart disease and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. It is a growing public health problem and economic and social burden. Studies investigating the prevalence and factors associated with atrial fibrillation among chronic rheumatic heart disease patients in Ethiopia are scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with atrial fibrillation in patients with chronic rheumatic heart disease.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 410 patients were selected using a systematic random sampling method. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 and subsequently exported to SPSS version 26 software for analysis. A binary logistic regression model was applied to identify significant variables related to AF.
RESULTS: In this study, 410 patient charts were reviewed. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 43% (95% CI of 38% up to 48%). Male (AOR = 3.81, 95% CI 2.00-7.26), age greater than 30 years (AOR = 7.26, 95% CI 3.93-13.41), heart failure (AOR = 4.65, 95% CI 2.39-9.04), mitral valve stenosis (AOR = 6.36, 95% CI 2.92-13.87), and left atrial diameter enlargement (AOR = 3.41, 95% CI 1.64-7.09) were associated with atrial fibrillation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Atrial fibrillation leads patients to frequent hospital admission and increases hospital mortality. As a result, health care professionals need to pay more attention to and apply more clinical treatment for older patients, those with heart failure, those with mitral valve stenosis, and those with left atrial diameter enlargement-associated causes of atrial fibrillation.
