Title: Haemodynamic and clinical outcomes at 5 years according to predicted prosthesis-patient mismatch after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although the impact of predicted prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM<sub>P</sub>) on outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement is well established, studies on PPM<sub>P</sub> in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are limited. This study investigated the effects of PPM<sub>p</sub> on haemodynamic and 5-year clinical outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS/MATERIALS: We analysed 1733 patients who underwent TAVR. PPM<sub>p</sub> was defined using two different methods: 1) normal reference values of the effective orifice area for each valve type and size indexed to body surface area (PPM<sub>p1</sub>; n = 1733) and 2) reference values for aortic annulus area or perimeter assessed with pre-procedural computed tomography indexed to body surface area (PPM<sub>p2</sub>; n = 1227). The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause death and/or rehospitalisation for heart failure at 5 years.
RESULTS: The incidence of PPM<sub>p1</sub> was 11.7 % and 0.8 % in moderate and severe cases, respectively. PPM<sub>p2</sub> was classified as either moderate (3.8 %) or severe (0 %). Rates of residual mean aortic gradient ≥20 mmHg significantly increased depending on PPM<sub>p1</sub> severity (no PPM<sub>p1</sub>: 3.1 % vs. moderate PPM<sub>p1</sub>: 26.8 % vs. severe PPM<sub>p1</sub>: 53.9 %, p &lt; 0.0001) and PPM<sub>p2</sub> (no PPM<sub>p2</sub>: 4.1 % vs. moderate PPM<sub>p2</sub>: 12.8 %, p = 0.0049). Neither of PPM<sub>P</sub> methods were associated with the composite outcome in total cohort; however, PPM<sub>P1</sub> was significantly related to worse clinical outcomes at 5 years among patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in multivariate analysis (HR: 1.87; 95 % CI: 1.02-3.43).
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of PPM<sub>P</sub> on TAVR clinical outcomes may not be negligible in patients with low LVEF.
