Title: A Case of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for the Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis with Multiple Organ Dysfunction.

Abstract: A 77-year-old woman with extremely high risk of mortality due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) and multiple organ failure was admitted to the affiliated hospital of Jiangsu University. She did not receive regular treatment since being diagnosed with AS 17 months previously. Frequent breakout of acute left heart failure after admission, with a low ostium of the left coronary artery showed by computed tomography, the patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Though cardiac conduction system abnormalities and a short-term elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure occurred in this patient after TAVR, she eventually recovered and her quality of life improved significantly. As the population adapted to TAVR keeps expanding, we believe this operation will play a more important role in the treatment of AS patients.
