Title: Outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients with extreme large infarction core.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and large infarction core may still benefit from mechanical thrombectomy (MT). In this study, we evaluate outcomes of MT in LVO patients presenting with extremely large infarction core Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS 0-2).
METHODS: Data from the Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry (STAR) was interrogated. We identified thrombectomy patients presenting with an occlusion in the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) or M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery and extremely large infarction core (ASPECTS 0-2). A favorable outcome was defined by achieving a modified Rankin scale of 0-3 at 90 days post-MT. Successful recanalization was defined by achieving a modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) score ≥2B.
RESULTS: We identified 58 patients who presented with ASPECTS 0-2 and underwent MT. Median age was 74.0 (66.3-80.0) years, 30 (51.7%) were females, and 16 (27.6%) patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. There was no difference regarding the location of the occlusion (p=0.57). Aspiration thrombectomy was performed in 34 (64.2%) patients and stent retriever was used in 8 (15.1%) patients. In patients presenting with ASPECTS 0-2 the mortality rate was 41.4%, 31% had mRS 0-3 at day 90, 66.67% ≥70 years of age had mRS of 5-6 at day 90. On multivariable analysis, age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission, and successful recanalization (mTICI ≥2B) were independently associated with favorable outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This multicentered, retrospective cohort study suggests that MT may be beneficial in a select group of patients with ASPECTS 0-2.
