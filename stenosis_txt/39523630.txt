Title: Ultrasound-based prevalence of polyvascular disease and its association with adverse outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

Abstract: Objective: Polyvascular disease (polyVD) often coexists with coronary artery disease (CAD). We aim to investigate the prevalence of polyVD using the method of ultrasound and find its association with adverse outcomes in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients. Methods: This retrospective and cross-sectional study included 1344 patients with a mean age of 61.4 years. Presence of peripheral artery atherosclerotic plaque and stenosis was assessed using the method of ultrasound. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to investigate the association of polyVD with in-hospital all-cause death. Results: 52.1% of the patients had polyVD and among which 31.9% had one additional arterial bed involvement and 20.2% had two or three additional arterial beds involvement. Patients with two or three involved arterial beds had worse baseline characteristics. In-hospital all-cause death rate increased with the number of involved arterial beds (1.1% in patients with only CAD vs 3.7% in patients with two or three involved arterial beds), and this trend was more prominent in elderly patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that polyVD patients with two or three involved arterial beds had about three times the risk for all-cause death. Conclusions: Prevalence of polyVD assessed by ultrasound was high in CABG patients and it was significantly associated with in-hospital all-cause death. Our study may provide additive information for preoperative risk stratification in CABG patients.
