Title: Exploring the link between cardiovascular risk factors and manifestations in latent tuberculosis infection: a comprehensive literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The global burden of tuberculosis (TB) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is overt, and the prevalence of this double burden disease remains steadily rising, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This review aims to explore the association between latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and the development of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to this relationship.
MAIN BODY: Approximately 25% of the global population carries a dormant form of tuberculosis (TB) infection. During this latent stage, certain subsets of mycobacteria actively reproduce, and recent research suggests that latent TB infection (LTBI) is connected to persistent, long-term low-grade inflammation that can potentially contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The presence of LTBI can be confirmed through a positive result on either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Several plausible explanations for the association between LTBI and CVD include increased inflammation, autoimmunity related to heat shock proteins (HSP), and the presence of pathogens within the developing atherosclerotic plaque. The most commonly observed cardiovascular events and risk factors associated with LTBI are acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery stenosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: This article highlights the critical role of LTBI in perpetuating the tuberculosis disease cycle and its association with cardiovascular risk factors. Chronic and persistent low inflammation underlined the association. Identifying high-risk LTBI patients and providing targeted preventive medication are crucial strategies for global TB eradication and interrupting transmission chains.
