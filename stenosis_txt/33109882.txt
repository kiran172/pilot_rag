Title: Complications of Endovascular Treatment in Fibromuscular Dysplasia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia affects generally renal artery, causing renovascular hypertension. The most classical angiographic pattern, string-of-beads, can be found in cervical and more rarely in other arteries. With the advance of endovascular procedures techniques, the number of open surgeries is decreasing, and complications related to the selective catheterization of diseased vessels are increasing.
CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old man presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage was submitted to angioplasty for dissecting aneurysms of vertebral artery with a good outcome. Several arteries were angiographically diagnosed with the dysplasia (renal, carotid, femoral), and some complications like stenosis, dissection, arteriovenous fistula, and dissecting aneurysm occurred in sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: FMD of cervical arteries is usually asymptomatic. There are no guidelines or protocols to cervical FMD treatment, being indicated only for the complications. Because of the vessels fragility, a several spontaneous or post endovascular procedure complications can be disastrous.
