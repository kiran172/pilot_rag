Title: Management of Tracheobronchial Stenosis in Chondrodysplasia Punctata.

Abstract: Chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP) is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by aberrant, punctate deposition of calcium during endochondral bone formation, resulting in the characteristic finding of epiphyseal stippling on radiographs. While otolaryngologic manifestations such as nasomaxillary hypoplasia and mixed hearing loss are common, tracheobronchial calcification occurs rarely in neonates with CDP. The management of CDP-related airway stenosis is complex and there is limited literature pertaining to outcomes of airway interventions. Herein, we describe the clinical course and outcome of tracheal dilation for a newborn patient with CDP. Laryngoscope, 134:1464-1468, 2024.
