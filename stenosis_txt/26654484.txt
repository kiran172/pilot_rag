Title: The cause of pyloric stenosis of infancy: A hyperacidity pathogenesis.

Abstract: The cause of pyloric stenosis of infancy (PS) is at present unknown. A theory of causation is proposed which is consistent with all the known clinical features of this condition. It is based on the knowledge that PS babies are hypersecretors of acid which pre-dates the development of PS and is an inherited constitutional feature. This acidity will become temporarily and dangerously high due to an insensitivity of the negative feed-back between gastrin and gastric acidy within the first few weeks of life. Normal babies who have inherited normal acidity will also experience peak acid secretions at that time but will be much less acid than babies destined to develop PS. Acid entering the duodenum causes contraction of the pyloric sphincter. Hyperacidity will naturally lead to repeated pyloric sphincter contractions and sphincter hypertrophy. Inappropriate repeated feeding of the vomiting PS baby by a first-time overanxious mother to her ever hungry baby, by provoking feed related sphincter contraction is considered to play a significant part in pathogenesis. Should the baby with PS survive beyond the age of around 6weeks, the matured negative feed-back between gastrin and acid will ensure that dangerous hyperacidity is kept in check. This coupled with the natural pyloric canal widening with age, will lead then to an long lasting cure. This theory explains satisfactorily all the known and hitherto unexplained features of this condition.
