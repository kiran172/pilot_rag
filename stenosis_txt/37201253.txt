Title: Additional rescue stenting with Neuroform Atlas stents during stent-assisted coiling of saccular aneurysms.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Overlapping stenting is sometimes attempted during endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysm as a rescue for coil herniation, stent mal-positioning, or in-stent thrombosis. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy and safety of additional rescue stenting (ARS) in telescoping fashion with Neuroform Atlas stent (NAS) during stent-assisted coiling of saccular aneurysms.
METHODS: We collected clinical and radiological data of patients with saccular aneurysms treated with ARS using NASs between March 2018 and December 2021. Y or X-stent-assisted coiling technique was excluded.
RESULTS: Eighteen unruptured and 5 ruptured aneurysms in 23 patients were treated with ARS using NASs. Sizes of aneurysms ranged from 2.0 mm to 10.0 mm (mean: 5.0 mm). Immediate angiographic results were complete occlusion in 11 aneurysms, residual neck in 4 aneurysms, and residual sac in 8 aneurysms. Peri-operative morbidity was 4.3 %. Nineteen of 23 patients underwent follow-up conventional angiography (mean, 9.9 months). Results showed progressive occlusion in 10 (52.6 %) cases and asymptomatic in-stent stenosis in 3 (15.8 %) cases. At the end of the observation period (mean, 17.4 months), all 18 patients without subarachnoid hemorrhage had excellent clinical outcomes (mRS of 0), except one (mRS of 1). Of five patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, four had a favorable outcome (mRS of 0-1), while the other one was dependent (mRS of 4).
CONCLUSION: In this report on 23 patients, ARS with NASs for treating saccular aneurysms showed good technical safety with favorable clinical and angiographic outcomes. However, delayed in-stent stenosis was not uncommon. Thus, regular imaging follow-up is required.
