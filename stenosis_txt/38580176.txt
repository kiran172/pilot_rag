Title: Prognostic impact of insomnia in patients receiving trans-catheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The presence of insomnia exhibits a profound association with diverse cardiovascular pathologies. However, its prognostic implications in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis remain ambiguous.
METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent TAVR for severe aortic stenosis at a prominent academic center from 2015 to 2022. The impact of insomnia, operationally defined as the prescription of soporific agents, on the two-year composite primary outcome comprising all-cause mortality and hospital readmissions was scrutinized.
RESULTS: A cohort of 345 patients (median age 85 years, 99 males) was encompassed in the analysis. All subjects underwent successful TAVR and subsequent discharge. The presence of insomnia (N = 91) emerged as an independent predictor of the two-year composite endpoint, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.66 (95 % confidence interval 1.08-2.57, p = 0.022), significantly delineating the two-year cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint (40 % versus 30 %, p = 0.035).
CONCLUSION: Approximately one-fourth of TAVR candidates manifested symptoms of insomnia, a condition autonomously correlated with heightened mortality and morbidity following the TAVR procedure. The optimal strategy for addressing insomnia in TAVR candidates constitutes a paramount consideration for future interventions.
