Title: Laparoscopic surgery for sigmoid colon cancer with complicated communication between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries.

Abstract: To perform complete mesocolic excision with central vessel ligation, it is important to recognize the vessel anomaly and the location of the tumor. For left-sided colon cancer, the variations in the course of the left colic artery and accessary middle colic artery must be recognized preoperatively. Here, we describe our experience with a 57-year-old man who was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer with complicated inter-mesenteric connections between the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), possibly due to median arcuate ligament syndrome. We performed laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with low ligation of the IMA to preserve the extremely enlarged left colic artery. The total operative time was 155 minutes, and the estimated total blood loss was 10 mL. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 9 without any postoperative complications. For patients with vascular anomalies in the left-sided mesocolon, preoperatively ruling out SMA stenosis by using angiography and 3-D CT might be important.
