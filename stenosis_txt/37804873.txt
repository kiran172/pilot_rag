Title: Complete circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection for early Barrett's neoplasia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is carving out an increasing role in the treatment of esophageal neoplasia in the Western world. Contrary to Asia, most esophageal cancers in North America are associated with Barrett's esophagus. Patients with circumferential advanced neoplasia were previously managed by esophagectomy, but an increased experience with ESD has allowed for an endoscopic alternative. We present our experience with complete circumferential esophageal ESD at a North American referral center.
METHODS: All patients undergoing 100% circumferential esophageal ESD between October 2016 and January 2023 at a single tertiary care center in Canada were included in the cohort. Demographics, procedural data, and lesion characteristics are presented in this series.
RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent 100% circumferential esophageal ESD during this period for Barrett's neoplasia. All patients had technically successful procedures with en-bloc resection. Nine patients (82%) had R0 resections, defined as clear lateral and deep margins on histologic examination. Two patients had positive deep margins on histologic examination and proceeded to esophagectomy. Seven patients (64%) had adenocarcinoma on the final pathology, of which 6 (86%) had upstaging from their initial biopsy sampling results. The median area of resected specimen was 48 cm2 (interquartile range [IQR], 26-80), and the median procedure time was 231 minutes (IQR, 180-246). Procedural efficiency was 4.0 min/cm2 (IQR, 2.7-5). Two patients (18%) developed refractory strictures after the procedure, which were endoscopically managed to resolution.
CONCLUSIONS: Multifocal dysplastic Barrett's esophagus remains a challenging entity to treat. Circumferential ESD is a possible therapeutic option, with high procedural success and a low rate of adverse outcomes. This should be balanced against the risk of stricture development, as the optimal postprocedural prophylaxis regimen is investigated.
