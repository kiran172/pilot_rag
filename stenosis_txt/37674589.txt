Title: Limb shaking transient ischemic attack secondary to innominate artery stenosis.

Abstract: Limb shaking transient ischemic attack is a rare disease manifestation typically caused by carotid stenosis but rarely caused by flow-limiting lesions involving more proximal vasculature. We demonstrate a case of limb shaking transient ischemic attack secondary to innominate stenosis in a 69-year-old woman who presented after a left leg shaking spell that caused her to fall and fracture her ipsilateral tibia. She did not experience changes in mentation and did not show any evidence of a postictal period. After receiving a comprehensive workup, she successfully underwent revascularization with innominate artery stenting. Continuous retrograde aspiration with the Enroute system (Silk Road Medical) and carotid clamping were used for embolic protection.
