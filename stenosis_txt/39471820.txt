Title: Effect of remote ischemic preconditioning on cerebral circulation time in severe carotid artery stenosis: Results from the RIC-CCT trial.

Abstract: In patients with severe internal carotid artery stenosis (sICAS), cerebral circulation time (CCT) is associated with cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. This study aims to investigate the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIC) on CCT in patients with sICAS. Patients are randomly assigned to the RIC group (RIC twice daily, for 2-4Â days before carotid artery stenting [CAS] as an adjunct to standard medical therapy) and the control group. The results show that RIC produces a significant decrease in CCT of the stenosis side (sCCT) from baseline to pre-CAS, and the occurrence of contrast staining on brain computed tomography (CT) is lower in RIC versus control group after CAS. In addition, significant changes in some serum biomarkers suggest that anti-neuroinflammation, anti-oxidative stress, protecting endothelial injury, and improving cerebral autoregulation may be associated with the effect of RIC. These findings provide supporting evidence that RIC can modulate cerebral circulation in patients with sICAS. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05451030).
