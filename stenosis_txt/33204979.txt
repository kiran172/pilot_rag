Title: Treatment of heavily calcified coronary artery stenosis using 3.5 mm peripheral intravascular lithotripsy balloon: case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prevalence of coronary artery calcification is high among patients with advanced age, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Percutaneous coronary intervention of heavily calcified coronary artery remains a significant challenge for interventional cardiologists. Although there are several modalities available in treating calcified coronary arteries, lesion preparation of certain heavily calcified vessels remains inadequate prior to stent deployment and/or often associated with worse periprocedural adverse outcomes.
CASE SUMMARY: We report feasibility and safety of 3.5â€‰mm peripheral intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) for the treatment of severely calcified coronary stenosis in two patients after orbital atherectomy failed to debulk calcified plaque to enable stent deployment.
DISCUSSION: Intravascular lithotripsy has recently emerged as a therapeutic option in treating calcified peripheral artery disease. However, coronary IVL is currently available only in a few centres in the USA. Studies are ongoing in the safety and efficacy of this technology in treating coronaries.
