Title: Balloon pulmonary angioplasty in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is caused by chronic stenosis or obstruction of the pulmonary arteries due to thromboembolism. Although previous studies have shown untreated CTEPH has a poor prognosis, the establishment of gold-standard therapies including pulmonary endarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA), and medical therapy has improved hemodynamics and right ventricular function, leading to good long-term survival. BPA is an important therapy for patients with inoperable CTEPH, although the procedure is currently limited to specific institutions and operators. This review discusses the development of the rapidly evolving field of CTEPH that includes improvements in imaging modalities and advances in surgical and interventional techniques.
