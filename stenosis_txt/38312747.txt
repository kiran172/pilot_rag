Title: Removal of a Metallic Stent after 9 Years of Placement That Caused Tracheal Stenosis: A Rare Case Report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Metallic stents are widely used to prevent airway obstruction for tracheal stenosis caused by malignant diseases. Although their efficacy has been recognized, there is no established evidence surrounding their long-term safety. We report a case of airway stenosis caused by a metallic tracheal stent. Removal of the stent to secure the airway was difficult and extremely complicated.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old male suffering from dyspnea caused by malignant lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) of the thyroid gland was treated with a metallic tracheal stent. After remission of the lymphoma, stenosis of the stent lumen developed gradually, and the patient complained of dyspnea. Tracheostomy could not be performed due to the metallic stent. Since the patient was unable to intubate, the stent was removed under general anesthesia with partial percutaneous cardiopulmonary support 9 years after the stent placement.
CONCLUSION: Otolaryngologists should be aware of the possibility of severe stenosis following the long-term placement of a metallic tracheal stent.
