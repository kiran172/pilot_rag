Title: TAVR in an XXXL annulus (1057 mm2 ) with type I bicuspid aortic valve.

Abstract: We report the largest annulus (&gt;1000 m2 ) treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement to date. It highlights the unique challenges in planning, sizing, and deployment considerations in the setting of a very large and altered geometry of a bicuspid aortic valve.
