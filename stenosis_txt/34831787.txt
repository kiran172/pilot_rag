Title: Neurosurgical Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Central Germany: A Retrospective Single Center Study of the Second Wave.

Abstract: The healthcare system has been placed under an enormous burden by the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addition to the challenge of providing sufficient care for COVID-19 patients, there is also a need to ensure adequate care for non-COVID-19 patients. We investigated neurosurgical care in a university hospital during the pandemic. We examined the second wave of the pandemic from 1 October 2020 to 15 March 2021 in this retrospective single-center study and compared it to a pre-pandemic period from 1 October 2019 to 15 March 2020. Any neurosurgical intervention, along with patient- and treatment-dependent factors, were recorded. We also examined perioperative complications and unplanned readmissions. A statistical comparison of the study groups was performed. We treated 535 patients with a total of 602 neurosurgical surgeries during the pandemic. This compares to 602 patients with 717 surgeries during the pre-pandemic period. There were 67 fewer patients (reduction to 88.87%) admitted and 115 fewer surgeries (reduction to 83.96%) performed, which were essentially highly elective procedures, such as cervical spinal stenosis, intracranial neurinomas, and peripheral nerve lesions. Regarding complication rates and unplanned readmissions, there was no significant difference between the COVID-19 pandemic and the non-pandemic patient group. Operative capacities were slightly reduced to 88% due to the pandemic. Nevertheless, comprehensive emergency and elective care was guaranteed in our university hospital. This speaks for the sufficient resources and high-quality processes that existed even before the pandemic.
