Title: Middle Meningeal Artery Embolization in the Treatment of Acute Subdural Hematoma: A Case Series Featuring Access Through a Carotid Stent.

Abstract: The first objective of this case series was to describe the case of a patient with severe symptomatic left internal carotid artery stenosis after a recent stroke. Several days after stent placement by transcarotid artery revascularization, the patient developed a left-sided subdural hematoma. The patient then underwent embolization of the left middle meningeal artery (MMA) despite blocked access to the left MMA because of an internal carotid stent. The external carotid artery was accessed by passing a guiding catheter through the stent wall. We describe this method as "intrawall access." This allowed a coaxial system to deliver polyvinyl alcohol particles to the MMA for embolization. Embolization was successfully performed, with the stent integrity and blood flow through it remaining uncompromised. Overall, we demonstrated a new method of access through a previously placed internal carotid stent to gain neurointerventional access to the external carotid artery, which was jailed by a stent, for treating an acute subdural hematoma via MMA embolization. The second objective of this case series was to demonstrate the first MMA embolization in literature carried out in the acute or acute-on-subacute setting, in this case, and in four others.
