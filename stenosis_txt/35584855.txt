Title: Non-surgical treatment of Lutembacher syndrome: combined percutaneous transcatheter therapy.

Abstract: A woman in her 30s presented with progressive worsening of dyspnoea for 6 months. On evaluation, she was diagnosed with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (mitral valve area of 0.6 cm2) and a large ostium secundum atrial septal defect (21 mm) with a left to right shunt and severe pulmonary artery hypertension. She was diagnosed with Lutembacher syndrome and was evaluated for suitability of a percutaneous approach. She was subjected to a combined procedure of percutaneous transluminal mitral commissurotomy followed by device closure of the atrial septal defect. The patient tolerated the procedure, remained haemodynamically stable and was discharged after 4 days. This procedure can prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with anaesthesia and cardiac surgery and the psychological trauma of a thoracotomy scar particularly in a female patient, as well as obviate the need for prolonged hospital stay.
