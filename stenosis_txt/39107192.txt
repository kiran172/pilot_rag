Title: Under pressure: a head-to-toe review of vascular compression syndromes.

Abstract: Vascular compression syndromes are a group of conditions resulting from mechanical compression of blood vessels by adjacent structures leading to compromised blood flow and various associated symptoms. They frequently affect young, otherwise healthy individuals and are often underdiagnosed due to their rarity and vague clinical manifestations. Achieving an accurate diagnosis depends on the integration of clinical presentation and imaging findings. Imaging modalities including color doppler ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and catheter-directed digital subtraction angiography are essential for diagnosis and management. Dynamic imaging is crucial in eliciting findings due to the positional nature of many of these syndromes. In this paper, we will present a "head-to-toe" overview of vascular compression syndromes including Vascular Eagle Syndrome, Vascular Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, Quadrilateral Space Syndrome, Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome, Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome, Renal Artery Entrapment Syndrome, Left Renal Vein Compression/Nutcracker Syndrome, May-Thurner Syndrome, Adductor Canal Syndrome, and Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome. Treatment is variable but typically involves a combination of conservative and surgical management. Surgical approaches focus on decompression of affected neurovascular structures. Endovascular treatment alone is rarely recommended. We aim to equip general radiologists with the knowledge needed to accurately diagnose patients with vascular compression syndromes, allowing for timely treatment.
