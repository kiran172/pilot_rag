Title: Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in a young lady with coexisting repaired patent ductus arteriosus.

Abstract: An asymptomatic woman aged 24 years was informed about the presence of a heart murmur by her attending obstetrician while she was hospitalised for a spontaneous abortion 6 months ago and was subsequently referred to us to rule out underlying heart disease. After clinical examination and relevant laboratory evaluation, a diagnosis of severe valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS) was established. Interestingly, our patient had undergone an open thoracotomy for surgical closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) under general anaesthesia 12 years ago in the absence of any appreciable shunt across the ligated ductus at present. Considering the severe gradient across her pulmonary valve, she underwent a successful percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (PBPV) procedure with excellent haemodynamic outcome. The pertinent literature concerning the rare combination of PDA in association with PS as well as the technicalities of PBPV procedure in an adult are discussed.
