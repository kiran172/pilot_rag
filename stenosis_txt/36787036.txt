Title: Associations of microcirculation damage on nailfold capillaroscopy with supra-aortic severe ischemic events in patients with Takayasu arteritis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and nailfold microcirculation and explore the associations with severe ischemic events (SIEs) in Takayasu arteritis (TA) with supra-aortic involvement.
METHODS: Eighty-one patients with supra-aortic artery involvement who underwent nailfold video-capillaroscopy (NVC) of their hands were enrolled from the East China TA (ECTA) cohort between August and December 2021. Clinical features and capillaroscopy variables associated with supra-aortic SIEs were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Overall, 71 patients were female, and 42 experienced supra-aortic SIEs, among whom there was a higher prevalence of hypertension and the number of supra-aortic artery stenosis (P = 0.005, and 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, intergroup differences in capillary density (P < 0.001) and minor morphology abnormalities (P < 0.001) were significant. After adjustment for all confounders, multivariate logistic regression revealed hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 7.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-33.7, P = 0.011), the number of supra-aortic arteries stenosis (≥4, OR: 6.8, 95% CI: 1.4-34.6, P = 0.020), capillary density (≤7.2/mm, OR: 43.0, 95% CI: 7.0-264.6, P < 0.001) and minor abnormalities (OR: 34.2, 95% CI: 3.6-325.1; P = 0.002) were independent risk factors for supra-aortic SIEs. capillary density (≤7.2/mm) and minor abnormalities or combined with at least two of the three items in the matrix model showed the probability of supra-aortic SIEs was 61.2-87.6%.
CONCLUSION: Decreased capillary density and morphologic abnormalities indicated that hypoperfusion was more likely to be observed in supra-aortic SIEs patients. Combined NVC indicators could be instrumental for early identification of supra-aortic SIEs. Key Points • Minor morphological abnormalities and hemorrhages were only observed in supra-aortic SIEs patients. • Capillaroscopic density and minor morphological abnormalities or combined with at least two of the three items in the matrix model showed the probability occurrence of supra-aortic SIEs was 61.2-87.6%.
