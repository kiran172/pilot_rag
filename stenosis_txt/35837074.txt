Title: Conservative treatment of urinary fistula: Case report.

Abstract: Radical cystectomy is the gold standard treatment for muscular invasive bladder cancer. Bricker surgery is the most common technique used for urinary diversion; however, troublesome complications such as postoperative anastomotic stenosis or fistula may occur. The case of a patient who had a urinary fistula after Bricker surgery performed at our hospital, is described. The patient was successfully treated with continuous double-cannula negative-pressure drainage and avoided a second surgery. The patient recovered well and is on regular follow-up. This case highlights the importance of timely and relevant treatment for patients with postoperative urinary fistula to avoid more invasive surgery.
