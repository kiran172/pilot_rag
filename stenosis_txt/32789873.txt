Title: Early bioprosthetic tricuspid valve stenosis due to size mismatch in Ebstein anomaly-Successful transcatheter treatment.

Abstract: Patients with congenital heart disease are surviving well into adulthood thanks to advances in medical and clinical care. We present a patient with Ebstein anomaly who underwent surgical tricuspid valve replacement and suffered early valve stenosis due to her unique anatomy. This case highlights the importance of the "unnatural" anatomy that can be encounter in this challenging patient population.
