Title: Emergency carotid artery revascularization using Casper-RX stent: A single-center experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Casper-RX (MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, California, USA) is a dual-layer closed cell stent recently introduced as a carotid artery revascularization device. Although its effectiveness and safety has been proved in elective cases, there are contradictive results regarding its patency in emergency settings. The purpose of the study is to present our single-center experience with the Casper-RX stent in the emergency interventions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent emergency carotid artery stenting using Casper-RX system with or without additional intracranial thrombectomy between August 2016 and June 2019 at our institution were included. Primary end point was the short-term patency of the carotid stents evaluated before hospital discharge by use of Doppler ultrasonography.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine procedures performed on 28 patients were included in the study. All stents were patent on final angiograms. Acute stent occlusion was observed only in one case (3.4%) with a spontaneous cervical internal carotid artery dissection the day after the procedure. In 26 (89.6%) cases, an additional intracranial thrombectomy was performed with a successful recanalization rate of 96.1%. Seven adverse events occurred peri-/post-procedural: two cases (6.9%) with iatrogenic dissection of distal cervical internal carotid artery during intracranial thrombectomy, two parenchymal hematoma type 2 (6.8%), and three patients (10.3%) developed massive infarction.
CONCLUSION: This study supports the safety and efficacy of the Casper-RX stent in emergency endovascular carotid artery revascularization procedures.
