Title: Influence of Carotid Artery Stenting on the Retina and Choroid.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The effect of carotid artery stenting in patients with unilateral carotid artery stenosis on the retina and choroid was evaluated using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA).
METHODS: SS-OCTA examination was conducted before stenting and 4 days and 3 months after stenting. The retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), inner nuclear layer, superficial vascular complex (SVC), deep vascular complex (DVC), choroidal vascular volume (CVV), and choroidal vascular index were measured. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to assess the impact of carotid artery stenting on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) metrics.
RESULTS: At baseline, 303 eyes from 160 patients (61.82 ± 9.98 years; 85.29% males) were enrolled. SVC and DVC densities and CVV were lower in ipsilateral eyes (stenosed side) compared to contralateral eyes (all P < 0.05). Four days after stenting, a significant increase was seen in SVC density in ipsilateral eyes (P < 0.05) while a significant increase was seen in CVV in ipsilateral eyes and contralateral eyes (both P < 0.05). Three months after stenting (63 patients with 114 eyes), a significant decrease was seen in the GCIPL thickness of ipsilateral and contralateral eyes (all P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Short term after carotid artery stenting, ipsilateral eyes showed a rapid and significant increase in SVC density and CVV.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Optical coherence tomography (OCT)/OCTA measurements may have the potential to detect retinal and choroidal changes after stenting. Future research on the long-term effect of stenting on the retina and choroid will be guided by these findings.
