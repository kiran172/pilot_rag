Title: Cardiac Damage and Quality of Life After Aortic Valve Replacement in the PARTNER Trials.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The extent of extravalvular cardiac damage is associated with increased risk of adverse events among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR).
OBJECTIVES: The goal was to describe the association of cardiac damage on health status before and after AVR.
METHODS: Patients from the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 2 and 3 trials were pooled and classified by echocardiographic cardiac damage stage at baseline and 1 year as previously described (stage 0-4). We examined the association between baseline cardiac damage and 1-year health status (assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Score [KCCQ-OS]).
RESULTS: Among 1,974 patients (794 surgical AVR, 1,180 transcatheter AVR), the extent of cardiac damage at baseline was associated with lower KCCQ scores both at baseline and at 1 year after AVR (P < 0.0001) and with increased rates of a poor outcome (death, KCCQ-OS <60, or a decrease in KCCQ-OS of ≥10 points) at 1 year (stages 0-4: 10.6% vs 19.6% vs 29.0% vs 44.7% vs 39.8%; P < 0.0001). In a multivariable model, each 1-stage increase in baseline cardiac damage was associated with a 24% increase in the odds of a poor outcome (95% CI: 9%-41%; P = 0.001). Change in stage of cardiac damage at 1 year after AVR was associated with the extent of improvement in KCCQ-OS over the same period (mean change in 1-year KCCQ-OS: improvement of ≥1 stage +26.8 [95% CI: 24.2-29.4] vs no change +21.4 [95% CI: 20.0-22.7] vs deterioration of ≥1 stage +17.5 [95% CI: 15.4-19.5]; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The extent of cardiac damage before AVR has an important impact on health status outcomes, both cross-sectionally and after AVR.
