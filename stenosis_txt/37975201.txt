Title: Outcomes of non-flow-limiting spiral dissection after drug-coated balloon angioplasty for de novo femoropopliteal lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Whether drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty would be effective in spiral dissection (SD) lesions with no flow impairment has been thoroughly investigated.
AIMS: The present study sought to assess the clinical outcomes of non-flow-limiting SD after DCB angioplasty for de novo femoropopliteal lesions in patients with symptomatic lower extremity artery disease.
METHOD: This single-center retrospective study enrolled 497 patients with non-flow-limiting SD (n = 92) or non-SD (n = 405) without bailout stenting. The primary endpoint was 1-year primary patency, with the secondary endpoints including freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), major adverse limb event (MALE), all-cause death, and 30-day restenosis.
RESULTS: The 1-year primary patency and freedom from TLR were significantly lower in the SD group than in the non-SD group (69.8% vs. 83.3%, p = 0.004; 78.7% vs. 93.0%, p = 0.007, respectively). The SD group had a higher incidence of MALE and 30-day restenosis than the non-SD group (24.6% vs. 11.9%, p = 0.001; 4.3% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.002, respectively). All-cause death was comparable. One-year restenosis after SD was associated with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) (hazard ratio, 3.36 [95% confidence interval, 1.21-9.36]; p = 0.020), TASC Ⅱ D (hazard ratio, 3.97 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-15.52]; p = 0.047), and residual stenosis ≥50% (hazard ratio, 4.92 [95% confidence interval, 1.01-23.94]; p = 0.048). The incidence of restenosis after SD increased with the number of these risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite normal antegrade flow, the 1-year primary patency rate after DCB angioplasty for de novo femoropopliteal lesions was significantly lower in lesions with SD than those without SD. CLTI, TASC II D, and residual stenosis ≥50% were risk factors associated with 1-year restenosis after DCB angioplasty for non-flow-limiting SD lesions.
