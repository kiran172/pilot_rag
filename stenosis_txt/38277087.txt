Title: The Role of CCTA-derived Cardiac Structure and Function Analysis in the Prediction of Readmission in Nonischemic Heart Failure.

Abstract: Cardiac function and structure significantly impact nonischemic heart failure (HF) patient outcomes. This study investigated 236 patients (107 nonischemic heart failure, 129 healthy) to assess the relationship between coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-derived parameters and clinical outcomes. Among the nonischemic heart failure patients, 37.3% experienced readmissions. In this group, specific CCTA measurements were identified as significant predictors of readmission: epicardial adipose tissue (CT<sub>EAT</sub>) at 54.49 cm3 (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03-1.07; P &lt; 0.001), cardiac muscle mass to lumen volume (CT<sub>V/M</sub>) at 20% (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.48-0.72; P &lt; 0.001), peri-coronary adipose (CT<sub>PCAT</sub>) at -64.68 HU (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.03-1.16; P = 0.002) for the right coronary artery, -81.07 HU (HR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1-1.53; P = 0.002) for the left anterior descending artery, and -73.42 HU (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.18-1.51; P &lt; 0.001) for the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery. In patients with nonischemic heart failure, increased CT<sub>EAT</sub>, CT<sub>PCAT</sub>, and CT<sub>V/M</sub> independently predicted rehospitalization.
