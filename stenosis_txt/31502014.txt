Title: Early effects of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on cardiac sympathetic nervous function assessed by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The effects of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on cardiac sympathetic nervous (CSN) function have not been fully explored. This study aimed to investigate the early (within 2 weeks) effects of TAVR on CSN function in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) using 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy.
METHODS: Of 143 consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo TAVR, 67 (18 men; median age 86 years) were evaluated in this single-centre prospective observational study. MIBG scintigraphy was performed at baseline and 3-14 days after the TAVR procedure to evaluate the heart-mediastinum ratio (H/M) and washout rate (WR). Differences between baseline and post-TAVR MIBG parameters were analysed. MIBG parameter changes were compared with echocardiographic parameters. Furthermore, factors involved in the improvement in MIBG parameters were investigated.
RESULTS: All patients successfully underwent TAVR with improved echocardiographic parameters, including aortic valve area (AVA; 0.6 cm2 vs. 1.6 cm2), peak velocity (4.5 m/s vs. 2.0 m/s), mean pressure gradient (50 mmHg vs. 9 mmHg), and left ventricular ejection fraction (56% vs. 62%) (all p &lt; 0.001). On MIBG imaging, delayed H/M significantly increased (2.57 vs. 2.68, p &lt; 0.001), whereas WR decreased (32.2% vs. 26.8%, p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, higher baseline WR was associated with improvement in WR (&gt; 3%). Female sex, Clinical Frailty Scale score ≤ 5, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, and baseline AVA were predictors of improvement in delayed H/M (&gt; 0.1). Baseline AVA and E/E' were independent predictors of improvement in both WR and delayed H/M.
CONCLUSIONS: The CSN function was impaired in patients with AS, as assessed using MIBG scintigraphy. WR and delayed H/M improved immediately after TAVR. Improvement in CSN function may be related to echocardiographic AS severity at baseline before TAVR.
