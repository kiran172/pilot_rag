Title: Can Right Ventricular Branch Bypass Alleviate Right Ventricular Dysfunction?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Right ventricle (RV) dysfunction after a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure is a challenge that adversely affects RV filling pressure and contraction. This study sought to determine whether additional bypass of an RV branch would lessen RV dysfunction.
METHODS: Patients with severe right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 patients (n = 50) had a single distal bypass on the RCA. Group 2 patients (n = 50) had both distal RCA and additional bypass on the RV branch of the RCA. Right ventricular function was examined by echocardiogram by measuring transannular plane systolic excursion, fractional area change, tissue Doppler S-wave velocity, and inferior vena cava diameter.
RESULTS: Transannular plane systolic excursion and fractional area change measurements rapidly decreased below the cutoff in both groups, but group 2 patient values reached normal limits at 90 days. Tissue Doppler S-wave velocity reached the normal limit in 7 days. Inotropic agents were required in 11 patients in group 1 and 2 patients in group 2 (P = .013). The mean (SD) intensive care unit stay was 2.11 (1.12) days and 1.45 (0.71) days (P = .033), and the hospital stay was 7.32 (1.44) days and 6.22 (0.45) days in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = .027).
CONCLUSION: The data in this study suggest that an additional graft on the RV branch of the RCA (eg, conus, marginal, any good runoff vessels on the RV) prevents severe RV dysfunction and allows for rapid recovery of RV dysfunction after off-pump coronary surgery.
