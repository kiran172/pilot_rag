Title: Use of oral diet and nutrition support in management of stricturing and fistulizing Crohn's disease.

Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD), a form of inflammatory bowel disease, involves chronic inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal strictures and fistulas are common complications of CD with varying severity in their presentations. Modifications in oral diet or use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) are common approaches to manage both stricturing and fistulizing disease, although supporting research evidence is generally limited. In the preoperative period, there is strong evidence that EEN can reduce surgical complications. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is often utilized in the management of enterocutaneous fistulas, given that oral diet and EEN may potentially increase output in proximal fistulas. This narrative review highlights the current practices and evidence for the roles of oral diet, EEN, and PN in treatment and management of stricturing and fistulizing CD.
