Title: The evaluation value of intracranial magnetic resonance angiography combined with carotid ultrasound in cerebral infarction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the evaluation value of intracranial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) combined with carotid ultrasound (CU) in patients with cerebral infarction (CI).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 122 patients with CI who underwent intracranial MRA combined with CU examination in Shengzhou People's Hospital from January 2021 to October 2022. Vascular stenosis rate and CU parameters of patients with different degrees of nerve damage (ND) and size of CI lesion were analyzed.
RESULTS: The rate of vascular stenosis and ultrasound parameters significantly varied between patients with different degrees of ND and different sizes of CI lesion. Spearman test showed a significant positive correlation between vascular stenosis, pulsatile index (PI), and resistance index (RI) with the degree of ND and the size of CI lesions in patients. There was a significant negative correlation between peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and the degree of ND and the size of CI lesions (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial MRA combined with CU can clarify the vascular stenosis and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with CI, and the combined approach closely correlates with the characteristics of CI, which can be used for disease assessment.
