Title: Eosinophilic esophagitis with a severe stenosis: report of a Japanese case.

Abstract: A 49 years old male, who had had postprandial dysphagia during the preceding 10 years, was referred to our hospital. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed longitudinal furrows and concentric rings in the mid to lower esophagus and stenosis in the lower esophagus. Histologic findings from esophageal biopsies showed eosinophilic infiltration (> 15 per high-power field). Under a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, an endoscopic bougie was performed, which resulted in symptomatic relief. Follow-up EGD revealed that the stenosis had improved, but histologic findings of eosinophilic esophagitis were remaining. Our case suggests that although rare, esophageal stenosis occurs in Japanese patients with EoE, and that the complication may be a consequence of prolonged disease. Other risks and the appropriate treatment for the prevention of stenosis need to be elucidated further.
