Title: Calcified cerebral emboli associated with calcified carotid plaque: a case report and morphological consideration for plaque calcification.

Abstract: We described a rare case of acute ischemic stroke due to calcified cerebral emboli from calcified carotid plaque (CCP). Radiological examinations revealed that the CCP had an irregular configuration containing a calcified nodule and scattered spotty calcifications, and a large calcified plate. The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy to prevent embolic recurrence. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of an erupted plaque with a disrupted fibrous cap. Calcified nodular protrusion and spotty calcifications in CCP are predictive of a high risk of embolic stroke with plaque rupture. Thus, careful treatment strategies are crucial to prevent the CCP-related embolic recurrence.
