Title: NcRNAs in Vascular and Valvular Intercellular Communication.

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs have been shown to be important biomarkers and mediators of many different disease entities, including cardiovascular (CV) diseases like atherosclerosis, aneurysms, and valvulopathies. Growing evidence suggests a central role of ncRNAs as regulators of different pathological pathways involved in endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular inflammation, cell differentiation, and calcification. This review will discuss the role of protein-bound and extracellular vesicular-bound ncRNAs as biomarkers of vascular and valvular diseases, their role as intercellular communicators, and regulators of disease pathways and also highlights possible treatment strategies.
