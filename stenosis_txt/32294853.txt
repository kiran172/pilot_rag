Title: [Clinical application of three cases of transcarotid artery revascularization].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the surgical indications, preoperative evaluation, technical points, perioperative management and effect of transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) in the treatment of carotid stenosis. Methods: From March to April 2019, three patients with carotid stenosis undergoing TCAR in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Naval Military Medical University. With the common carotid artery approach, under the protection of the carotid-femoral vein reverse blood flow, the balloon dilatation of the internal carotid artery stenosis and stent implantation to achieve the purpose of carotid revascularization.The patient's general condition, preoperative evaluation, intraoperative operation, postoperative management and complications were recorded in detail. The clinical safety, efficacy and efficacy of TCAR in the treatment of carotid stenosis were evaluated. Results: All three operations were successful, including 2 cases of left carotid artery revascularization and 1 case of right carotid artery revascularization. A total of 3 carotid stents were implanted. The operation time was 65, 59, and 55 min,the intraluminal operation time was 13, 18, and 11 min, the common carotid artery blocked time was 15, 20, and 13 min, the contrast agent was 20, 25,15 ml, respectively. There was no death, no nervous system and other related complications during the perioperative period. Three patients were followed up for 7, 7, and 6 months without death, there were no nervous system diseases and other complications. All patients with ultrasound indicated that the carotid artery stent was patency. Conclusion: TCAR adopts the neuroprotection system of carotid-femoral vein continuous reverse blood flow to prevent transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke, and it is a safe and effective treatment for carotid artery stenosis.
