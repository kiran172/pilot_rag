Title: Assessment of Damage in Takayasu's Arteritis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate damage and clinical characteristics associated with damage in Takayasu's arteritis (TAK).
METHODS: Patients with TAK enrolled in a multicentre, prospective, observational study underwent standardized damage assessment every 6 months using the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) and the Large-Vessel Vasculitis Index of Damage (LVVID).
RESULTS: The study included 236 patients with TAK: 92% female, 81% Caucasian; median (25th, 75th percentile) disease duration = 2.6 (0.12, 6.9) years. Eighty-four percent had follow-up: median (25th, 75th) duration 4.1 (1.9, 7.5) years.Items of damage were present in 89% on VDI, 87% on LVVID, in the peripheral vascular (76% VDI, 74% LVVID), cardiac (40% VDI, 45% LVVID) systems. During follow-up, 42% patients had new damage;, including major vessel stenosis/arterial occlusion (8%), limb claudication (6%), hypertension (7%), aortic aneurysm (4%), and bypass surgery (4%). Disease-specific damage accounted for >90% new items. Older age, relapse, and longer duration of follow-up were associated with new damage items; a higher proportion of patients without new damage were on methotrexate (p< 0.05). Among 48 patients diagnosed with TAK within 180 days of enrolment, new damage occurred in 31% on VDI and 52% on LVVID. History of relapse was associated with new damage in the entire cohort while in patients with a recent diagnosis, older age at diagnosis was associated with new damage.
CONCLUSION: Damage is present in > 80% of patients with TAK even with recent diagnosis and >40% of patients accrue new, mainly disease-specific damage. Therapies for TAK that better control disease activity and prevent damage should be prioritized.
