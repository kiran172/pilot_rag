Title: Speaker-independent speech inversion for recovery of velopharyngeal port constriction degreea).

Abstract: For most of his illustrious career, Ken Stevens focused on examining and documenting the rich detail about vocal tract changes available to listeners underlying the acoustic signal of speech. Current approaches to speech inversion take advantage of this rich detail to recover information about articulatory movement. Our previous speech inversion work focused on movements of the tongue and lips, for which "ground truth" is readily available. In this study, we describe acquisition and validation of ground-truth articulatory data about velopharyngeal port constriction, using both the well-established measure of nasometry plus a novel technique-high-speed nasopharyngoscopy. Nasometry measures the acoustic output of the nasal and oral cavities to derive the measure nasalance. High-speed nasopharyngoscopy captures images of the nasopharyngeal region and can resolve velar motion during speech. By comparing simultaneously collected data from both acquisition modalities, we show that nasalance is a sufficiently sensitive measure to use as ground truth for our speech inversion system. Further, a speech inversion system trained on nasalance can recover known patterns of velopharyngeal port constriction shown by American English speakers. Our findings match well with Stevens' own studies of the acoustics of nasal consonants.
