Title: Retrospective evaluation of interventional radiological treatments for chronic mesenteric ischemia in Germany based on a four-year period of the DeGIR Registry: comparison of outcomes with international quality standards.

Abstract: PURPOSE:  Endovascular treatment has emerged as the gold standard for managing chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) resulting from arterial stenosis or occlusion. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and complication rates of continuous interventional radiology treatment for CMI in Germany between 2018 and 2021, comparing these findings with international quality standards.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Data for CMI therapy with stenting and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was obtained from the quality management system of the German Interventional Radiological Society (DeGIR). A total of 3752 endovascular procedures for CMI performed from 2018 to 2021 were documented (PTA: n = 675; stenting: n = 3077). Data was analyzed for technical and clinical success rates, as well as major complication rates.
RESULTS:  Overall technical and clinical success rates for PTA and stenting procedures were 92.03 %/85.9 % and 98.76 %/96.62 %, respectively. The most common major complications were: arterial occlusion (PTA: 0.73 %; stenting: 0.63), major bleeding (PTA: 1.05 %; stenting: 0.68 %), aneurysm formation (PTA: 0.29 %; stenting: 0.72 %), stent dislodgment (PTA: 0 %; stenting: 0.06 %), and organ failure (PTA: 0.43 %; stenting: 0.96 %). Technical and clinical success rates were higher, while complication rates were lower than the corresponding threshold recommended by the Society of Interventional Radiology for the percutaneous management of chronic mesenteric ischemia.
CONCLUSION:  Treatment of CMI performed by interventional radiologists in Germany is safe and effective during daily and on-call shifts with results exceeding internationally accepted standards.
KEY POINTS:   · Treatment of CMI by interventional radiologists in Germany is effective and safe.. · The interventions are safe and effective regardless of whether they are performed during on-call shifts or the daily routine.. · The clinical and technical success rates favorably surpass the thresholds presented by SIR.. · Different major complications occurred in under 1.1 % of CMI interventions..
