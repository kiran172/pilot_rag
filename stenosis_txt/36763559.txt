Title: Repeated cervical laminoplasty for progressive ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament: a case report.

Abstract: Posterior longitudinal ligament ossification is a progressive disease resulting in severe multilevel spinal stenosis with myelopathy. Decompression via anterior or posterior approach is the main treatment option. Decompressive laminoplasty is currently considered the most effective and safest method. This procedure provides favorable outcomes with low trauma and short surgery time. Redo surgeries are rare and most often performed within 2 years after primary laminoplasty. The most common causes are progressive spinal stenosis following posterior longitudinal ligament ossification, insufficient primary decompression and progressive cervical spine kyphosis. Considering few data on redo laminoplasty, we present a patient with progressive ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament who underwent redo surgery at the same level in 10 years after primary laminoplasty.
