Title: Infolding of Self-Expandable Transcatheter Valve: A Complication that Needs Prompt Diagnosis During TAVR Procedure.

Abstract: Infolding of self-expandable prosthetic valve is a possible complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). A prompt diagnosis during the procedure before full deployment of the valve is extremely important to avoid potentially lethal consequences.
