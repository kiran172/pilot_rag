Title: Pregnancy Considerations in Tetralogy of Fallot.

Abstract: The majority of women with repaired tetralogy of Fallot are able to tolerate pregnancy with a low risk of cardiovascular events. However, proactive contraceptive advice, prepregnancy counselling, and care by a pregnancy heart team with expertise in congenital heart disease are key to ensuring a good outcome for mother and baby. Maternal and fetal risks are increased in the presence of severe valvular stenosis, poorly tolerated arrhythmia, significant ventricular dysfunction, and cyanosis. It is unusual to see cyanotic adults with tetralogy of Fallot, whether unoperated or shunt palliated; pregnancy risks are greatly reduced by completing their repair before pregnancy is undertaken. The multidisciplinary pregnancy heart team should make a risk-stratified pregnancy care plan using a combination of published scoring systems and an individualized assessment of the patient's comorbidities. Low-risk patients may have the majority of their care and give birth in local units, whereas those at high risk should be managed and give birth in a tertiary centre with high-level expertise and intensive care facilities. Age-appropriate conversations about future childbearing and safe and reliable contraception should be part of routine follow-up from teenage years, so that women with tetralogy of Fallot can control their own fertility and make informed decisions about having children.
