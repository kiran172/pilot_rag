Title: One-year outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for bicuspid aortic valve stenosis: a report from the Japanese Nationwide registry (J-TVT registry).

Abstract: The outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) remains unclear, particularly among Asian patients that are known to have different valvular morphology and lower body habitus. This study investigated patient characteristics, procedural and 1-year outcome of TAVR for BAV within national TAVR registry in Japan. The patient-level data were extracted from the J-TVT (Japanese Transcatheter Valvular Therapy) registry between August 2013 and December 2018; overall, there were 423 patients (2.5%) with BAV and 16,802 patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). At baseline, patients with BAV were younger and had less arteriosclerotic comorbidities. There was no statistically significant difference between BAV and TAV groups in conversion to surgery (0.5% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.34) and 30-day mortality (0.5% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.18). Cumulative all-cause survival and survival from major adverse events were analyzed. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio. All-cause mortality and major adverse event rate at 1 year were comparable between the two groups. Relative hazard for all-cause mortality for BAV compared to TAV was 1.01 (0.70-1.45; p = 0.96), and for major adverse event was 0.94 (0.69-1.27; p = 0.67). From the Japanese nationwide TAVR registry, procedural and 1-year outcome of TAVR in BAV was as favorable as TAVR in TAV.
