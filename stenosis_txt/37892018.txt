Title: The Relation of the Iron Metabolism Index to the Vulnerability Index of Carotid Plaque with Different Degrees of Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences in serum iron index and iron metabolizing protein expression in plaques in patients with different degrees of carotid artery stenosis and the relationship with plaque traits.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients eligible for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) from August 2021 to February 2022 were included. Patients completed a computed tomography (CTA) scan for patient grouping and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for precise quantification of carotid plaque traits within 1 week prior to surgery. Clinical indicators associated with the progression of carotid stenosis to occlusion were analyzed using ordered logistic regression. Twenty carotid plaques were analyzed immunohistochemically to investigate the relationship between plaque traits and the iron metabolism indexes.
RESULTS: No significant correlation between high serum ferritin (SF), unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) and progression of carotid stenosis (OR 1.100, 95% CI 0.004-0.165, p = 0.039; OR 1.050, 95% CI 0.005-0.094, p = 0.031). SF and serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) were correlated with normalized wall index (NWI) (R = 0.470, p = 0.036; R = 0.449, p = 0.046), and the results of multiple linear regression suggested that SF and sTfR remained associated with NWI (R = 0.630, R2 = 0.397, Adjusted R2 = 0.326, p = 0.014). In plaques, H-type ferritin (H-FT) was correlated with NWI and lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC) volume (R = 0.502, p = 0.028; R = 0.468, p = 0.043). Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) was correlated with LRNC volume and intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) volume (R = 0.538, p = 0.017; R = 0.707, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: There were statistical differences in the expression of iron metabolism proteins in carotid plaques with different degrees of stenosis. Serum iron metabolism index (SF and sTfR) and expression of iron metabolizing proteins (H-FT and TfR1) in plaques were positively correlated with carotid plaque vulnerability index (NWI, LRNC volume).
