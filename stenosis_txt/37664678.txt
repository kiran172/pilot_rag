Title: Dynamic observation of circRNA and mRNA profiles in a rat model of deep vein thrombosis.

Abstract: The goal of the present study was to identify different transcriptome expression profiles involved in the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and to illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of circular RNAs (circRNAs) and mRNAs in DVT progression. A Sprague-Dawley rat model of DVT was successfully established through the stenosis method and samples were sequenced at four time points (1, 6 and 12 h, and 3 days after ligation) to observe the dynamic changes in circRNAs and mRNAs during DVT progression. RNA sequencing was used to analyze the circRNA and mRNA expression profiles, and associated functions and pathways, in the blood of DVT rats at the four time points. In addition, Short Time Series Expression Miner (STEM) analysis was performed to explore temporal gene expression. Differential expression of 1,680, 4,018, 3,724, and 3,036 circRNAs, and 400, 1,176, 373, and 573 mRNAs was observed in the 1, 6 and 12 h, and 3-day groups, respectively, compared with the sham group (fold change >2.0 or <-2.0, P<0.05). Functional enrichment analysis indicated that differentially expressed mRNAs were associated with the following terms: Immune response, cell activation, blood stasis facilitated organelle, extracellular membrane-bounded organelle, and blood microparticle, oxygen transporter activity. STEM analysis indicated that the expression of 366 circRNAs in circRNA profile 45 and 270 mRNAs in mRNA profile 45 was consistent with thrombus progression. Enrichment analysis was performed on mRNA profile 45. The main Gene Ontology annotations were chromosome segregation, mitotic sister chromatid segregation, cell cycle process, and ligand-dependent nuclear receptor transcription coactivator activity. Pathway enrichment analysis identified the platelet-associated pathway, immune-associated pathway, and inflammation-relation pathway. According to the enriched platelet-associated pathways, four mRNAs and ten candidate circRNAs were selected for reverse transcription-quantitative PCR verification. The expression of nine of the ten circRNAs and all four mRNAs was consistent with the sequencing results. In summary, differentially expressed circRNAs and mRNAs are dynamically involved in DVT development. Dysregulated transcriptome profiles and the corresponding functions and pathways may provide mechanistic insights into DVT diagnosis and treatment.
