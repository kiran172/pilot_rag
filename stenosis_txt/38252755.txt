Title: Circulating Sex-Specific Markers of Plaque Instability in Women and Men With Severe Carotid Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sex-specific differences in plaque composition and instability underscore the need to explore circulating markers for better prediction of high-risk plaques. This cross-sectional study aims to (1) investigate differences in lipid, immune, and adipokine circulating profiles between men and women with stable versus unstable plaques and (2) identify circulating markers that can better classify men and women according to plaque instability.
METHODS: Preoperative blood samples and plaque specimens were collected from consecutive men and women with carotid artery stenosis ≥50% and who underwent a carotid endarterectomy between 2009 and 2018. Adipokine, lipid, and immune profiling was conducted. Plaque stability was determined by gold-standard histological classifications. Statistical analyses, including χ2, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and logistic regression, assessed differences in plaque features and blood parameters between men and women with stable and unstable plaques.
RESULTS: Of 470 recruited patients (aged 70.8±9.2 years), the final study analyses included 317 men and 143 women (aged 71.0±9.0 years). Men exhibited more unstable plaques (P&lt;0.001), characterized by increased plaque hemorrhage, larger lipid core, and inflammation (P&lt;0.001), along with less favorable circulating profiles. Antagonistic interactions between sex and white blood cell (WBC) counts, basophil-to-WBC ratio, and platelet counts influenced plaque instability. In men, low WBC counts, high monocyte-to-WBC ratio, low basophil-to-WBC ratio, and high LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels were associated with greater plaque instability (odds ratio, 0.827 [95% CI, 0.713-0.926], 1.158 [95% CI, 1.027-1.305], 0.495 [95% CI, 0.281-0.871], and 1.564 [95% CI, 1.001-2.443], respectively) and more unstable features (ie, inflammation, foam cells, and neovascularization). In women, a high basophil-to-WBC ratio was associated with greater plaque instability (3.142 [95% CI, 1.220-8.093]), hemorrhage, and thrombosis, while a high molecular weight-to-total adiponectin ratio was associated with decreased instability (0.014 [95% CI, 0.000-0.646]) and inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated sex-specific differences, with women displaying more stable plaque phenotypes and favorable circulating profiles compared with men. This proof-of-concept study was also designed as the key first step in exploring novel sex-specific associations between circulating lipid, immune, and adipokine profiles and carotid plaque instability.
