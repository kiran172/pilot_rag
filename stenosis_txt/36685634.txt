Title: Results of carotid endarterectomy under regional anesthesia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) surgery under regional anesthesia and to report early mid-term results.
METHODS: Data for 42 patients who underwent CEA were reviewed retrospectively between January 2013 and June 2015. Of the patients, 60% (n=25) were male and 40% (n=17) were female. The mean age was 74.03 years. Early and midterm mortality, intraoperative stroke, and complication rates were calculated by reviewing patient's data at the end of 2 years.
RESULTS: The level of carotid stenosis was over 70% in 83% (n=35) of the patients. Seventeen percent (n=7) of the patients had 60% carotid stenosis. Forty patients received regional anesthesia and two patients received general anesthesia. The mean cross-clamp time was 13.08 min. The mean operation time was 53.09 min. No early post-operative deaths occurred. The midterm (24 months) mortality rate was 2% (n=1). Recurrent atheromatous plaque was found in 2% (n=1) of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that CEA surgery may be safely performed under regional anesthesia will acceptable low mortality and morbidity rate.
