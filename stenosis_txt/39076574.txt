Title: Cardiovascular risk and subclinical atherosclerosis in first-degree relatives of patients with premature cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Screening first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with premature coronary artery disease (CAD) is recommended but not routinely performed.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic yield and impact on clinical management of a clinical and imaging-based screening program of FDRs delivered in the setting of routine clinical care.
METHODS: We recruited FDRs of patients with premature CAD with no personal history of CAD and prospectively assessed for: 1) cardiovascular risk and presence of significant subclinical atherosclerosis (SA) defined as plaque on carotid ultrasound, stenosis >50% or extensive atherosclerosis on coronary computed tomography angiography, or coronary artery calcium scores >100 Agatston units or >75% percentile for age and sex; 2) utilization of preventive medications and lipid levels prior enrolment and after completion of the assessment.
RESULTS: We assessed 132 FDRs (60.6% females), mean (SD) age 47(17) years old. Cardiovascular risk was high in 38.2%, moderate in 12.2%, and low in 49.6% of FDRs. SA was present in 34.1% of FDRs, including 12.5% in low, 51.9% in moderate, and 55.0% in high calculated risk groups. After assessment, LLT was initiated in 32.6% of FDRs and intensified in 16.0% leading to mean (SD) LDL-C decrease of 1.07(1.10) mmol/L in patients with high calculated risk or SA. LLT was recommended to all patients with high calculated risk, but those with SA were more likely to receive the medications from pharmacies (93.3% vs 60.0%, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Screening the FDRs of patients with premature CAD is feasible, may have high diagnostic yield and impact risk factor management.
