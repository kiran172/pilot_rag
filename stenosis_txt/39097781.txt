Title: Ultrasound-guided nitinol stent implantation to treat early restenosis of arteriovenous fistula: A 69-case study with 1-year outcome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the feasibility, methods and effects of interventional ultrasound in nitinol stent implantation to treat early restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF).
METHODS: From April 2018 to December 2021, 69 patients with early restenosis of AVF received ultrasound-guided nitinol stent implantation (UNSI) and were followed-up. Imaging features of the stent and procedure by ultrasound were observed. The technical success rate, clinical success rate and incidence of complications were recorded and counted. Target lesion primary patency (TLPP), access circuit primary patency (ACPP) and access circuit secondary patency (ACSP) were estimated.
RESULTS: Ultrasonography can show the structure of the stent and guide the stenting process clearly. Both the technical and clinical success rates were 100%. Thirty-one patients had in-stent restenosis (ISR), which was treated by plain balloon (PB) PTA or drug coated balloon (DCB) PTA. The TLPP at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were 100.0%, 94.2%, 63.4% and 39.6%, respectively. The ACPP at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were 98.6%, 91.6%, 60.2% and 35.2%, respectively. The ACSP at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were 98.6%, 98.6%, 95.6% and 93.8%, respectively. The TLPP of ISR after DCB PTA at 3, 6 and 12 months were 100.0%, 100.0% and 93.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study indicates ultrasonography can accurately guide nitinol stent implantation in AVF and this technique is a feasible and minimally invasive treatment for early restenosis after PTA with good short- and medium-term patency. DCB PTA may be used to deal with the ISR and is a way to prolong the patency of nitinol stent.
