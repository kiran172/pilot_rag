Title: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic submucosal dissection using an ultrathin endoscope: a retrospective, single-center evaluation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported the therapeutic use of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) using an ultrathin endoscope for targeting pharyngeal and distal side lesions in the stenosis or as a less invasive treatment via the nasal route. However, the effectiveness and safety of these treatments remain undetermined. Therefore, this study aimed to review treatment outcomes and discuss the advantages and precautions of the treatments based on our experience.
METHODS: This study included 13 patients with 14 lesions who underwent 14 sessions of upper gastrointestinal ESD using an ultrathin endoscope between December 2021 and August 2023. The outcome measures included lesion background, en bloc resection rate, en bloc complete resection rates, and incidence of adverse events (including post-operative bleeding, intraoperative perforation, and delayed perforation).
RESULTS: The lesions in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were eight, three, and three, respectively, and the median length (range) of each located lesion was 16.5 (6-26), 17 (9-36), and 10 (4-16) mm, respectively. En bloc resection and en bloc complete resection rates were 100 and 92.9%, respectively. The only adverse event was an intraoperative perforation observed during duodenal ESD, resulting from the assistant's inadvertent expansion of the SOUTEN at the final dissection stage.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that ESD with an ultrathin endoscope effectively reaches lesions in difficult locations and enables treatment within a small working space. Therefore, ESD using an ultrathin endoscope is a treatment option for lesions located distally to gastrointestinal stenosis, highly fibrotic lesions, and duodenal tumors.
