Title: Post-surgical unilateral left pulmonary edema after mitral valve replacement - A diagnostic challenge.

Abstract: Unilateral left pulmonary edema due to inadvertent surgical occlusion of left superior and inferior pulmonary veins is not only an exceedingly rare complication of mitral valve surgeries but also a diagnostic challenge in the postoperative recovery unit. Described here is a case of a 38-year-old male who developed progressively worsening unilateral left pulmonary edema after mitral valve replacement on postoperative day-1. The diagnosis was mostly by the exclusion of multiple possible differentials and was confirmed during reexploration surgery.
