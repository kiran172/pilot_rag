Title: Hypopigmented penile fixed drug eruption.

Abstract: Fixed drug eruptions (FDE) are typically associated with residual hyperpigmentation or non-pigmenting lesions. There is no distinctive histopathological feature; though, drug provocation tests (DPT) can be confirmatory within 7â€‰days. We describe a patient with penile FDE associated with residual hypopigmentation, a prolonged refractory period to DPT and recurrent meatal stenosis.
