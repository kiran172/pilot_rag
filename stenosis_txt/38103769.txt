Title: Meta-Analysis of the Performance of AI-Driven ECG Interpretation in the Diagnosis of Valvular Heart Diseases.

Abstract: Valvular heart diseases (VHDs) significantly impact morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Early diagnosis improves patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation presents a promising approach for early VHD detection. We conducted a meta-analysis on the efficacy of AI models in this context. We reviewed databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane until August 20, 2023, focusing on AI for ECG-based VHD detection. The outcomes included pooled accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value. The pooled proportions were derived using a random-effects model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study heterogeneity was evaluated with the I-squared statistic. Our analysis included 10 studies, involving ECG data from 713,537 patients. The AI algorithms mainly screened for aortic stenosis (n = 6), mitral regurgitation (n = 4), aortic regurgitation (n = 3), mitral stenosis (n = 1), mitral valve prolapse (n = 2), and tricuspid regurgitation (n = 1). A total of 9 studies used convolution neural network models, whereas 1 study combined the strengths of support vector machine logistic regression and multilayer perceptron for ECG interpretation. The collective AI models demonstrated a pooled accuracy of 81% (95% CI 73 to 89, I² = 92%), sensitivity was 83% (95% CI 77 to 88, I² = 86%), specificity was 72% (95% CI 68 to 75, I² = 52%), PPV was 13% (95% CI 7 to 19, I² = 90%), and negative predictive value was 99% (95% CI 97 to 99, I² = 50%). The subgroup analyses for aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation detection yielded analogous outcomes. In conclusion, AI-driven ECG offers high accuracy in VHD screening. However, its low PPV indicates the need for a combined approach with clinical judgment, especially in primary care settings.
