Title: [Endoscopic septoplasty as a stage of endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy].

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Endoscopic endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (EN-DCR) is a modern and effective method for the surgical treatment of distal part obstruction of lacrimal pathway. Unsuccessful outcome and dacryocystitis relapses may be associated with concomitant rhinological pathology. Deviation of the nasal septum in the surgical area can affect the operation and contribute to stenosis. Additional correction of the nasal septum is necessary to obtain free surgical approach to the lacrimal sac. Endoscopic septoplasty provides high-quality surgical approach to the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate simultaneous endoscopic septoplasty when performing EN-DCR.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis patients clinical data was conducted who were operated at the ENT department of Pavlov First Saint Petersburg State Medical University between January 2014 and December 2019.
RESULTS: 232 EN-DCR were performed in 212 patients (21 men, 191 women). The average age at the time of the operation was 54.3 years (range 19-87). Of the 212 people 192 underwent unilateral surgery, 20 - bilateral EN-DCR. Simultaneous endoscopic septoplasty was required in 36 (15.5%) cases.
CONCLUSION: Performing a simultaneous endoscopic septoplasty provides comfortable surgical access and contributes to the final successful outcome of EN-DCR.
