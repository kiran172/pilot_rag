Title: [Observation of Short-term and Long-term Efficacy of Bronchoscopic Interventional Therapy in the Treatment of Typical Carcinoid].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The curative potential of various bronchoscopic treatments such as electric snare, carbon dioxide freezing, argon plasma coagulation (APC), Neudymium-dopted Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser and photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of intraluminal tumor has been administered previously, but this regimen is not common in the treatment of typical carcinoid. The aim of this study is to investigate the curative effects both in short-term and long-term of interventional bronchoscopy in the treatment of typical carcinoid.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of typical carcinoid patients who were treated with interventional bronchoscopy for tumor suppression and they were hospitalized in the Emergency General Hospital from December 2010 to December 2020, and Wilcoxon rank sum test and chi-square test were used for analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were included, including 18 cases of preoperative bronchial artery embolization (embolization rate 56%, 95%CI: 31%-79%). The grade score of dyspnea decreased from before treatment to after treatment, and the difference was statistically significant [(1.44±1.03) score vs (0.25±0.58) score, P=0.003]; The degree of bronchial stenosis decreased from pre-treatment to post-treatment, and the difference was statistically significant [(87.50%±13.90%) vs (17.50%±6.83%), P<0.001]; There was significant difference in bronchial diameter before and after treatment [(0.14±0.18) cm vs (0.84±0.29) cm, P<0.001].
CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopic interventional therapy has significant short-term and long-term effects in the treatment of typical carcinoid.
