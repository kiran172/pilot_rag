Title: Delay between onset of indication and definitive surgery for tracheal trauma.

Abstract: Tracheal stenosis is rare but a recognized complication after traumatic injury or prolonged intubation. We assessed the time lag between onset of indication for tracheal reconstruction surgery following trauma and actual surgical intervention. We reviewed our operative records for all patients undergoing tracheal reconstruction over the past 10 years. Files were reviewed retrospectively to collect all the relevant data. Surgically all patients were operated via cervical approach. Series 12 cases were identified with an equal split between external trauma and iatrogenic tracheal trauma from prolonged intubation. On, an average patients presented 185 days after initial indication of surgery however there was a wide range of time lag which leads to the importance of early diagnosis of such injuries to reduce delay of definitive management.
