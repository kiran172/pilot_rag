Title: Moyamoya disease and syndrome: a review.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is a chronic occlusive cerebrovascular disease that is non-inflammatory and non-atherosclerotic. It is characterized by endothelial hyperplasia and fibrosis of the intracranial portion of the carotid artery and its proximal branches, leading to progressive stenosis and occlusion, often clinically manifesting as ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with high rates of morbidity and mortality. On cerebral angiography, the formation of collateral vessels has the appearance of a puff of smoke (moyamoya in Japanese), which became more conspicuous with the refinement of modern imaging techniques. When there is associated disease, it is known as moyamoya syndrome. Treatments are currently limited, although surgical revascularization may prevent ischemic events and preserve quality of life. In this review, we summarize recent advances in moyamoya disease, covering aspects of epidemiology, etiology, presentation, imaging, and treatment strategies.
