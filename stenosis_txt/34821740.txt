Title: Modern Approaches in Cardiovascular Disease Therapeutics: From Molecular Genetics to Tissue Engineering.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) currently represents one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is estimated that more than 17.9 million people die each year due to CVD manifestations. Often, occlusion or stenosis of the vascular network occurs, either in large- or small-diameter blood vessels. Moreover, the obstruction of small vessels such as the coronary arteries may be related to more pronounced events, which can be life-threatening. The gold standard procedure utilizes the transplantation of secondary vessels or the use of synthetic vascular grafts. However, significant adverse reactions have accompanied the use of the above grafts. Therefore, modern therapeutic strategies must be evaluated for better disease administration. In the context of alternative therapies, advanced tissue-engineering approaches including the decellularization procedure and the 3D additive bioprinting methods, have been proposed. In this way the availability of bioengineered vascular grafts will be increased, covering the great demand that exists globally. In this Special Issue of Bioengineering, we tried to highlight the modern approaches which are focused on CVD therapeutics. This issue includes articles related to the efficient development of vascular grafts, 3D printing approaches and suitable atherosclerosis models.
