Title: Surgical resection for non-Asian intrahepatic lithiasis: The Brazilian experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intrahepatic lithiasis (IHL) is a rare disease in the western world. Complications associated with IHL include acute cholangitis, liver atrophy, secondary biliary cirrhosis, and risk for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Liver resection is considered the treatment of choice for IHL. The objective of this study was to analyze patients who underwent liver resection for non-Asian hepatolithiasis.
METHODS: 127 patients with symptomatic non-Asian hepatolithiasis underwent resection in six institutions. Demographic data, clinical presentation, diagnosis, classification according to stone location, presence of atrophy, bile duct stricture, biliary cirrhosis, incidence of cholangiocarcinoma, treatment and postoperative course were evaluated.
RESULTS: 52 patients (40.9%) were male and the mean age was 46.1 years. Sixty-six patients (51.9%) presented with history of cholangitis. Stones were located in the left lobe in 63 (49.6%), and right lobe in 28 patients (22.0%). Atrophy was observed in 31 patients (24.4%) and biliary stenosis in 18 patients (14.1%). The most common procedure performed was left lateral sectionectomy in 63 (49.6%) patients, followed by left hepatectomy in 36 (28.3%), right hepatectomy in 19 (15.0%), and associated hepaticojejunostomy in 28 (22.0%). Forty-two patients (33.0%) presented postoperative complications and the most common were biliary fistula (13.3%) and surgical site infection (7.0%). Postoperative mortality was 0.7%. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was observed in 2 patients (1.5%). Recurrence was identified in 10 patients (7.8%), mostly with bilateral stones and/or hepaticojejunostomy.
CONCLUSION: Liver resection is the standard treatment for symptomatic unilateral or complicated IHL with good operative results. Risk of cholangiocarcinoma was low in non-Asian patients.
