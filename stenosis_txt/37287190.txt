Title: Acute quadriplegia and death following a routine MRI for undiagnosed degenerative cervical myelopathy.

Abstract: Bilateral upper limb paraesthesia and pain are common symptoms of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Such symptoms instigate investigation by cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This was the case for our patient, who was 72-years-in age and otherwise fit and well. During the scan he unfortunately developed sudden onset quadriplegia secondary to an intervertebral disc prolapse. This necessitated intubation due to respiratory failure and urgent transfer to the neurosciences critical care unit at a tertiary neurosciences centre. Despite prompt surgical decompression, he did not regain function. Extubation was unsuccessful on three occasions. Following discussion between the patient and his family, ventilation was withdrawn, and he died the following day. This case highlights the potentially devastating consequences of DCM and poses questions about the aetiology of DCM.
