Title: Development of an artificial portal vein using bioabsorbable polymers.

Abstract: PURPOSE: During surgical resection of malignant tumors in the hepatobiliary pancreatic region, portal vein resection and reconstruction may be needed. However, there is no alternative to the portal vein. We therefore developed an artificial portal vein that could be used in the abdominal cavity.
METHODS: In the experiments, hybrid pigs (n = 8) were included. An artificial portal vein was created using a bioabsorbable polymer sheet (BAPS). Subsequently, the portal vein's anterior wall was excised into an elliptical shape. A BAPS in the form of a patch was implanted at the same site. At 2 weeks (n = 3) and 3 months (n = 5) after the implantation, the BAPS implantation site was resected and evaluated macroscopically and histopathologically.
RESULTS: Immediately after the implantation, blood leakage was not detected. Two weeks after implantation, the BAPS remained, and endothelial cells were observed. Thrombus formation was not observed. Three months after implantation, the BAPS had been completely absorbed and was indistinguishable from the surrounding portal vein. Stenosis and aneurysms were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: BAPS can replace a defective portal vein from the early stage of implantation to BAPS absorption. These results suggest that it can be an alternative material to the portal vein in surgical reconstruction.
