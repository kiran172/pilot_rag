Title: Predictors of Clinical Outcomes in Adult Laryngotracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Sequelae of laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) can be devastating, often necessitating tracheostomy. This study aims to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with LTS and identify risk factors for long-term tracheostomy dependence stratified by etiology.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on 215 patients diagnosed with LTS from 09/01/2011 to 12/31/2020. Patients were grouped based on the cause of LTS. Patient factors were compared to evaluate risk factors for long-term tracheostomy dependence.
RESULTS: Of the 215 patients, 129 (60%) were classified as iatrogenic, 41 (19%) idiopathic, 10 (4.7%) cancer treatment, 18 (8.3%) autoimmune, and 17 (8%) patients unknown. Idiopathic patients were significantly less likely to be tracheostomy-dependent compared with iatrogenic patients (p < 0.001) and cancer patients (p < 0.05). The mortality rate did not significantly differ among the categories (p = 0.1078). Significant improvement was seen after treatment, as the median percent of stenosis at presentation was 52.5%, and the median percent of stenosis at the most recent visit was 10% (p < 0.001). The autoimmune group received the most steroid injections (mean = 6.56; SD = 11.96). The idiopathic group had the longest surgery-free interval (mean = 30.8 months; SD = 27.7).
CONCLUSION: Iatrogenic and cancer patients were more likely to be tracheostomy-dependent. There was a significant improvement in percent and length of stenosis after treatment, with the idiopathic group having the longest surgery-free interval. Mortality risk did not differ among the different etiologies of LTS.
