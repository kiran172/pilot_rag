Title: Aortic endarterectomy: a useful technique to utilize for aortic valve replacements in hostile aorta.

Abstract: Calcified aorta poses a significant technical challenge in the performance of surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Aortic endarterectomy is a less utilized approach and is suitable in select cases for aortic decalcification during AVR. Here, we report a case of calcified ascending aorta who underwent ascending aortic endarterectomy and AVR with the technical details of the procedure.
