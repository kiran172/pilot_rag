Title: Isolated Coronary Arteritis Treated With FDG-PET/CT-Guided Immunosuppressant to Break the Vicious Cycle of In-Stent Restenosis.

Abstract: Recurrent in-stent restenosis of the coronary artery is a rare but intractable problem. In this situation, coronary arteritis should be considered as an etiology. This case highlights the use of immunosuppressive drugs, including tocilizumab, and follow-up F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography to break the vicious circle of recurrent stenosis caused by isolated coronary arteritis of unknown cause.
