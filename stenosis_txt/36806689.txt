Title: Syncope in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: No data exist on the clinical and prognostic significance of syncope in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS: A total of 1705 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR in a tertiary university centre between 2007 and 2021 were included and classified according to the presence of syncope before the TAVR procedure. Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were collected prospectively in a dedicated database.
RESULTS: A total of 115 patients (7%) presented with syncope before the TAVR procedure. Of these, 15 patients (13%) showed arrhythmic episodes as the probable cause of the syncope, and all of them had pacemakers implanted at a median of 13 (6 to 53) days before the TAVR procedure. Patients with syncope were older (82 ± 8 years vs 80 ± 8 years, P = 0.001) and had a higher rate of pacemaker implantation before the TAVR procedure (27% vs 14%, P < 0.001), with no differences between groups regarding the severity of aortic stenosis (transvalvular gradient, valve area). There were no differences between groups in 30-day (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-3.60) and 1-year (adjusted HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.0.35-1.45) mortality following TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Syncope was not associated with a more advanced valvular disease and had no significant prognostic impact on patients undergoing TAVR. However, arrhythmias and conduction-system disturbances were more common in patients with previous syncope and might play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of syncope in patients with aortic stenosis.
