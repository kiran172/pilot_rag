Title: Computed tomography fractional flow reserve discrepancies with invasive angiography and physiology - Case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computed tomography with fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) is increasingly common in assessing coronary artery disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report five cases of discrepancies that led to changes in treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights discordant findings between modalities, which should be considered during the diagnostic assessment of chest pain.
