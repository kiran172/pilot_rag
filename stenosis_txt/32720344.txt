Title: Congenital superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis and obstructed supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC)-A surgical perspective.

Abstract: Congenital superior vena cava (SVC) stenosis is a very rare anomaly, especially in pediatric population. Coexistence with obstructed supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) has never been reported. Clinical examination should prompt detailed and focused evaluation for this treatable etiology. Pericardial patch augmentation can cure SVC stenosis, and may allow for growth potential as well. We describe a case of congenital SVC stenosis in a case of obstructed supracardiac TAPVC in a 3-month-old infant, managed successfully.
