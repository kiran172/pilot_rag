Title: The impact of stroke and bleeding on mortality and quality of life during the first year after TAVI: A POPular TAVI subanalysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bleeding and stroke are frequent complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The mortality risk associated with these events has been reported before, but data regarding their impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) is limited.
AIM: To evaluate the impact of bleeding and stroke occurring within 30 days after TAVI, on mortality and QoL during the first year after TAVI.
METHODS: POPular TAVI was a randomized clinical trial that evaluated the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin or oral anticoagulation in patients undergoing TAVI. Besides clinical outcomes, QoL was assessed using the Short Form-12 and EuroQoL Five Dimensions questionnaires before, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after TAVI.
RESULTS: Major or life-threatening bleeding occurred in 81 patients (8.3%) and was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-3.79]); minor bleeding occurred in 104 patients (10.6%) and was not associated with mortality (HR 0.75 [95% CI 0.30-1.89]). Stroke occurred in 35 patients (3.6%) and was associated with an increased risk of death (HR 2.90 [95% CI 1.23-6.83]). Mean mental component summary (MCS-12) scores over time were lower in patients with major or life-threatening bleeding (p = 0.01), and similar in patients with minor bleeding, compared to patients without bleeding; mean physical component summary (PCS-12) scores, EQ-5D index, and visual analog scale (VAS) were similar between those patients. Mean MCS-12 scores were lower in patients with stroke (p = 0.01), mean PCS-12, EQ-5D index, and VAS were similar compared to patients without stroke.
CONCLUSION: Major or life-threatening bleeding and stroke were associated with an increased risk of death and decreased mental QoL in the first year after TAVI.
