Title: Simultaneous integrated or sequential boost to clinically involved lymph nodes in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is controversial. With the widespread use of modern radiotherapy (RT) techniques, it is become possible to perform dose escalation in clinically involved LNs. This study aimed to evaluate the oncologic outcomes of dose escalation to the involved LNs with the simultaneous-integrated (SIB) or sequential boost (SEB) techniques as a part of definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for patients with LACC.
METHODS: The data of 47 patients treated with definitive CRT with either a SIB or SEB technique to the metastatic LNs between 2015 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received 50.4 Gy/28 fractions of external-beam RT and 28 Gy/4 fractions of brachytherapy.
RESULTS: The number of boosted LNs was 146. The median size of the LNs was 2 cm (range, 1-5 cm). The median cumulative equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions for the LNs was 64.2 Gy (range, 57.6-71.2 Gy). During the median 30 months of follow-up (range, 14-91 months), no boosted LNs recurred and the local control (LC) rate was 100%. The 2-year overall, disease-free, local recurrence-free, and distant metastasis-free survival rate was 83.1%, 70.5%, 77.5%, and 74.4%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the non-squamous cell histology was the only negative independent prognostic factor for DFS and DMFS. Treatment was well tolerated without any serious acute toxicity. Serious late toxicity developed in three (6%) patients as ureteral stenosis, rectal bleeding and pelvic fracture in one patient each.
CONCLUSIONS: RT dose escalation provides excellent LC for the clinically involved LNs, even for bulky ones, with a low toxicity profile. Routine LN dissection may not be necessary. However, randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment approach.
