Title: [Endoscopic diagnosis, treatment and evaluation of iatrogenic biliary stricture].

Abstract: Iatrogenic biliary stricture is a serious complication after biliary surgery. It can cause recurrent cholangitis, bile duct stones, cholestatic cirrhosis, and even liver failure. The overall effect of traditional surgery is satisfactory, but there are also shortcomings such as large trauma, high difficulty of surgery and poor acceptance of patients. With the development of endoscopic minimally invasive technology, choledochoscopy and duodenoscopy have become important treatment methods for iatrogenic biliary stricture, with the advantages of small trauma, high safety and strong repeatability. How to give full play to the advantages of endoscopic therapy, improve the success rate of stenosis treatment and reduce the recurrence rate is still a topic worthy of discussion.
