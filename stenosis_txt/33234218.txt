Title: Severe Left Main Coronary Stenosis Due to Aortic Bioprosthesis Implantation: A Case Report.

Abstract: Coronary artery ostial stenosis is a common but life-threatening complication that usually presents right after valve implantation, especially in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure. However, as reported in our case, it may also have a late delayed presentation in valve replacement through median sternotomy. Here, we present a rare case of one patient who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for severe stenosis of the left main (LM) coronary artery six months after Mosaic aortic bioprosthesis implantation.
