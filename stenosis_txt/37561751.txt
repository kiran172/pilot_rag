Title: Diagnostic utility of quantitative analysis of microRNA in bile samples obtained during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for malignant biliary strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The sensitivity of bile cytology for malignant biliary strictures is not adequate. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated whether quantitative analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) in bile can provide a precise diagnosis of malignant biliary strictures due to pancreatic cancer (PC) and biliary tract cancer (BTC).
METHODS: This was a retrospective evaluation of miRNA levels in stored bile samples of patients with PC, BTC or benign biliary stricture obtained during biliary drainage from April 2019 to December 2021 at our institution. A total of 113 patients (PC; n = 40, BTC; n = 38, control; n = 35) were enrolled. The miRNA candidates to be quantified were determined with microarray analysis from each 3 patients with PC, BTC and controls.
RESULTS: Using microarray analysis, we confirmed four significantly up-regulated miRNAs (miR-1275, miR-6891-5p, miR-7107-5p, miR-3197) in patients with PC and BTC compared to control patients. Quantitative PCR was then performed in 113 bile samples for these miRNAs. miR-1275 was significantly upregulated in PC (p = 0.003) and BTC (p = 0.049) compared to controls, miR-6891-5p was significantly upregulated in PC compared to controls (p = 0.025). In particular, a combination of bile cytology and miR-1275 in bile showed a sensitivity of 77.5% (95% CI, 70.7-77.5%), specificity of 100% (95% CI, 92.2-100%) and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93, and provided a significantly greater additional diagnostic effect than bile cytology alone (p = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest that bile miRNAs could be potential biomarkers for pancreato-biliary diseases, particularly miR-1275 and miR-6891-5p may be helpful in the diagnosis of PC and BTC.
