Title: ERCP and situs inversus.

Abstract: An 85-year-old female with situs inversus totalis was admitted due to obstructive jaundice, secondary to multiple choledocholithiasis and distal biliary stenosis due to adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas, with duodenal infiltration and metastatic liver disease. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was attempted in the supine position but bile duct cannulation was not possible due to duodenal infiltration. Finally, a palliative biliary stent was placed percutaneously, with resolution of the jaundice.
