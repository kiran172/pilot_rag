Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Asia: Present Status and Future Perspectives.

Abstract: Over the last decade, based on evidence from multiple randomized clinical trials, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the established treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Despite the overwhelming expansion of TAVR in Western countries, the initial uptake and widespread adoption of this procedure have been relatively delayed in Asian countries, owing to the high cost of devices; limited local health and reimbursement policies; and lack of specific training/proctoring program, specialized heart team, or dedicated infrastructure. Furthermore, it has not yet been determined whether there are substantial interracial and ethnic differences in the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and anatomic features, as well as procedural and long-term outcomes, in patients receiving TAVR. In this review, we provide not only a comprehensive look at the current status and outcomes of TAVR in Asian populations compared with those of Western populations but also a perspective on the future of TAVR in Asia.
