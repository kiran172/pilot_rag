Title: Aortic Valve Repair in Pediatric Patients: 30 Years Single Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Valve repair is the procedure of choice for congenital aortic valve disease. With increasing experience, the surgical armamentarium broadened from simple commissurotomy to more complex techniques. We report our 30-year experience with pediatric aortic valve repair.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients aged less than 18 years who underwent aortic valve repair from May 1985 to April 2020 was conducted. Mortality was cross-checked with the national health insurance database (96% complete mortality follow-up in April 2020). Primary study endpoints were survival and incidence of reoperations.
RESULTS: From May 1985 until April 2020, 126 patients underwent aortic valve repair at a median age of 1.8 years (interquartile range, 0.2-10). Early mortality was 5.6% (7 of 126). All early deaths occurred in neonates with critical aortic stenosis undergoing commissurotomy. No early deaths were observed after 2002. Kaplan-Meier estimated survival was 90.8% (95% CI, 84.0-94.8) at 10 years, 86.9% (95% CI, 78.7-92.2) at 20 years, and 83.5% (95% CI, 71.7-90.6) at 30 years. The cumulative incidence of aortic valve replacement was 37% (95% CI, 27.7-46.3) at 10 years, 62.2% (95% CI, 50.1-72.1) at 20 years, and 67.4% (51.2-79.2) at 30 years. Nine patients had undergone re-repair of the aortic valve. The majority of valve replacements were Ross procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a repair-first strategy for patients with congenital heart disease and underline that aortic valve reconstruction can be a successful long-term solution. Longevity did not differ between aortic valve commissurotomy and complex aortic valve reconstruction.
