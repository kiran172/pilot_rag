Title: Establishing a jugular-femoral venous route for recanalization of complicated inferior vena cava in Budd-Chiari Syndrome after transfemoral access failure.

Abstract: Recanalization of inferior vena cava (IVC) with complete obstruction, old thrombosis or long segmental stenosis/obstruction (complicated IVC) via transfemoral access may fail in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). In this study, 34 consecutive patients with BCS underwent recanalization of complicated IVC occlusion via jugular-femoral venous (JFV) route establishment. BCS with complicated IVC was detected by reviewing preoperative color Doppler ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) venography, and confirmed by intraoperative venography. Clinical data on technical success, complications, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. Except for one patient received surgical repair of rupture IVC after recanalization, technical success of IVC recanalization was achieved in remaining 33 (97.1%) patients. No perioperative deaths was found. Three complications were observed during recanalization, for a complication rate of 8.8%. Bleeding of the femoral vein was observed in one patient, and two patients showed bleeding of IVC. The IVC lesion diameter and blood flow of the distal IVC increased significantly after the procedure. Twenty-four patients (77.4%) were clinically cured, and four patients (12.9%) showed clinical improvement. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year primary patency rates were 85.9%, 76.4% and 70.0%, respectively. The 5-year secondary patency rate was 96.8%. There were three deaths during follow up, and the 5-year survival rate was 90.0%. In conclusion, JFV route establishment and angioplasty for complicated IVC is safe and effective for patients with BCS after transfemoral access failure.
