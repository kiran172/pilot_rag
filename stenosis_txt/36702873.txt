Title: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: maternal diabetes and perinatal exposure to non-macrolide antibiotics.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Infant exposure to macrolide antibiotics is a risk factor for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). The aim of the study was to establish whether perinatal exposure to non-macrolide antibiotics was a risk factor for IHPS.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective matched case-control study was performed using a database including all children born at Soroka University Medical Centre between 2006 and 2018. Cases and controls were compared using Student T-test and multiple logistic regression.
RESULT: Of 189 461 children in the database, 63 infants were diagnosed with IHPS and underwent pyloromyotomy. There was no association between non-macrolide antibiotic exposure and IHPS. Maternal diabetes (DM) had an adjusted odds ratio for infants developing IHPS of 4.53 (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: The lack of association between exposure to non-macrolide antibiotics and IHPS suggests a quality unique to macrolides. An association between DM and IHPS may suggest elevated levels of IGF-1 have a role.
