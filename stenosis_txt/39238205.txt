Title: Efficacy and Safety of In-Office Transnasal Oesophagoscopy and Balloon Dilatation for Patients Presenting With High Dysphagia: A 6-Year Retrospective Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of in-office transnasal oesophagoscopy (TNO) and balloon dilatation for patients presenting with symptoms of high dysphagia. The secondary objective was to conduct a subgroup analysis to better understand patient selection.
METHODS: Retrospective observational study from a single university hospital.
RESULTS: Two-hundred four TNO and balloon dilatations were performed for 146 patients (median age 73 years; range 12-94 years). Indications included cricopharyngeal hypertrophy ± pouch (n = 70), hypopharyngeal/upper oesophageal web/stenosis (n = 18), head and neck cancer treatment-related (n = 41), multi-level obstruction (n = 13) and symptom-based (n = 4). The mean EAT-10 score improved from 21.2 (SD ± 8.92) pre-dilatation to 12.6 (SD ± 10.7) post-dilatation overall (median follow-up 4.4 months; range 1.5 months-6.21 years). Cricopharyngeal hypertrophy and/or web without dysmotility cohort responded the best with the mean EAT-10 score improvement from 20.4 (SD ± 8.21) to 4.4 (SD ± 6.71). Head and neck cancer patient group showed three types of responses: good response although effect transient requiring repeat dilatations; initial good response however stops responding over time and no response. The overall complication rate was 0.98% (n = 2/204; both failed in-clinic attempts) with 0% perforation rate.
CONCLUSION: TNO and balloon dilatation is a safe and effective treatment modality for managing high dysphagia in patients with identifiable non-malignant obstructive pathologies at and around the level of the upper oesophageal sphincter, including head and neck cancer treatment-related patients, both short-term and long-term. Barium swallow is an excellent screening tool for assessing the swallow as a whole.
