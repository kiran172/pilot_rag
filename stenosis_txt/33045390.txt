Title: Clinical outcomes of radiofrequency ablation for patients with varicose veins of the lower extremities combined with grade II iliac vein compression.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Iliac vein compression (IVC) is a common condition in patients with varicose veins (VVs) of the legs. IVC has been classified into three grades in previous studies. Grade II IVC is defined by >50% stenosis without the development of collateral circulation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for patients with VVs combined with grade II IVC.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 339 patients who had undergone RFA for VVs of the left leg from March 2017 to January 2019. Duplex ultrasonography, computed tomography venography, and venography were performed to evaluate for grade II IVC. All the patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 included patients with VVs only, and group 2, patients with VVs combined with grade II IVC. Propensity score matching was used to ensure an even distribution of confounding factors between groups. The venous clinical severity score (VCSS) and chronic venous insufficiency questionnaire (CIVIQ) score were recorded during the 12-month follow-up. Occlusion of the truncal veins was evaluated using duplex ultrasound scans.
RESULTS: Using 1:1 propensity score matching, 50 pairs of patients were enrolled in the present analysis. The average age of groups 1 and 2 was 58.7 ± 13.1 and 60.1 ± 7.1 years, respectively. The VCSS had decreased significantly from baseline to 12 months postoperatively (group 1, from 5 to 1; group 2, from 4 to 1; P < .01). A significant increase in the CIVIQ score was found between the baseline and 12-month evaluations for both groups (group 1, from 62.5 to 69; group 2, from 63 to 70; P < .01). The truncal occlusion rate was 98% in both groups at 12 months. No significant differences were found between the two groups in the VCSS, CIVIQ score, procedure complications, or occlusion rate during the 12-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: RFA is effective for patients with VVs combined with grade II IVC.
