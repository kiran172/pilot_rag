Title: Redefining the exact roles and importance of carotid intima-media thickness and carotid plaque thickness in predicting cardiovascular events.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The survey aimed to evaluate the precise roles and importance of carotid plaque thickness and carotid intima-media thickness measured in plaque-free areas (PF CC-IMTmean) in future cardiovascular risk prediction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 188 respondents between the age of 46 and 87 divided into two groups (I group - 94 respondents without plaques with CIMT measurement and II Group 94 respondents with carotid plaques; 118 men and 70 women; mean age ± SD, 61.80 ± 5.49) were prospectively examined by the carotid ultrasound Doppler (carotid measurements included plaque thickness PT - nonstenotic plaques (carotid stenosis <50%) and stenotic culprit plaques (carotid stenosis ≥50%), mean CIMT and maximum CIMT). Subjects were followed for 36 months from the inclusion in the study (regular control examinations). Data were recorded on new cases of mortality (CV mortality) and adverse CV events (myocardial infarction - -MI, surgical or endovascular revascularization - coronary or stroke).
RESULTS: In this study, CIMT values vary between 0.62 and 1.43 mm (mean CIMT = 1.21 ± 0.2 mm) while 52 subjects had nonstenotic plaques (14 respondents plaque ulceration, 22 type 2 diabetes mellitus, 38 arterial hypertension) and 38 subjects had stenotic culprit plaques (17 respondents plaque ulceration, 20 type 2 diabetes mellitus, 31 arterial hypertension). After 36 months of follow-up, 76 vascular events were noted (MI, transient ischaemic attack - TIA, stroke and cardiovascular angioplasty or surgery) in this period.
CONCLUSION: Respondents with carotid plaques had higher cardiovascular events occurrence (p &lt; .01, high statistical difference). Carotid plaques as a parameter have higher predictive vascular event value importance than CIMT. Of note, stenotic plaques, the presence of ulceration on the free surface of the plaque, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension were connected with the highest events occurrence.
