Title: Surgical transcatheter valve implantation: The more pathways, the better.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is rapidly spreading across the world with the endorsement of the cardiological community and the supporting results of randomized controlled trials. However, TAVI-related complications like aortic dissection, aortic valvular rupture, or left ventricle perforation are still potentially catastrophic.
