Title: Intraoperative blood pressure lability carries a higher risk of headache after carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is a rare but potentially devastating complication after carotid endarterectomies (CEA). Its symptoms range from new-onset unilateral headache (HA) to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Risk factors for CHS in the literature to date have not yet yielded a consensus. This study examines intraoperative and postoperative blood pressure variations as potential risk factors for HA.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective review at a tertiary care center from January 2010 to November 2019 was performed. Inclusion criteria were all patients undergoing CEA for symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid disease. Patients with incomplete charts were excluded. Primary endpoints were new-onset unilateral HA or postoperative ICH. Data on intraoperative and postoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), the mode of endarterectomy, shunt placement, and contralateral carotid status were collected.
RESULTS: There were 735 patients who met the inclusion criteria: 430 patients underwent modified eversion CEA (59%) and 305 patients for patch angioplasty (42%). The incidence of HA was 19% (n = 142) in our total cohort. Of the 19% with HA, 1.5% (n = 11) demonstrated no relief with analgesics and strict blood pressure control; noncontrast head computed tomography scans were performed subsequently. One patient (0.1%) had an ipsilateral ICH. Univariate analysis demonstrated that greater intraoperative MAP peak had the highest risk for HA (odds ratio [OR], 1.014; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.007-1.022; P = .0002), followed by intraoperative MAP variability (OR, 1.011; 95% CI,1.005-1.018; P ≤ .0008), and peak intraoperative SBP (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.004-1.015; P = .0011). An unpaired Student t test identified change in intraoperative MAP (P < .005), change in the SBP (P < .005), and peak SBP (P < .001) were significantly associated with HA. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between postoperative MAP variability and HA (P = .1). The mode of endarterectomy showed no statistically significant difference in risk for developing HA (OR, 1.165; 95%; 95% CI, 0.801-1.694; P = .42).
CONCLUSIONS: Greater intraoperative variability in blood pressures are significantly associated with a higher risk of HA. Adhering to stricter intraoperative blood pressure parameters and limiting blood pressure variability may be beneficial at decreasing the incidence of CHS and its complications.
