Title: Artificial intelligence-enabled phenotyping of patients with severe aortic stenosis: on the recovery of extra-aortic valve cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: A novel artificial intelligence-based phenotyping approach to stratify patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been proposed, based on echocardiographic and haemodynamic data. This study aimed to analyse the recovery of extra-aortic valve cardiac damage in accordance with this novel stratification system following TAVR.
METHODS: The proposed phenotyping approach was previously established employing data from 366 patients with severe AS from a bicentric registry. For this consecutive study, echocardiographic follow-up data, obtained on day 147±75.1 after TAVR, were available from 247 patients (67.5%).
RESULTS: Correction of severe AS by TAVR significantly reduced the proportion of patients suffering from concurrent severe mitral regurgitation (from 9.29% to 3.64%, p value: 0.0015). Moreover, pulmonary artery pressures were ameliorated (estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure: from 47.2±15.8 to 43.3±15.1 mm Hg, p value: 0.0079). However, right heart dysfunction as well as the proportion of patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation remained unchanged. Clusters with persistent right heart dysfunction ultimately displayed 2-year survival rates of 69.2% (95% CI 56.6% to 84.7%) and 74.6% (95% CI 65.9% to 84.4%), which were significantly lower compared with clusters with little or no persistent cardiopulmonary impairment (88.3% (95% CI 83.3% to 93.5%) and 85.5% (95% CI 77.1% to 94.8%)).
CONCLUSIONS: This phenotyping approach preprocedurally identifies patients with severe AS, who will not recover from extra-aortic valve cardiac damage following TAVR and whose survival is therefore significantly reduced. Importantly, not the degree of pulmonary hypertension at initial presentation, but the irreversibility of right heart dysfunction determines prognosis.
