Title: Characterization of myocardial mechanics and its prognostic significance in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIMS: Aortic stenosis (AS) induces characteristic changes in left ventricular (LV) mechanics that can be reversed after aortic valve replacement (AVR). We aimed to comprehensively characterize LV mechanics before and after AVR in patients with severe AS and identify predictors of short-term functional recovery and long-term survival.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively performed comprehensive strain analysis by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography in 88 patients with severe AS and LV ejection fraction ≥50% (mean age 71 ± 12 years, 42% female) prior to and within 7 days after AVR. Patients were followed for up to 5.2 years until death from any cause or last encounter. Within days after AVR, we observed an absolute increase in global longitudinal strain (GLS) (-16.0 ± 2.0% vs. -18.5 ± 2.1%, P&lt;0.0001) and a decrease in apical rotation (10.5 ± 4.0° vs. 8.3 ± 2.8°, P = 0.0002) and peak systolic twist (18.2 ± 5.0° vs. 15.5 ± 3.8°, P = 0.0008). A baseline GLS is less negative than -16.2% was 90% sensitive and 67% specific in predicting a ≥ 20% relative increase in GLS. During a median follow-up of 3.8 years, a global circumferential systolic strain rate (GCSRs) less negative than -1.9% independently predicted lower survival.
CONCLUSION: In patients with severe AS, a reversal in GLS, apical rotation, and peak systolic twist abnormalities towards normal occurs within days of AVR. Baseline GLS is the strongest predictor of GLS recovery but neither was associated with long-term survival. In contrast, abnormal baseline GCSRs are associated with worse outcomes.
