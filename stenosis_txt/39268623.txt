Title: Resolution of high aortic valve systolic gradient suggesting significant stenosis following closure of patent ductus arteriosus.

Abstract: A 3-month-old baby girl presenting with heart failure was found to have a large persistent ductus arteriosus as well as a bicuspid aortic valve with severe aortic stenosis. She underwent surgical ductal closure following which there was complete resolution of aortic valve gradients without requiring any aortic valve intervention. This case highlights the importance of understanding hemodynamics in efficacious management of congenital heart disease.
