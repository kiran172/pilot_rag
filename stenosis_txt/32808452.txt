Title: Subclinical biliary strictures as a cause of long-term allograft dysfunction in children who underwent liver transplantation.

Abstract: We aimed to evaluate the role of liver biopsy to predict subclinical biliary strictures (BS) and assess the impact of BS on long-term allograft dysfunction following liver transplantation in children (LT). We reviewed all liver biopsies performed from 2012-2018. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) was performed in patients presenting cholangiolar proliferation on cytokeratin-7 stained sections. We performed 271 biopsies in 161 children (86% with a left lateral segment); 44/161 (27%) presented with diffuse or multifocal cholangiolar proliferation. Among them, a tight BS was confirmed in 38/44 (86%, 24% of total) and it was managed by balloon dilatation. Cholangiolar proliferation showed a positive predictive value (PPV) for BS of 86.4%. Levels of alkaline phosphatase >325 IU/L predicted BS (P = .007). Dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts on ultrasound was found only in 44% of patients with BS. Following a median follow-up of 9.2 years, only 15/38 (39%) patients resolved the BS. In conclusion subclinical BS is very common and probably underdiagnosed in these patients. Histological evidence of cholangiolar proliferation detectable by cytokeratin-7 immunostain should be preferred to liver function tests and ultrasound to suspect BS. BS in this setting should be regarded as a main cause of long-term allograft dysfunction.
