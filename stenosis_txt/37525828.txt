Title: Prevention and Treatment of Anastomotic Strictures After Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoids.

Abstract: Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoids (PPH), also known as circular stapled hemorrhoidectomy, is a common method of treating hemorrhoids due to its low risk of complications and minimal postoperative pain. Several complications have appeared alongside the rise of treated cases, however, and this has led to a progressive slowing of the clinical use of PPH in recent years. Anastomotic stenosis is one of the most common complications of PPH, but the greater amount of tissue removed and the speed with which it can heal make it the best choice for patients with severe prolapsed annular hemorrhoids or rectal mucosal prolapse. Therefore, academics continue to comprehensively study PPH to take advantage of annular resection and reduce complications. In this paper, we analyzed the causes, intraoperative warnings, and postoperative therapy of anastomotic stenosis induced by PPH, with an eye toward scientific application in the anorectal field, based on the experience of clinical applications.
