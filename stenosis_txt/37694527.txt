Title: Hypoxia following warden procedure: evaluation and percutaneous treatment.

Abstract: Partial anomalous venous connection with sinus venosus atrial septal defect is repaired with different approaches including the Warden procedure. Complications include stenosis of the superior caval vein and pulmonary venous baffle; however, cyanosis is rarely seen post-operatively. We report a patient presenting with cyanosis 5 years after a Warden, which was treated with a transcatheter approach.
