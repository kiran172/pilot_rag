Title: Coexistence of Cor Triatriatum Sinister, Fibroelastoma and Pulmonary Veins Ostial Anatomy Variant as Incidental Findings in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography.

Abstract: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a noninvasive examination whose main purpose is to exclude significant stenosis in the coronary arteries. The obtained computed tomography images may also provide information about other coexisting pathologies of the heart and vessels. The paper presents images of cardiac lesions in a 44-year-old hypertensive patient who underwent CCTA, based on which significant stenosis in the coronary arteries was excluded, the suspicion of a cor triatriatum sinister was confirmed and the presence of fibroelastoma and a variant of the anatomy of the pulmonary veins ostial was confirmed. To sum up, when performing CCTA, apart from the analysis of the coronary arteries, one should remember about lesions in the remaining visible anatomical structures of the heart and large vessels.
