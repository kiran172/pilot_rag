Title: [Esophageal Lichen Planus - An Underdiagnosed Disease].

Abstract: An involvement of the esophagus in patients with lichen planus was described for the first time in 1982. Ever since, it has been seen as a rarity. However, studies over the last 10 years have shown a higher prevalence than expected. It may even be supposed that esophageal lichen planus (ELP) is more common than eosinophilic esophagitis. ELP mostly affects middleaged women. The principal symptom is dysphagia. Endoscopically, ELP is characterized by denudation and tearing of the mucosa, trachealization and hyperkeratosis and esophageal stenosis may occur in patients with long courses of the disease. Histologic findings including mucosal detachment, T-lymphocytic infiltrate, intraepithelial apoptosis (civatte bodies) and dyskeratosis are crucial. Direct immunofluorescence shows fibrinogen deposits along the basement membrane zone. So far, there is no well-established therapy but a treatment with topic steroids is effective in 2/3 of the patients. Common therapy of lichen planus of the skin seems to be ineffective for treatment of ELP. Symptomatic esophageal stenosis should be endoscopically dilated. ELP joins the group of "new" immunologic diseases of the esophagus.
