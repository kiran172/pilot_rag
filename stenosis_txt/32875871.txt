Title: Improvement of Lower Back Pain in Lumbar Spinal Stenosis After Decompression Surgery and Factors That Predict Residual Lower Back Pain.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
OBJECTIVES: There is no consensus to predict improvement of lower back pain (LBP) in lumbar spinal stenosis after decompression surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the improvement of LBP and analyze the preoperative predicting factors for residual LBP.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 119 patients who underwent lumbar decompression surgery without fusion and had a minimum follow-up of 1 year. LBP was evaluated using the numerical rating scale (NRS), Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) LBP score, and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). All patients were divided into LBP improved group (group I) and LBP residual group (group R) according to the NRS score. Radiographic images were examined preoperatively and at the final follow-up. We evaluated spinopelvic radiological parameters and analyzed the differences between group I and group R.
RESULTS: LBP was significantly improved after decompression surgery (LBP NRS, 5.7 vs 2.6, P &lt; .001; JOABPEQ LBP score, 41.3 vs 79.6, P &lt; .001; RMDQ, 10.3 vs 3.6, P &lt; .001). Of 119 patients, 94 patients were allocated to group I and 25 was allocated to group R. There was significant difference in preoperative thoracolumbar kyphosis between group I and group R.
CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of LBP in lumbar spinal stenosis were improved after decompression surgery without fusion. Preoperative thoracolumbar kyphosis predicted residual LBP after decompression surgery.
