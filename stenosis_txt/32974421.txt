Title: Disease-inspired tissue engineering: Investigation of cardiovascular pathologies.

Abstract: Once focused exclusively on the creation of tissues to repair or replace diseased or damaged organs, the field of tissue engineering has undergone an important evolution in recent years. Namely, tissue engineering techniques are increasingly being applied to intentionally generate pathological conditions. Motivated in part by the wide gap between 2D cultures and animal models in the current disease modeling continuum, disease-inspired tissue-engineered platforms have numerous potential applications, and may serve to advance our understanding and clinical treatment of various diseases. This review will focus on recent progress toward generating tissue-engineered models of cardiovascular diseases, including cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and ischemia reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and calcific aortic valve disease, with an emphasis on how these disease-inspired platforms can be used to decipher disease etiology. Each pathology is discussed in the context of generating both disease-specific cells as well as disease-specific extracellular environments, with an eye toward future opportunities to integrate different tools to yield more complex and physiologically relevant culture platforms. Ultimately, the development of effective disease treatments relies upon our ability to develop appropriate experimental models; as cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, the insights yielded by improved in vitro disease modeling could have substantial ramifications for public health and clinical care.
