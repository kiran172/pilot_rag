Title: Tracheal resection for tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: Anatomically, patients with refractory tracheal stenosis benefit from tracheal resection, depending on the medical comorbidities or challenging tracheal anatomy, which is often the reason for denial of this option in these patients. We evaluated 15 patients undergoing tracheal resection at our institution from May 2016 through December 2017. Eleven patients had a history of previous tracheostomy, six in place at the time of resection. One had idiopathic stenosis with no known comorbidities. Major comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. One had a left ventricular assist device, and one was a lung transplant recipient. All had primary resection through the cervical approach with a median length of 3.5 cm. Fourteen patients were eventually decannulated. One patient had re-resection 1 year later for recurrent stenosis. Twelve were alive at a median follow-up of 15 months with patent airways. In conclusion, tracheal stenosis patients have significant comorbidities that increase the risks after resection. However, these patients should still be considered for surgery for an improved quality of life and eventual resolution of severe stenosis.
