Title: Lymphogranuloma venereum: an unusual cause of rectal stenosis.

Abstract: Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV) is a notifiable disease linked to high-risk sexual practices such as cruising, chemsex, or orgies. The anorectal manifestation is associated with receptive anal sex and presents with characteristic symptoms such as proctitis, tenesmus, suppuration, and in advanced cases, anorectal fistulas or stenosis. The case of a 57-year-old man engaging in high-risk sexual practices is presented, showing symptoms such as discharge, fistulizations, rectal stenosis, and a weight loss of 15 kg. Following diagnostic studies, a neoplastic and inflammatory origin was ruled out, confirming the LGV diagnosis. Although the patient responded positively to a three-week course of doxycycline, the stenosis persisted, ultimately necessitating a terminal colostomy. The patient was scheduled to undergo a protectomy to control the inflammatory and infectious process, a procedure that took place months later without significant incidents. The primary treatment for LGV continues to be doxycycline. In cases of complications, such as fistulas, abscesses, or stenosis, surgical interventions, drainage, or pneumatic dilations may be necessary.
