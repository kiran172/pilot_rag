Title: Rheumatic mitral valve repair: the Score procedure.

Abstract: We have defined a standard surgical procedure for rheumatic mitral valve repair (the Score procedure) including four steps: shaving, checking, commissurotomy, and relaxing. Here, we summarize the clinical pathological classification for making a decision on repair or replacement. Given the large number of patients in China, we consider it the responsibility of Chinese cardiac surgeons to adopt a therapeutic schedule for rheumatic mitral valve disease, which includes a simple operation with reliable effects and easy to promote. This schedule would ensure that millions of patients get the best treatment to extend survival and improve their quality of life.
