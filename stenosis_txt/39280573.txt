Title: One Puncture, Two Solutions: Simultaneous Carotid and Iliac Artery Stenting.

Abstract: An 81-year-old man with asymptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis and symptomatic iliac artery stenosis underwent simultaneous carotid artery stenting (CAS) and iliac artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting. The procedure involved transfemoral access, balloon angioplasty, and stenting of the right iliac artery, followed by CAS of the right carotid artery. Similar procedures were performed later on the left iliac and carotid arteries. The patient was discharged with no neurological deficits and remained asymptomatic at a six-month follow-up. Simultaneous CAS and iliac artery stenting were feasible and effective in patients with concurrent severe carotid and iliac artery stenosis, providing a comprehensive revascularization strategy for patients with complex atherosclerotic disease.
