Title: Dietary nutrients of relative importance associated with coronary artery disease: Public health implication from random forest analysis.

Abstract: Dietary nutrients have significant effects on the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the results were not uniform across different countries. The study aims to determine the relative importance of dietary nutrients associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) among the Nepalese population. A hospital-based matched case-control study was carried out at Shahid Gangalal National Heart Center in Nepal. In the present study, patients with more than seventy percent stenosis in any main coronary artery branch in angiography were defined as cases, while those presenting normal coronary angiography or negative for stressed exercise test were considered controls. Dietary intakes of 612 respondents over the past 12 months were evaluated using a semi-quantitative customized food frequency questionnaire. In conditional regression model, the daily average dietary intake of β-carotene (OR: 0.54; 95%CI: 0.34, 0.87), and vitamin C (OR: 0.96; 95%CI: 0.93, 0.99) were inversely, whereas dietary carbohydrate (OR: 1.16; 95%CI: 1.1, 1.24), total fat/oil (OR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.27, 1.69), saturated fatty acid (SFA) (OR: 1.2; 95%CI: 1.11, 1.3), cholesterol (OR: 1.01; 95%CI: 1.001, 1.014), and iron intakes (OR: 1.11; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.19) were positively linked with CAD. Moreover, in random forest analysis, the daily average dietary intakes of SFA, vitamin A, total fat/oil, β-carotene, and cholesterol were among the top five nutrients (out of 12 nutrients variables) of relative importance associated with CAD. The nutrients of relative importance imply a reasonable preventive measure in public health nutrients specific intervention to prevent CAD in a resource-poor country like Nepal. The findings are at best suggestive of a possible relationship between these nutrients and the development of CAD, but prospective cohort studies and randomized control trials will need to be performed in the Nepalese population.
