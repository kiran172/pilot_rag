Title: The efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for the endovascular management of arteriovenous fistula dysfunction: a retrospective analysis in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the endovascular management of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
METHODS: A total of 135 consecutive patients with ESRD (mean±SD age: 58.8±9.4 years, 74.8% were males) who underwent endovascular treatment for a dysfunctional native AVF were included in this retrospective single-center study. Data on patient demographics, etiology of ESRD, characteristics of AVF, stenotic segments, PTA parameters and postoperative recurrence and patency rates within the 12 months were recorded.
RESULTS: Technical and clinical success rates of PTA were 100.0% and 97.0%, respectively. Dysfunction recurrence rate was 30.4%. In patients with vs. without presence of recurrent AVF dysfunction, there was higher percentage of males (P=0.030), older age (P=0.018), diabetic or hypertensive rather than polycystic etiology (P<0.001), younger AVF (P<0.001), longer-segment stenosis (P=0.019) and lower median number (P=0.038) of stenotic segments. Presence of hypertension (OR 12.23, 95% CI: 4.29 to 34.85, P<0.001) and age of the AVF (OR 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.08, P=0.029) were significant determinants of increased risk of recurrent AVF dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize favorable safety and efficacy of PTA in the management of dysfunctional hemodialysis AVFs in terms of high technical and clinical success and low rates of residual stenosis, complications and post-PTA recurrence of AVF dysfunction. Male gender, older patient age, younger AVF and longer-segment stenosis were associated with higher likelihood of AVF failure, whereas hypertension and age of AVF were the two significant determinants of increased risk of post-PTA recurrence of AVF dysfunction.
