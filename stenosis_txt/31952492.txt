Title: Surgical removal of part of an occluder to treat iatrogenic coarctation of the aorta: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Iatrogenic aortic stenosis is a serious complication and potentially fatal due to erosion of the aortic wall. Timely management is necessary to prevent complications.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old boy underwent surgery to remove part of an Amplatzer occluder after patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) device embolization in the thoracic aorta. He exhibited moderate to severe obstruction with erosion of the intimal layer of the aorta caused by the device, part of which was retrieved surgically with restructuring of the thoracic aorta segment and occluder remnant. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful.
CONCLUSIONS: When possible, retrieving only part of an embolized device can be advocated because it reduces the risk of aortic and pulmonary artery damage.
