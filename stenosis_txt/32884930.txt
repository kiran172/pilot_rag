Title: Congenital Laryngeal Stenosis and Concomitant Birth Defects in a Term Newborn: A Case Report.

Abstract: Congenital laryngeal stenosis is a rare and unusual anomaly that usually presents in the first minutes after delivery as severe life-threatening respiratory distress. It may exist as an isolated entity or in association with other congenital malformations, in particular cardiac anomalies. In this paper, we present the case of an infant with prenatal suspicion of tetralogy of Fallot. Immediately after delivery, the patient required intubation, which proved difficult. He was eventually diagnosed with laryngeal stenosis requiring laryngological treatment.
