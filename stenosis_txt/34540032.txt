Title: IVUS plus multivariate analysis for evaluating the stability of coronary artery plaque in coronary heart disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) plus multivariate analysis in evaluating the stability of coronary artery plaque in coronary heart disease (CHD).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on ninety-five patients with CHD admitted to our hospital from February 2020 to February 2021. Patients with CHD were examined by IVUS and assigned to a stable plaque group (n=60) and an unstable plaque group (n=35) according to their characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the risk factors affecting the stability of coronary artery plaque.
RESULTS: Of 95 patients, 35 cases with unstable plaque were determined by IVUS, with a detection rate of 36.84%; notable differences were found in HDL-C, hs-CRP, and homocysteine (Hcy) between the two groups (P&lt;0.05). The eccentricity index and reconstruction index of the two groups were statistically different (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, 17 cases were diagnosed by IVUS as mild coronary stenosis, 28 cases as moderate stenosis, and 50 cases as severe stenosis. In addition, compared with the stable plaque group, the unstable plaque group yielded a much higher stenosis rate (P&lt;0.05) and a higher level of plaque thickness and plaque area (P&lt;0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed eccentricity index, remodeling index, plaque thickness, and plaque area, stenosis rate, HDL-C, Hcy, and hs-CRP were independent risk factors for unstable plaque (P&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: IVUS plus multivariate analysis can accurately assess plaque stability.
