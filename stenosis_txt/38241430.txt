Title: Treatment of Chronic Extensor Carpi Ulnaris Stenosing Tenosynovitis Using Ultrasound-Guided Retinaculum Release: A Case Report.

Abstract: CASE: A 65-year-old man with chronic extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) stenosing tenosynovitis who had failed treatments for 3 years was successfully treated with an ultrasound-guided retinaculum release of the sixth dorsal compartment.
CONCLUSION: There are limited options in the literature for treating chronic, recalcitrant ECU tenosynovitis. We describe a novel technique in which the retinaculum overlying the ECU tendon was successfully incised under ultrasound guidance to release the sixth dorsal compartment stenosis. There was no recurrence of symptoms in the following 2 years of follow-up.
