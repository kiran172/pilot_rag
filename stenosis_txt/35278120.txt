Title: FLAIR vessel hyperintensities predict functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with medical therapy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The prognostic value of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery vessel hyperintensity (FVH) remains controversial in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The objective was to investigate whether the presence of FVH could predict long-term functional outcomes in patients with AIS receiving medical therapy.
METHODS: Consecutive AIS patients with anterior circulation large vessel stenosis (LVS) in multiple centers between January 2019 and December 2020 were studied. Presence of FVH was identified and evaluated as FVH (+). Quantification of FVH was performed using an FVH-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) system and divided into grades: FVH-ASPECTS of 0 = grade 0; 1-2 = grade 1; 3-7 = grade 2. Poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale > 2 at 3 months.
RESULTS: Overall, 175 patients were analyzed (age, 64.31 ± 13.47 years; men, 65.1%), and 78.9% patients presented with FVH. Larger infarct volume (19.90 mL vs. 5.50 mL, p < 0.001), higher rates of FVH (+) (92.0% vs. 65.9%, p < 0.001), and higher FVH grades (grade 2, 34.5% vs. 10.2%, p < 0.001) were more prone to be observed in patients with poor functional outcomes. FVH (+) with infarct volume larger than 6.265 mL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82-19.98) and FVH grade (grade 1, aOR 3.07, 95% CI 1.12-8.43; grade 2, aOR 5.80, 95% CI 1.59-21.11) were independently associated with poor functional outcomes.
CONCLUSION: FVH (+) combined with large infarct volume and high FVH grade can predict poor long-term functional outcomes in patients with LVS who receive medical therapy.
KEY POINTS: • FVH is expected to be a contrast agent-independent alternative for assessing hemodynamic status in the acute stage of stroke. • FVH (+) and high FVH grade, quantified by FVH-ASPECTS rating system and grades, are associated with large infarct volume. • The combination of FVH and DWI-based infarct volume has independent predictive value for long-term functional outcomes in AIS patients with large artery stenosis treated with medical therapy.
