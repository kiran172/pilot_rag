Title: Establishing a robotic-assisted PCI program: experiences at a large tertiary referral center.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary interventions (rPCI) have proven feasible and safe while reducing radiation exposure for the operator. Recently, rPCI systems have been refined to facilitate the treatment of complex lesions. The aim of the current study was to evaluate challenges and opportunities of establishing an rPCI program at a tertiary referral center. rPCI was performed using the CorPath GRX Vascular Robotic System (Corindus Inc., a Siemens Healthineers Company, Waltham, USA). Baseline, procedural, and in-hospital follow-up data were prospectively assessed. rPCI success was defined as completion of the PCI without or with partial manual assistance. The safety endpoint was the composite of missing angiographic success or procedure-related adverse events during hospital stay. Overall, 86 coronary lesions were treated in 71 patients (28.2% female) from January to April 2021. Median age was 71.0Â years (IQR 60.3; 79.8). Indications for rPCI were stable angina pectoris (71.8%), unstable angina (12.7%) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (15.5%). Most lesions were complex (type B2/C: 88.4%) and included 7 cases of rPCI for chronic total occlusions. Angiographic and rPCI success were achieved in 100.0% and 94.2%, respectively. Partial manual assistance was used in 25.6%. Conversion to manual PCI was required in 5.8%. The safety endpoint occurred in 7.0% of patients. rPCI when applied as clinical routine for complex coronary lesions is effective with good immediate angiographic and clinical results. Future investigations should focus on the identification of patients that particularly benefit from robotic-assisted vs. manual PCI despite higher resource utilization.
