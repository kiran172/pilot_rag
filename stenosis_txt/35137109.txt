Title: Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome associated with valvular pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: Association between hypoplastic left heart syndrome and valvular pulmonary stenosis is very rare. Severity of valvular pulmonary stenosis in this setting limits management options. Consequently, patients with this condition are considered poor candidates for Norwood stage one reconstruction. Herein, we describe a newborn with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and significantly dysplastic pulmonary valve who successfully underwent the Norwood procedure with neoaortic valve reconstruction. Therefore, the Norwood procedure with neoaortic valve reconstruction might be an option for this difficult condition.
