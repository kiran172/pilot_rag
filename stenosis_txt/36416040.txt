Title: Evaluation of rs1748195 ANGPTL3 gene polymorphism in patients with angiographic coronary artery disease compared to healthy individuals.

Abstract: SUBJECT: The Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) gene has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular risk. This study is designed to compare the genetic variant (rs1748195) of the ANGPTL3 gene and the presence of a coronary artery occlusion of >50% in Iranian nation.
METHOD: In this study, 184 patients underwent angiography and 317 healthy individuals were evaluated for polymorphism of rs1748195 the ANGPTL3 gene using Tetra-ARMs PCR. Coronary patients who experience angiography were categorized into two groups: 54 patients who had an angiography indication for the first time and coronary occlusion was <50% (Angio-) and 134 patients who formerly underwent coronary stent implanting at least 1 month before with coronary occlusion of ≥50% that again have an angiography indication (Angio+). In addition, individuals with angio+ are categorized in two groups: (1) non-in-stent restenosis (NISR); patient with a patent stent (N = 92). (2) in-stent restenosis (ISR); in-stent stenosis >50% (N = 42).
RESULT: The fundamental of characteristics of our study design population was categorized based on undergoing angiography or not. In the present study, we investigated that the CC genotype, and also the A allele corresponding to rs1748195 at the ANGPTL3 gene loci, was associated with negative angiogram and directly related to the risk of coronary occlusion >50%. In contrast, this result was not significant in genotypes of ANGPTL3 between non-ISR and ISR groups.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study showed that rs1748195 polymorphism at the ANGPTL3 gene loci is associated with an elevated risk for the existence of a coronary occlusion of >50%.
