Title: Laparoscopic-assisted anorectoplasty for intermediate type rectovestibular fistula: a preliminary report.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Laparoscopic-assisted anorectoplasty (LAARP) is considered to benefit the male patients with anorectal malformation (ARM). This study evaluates LAARP management for intermediate type rectovestibular fistula (IRVF) in the female patient with ARM.
METHODS: Twelve patients with IRVF (aged 3-5 months) underwent LAARP from 2017 to 2019 in our institute. LAARP was performed for mobilization of the rectum, visualization and enlargement of the center of the sphincter muscle complex (SMC) from pelvic and perineal aspects, intra-fistula mucosectomy and rectal pull-through in the SMC with the fourchette and the perineal body unattached.
RESULTS: LARRP was performed in all patients without conversion to open procedure. No patient suffered from wound infection, vaginal injury, recurrent fistula and anal stenosis. The parents were satisfied with the appearance of the wound. Rectal prolapse developed in one patient and needed surgical correction. The patients were followed up for a mean of 19.7 months (ranged from 12 to 35 months).
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience shows that LAARP offers an alternative method of correction for the IRVF with good visualization of the SMC and may diminish the risks of wound dehiscence and vaginal injury.
