Title: Giant subserosal myoma causing deep venous thrombosis in a patient with pre-existing May-Thurner syndrome.

Abstract: One of the rare sequelae of large pelvic masses is direct compression of the inferior vena cava with formation of a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Although uncommon, multiple cases of thrombosis secondary to pelvic mass compression of the venous system have been reported in the literature. However, our patient showed a disproportionate degree of thrombus and subsequent postthrombotic stricture/stenosis limited to the left iliofemoral system, sparing the right side. These findings make it exceedingly likely that she had some degree of pre-existing May-Thurner syndrome. The superimposed nature of these 2 rare causes of DVT make this presentation remarkably unique. Our case illustrates the advances in endovascular techniques and their application toward DVT treatment for even the most complicated and unique cases.
