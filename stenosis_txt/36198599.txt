Title: Hiatal Hernia with Prolapse of the Pancreas Causing Bile Duct Stricture and Liver Function Disorders: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Hiatal hernia is a common condition in elderly patients, but the additional presence of prolapse of the pancreas is extremely rare. We herein report an 89-year-old woman who presented with liver function disorders and abdominal pain. Her laboratory tests revealed cholestasis, and imaging examinations showed stenosis of the common bile duct pulled toward the hernia sac. She was diagnosed with a common bile duct stricture due to pancreatic herniation and underwent laparoscopic surgery. Our review of the literature identified three types of pancreatic herniations: asymptomatic, bile duct complication, and acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic head herniation tends to induce bile duct complications.
