Title: Operative V2 decompression for traumatic vertebrobasilar insufficiency: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Blunt vertebral artery injuries after cervical trauma due to the close anatomical relationship of the vertebral artery to the cervical spine may have fatal consequences because of posterior circulation ischemia and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. While the standard of care remains medical treatment by anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, surgical decompression of the vertebral artery is rarely indicated.
OBSERVATIONS: The authors present a case of selective decompression of a traumatically constricted vertebral artery within the transverse foramen of C2 presenting with vertebrobasilar insufficiency due to bilateral aplasia of the posterior communicating arteries and contralateral hypoplasia of the vertebral artery.
LESSONS: Because of their close relationship to the cervical spine, the vertebral arteries are at risk for blunt injury, which may present asymptomatically or with symptoms of posterior circulation ischemia or vertebrobasilar insufficiency either immediately or after a latency phase. The anatomical variability of (1) the vertebral arteries, (2) collateral brainstem perfusion, and (3) the individual injury pattern demands individualized treatment strategies. If endovascular treatment of hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the V2 segment of the vertebral artery poses too high a risk for vessel injury, decompression of the transverse foramen can be performed safely and without risk to the biomechanical stability of the cervical spine.
