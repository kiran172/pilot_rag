Title: Repair of tetralogy of Fallot associated with anomalous origin of right pulmonary artery and accessory left anterior descending coronary artery.

Abstract: We present an unusual combination of lesions in an 8-month-old child diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot, anomalous origin of right pulmonary artery, and anomalous coronary artery crossing the pulmonary annulus. The association of anomalous origin of branch pulmonary artery from aorta and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is extremely rare with an incidence of 0.4%. The incidence of anomalous coronary artery in TOF is 10.3%. However, a combination of all three lesions poses challenges to surgical repair and has not been previously reported.
