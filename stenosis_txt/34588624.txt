Title: Epidemiological profile of 338 traumatic spinal cord injury cases in Shandong province, China.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Hospital-based retrospective review.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) in Liaocheng, China.
SETTING: Liaocheng People's Hospital.
METHODS: Medical records of 338 persons with TSCI admitted to Liaocheng People's Hospital from 2013 to 2017 were reviewed. The detailed information included gender, age, marital status, occupation, time, etiology, level of injury, ASIA grade, spinal stenosis, concomitant injury, treatment, length of stay.
RESULTS: Over this period, the mean age (SD) of persons with TSCI was 50.1 (14.1) years, and the male/female ratio was 3.1:1. 96.4% of all were married. The leading cause was fall, followed by motor vehicle accident (MVA). The most common level of injury was the cervical cord. ASIA grade D and A injuries were the most common, accounting for 48.5 and 29.3% respectively. Among the concomitant injuries, spinal fractures were the most common. Within 24â€‰h, 91.1% of individuals with TSCI arrived hospital, 63.3% of all accepted surgery.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that fall and MVA were the two main causes, so we should focused on preventing fall and reducing MVA. Cervical spinal stenosis can increase the risk of TSCI, so education should be provided to this population to raise their risk awareness. In addition, timely treatment was critical for TSCI, but the data showed that rescue process was not standard, so it was necessary for medical staff to popularize professional knowledge.
