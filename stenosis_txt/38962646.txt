Title: Unusual Presentation of De Winter's Sign Due to Bezold-Jarisch Reflex in a Patient With Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: The de Winter electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern, marked by upsloping ST depression in leads V2-V6, ST elevation in lead aVR, and tall symmetric T waves, typically indicates left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion. Traditionally linked to LAD occlusion, it is rare in severe aortic stenosis and the Bezold-Jarisch reflex (BJR). We report an 83-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis who developed hypotension due to bleeding and exhibited the de Winter ECG pattern. This case highlights how severe aortic stenosis and BJR can lead to significant hemodynamic instability and ischemic ECG changes, resolving after hemodynamic stabilization.
