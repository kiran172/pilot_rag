Title: Management of supraglottic stenosis using interarytenoid Z-plasty: how I do it.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Supraglottoplasty is the primary surgical treatment of congenital laryngomalacia. Supraglottic stenosis is a rare complication of supraglottoplasty that is difficult to manage.
METHODS: This study presents a new endoscopic mucosa-sparing Z-plasty double transposition flap technique that was used to manage supraglottic stenosis following supraglottoplasty for severe congenital laryngomalacia in an eight-month-old infant.
RESULTS: At 10 months post-operatively, the patient remained asymptomatic and flexible laryngoscopy showed adequate supraglottic patency.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic interarytenoid Z-plasty is a safe and effective technique in the management of paediatric supraglottic stenosis.
