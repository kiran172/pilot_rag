Title: Can TAVR Be Effectively and Safely Performed Without Intraprocedural TEE?

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The TAVR procedure is a well-established therapy for patients with severe aortic stenosis at intermediate/high risk for surgery and a potential treatment for low-risk patients. It is much less invasive with short hospital stays and presents similar results compared with SAVR. Different "minimalist approach strategies" were proposed in order to obtain this performance. In these settings, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) became less relevant for the TAVR procedure. The present review provides an update regarding the safety of TAVR without intraprocedural TEE.
RECENT FINDINGS: Transthoracic echocardiography and fluoroscopy are the primary imaging tools during TAVR. Several studies proved that TAVR under local anesthesia without TEE is as safe as that performed under TEE guidance. However, not all patients have a proper window for TTE, and particular cases with complex anatomy can benefit from TEE support during the intervention. Intraprocedural TEE no longer plays a crucial role in the TAVR procedure, but in some instances, it remains of great help to detect and avoid complications.
