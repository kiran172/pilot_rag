Title: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy: Etiology-Based Therapeutic Options.

Abstract: Determining the etiologies of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be challenging due to the similarities of the different manifestations in clinical presentation and morphological features. Depending on the underlying cause, not only left ventricular mass but also left ventricular cavity size, or both, may increase. Patients with LVH remain asymptomatic for a few years, but disease progression will lead to the development of systolic or diastolic dysfunction and end-stage heart failure. As hypertrophied cardiac muscle disrupts normal conduction, LVH predisposes to arrhythmias. Distinguishing individuals with treatable causes of LVH is important for prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality. Athletic's heart with physiological LVH does not require treatment. Frequent causes of hypertrophy include etiologies due to pressure/volume overload, such as systemic hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative cardiac processes such as amyloidosis, Fabry disease, and sarcoidosis. Hypertension and aortic valve stenosis are the most common causes of LVH. Management of LVH involves lifestyle changes, medications, surgery, and implantable devices. In this review we systematically summarize treatments for the different patterns of cardiac hypertrophy and their impacts on outcomes while informing clinicians on advances in the treatment of LVH due to Fabry disease, cardiac amyloidosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
