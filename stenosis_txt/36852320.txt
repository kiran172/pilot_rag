Title: Percutaneous thrombectomy of upper extremity and thoracic central veins using Inari ClotTriever System: Experience in 14 patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In the present report, we have described the technical and clinical outcomes of percutaneous thrombectomy in the deep veins of the upper extremity and thorax using the ClotTriever system (Inari Medical, Irvine, CA).
METHODS: Fourteen patients with symptomatic deep venous occlusive disease in the upper extremity deep veins and thoracic central veins who had undergone thrombectomy using the ClotTriever system between October 2020 and January 2022 were reviewed. The technical results, adverse events, imaging follow-up data, and clinical outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients (seven men and seven women; mean age, 53.6 ± 13.3 years) constituted the study cohort. Of the 14 patients, 9 (64.3%) had had DVT due to intravascular invasion or external compression from known malignancy, 2 (14.3%) had had infected thrombi and/or vegetation due to Staphylococcus aureus refractory to intravenous antibiotic therapy, and 3 (21.4%) had had a benign etiology for thrombus formation. The presenting symptoms included upper extremity and/or facial swelling (n = 14), upper extremity pain (n = 6), fever (n = 2), and dyspnea (n = 1). Thrombectomy with the ClotTriever system was successfully completed in all 14 patients. Seven patients (50.0%) had required additional venous stent reconstruction after thrombectomy to address the underlying stenosis. No major adverse events were noted. All the patients had experienced resolution of the presenting symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: For the management of symptomatic deep venous occlusive disease of the upper extremity deep veins and thoracic central veins, thrombectomy using the ClotTriever system was feasible with excellent technical and clinical success.
