Title: Rheumatic valvular heart disease treated with traditional Chinese medicine: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is an autoimmune disease that leads to irreversible valve damage and heart failure. Surgery is an effective treatment; however, it is invasive and carries risks, restricting its broad application. Therefore, it is essential to find alternative nonsurgical treatments for RHD.
CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year-old woman was assessed with cardiac color Doppler ultrasound, left heart function tests, and tissue Doppler imaging evaluation at Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University. The results showed mild mitral valve stenosis with mild to moderate mitral and aortic regurgitation, confirming a diagnosis of rheumatic valve disease. After her symptoms became severe, with frequent ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia > 200 beats per minute, her physicians recommended surgery. During a 10-day preoperative waiting period, the patient asked to be treated with traditional Chinese medicine. After 1 week of this treatment, her symptoms improved significantly, including resolution of the ventricular tachycardia, and the surgery was postponed pending further follow-up. At 3 -month follow-up, color Doppler ultrasound showed mild mitral valve stenosis with mild mitral and aortic regurgitation. Therefore, it was determined that no surgical treatment was required.
CONCLUSION: Traditional Chinese medicine treatment effectively relieves symptoms of RHD, particularly mitral valve stenosis and mitral and aortic regurgitation.
