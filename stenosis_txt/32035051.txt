Title: Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery to Esophageal Fistula: A Rare Case and Its Management.

Abstract: A 29-year-old woman underwent esophageal stent placement after developing esophageal stenosis in the setting of tracheoesophageal fistula repair in childhood. The patient developed hemoptysis from an esophageal to aberrant right subclavian artery fistula; this was managed with several staged procedures involving arterial stent placement, carotid-to-subclavian bypass, and aberrant subclavian artery ligation. The patient then underwent pericardial patch repair of her perforated esophagus. This case illustrates the importance of understanding congenital anatomy and frequent associations, such as tracheoesophageal fistula and aberrant right subclavian artery; furthermore, it demonstrates the importance of multidisciplinary care for complex cases.
