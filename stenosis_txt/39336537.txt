Title: Preoperative Factors on Loss of Range of Motion after Posterior Cervical Foraminotomy.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) aims to resolve cervical radiculopathy while preserving range of motion (ROM). However, its effectiveness in maintaining ROM is uncertain. This study investigates the changes in ROM after PCF and identifies preoperative factors that influence ROM reduction post surgery. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients treated at our hospital from August 2016 to September 2021. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) for neck and arm pain and the neck disability index (NDI). Radiological outcomes included the segmental angle (SA), cervical angle (CA), C2-C7 SVA, Pfirrmann grade, extent of facetectomy, foraminal stenosis, and ROM. Patients were categorized into two groups based on segmental ROM changes: decreased (Group D) and maintained (Group M). Radiological and clinical outcomes were compared between the groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for ROM loss after PCF. Results: 76 patients were included: 34 in Group D and 42 in Group M, with no demographic differences. Preoperatively, Group D had significantly larger flexion segmental and cervical angles than Group M (segmental, p &lt; 0.001; cervical, p = 0.001). Group D also had a higher Pfirrmann grade (p = 0.014) and more bony bridge formations (p = 0.004). While no significant differences were observed in arm pain VAS and NDI scores, Group D exhibited worse neck pain VAS at the last follow-up (p = 0.03). Univariate linear regression indicated that preoperative segmental ROM (p &lt; 0.001, B = 0.82) and bony bridge formation (p = 0.046, B = 5.33) were significant predictors of ROM loss post PCF. Conclusions: Patients with higher preoperative flexion angles and Pfirrmann grades at the operative level are at an increased risk for ROM loss and neck pain and often exhibit bony bridge formation. Accounting for these factors can improve surgical planning and patient outcomes.
