Title: Two-Year Clinical Outcomes of Staged Transcatheter Mitral Edge-to-Edge Repair After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Residual significant mitral regurgitation (MR) can increase the risk of adverse events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The clinical benefits of staged transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) after TAVR remain underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of staged TEER for residual significant MR after TAVR. This observational study included 314 consecutive patients with chronic residual grade 3+ or 4+ MR at the 30-day follow-up after TAVR, with 104 patients (33.1%) treated with staged TEER (TEER group) and 210 (66.9%) with medical therapy alone. The primary composite outcomes were all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization at 2 years. Additional analysis, including changes in MR grade and the New York Association functional classification, and subgroup outcome comparisons based on MR etiology were also conducted. In our study, the rate of primary composite outcome was lower in the TEER group than in the medical therapy alone group (33.7% vs 48.1%, p = 0.015). Significant improvement in MR grade and New York Association class was observed in the TEER group after 2 years. The subgroup analysis demonstrated that in patients with degenerative MR, a lower incidence of composite outcome and heart failure hospitalization was observed in the TEER group (hazard ratio 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.53, p <0.001). In conclusion, staged TEER after TAVR was associated with reduced MR and improved clinical outcomes. The clinical significance of MR after TAVR should be carefully evaluated, and TEER should be considered for patients with significant residual MR, particularly, those with degenerative MR.
