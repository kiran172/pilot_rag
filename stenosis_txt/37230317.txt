Title: Placement of Bare Self-Expanding Metal Stent for Isolated Superior Mesenteric Artery Dissection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of placing bare self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) for treating isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection (ISMAD).
METHOD: Patients with ISMAD who received bare SEMS from January 2014 to December 2021 at the authors' center were included. Baseline characteristics, clinical manifestation, radiological findings, and treatment outcomes, including symptom relief and SMA remodeling, were analyzed.
RESULT: A total of 26 patients were included in this study. Among the patients, 25 were admitted due to persistent abdominal pain, and 1 was admitted based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) during physical examination. According to CTA scan, the percentage of stenosis was 91% (53.8-100%), and the length of dissection was 100.2 ± 8.4 mm. All patients received bare SEMS placement. The median time to symptom relief was 1 day (interquartile range, 1 3 days). The the median follow-up time of CTA was 6.8 months (range, 2-85 months), with an average of 16.2 months. Complete remodeling of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was recorded in 24 patients. The median time to remodeling was 3 months with an average of 4.7 months. Survival analysis indicated no significance difference in remodeling time between different ISMAD types based on Yun classification (P = 0.888) or between acute and nonacute disease (P = 0.423). Incomplete remodeling was noted in 2 patients. Distal stent occlusion without SMA-related symptoms was seen in 1 patient. Proximal stent stenosis occurred in 1 patient, and restenting was performed. The median follow-up time by telephone was 20.8 (4-91.5) months, and no intestinal ischemic symptoms were observed in any patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Bare SEMS placement can effectively relieve SMA-related symptoms in a short time and promote dissection remodeling in ISMAD. Time from symptom onset and classification of ISMAD seem not to have effects on SMA remodeling after bare SEMS placement.
