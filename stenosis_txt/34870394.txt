Title: Superior Mesenteric Artery Stenosis Due to Disseminated Tuberculosis in a Pediatric Patient.

Abstract: Disseminated tuberculosis (TB) associated with mesenteric arteritis has not been established in children. We present the case of an 8-year-old woman who presented with TB and superior mesenteric artery stenosis. Although rare, large vessel involvement from Takayasu arteritis can occur in TB. Evaluation for mesenteric vessel involvement should be considered in pediatric patients presenting with widely disseminated TB and abdominal pain.
