Title: Relationship between non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and coronary heart disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and degree of coronary artery stenosis proven by coronary angiography.
METHODS: A total of 1867 patients were enrolled into this study and analyzed retrospectively. Three hundred eighty-five non-coronary artery disease hospitalized patients were selected as control group, 1482 patients diagnosed as coronary artery disease were classified into three subgroups according to the tertiles of their SYNTAX score. We compared the level of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among the three subgroups. The Spearman correlation was used to analyze the correlation between non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and SYNTAX, logistic regression was used for analyzing independent predictors of coronary artery disease.
RESULTS: The level of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio was higher in coronary artery disease group compared with non-coronary artery disease group (P < 0.01). The Spearman correlation analysis showed that non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio were significantly correlated with SYNTAX score (r = 0.081, P < 0.001; r = 0.216, P < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio were independent predictors of coronary artery disease (odds ratio = 3.645, 95% confidence interval, 1.267-10.486; OR = 2.096, 95% confidence interval, 1.438-3.054).
CONCLUSION: Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I and monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio were associated with the severity of coronary artery lesions, which can be used as a biomarker for the evaluation of severity of coronary artery disease.
