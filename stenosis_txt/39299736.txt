Title: Recovery rate from conduction disorders in patients with permanent pacemaker implantation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUNDS: Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) is one of the greatest disadvantages of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). To seek the predictors and clinical impacts of PPMI and investigate the recovery rate from conduction disorders.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 745 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI for severe aortic stenosis from November 2013 to July 2022. The ventricular pacing (VP) rate was recorded at 1 and 6 months after PPMI and the recovery from conduction disorders was defined as the VP rate <1%.
RESULTS: Postoperative PPMI was performed in 7.1% (53/745) of patients. Balloon predilatation was significantly frequent in the PPMI (-) group (52.8% (28/53) vs 80.6% (558/692); p<0.001) and the oversizing ratio was significantly greater in the PPMI (+) group (11.8%±10.1% vs 9.1%±9.7%; p=0.035). Freedom from rehospitalisation due to heart failure rate was significantly higher in the PPMI (-) group (p=0.032). In patients with postoperative PPMI, recovery from conduction disorders was observed in 17.0% and 27.9% of patients at 1 and 6 months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from conduction disorders occurred frequently. Avoidance of oversizing and extension of observation time may reduce the need for PPMI after TAVI.
