Title: Orthobiologic Supplementation Improves Clinical Outcomes Following Lumbar Decompression Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic-assisted lumbar decompression is a minimally invasive spine surgery which has been touted to reduce collateral tissue damage, incisional pain, recovery time and complications. Residual back or leg pain and recurrent herniation are commonly reported post-operative outcomes. It has been suggested that injecting orthobiologics like cryopreserved amniotic-derived products (ADPs) and bone marrow aspiration (BMA) into the surgery site would have additional benefit on patient outcomes. This is a Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB)-approved level 1, randomized controlled trial of prospectively collected patient demographic and outcomes data for endoscopic-assisted lumbar decompression surgery. The primary goal of this study was to compare patient outcomes of orthobiologic supplementation during endoscopic-assisted lumbar decompression surgery.
METHODS: Following WIRB approval, 269 patients underwent lumbar endoscopic-assisted decompressive surgery between January 2011 and October 2017. Patients were randomized to receive ADP, BMA, both, or no supplementation (control group). Outcomes were measured by post-operative questionnaires (visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36)) over 12 months.
RESULTS: Mean VAS-leg for either BMA or ADP group displayed statistically significant improvements at 2 weeks (3.55 vs. 4.77, P = 0.002), 6 months (2.34 vs. 3.37, P = 0.026), and 9 months (2.18 vs. 3.57, P = 0.01) compared to no supplementation group (control group). Similarly, improvements in mean VAS-back were significant at 2 weeks (3.98 vs. 5.01, P = 0.011), 2 months (3.22 vs. 3.93, P = 0.04), 9 months (2.38 vs. 4.11, P = 0.004), and 12 months (2.23 vs. 3.58, P = 0.011) compared to no supplementation group (control group). There were statistically significant differences in the ODI (2 weeks, 42.19 vs. 31.11, P = 0.014) and SF-36 (4 months, 85 vs. 63, P = 0.043 for ADP only), but these differences did not subsist over time. Two patients (one control, one ADP) re-herniated at the same level.
CONCLUSIONS: Orthobiologic BMA and ADP resulted in improved pain control during early post-operative periods.
