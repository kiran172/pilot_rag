Title: Percutaneous Enteral Feeding in Patients With 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of percutaneous enteral feeding in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) and determine factors associated with the need for percutaneous enteral feeding tube placement.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
METHODS: The records of a 22q11.2 DS clinic and pediatric otolaryngology clinic at a tertiary pediatric hospital were reviewed from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. All patients with confirmed 22q11.2 deletion were identified. Cardiac, otolaryngological, and feeding characteristics were recorded along with surgical history. A patient was defined to have a G-tube if the history was significant for any percutaneous gastric feeding tube placement, including a gastrostomy tube, gastrostomyjejunostomy tube, or a Mickey button.
RESULTS: One hundred ninety patients with confirmed 22q11.2 DS by genetic testing were included. Thirty-three percent (n = 63) required G-tube placement. G-tube placement was associated with cardiac diagnosis (P &lt; .01), history of cardiac surgery (P &lt; .01), aspiration (P &lt; .01), nasopharyngeal reflux (P &lt; .01), subglottic stenosis (P &lt; .01), laryngeal web (P = .003), and tracheostomy (P &lt; .01). This suggests these conditions are associated with higher rates of G-tube placement in the 22q11.2 DS population.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 22q11.2 DS often require supplemental nutritional support in the form of G-tube feeding, most often in the first year of life. Congenital heart abnormalities and surgery along with tracheostomy, subglottic stenosis, laryngeal web, aspiration, and nasopharyngeal reflux are significantly associated with the need for G-tube placement. Understanding associations between comorbid conditions and G-tube placement, especially those involving the head and neck, may assist with counseling of patients with 22q11.2 DS.
