Title: 3D-Printed Coronary Implants Are Effective for Percutaneous Creation of Swine Models with Focal Coronary Stenosis.

Abstract: Reliable, closed-chest methods for creating large animal models of acute myocardial hypoperfusion are limited. We demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of using magnetic resonance (MR)-compatible 3D-printed coronary implants for establishing swine models of myocardial hypoperfusion. We designed, manufactured, and percutaneously deployed implants in 13 swine to selectively create focal coronary stenosis. To test the efficacy of the implants to cause hypoperfusion or ischemia in the perfused territory, we evaluated regional wall motion, myocardial perfusion, and infarction using MR imaging. The overall swine survival rate was 85% (11 of 13). The implant retrieval rate was 92% (12 of 13). Fluoroscopic angiography confirmed focal stenosis. Cine and perfusion MRI showed regional wall motion abnormalities and inducible ischemia, respectively. Late gadolinium enhancement and histopathology showed no myocardial infarction. Our minimally invasive technique has promising applications for validation of new diagnostic methods in cardiac MR. Graphical abstract Our new minimally invasive, percutaneous method for creating swine models of acute focal coronary stenosis can be used for magnetic resonance imaging studies of myocardial ischemia. Comparable to existing methods in its efficacy and reliability, this rapid prototyping technique will allow researchers to more easily conduct translational cardiac imaging studies of coronary artery disease in large animal models.
