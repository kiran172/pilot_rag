Title: Angiographic predictors of coronary hemodynamics.

Abstract: Aims: Assess the correlation between diameter stenosis, lesion length, location, diffuse coronary disease and with fractional flow reserve (FFR). Methods/Results: We performed quantitative coronary analysis analysis on 384 lesions with stable coronary artery disease undergoing FFR assessment. Vessels were 59.1% left anterior descending artery (LAD), 16.1% left circumflex artery and 14.8% right coronary artery. Median diameter stenosis was 58% ± 2.5 and median lesion length was 10 mm ± 7.36. 21% of vessels were diffusely diseased. Lesions were 33.6% proximal, 44% mid-vessel and 12% distal. Median FFR was 0.85. Diameter stenosis correlated with lower FFR (p &lt; 0.005, odds ratio [OR]: 2.4 [95% CI: 0.99-5.63]). There was no association between lesion length, location, number of proximal side branches and FFR. Vessels with diffuse disease had a nonsignificant trend for lower FFR (0.84 vs 0.85, p = 0.375, OR: 1.26 [95% CI: 0.76-2.09]). LAD lesions had significantly lower FFR compared with non-LAD (p &lt; 0.001, OR: 2.55 [95% CI: 1.61-4.04]); including left circumflex artery and right coronary artery lesions (p = 0.001, OR: 3.4 [95% CI: 1.7-6.9]) and p = 0.02, OR: 2.55 [95% CI: 1.17-4.34]). Conclusion: FFR is not related to lesion length, location or number of proximal branches.
