Title: Safety and performance of the Vienna self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve system: 6-month results of the VIVA first-in-human feasibility study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The novel Vienna TAVI system is repositionable and retrievable, already pre-mounted on the delivery system, eliminating the need for assembly and crimping of the device prior to valve implantation.
AIMS: The purpose of this first-in-human feasibility study was to determine the safety, feasibility, clinical and hemodynamic performance of the Vienna TAVI system at 6-month follow-up. (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04861805).
METHODS: This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, single-center, first-stage FIH feasibility study, which is followed by a second-stage pivotal, multicenter, multinational study in symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (SAS). The first-stage FIH study evaluated the safety and feasibility, clinical and hemodynamic performance of the device in 10 patients with SAS based on recommendations by the VARC-2.
RESULTS: All patients were alive at 3-month follow-up. 1 non-cardiovascular mortality was reported 5 months after implantation. There were no new cerebrovascular events, life-threatening bleeding or conduction disturbances observed at 6-month follow-up. The mean AV gradient significantly decreased from 48.7 ± 10.8 to 7.32 ± 2.0 mmHg and mean AVA increased from 0.75 ± 0.18 to 2.16 ± 0.42 cm2 (p &lt; 0.00001). There was no incidence of moderate or severe total AR observed. In the QoL questionnaires, the patients reported a significant improvement from the baseline 12-KCCQ mean score 58 ± 15 to 76 ± 20. NYHA functional class improved in two patients, remained unchanged in one patient. There was an increase in mean 6-min-walk distance from baseline 285 ± 97 to 347 ± 57 m.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that using Vienna TAVI system has favourable and sustained 6-month safety and performance outcomes in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.
