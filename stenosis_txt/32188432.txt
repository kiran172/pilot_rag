Title: Percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy for the treatment of lateral recess stenosis secondary occurred the discal fungus infection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This is a case of lateral recess stenosis secondary occurred the discal fungus infection treated with percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). There has been no relevant reports before.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old patient who had taken itraconazole for 13â€‰months for lateral recess stenosis secondary occurred the discal fungus infection complained of gradually worsening radiating pain and numbness in the back and inguinal and inner thigh region of right side. In order to relieve the radiating neuralgia and reduce the damage to spinal stability, the minimally invasive PTED was performed.The patient's prognosis was assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). During the follow-up, the patient's ODI and VAS scores were decreased significantly. The radiating pain in the inguinal and inner thigh region of right side were significantly alleviated and the discomfort caused by lower back instability was improved by plaster vest.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: PTED not only avoids further damage to the stability of the lumbar spine, but also effectively relieves the symptoms of leg neuroradialgia caused by lateral recess stenosis secondary occurred the discal fungus infection.
