Title: Anterior Right Thoracotomy for Rapid-Deployment Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement through anterior right thoracotomy (ART) has shown to be safe and feasible. However, acceptance within the surgical community is low. Rapid-deployment aortic valves may be a game changer due to simplified surgical technique and shorter operative times. Therefore, the combination of advanced surgical techniques like the ART access with rapid-deployment aortic valves was assessed in this study.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients undergoing ART with the Edwards Intuity Elite (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) valve system between 2011 and 2018. Patient data were collected prospectively in an ongoing, single-center registry. Data analysis regarding valve outcome was performed according to current guidelines.
RESULTS: In all, 165 patients underwent aortic valve replacement through ART access with the Edwards Intuity valve system (age 73 ± 9 years, 49% female, median European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score 1.6 [range, 0.6 to 10.6]). Median cardiopulmonary bypass time was 114 minutes (range, 61 to 310) and median aortic cross-clamp time was 80 minutes (range, 45 to 230). Thirty-day as well as inhospital mortality was 0.6% (n = 1). Postoperative neurologic events occurred in 3%, resulting in major neurologic deficit in 1 patient. Intermediate and long-term survival was 99%, 98%, and 93% after 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the Edwards Intuity valve system through ART is safe, feasible, and reproducible. The overall results of this single center experience are excellent compared with contemporary series of both surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacements.
