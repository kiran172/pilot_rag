Title: [Degenerative lumbar spine stenosis: minimally invasive microsurgical methods of treatment].

Abstract: Degenerative lumbar spine stenosis is one of the main causes of chronic pain and radiculopathy in advanced age people. Along with increase in average life expectancy, degenerative lumbar spine stenosis becomes the most common indication for spinal surgery. There is still no consensus regarding the most optimal surgical approach due to the variety of modern surgical methods. In recent years, minimally invasive spinal surgery has become a more advisable alternative to open surgery due to its advanced technical features combined with less soft tissue damage, lower risk of complications and shorter postoperative recovery.
