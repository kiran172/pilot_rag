Title: Applying the ABCs of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention to the 2023 AHA/ACC Multisociety Chronic Coronary Disease Guidelines.

Abstract: The 2023 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Multisociety Guideline for the Management of Patients with Chronic Coronary Disease provides updated recommendations for the management of chronic coronary disease. The term "chronic coronary disease" reflects the lifelong nature of the disease and diverse disease etiologies that come under the chronic coronary disease umbrella, beyond the presence of epicardial coronary stenosis, which require targeted lifestyle recommendations, serial optimization of medications, and involvement of multiple care team members. In this review, we highlight several areas where a collaborative approach between cardiologists, primary care clinicians, and internists is essential to optimize the care of patients with chronic coronary disease.
