Title: Pulmonary Vasculitis on Dual-Phase 18F-FDG PET/CT in SAPHO Syndrome.

Abstract: Pulmonary vasculitis is an uncommon type of vasculitis that may cause pulmonary artery stenosis with ensuing ischemic damage to lung tissue. 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin scintigraphy and iodine lung perfusion mapping are useful imaging modalities for assessment of lung perfusion but are not useful for assessing disease activity. On the other hand, 18F-FDG PET/CT is widely used for assessment of vasculitis activity but cannot provide perfusion information. We reported the clinical utility of dual-phase 18F-FDG PET/CT for pulmonary vasculitis in patients with SAPHO (synovitis-acne-pustulosis-hyperostosis-osteitis) syndrome.
