Title: Anastomosis selection in liver transplantation for recipients with unusable recipient hepatic arteries: a bayesian network meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The anastomosis of donor and recipient hepatic arteries is standard in liver transplantations. For transplant recipients with unusable hepatic arteries, appropriate artery selection should be conducted using evidence-based considerations; therefore, this network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to analyze the most suitable alternative recipient artery for anastomosis during liver transplantations.
METHODS: Comprehensive searches of the Scopus, Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE databases were conducted to analyze observational studies containing non-standard anastomoses in liver transplantations that used the splenic artery, aorta, celiac, or branches of the gastric artery. The outcome parameters included intraoperative components, complications, and survival data. This NMA used the BUGSnet package in R studio and the results were presented in a Forest plot, league table, and SUCRA plot.
RESULTS: Among the 13 studies included in this NMA, 5 arteries were used for the anastomoses. The splenic artery anastomosis showed a high risk of thrombosis and a low risk of stenosis (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.13-3.14) and biliary tract abnormalities (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.36-1.55). In addition, the graft survival (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.96-1.23) and overall survival (1-year survival OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94-1.26; 5-year survival OR 1.95% CI 0.83-1.22) showed favorable results using this artery. Constraints to the use of the splenic artery were longer operation and cold ischemic times. However, the duration of hospital stay (MD 1.36, 95% CI -7.47 to 10.8) was shorter than that when the other arteries were used, and the need for blood transfusions was minimal (MD -1.74, 95% CI -10.2 to 6.7).
CONCLUSION: In recipients with unusable hepatic arteries, the splenic artery of the patient should be the first consideration for anastomosis selection in liver transplantations.
