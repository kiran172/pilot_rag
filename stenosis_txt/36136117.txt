Title: Simulated slide tracheoplasty for congenital tracheal stenosis using three-dimensional printed models.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The slide tracheoplasty (STP) is the standard treatment for severe congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS). Understanding the features of the tracheal stenosis in each case and choosing an appropriate incision design are very important for successfully executing the procedure. The present study aimed to evaluate the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) printed models of the trachea for improving CTS.
METHODS: Three-D tracheal models were created using computed tomography (CT) data from ten patients undergoing STP for CTS. Simulated surgery was performed using the hollow models after reinforcing with them with a coating of gum spray. Clinical outcomes, including patient survival, postoperative surgical interventions, and time required for STP, were compared with the corresponding values in the last ten patients before the introduction of 3D model simulations.
RESULTS: All ten patients for whom simulated surgery using a 3D tracheal model were conducted achieved good airway patency after their STP. The surgeons reported feeling that the 3D model simulations were highly effective although there was no significant difference in the clinical outcomes of the groups with or without simulated STP. The models were useful not only for surgical planning but also for sharing important information among the multidisciplinary team and the patients' family.
CONCLUSION: Our experience using 3D tracheal models demonstrated several features enabling improvement in the surgical treatment of CTS.
