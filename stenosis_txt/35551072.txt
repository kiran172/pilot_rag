Title: Treatment of large and giant posterior communicating artery aneurysms with the Surpass streamline flow diverter: results from the SCENT trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Surpass flow diverter was developed to treat intracranial aneurysms not amenable to standard treatment. Indications for use allow placement in the internal carotid artery to the terminus, including the communicating artery segment.
METHODS: The Surpass Intracranial Aneurysm Embolization System Pivotal Trial to Treat Large or Giant Wide Neck Aneurysms (SCENT) trial is an international, multicenter, prospective, non-randomized trial comparing the outcomes of Surpass flow diverter treatment with historic control designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Surpass for the treatment of wide neck (≥4 mm) large or giant intracranial aneurysms ≥10 mm. The primary effectiveness endpoint is the percentage of subjects with 100% aneurysm occlusion without significant stenosis of the parent artery and without retreatment of the target aneurysm at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint is the percentage of subjects experiencing neurologic death or major ipsilateral stroke at 12 months. We report the effectiveness and safety of flow diversion in the subgroup of posterior communicating artery (PComA) aneurysms.
RESULTS: Of the 180 patients treated, 38 harbored a PComA aneurysm. Mean aneurysm size was 12.2 mm and mean neck width was 4.8 mm. The mean number of Surpass devices used was 1.1 per procedure, with 94.7% of aneurysms treated with one flow diverter. The 12 month primary effectiveness rate was 73.7% (28/38). At 36 months, 68.4% (26/38) of aneurysms remained completely occluded. The 12 month major ipsilateral stroke or neurological death rate was 10.5%. No patients with PComA occlusion after flow diverter placement (54.5%) had clinical sequelae.
CONCLUSIONS: SCENT demonstrated acceptable 12 month effectiveness of flow diversion in PComA aneurysms. Despite associated PComA occlusions in many cases, arterial occlusions were clinically silent.
