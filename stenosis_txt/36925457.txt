Title: Intestinal complications in Brazilian patients with ulcerative colitis treated with conventional therapy between 2011 and 2020.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This was an observational, descriptive, and retrospective study from 2011 to 2020 from the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Healthcare System database.
AIM: To describe the intestinal complications (IC) of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who started conventional therapies in Brazil´s public Healthcare system.
METHODS: Patients ≥ 18 years of age who had at least one claim related to UC 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) code and at least 2 claims for conventional therapies were included. IC was defined as at least one claim of: UC-related hospitalization, procedures code for rectum or intestinal surgeries, and/or associated disease defined by ICD-10 codes (malignant neoplasia of colon, stenosis, hemorrhage, ulcer and other rectum or anus disease, megacolon, functional diarrhea volvulus, intussusception and erythema nodosum). Descriptive statistics, annual incidence, and incidence rate (IR) [per 100 patient-years (PY)] over the available follow-up period were cal-culated.
RESULTS: In total, 41229 UC patients were included (median age, 48 years; 65% women) and the median (interquartile range) follow-up period was 3.3 (1.8-5.3) years. Conventional therapy used during follow-up period included: mesalazine (87%), sulfasalazine (15%), azathioprine (16%) or methotrexate (1%) with a median duration of 1.9 (0.8-4.0) years. Overall IR of IC was 3.2 cases per 100 PY. Among the IC claims, 54% were related to associated diseases, 20% to procedures and 26% to hospitalizations. The overall annual incidence of IC was 2.9%, 2.6% and 2.5% in the first, second and third year after the first claim for therapy (index date), respectively. Over the first 3 years, the annual IR of UC-related hospitalizations ranged from 0.8% to 1.1%; associated diseases from 0.9% to 1.2% - in which anus or rectum disease, and malignant neoplasia of colon were the most frequently reported; and procedure events from 0.6% to 0.7%, being intestinal resection and polyp removal the most frequent ones.
CONCLUSION: Study shows that UC patients under conventional therapy seem to present progression of disease developing some IC, which may have a negative impact on patients and the burden on the health system.
