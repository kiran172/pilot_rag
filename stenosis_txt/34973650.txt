Title: Global Rostral Midbrain Syndrome (GRMS) and Corpus callosum infarction in the context of shunt overdrainage.

Abstract: We report 3 cases of Global rostral midbrain syndrome (GRMS) and Corpus Callosum (CC) infarction, in the context of hydrocephalus followed by shunt dysfunction and slit ventricles. Prior shunt implantation had been indicated for adult-onset hydrocephalus secondary to aqueductal stenosis of varying causes. All three patients had been stable for months before developing repeated shunt dysfunctions, ultimately progressing to parkinsonism, Parinaud syndrome, akinetic mutism, pyramidal signs, cognitive impairment, CC infarction and slit ventricles, in the context of CSF overdrainage. Parkinsonism-related symptoms responded to dopa in all cases, but Parinaud syndrome and cognitive impairment persisted. Although GRMS has been described in the context of a transtentorial pressure gradient after shunt blockage, in these three cases with similar clinical presentation, reverse transtentorial pressure gradient and slit ventricles due to shunt overdrainage was the likely cause. The authors discuss the role of CC infarction and provide a detailed analysis after gathering previously described data, to unify information under a recognizable clinical entity and better understand the underlying pathophysiology, treatment options and outcome.
