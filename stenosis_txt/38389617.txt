Title: Non-syndromic Parachute Mitral Valve "When the Valve Dives in": Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: A parachute mitral valve (PMV) is a congenital mitral valve anomaly diagnosed in infancy, and it can also be discovered in adults during echocardiography. Surgical management is common in infants to prevent complications from left-heart obstructions. In adults, PMV may be found independently or with other cardiac defects. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for certain congenital heart anomalies before dental procedures. A study suggests reconsidering guidelines to include anomalies like bicuspid aortic valve and MVP for antibiotic prophylaxis. PMV, with transvalvular blood flow turbulence, may increase the risk of infective endocarditis, as seen in a reported case with a parachute-like mitral valve. Here, we present the case of a 62-year-old female incidentally found to have a PMV during an echocardiogram.
