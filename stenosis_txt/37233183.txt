Title: Advanced Cardiac Imaging in the Assessment of Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is the most common form of valve disease in the Western world and a major healthcare burden. Although echocardiography remains the central modality for the diagnosis and assessment of aortic stenosis, recently, advanced cardiac imaging with cardiovascular magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography have provided invaluable pathological insights that may guide the personalized management of the disease. In this review, we discuss applications of these novel non-invasive imaging modalities for establishing the diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and eventually planning the invasive treatment of aortic stenosis.
