Title: Neuroangiography: Review of Anatomy, Periprocedural Management, Technique, and Tips.

Abstract: Neuroangiography (NA) is a minimally invasive procedure used to diagnose patients with neurovascular diseases. Noninvasive imaging has improved dramatically in recent years and is utilized more frequently; however, further evaluation with NA is still required in certain cases. NA indications include intracranial (cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, dural arteriovenous fistula, cerebral vasculitis, cerebral vasospasm, ischemic stroke, nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, Moyamoya, vein of Galen malformation, intracranial tumors, and pseudotumor cerebri) and extracranial (internal and common carotid artery stenosis, vertebral artery stenosis, carotid artery blowout, vertebral artery blowout, epistaxis, oropharyngeal bleeding, and carotid body tumor) pathologies which can help with diagnosis and potential subsequent endovascular treatment. A thorough understanding of normal and variant cervical/cranial vascular anatomy is required. In addition, periprocedural management, catheter technique, equipment needed, and underlying disease pathology are paramount to successful and safe outcomes. This article will review basic neurovascular anatomy, periprocedural management, NA technique, and tips for safe and successful outcomes.
