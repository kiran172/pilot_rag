Title: Reoperations after sleeve gastrectomy: a dual academic institutional experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is the most common bariatric operation performed worldwide, patients can experience complications and poor outcomes that warrant reoperations. The incidence, indications, and outcomes of reoperations are not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To describe indications and outcomes for reoperations after LSG.
SETTING: Two academic, tertiary care hospitals.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort review of institutional Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program data from 2014-2018 and reviewed charts of all reoperations after LSG. We analyzed demographics, preoperative symptoms and work-up, and postoperative outcomes.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven reoperations after LSG represented 3.0% of 1965 bariatric cases performed. Most LSGs (56.1%) were performed outside our academic centers. Median time to reoperation and follow-up were 2.63 and 1.2 years, respectively. Conversion to gastric bypass was the most common reoperation (77.2%). More than half of the patients (52.6%) had multiple indications for reoperation. Reflux was the most common primary indication for reoperation (47.3%), followed by incisural strictures (20.1%), inadequate weight loss (17.5%), and leak/fistulae (12.2%). Reoperations were most successful when performed for reflux (92.5%) and oral intolerance from strictures (92%), whereas only 71.4% of leak/fistulas resolved. Surgery for inadequate weight loss resulted in total weight loss of 24.7 Â± 10.1%. Complications occurred in 36.2% of cases but varied by indication.
CONCLUSION: Symptoms and complications after LSG can persist, and patients may require reoperation. Reoperations can successfully treat the primary indications for reoperation and should be offered, but they have higher complication rates than initial operations.
