Title: Intravascular Ultrasound-Guided Stent Implantation in the Left Main Coronary Artery Extrinsic Compression by Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm Due to Eisenmenger Syndrome.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a profoundly destructive condition marked by the gradual narrowing and restructuring of small pulmonary arteries, leading to a rise in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), causing right-sided heart failure and, ultimately, mortality. During more advanced stages of this disease, patients may present with rare manifestations of pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) which are exertional chest pain, and hoarseness. The left main coronary artery compression (LMCA-Co) has been an increasingly recognized and possibly life-threatening entity in patients with severe PAH. The lack of well-established decision-making strategies for the management of both PAA and LMCA-Co has been remained as an unsolved issue in this setting. In this report, we present a case of percutaneous intervention of LMCA-Co with the guidance of intracoronary imaging in a patient with patent ductus arteriosus-Eisenmenger syndrome. Percutaneous intervention with intravascular guidance appears to be a safe and effective option for relieving symptoms and achieving positive clinical outcomes in patients with LMCA-Co.
