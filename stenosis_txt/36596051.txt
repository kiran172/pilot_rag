Title: Stent graft placement in anterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm in a patient with type I neurofibromatosis: A case report.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Vascular involvement manifests as aneurysms, stenosis, and arteriovenous malformations in patients with type I neurofibromatosis (NF-I). Aneurysms are rare; however, the renal artery is the most common site. Herein, we report a rare case of stent graft placement in an anterior tibial artery (ATA) pseudoaneurysm in a patient with NF-I.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old woman with NF-1 was admitted to the emergency room with painful swelling in the left lower leg. At presentation, the patient's blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and the hemoglobin level was 9â€‰g/dL.
DIAGNOSES: Computed tomography scan revealed a small aneurysm arising from the left ATA and an adjacent large hematoma.
INTERVENTION: Stent graft placement was performed to treat ATA pseudoaneurysm.
OUTCOMES: After stent graft placement, the aneurysm disappeared and the distal flow was patent through the ATA.
LESSONS: Stent graft placement should be considered as another option for endovascular treatment in patients in whom coil embolization or surgery cannot be performed.
