Title: A novel endovascular method of atherectomy for calcified common femoral and popliteal disease using the crosser system: Crossbow and Rambow techniques.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aims to report the efficacy and safety of new atherectomy methods using the Crosser system for calcified lesions in the common femoral and popliteal artery: the Crosser system supported by bended 0.014 wire (Crossbow) technique and retrograde approach of sheathless Crosser system supported by bended 0.014 wire (Rambow) technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This report describes a single-center, retrospective study. A total of 23 patients (mean ± SD age, 73 ± 10 years; 19 men) with symptomatic peripheral artery disease received the Crossbow technique and Rambow technique for treatment of calcified common femoral and popliteal disease; these patients were enrolled between October 2013 and October 2015. The primary efficacy outcome was acute technical success, defined as achievement of residual stenosis < 30% for stenting and < 50% for angioplasty or atherectomy. The primary safety outcome was assessed on the basis of angiographic complications.
RESULTS: The Crossbow and Rambow techniques were undertaken in 100% and 17% of the patients, respectively. Acute technical success was achieved in 96% of the patients. There were two embolic events.
CONCLUSION: Crossbow and Rambow techniques could be effective atherectomy methods of calcified common femoral and popliteal disease. Regarding safety, embolic protection devices may be needed for our atherectomy methods.
