Title: Outcomes of Arterial Switch Operation With Aortic Arch Reconstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study investigated the outcomes and factors associated with reintervention or development of significant pulmonary stenosis (PS) after repair of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) or Taussig-Bing anomaly (TBA) with aortic arch obstruction.
METHODS: A total of 51 patients with TGA or TBA who underwent an arterial switch operation and aortic arch reconstruction between 2004 and 2020 were included. The outcomes of interest were all-cause death, including heart transplantation, all-cause reintervention, right-sided reintervention, and development of significant PS.
RESULTS: The median age and body weight at repair were 9 days and 3.2 kg, respectively. Forty-nine patients (96.1%) underwent 1-stage repair. A total of 28 patients (54.9%) had TBA, and 8 patients (15.7%) had interrupted aortic arch. There were 5 early deaths (9.8%) and 2 late deaths during a median follow-up duration of 59 months. The transplant-free survival rate 10 years after repair was 82.6%. A total of 21 reinterventions were required in 10 patients. The significant PS-free survival rate 10 years after repair was 68.8%. In univariable analysis, a higher ratio of the diameter of the main pulmonary artery to the ascending aorta was associated with all-cause reintervention (P = .007) and right-sided reintervention (P = .002). A smaller aortic annulus z-score at the pulmonary position was associated with the development of significant PS (P = .049).
CONCLUSIONS: The rates of overall mortality and reintervention after repair were not negligible. A higher degree of size discrepancy between the 2 great arteries was associated with all-cause or right-sided reintervention. A smaller aortic annulus z-score at the pulmonary position was associated with the development of significant PS.
