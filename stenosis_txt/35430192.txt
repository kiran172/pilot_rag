Title: Significant Valvular Dysfunction and Outcomes in Cardiogenic Shock: Insights From the Randomized DOREMI Trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) suffer high rates of in-hospital mortality, with little evidence guiding management. The impact of valvular heart disease in patients with CS remains unclear. We therefore conducted a post hoc analysis of the randomized Dobutamine Compared to Milrinone (DOREMI) trial to determine the impact of valvular disease on outcomes in patients with CS.
METHODS: We defined significant valvular disease as moderate to severe or greater valvular stenosis or regurgitation and divided participants into a group of those with significant valvular disease and those without. Our primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included resuscitated cardiac arrest; cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support; nonfatal myocardial infarction; stroke; initiation of renal replacement therapy; as well as changes in renal function, perfusion, and hemodynamics over time.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine (98.4%) participants from the DOREMI trial were included in our analysis, and 74 (39.2%) had significant valvular dysfunction. Thirty-six (48.7%) patients with valvular disease died in hospital, compared with 37 (32.2%) in the comparator group (relative risk, 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.15; P = 0.02). Patients with aortic stenosis (2.42, 1.56-3.75; P < 0.01) and patients with mitral regurgitation (1.63, 1.1-2.43; P = 0.02) also had increased incidence of in-hospital mortality. There was no significant difference in any secondary outcomes among groups, apart from variances in mean arterial pressure observed in patients with valvular disease (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant valvular dysfunction is associated with increased in-hospital mortality in patients with CS. Randomized clinical trial data are needed to further elucidate the role of transcatheter valvular interventions as a therapeutic target in this population.
