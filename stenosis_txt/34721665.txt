Title: Patient-specific Computer Simulation: An Emerging Technology for Guiding the Transcatheter Treatment of Patients with Bicuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly being used to treat younger, lower-risk patients, many of whom have bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). As TAVI begins to enter these younger patient cohorts, it is critical that clinical outcomes from TAVI in BAV are matched to those achieved by surgery. Therefore, the identification of patients who, on an anatomical basis, may not be suitable for TAVI, would be desirable. Furthermore, clinical outcomes of TAVI in BAV might be improved through improved transcatheter heart valve sizing and positioning. One potential solution to these challenges is patient-specific computer simulation. This review presents the methodology and clinical evidence surrounding patient-specific computer simulation of TAVI in BAV.
