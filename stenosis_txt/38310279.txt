Title: Early efficacy observation of the unilateral biportal endoscopic technique in the treatment of multi-level lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To explore the early curative effect of unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) in the treatment of multi-level lumbar spinal stenosis with the help of multiple small incisions.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 26 patients with multi-level lumbar spinal stenosis treated by UBE in our hospital from August 1, 2021, to March 1, 2022. We collect patients' basic medical records and independently design surgical incisions. The visual analog score (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were compared before surgery, 7 days after surgery and 6 months after surgery. Spinal canal diameters on CT were compared before surgery and 7 days after surgery. The modified MacNab standard was used to evaluate the efficacy satisfaction at 6 months after operation.
RESULTS: In this study, 26 patients were operated according to the predetermined surgical plan. The operative time was 145 ± 40.11 min, the intraoperative blood loss was 156.25 ± 44.32 ml, and the postoperative hospital stay was 4.79 ± 1.31 days. The VAS scores of postoperative lumbago and leg pain were lower than those before surgery (P < 0.05). The postoperative ODI score was significantly different from that before surgery (P < 0.05). The postoperative CT sagittal diameter was significantly different from that before surgery (P < 0.05). The curative effect of modified MacNab was 76.92% when followed up 7 days after surgery. The curative effect of modified MacNab was 92.31% when followed up 6 months after surgery, which was significantly improved compared with 7 days after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Under multiple small incision channels, UBE can effectively treat multi-level lumbar spinal stenosis, significantly relieve the clinical symptoms of patients, and significantly improve the quality of life of patients. It is a safe and feasible minimally invasive surgical treatment method for multi-level lumbar spinal stenosis.
