Title: Use of Baclofen as a Treatment for Nocturnal Calf Cramps in Individuals With Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: A Prospective Randomized Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of baclofen and gabapentin in reducing leg pain from nocturnal calf cramps in lumbar spinal stenosis patients.
DESIGN: In a randomized clinical trial, the patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who commonly experienced nocturnal calf cramps were included. Patients were randomly assigned to either the baclofen or gabapentin group. Overall leg pain intensity, nocturnal calf cramp frequency and severity, sleep disturbances and functional disability were assessed at baseline and after 4 and 12 wks.
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients completed the 3-mo study. Both gabapentin and baclofen groups showed a significant reduction in overall leg pain, calf cramp frequency and intensity, and insomnia severity index scores from baseline to the endpoint. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptom reduction at different time points. The baclofen group also demonstrated a significant decrease in Oswestry Disability Index scores ( P < 0.001), while the gabapentin group did not ( P = 0.344). No adverse effects were reported in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Baclofen seems to be as effective and as safe as gabapentin in treating nocturnal calf cramps in lumbar spinal stenosis patients and even shows superiority in enhancing functional outcomes.
