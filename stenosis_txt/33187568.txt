Title: Coronary Artery Disease Screening Using CT Coronary Angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The increased utility of CT coronary angiography (CTCA) in cardiovascular screenings of aircrew has led to the increased detection of asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). A systematic review of studies relevant to the interpretation of CTCA for the occupational fitness assessment of high-risk vocations was performed, with findings used to describe the development of a pathway for the aeromedical disposition of military aviators with asymptomatic CAD.METHODS: Medline was searched using the terms CT coronary angiogram and screening and prognosis. The inclusion criteria were restricted to study populations ages &gt; 18 yr, were asymptomatic, were not known to have CAD, had undergone CTCA, and with their associations with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and other relevant cardiac outcomes reported.RESULTS: Included in this systematic review were 10 studies. When compared to subjects with no or nonobstructive CAD, those with obstructive CAD on CTCA had hazard ratios (HR) for cardiac events ranging from 1.42 to 105.48. Comparing subjects with nonobstructive CAD and those without CAD on CTCA, a lower HR of 1.19 for cardiac events was found. The annual event rates of subjects with no CAD on CTCA were extremely low, ranging from 0 to 0.5%.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, we suggest that CTCA should only be performed in aircrew with higher cardiac risk profiles. Those found to have no CAD or minimal CAD (i.e., 25% stenosis) in a non-left main coronary artery on CTCA can be returned to flying duties. All other results should be further evaluated with an invasive angiogram.Cheong RWL, See B, Tan BBC, Koh CH. Coronary artery disease screening using CT coronary angiography.
