Title: Arterial Preparation by Longitudinal Micro-Incisions Before Balloon Angioplasty of the Superficial Femoral and Popliteal Artery: Acute and 12-Month Results.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with conventional plain old balloon (POBA) and/or drug-coated balloon (DCB) is the primary intervention to treat peripheral artery stenoses. However, acute dissections during the procedure and potential for future target lesion revascularization remain procedural complications. The purpose of this study was to assess the acute and 12-month outcomes in patients who underwent novel vessel preparation with longitudinal, controlled-depth micro-incisions prior to PTA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with symptomatic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease with a Rutherford class of 2 to 6 and >70% de novo stenosis of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries were included in this retrospective study. Patients with thrombotic or embolic lesions, restenosis, or in-stent restenosis were excluded. The FLEX Vessel Prep System (FLEX VP) was used to prepare the vessel prior to PTA by creating micro-incisions at the target lesion. The FLEX VP was followed by POBA or paclitaxel DCB.
RESULTS: The study included 65 patients. Lesion characteristics were 90% median stenosis (range = 70%-100%), 75.4% mild-to-severe calcifications, and 33.8% occlusion rate, and median lesion length was 196 (range = 10-480) mm. Following vessel preparation, 82.1% of the patients had low severity dissection or no flow-limiting dissection. The provisional stent rate postprocedure was 16.9%, with a median stent length of 60 mm. The freedom from target lesion revascularization (FFTLR) in 63 evaluable patients at 6 and 12 months was 98.4% and 93.7%, respectively. Freedom from amputation was 100%.
CONCLUSION: In this real-world/all-comers patient population with long, stenotic lesions across the calcification spectrum, vessel preparation with longitudinal micro-incisions prior to PTA was associated with low dissection rate, low dissection severity, low stent implantation, and high FFTLR with the absence of amputation at 12 months relative to published reports in long-lesion cohorts. These results support vessel preparation via micro-incisions.
