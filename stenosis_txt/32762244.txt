Title: Proximal hyper-intense vessel sign on initial FLAIR MRI in hyper-acute middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke: a retrospective observational study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A hyper-intense vessel sign on fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (FHV) represents slow blood flow in the cerebral arteries.
PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between the proximal FHV (pFHV) on initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the status of the culprit vessel (stenosis, obstruction) in hyper-acute strokes affecting the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study participants consisted of 105 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute MCA infarction within 4.5 h of onset of symptoms. Patients underwent brain MRI within 45 min of arrival at the ED and angiography within 2 h of arrival. Culprit vessel status and presence of a pFHV on initial MRI were investigated retrospectively.
RESULTS: The pFHV was observed in 71/105 (67.6%) patients who presented with a hyper-acute MCA infarction. All patients with hyper-acute MCA infarction caused by internal carotid artery (90.6% caused by M1 occlusion, 92.9% caused by M2 occlusion) showed a pFHV on initial MRI. After logistic regression analysis, the presence of a pFHV showed significant positive correlation with large vessel occlusion (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 34.533, 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.781-121.926; P &lt; 0.001). A pFHV was not associated with severe large vessel stenosis.
CONCLUSION: A pFHV is independently representative of the acute occlusion of intervention-eligible proximal arteries within the territory of the MCA. If a patient with a hyper-acute MCA infarction shows a pFHV, aggressive flow augmentation strategies and early activation of intervention team should be warranted for best patient outcome.
