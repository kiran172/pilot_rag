Title: Incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation after valve replacement surgery : Cardiac structure and function at 1-year follow-up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to explore the incidence and risk factors of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) after valve replacement surgery (VR). The influence of long-term pacemaker dependency on cardiac structure and function at the 1‑year follow-up was also assessed.
METHODS: The demographic and surgical data of all consecutive patients who underwent VR between 2013 and 2016 were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables independently associated with PPI after VR. A 1‑year follow-up was undertaken of patients who underwent dual-chambers pacemaker after VR because of complete atrioventricular block (AVB). Long-term pacemaker dependency and recovery of cardiac structure and function were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were 5320 consecutive patients with VR. The incidence of postoperative PPI was 2.42%. Multivariate analysis indicated that among the 62 patients who underwent PPI due to AVB and sick sinus syndrome, isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR; OR: 2.24, p < 0.05), VR combined with ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair (OR: 6.78, p < 0.05), and VR with aortic root and arch surgery (OR: 4.14, p < 0.05) were independent predictors of PPI after surgery. In total, 89.6% (43/48) of the survivors showed pacemaker dependency. Of these 43 patients, 24 had enlarged left heart before VR. Compared with preoperative values, the left atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter post-PPI decreased significantly, while left ventricular ejection fraction was not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: Isolated AVR, VR concomitant with VSD repair, and VR with aortic root and arch surgery are independent predictors of PPI after VR. The majority of patients do not recover from AVB disorders and there is no significant negative effect on recovery of cardiac structure and function.
