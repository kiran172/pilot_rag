Title: Pediatric Renovascular Hypertension: A Pediatric Interventional Radiologist's Perspective.

Abstract: Renovascular hypertension (RVH) contributes close to one-fourth of the secondary etiologies of hypertension in children and a delay in diagnosis can result in adverse clinical outcomes. RVH in children is clinically silent with elevations in blood pressure measurements sometimes as its sole manifestation. Only a high index of suspicion by the clinician can prompt its detection. Despite the availability of other imaging modalities like ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography is still considered the gold standard to make a diagnosis of RVH. Angioplasty is considered the treatment of choice in appropriately selected patients. In this article, we shall focus on the various imaging findings, and management of RVH in children, which requires a multidisciplinary approach with a special focus on the role of interventional radiology.
