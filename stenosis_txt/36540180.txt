Title: 123I-BMIPP Scintigraphy Shows That CNT-01 (Tricaprin) Improves Myocardial Lipolysis in Patients with Idiopathic Triglyceride Deposit Cardiomyovasculopathy: First Randomized Controlled, Exploratory Trial for TGCV.

Abstract: Background: Triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy (TGCV) is a rare intractable cardiovascular disorder (Orphanet ORPHAcode: 565612) in which defective intracellular lipolysis results in heart failure and coronary artery disease. Myocardial scintigraphy with 123I-β-methyl-p-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) is useful to evaluate myocardial TG metabolism; its washout rate (WR) reflects myocardial lipolysis. This study reports the effects of CNT-01 (tricaprin), a developing orphan drug to facilitate lipolysis, on BMIPP-WR in patients with TGCV. Methods: An investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, double-blind exploratory, trial (Phase IIa) was conducted (UMIN000035403). Seventeen patients with idiopathic TGCV were orally administered 1.5 g/day of CNT-01 or placebo for 8 weeks. Endpoints included delta BMIPP-WR and clinical parameters such as 6-minwalk distance and TGCV severity score. Results: During the protocol, delta BMIPP-WRs were -0.26±3.28 and 7.08±3.28% (95% confidence intervals, -7.36 to 6.84 and -0.01 to 14.18) in the placebo and CNT-01 groups, respectively. The baseline-adjusted difference of delta BMIPP-WR between the two groups was significant (p=0.035) after one patient was excluded from the placebo group because of pseudonormalization of BMIPP-WR related to coronary bypass graft stenosis. Clinical parameters did not show significant changes. Conclusions: This study proved the mechanism of CNT-01 to improve myocardial lipolysis in TGCV, as demonstrated by BMIPP scintigraphy.
