Title: Sarcopenia and health-related quality of life in older adults after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle wasting, or sarcopenia, affects a significant proportion of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, its influence on post-TAVR recovery and 1-year health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) remains unknown. We examined the relationship between skeletal muscle index (SMI), post-TAVR length of hospital stay (LOS), and 1-year QOL.
METHODS: The study sample consisted of 300 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR from 2012 to 2018 who had pre-TAVR computed tomographic scans suitable for analysis of body composition. Skeletal muscle mass was quantified as cm2 of skeletal mass per m2 of body surface area from the cross-sectional computed tomographic image at the third lumbar vertebra. Sarcopenia was defined using established sex-specific cutoffs (women: SMI &lt; 39 cm2/m2; men: &lt; 55 cm2/m2). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between SMI, LOS, and HR-QOL using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Sarcopenia was present in most (59%) patients and associated with older age (82 vs 76 years; P &lt; .001) and lower body mass index (27 vs 33 kg/m2; P &lt; .001). There were no other differences in baseline clinical or echocardiographic characteristics among the 4 quartiles of SMI. SMI was positively correlated with LOS and 1-year QOL. After adjusting for age, gender, race, and body mass index, SMI remained a significant predictor of both LOS (P = .01) and 1-year QOL (P = .012). For every 10 cm2/m2 higher SMI, there was an 8-point increase in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, a difference that is clinically meaningful.
CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia is prevalent in TAVR patients. Higher SMI is associated with shorter LOS and better 1-year HR-QOL. To achieve optimal TAVR benefits, further study into how body composition influences post-TAVR recovery and durable improvement in QOL is warranted.
