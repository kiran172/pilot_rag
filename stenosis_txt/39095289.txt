Title: Peripheral intravascular lithotripsy to facilitate transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement - Defining optimal treatable peripheral arterial disease burden.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR) has proven superior to alternative access. However, some patients evaluated for TF-TAVR are unfit secondary to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Peripheral intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) can facilitate femoral access. This study aimed to characterize optimal lesions that can be treated with IVL.
METHODS: Single-center, retrospective analysis of an institutional database, queried from 1/2018 through 7/2023 for all patients who underwent TAVR. Patients who received IVL-facilitated transfemoral access were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 2862 TAVR cases identified, 92 (3.2 %) underwent lithotripsy. The IVL-facilitated cohort had a mean age of 78 ± 9.2 years and 45 % were female. The right common iliac artery was most treated (47). Most IVL was performed with 7-mm balloons (73.9 %). All cases were successful. 30-day mortality was 1.1 % (1/92).
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, complications after IVL-facilitated TF-TAVR were more common with small vessel diameter (≤4.7 mm), significant luminal loss (>50 % stenosis), and heavy calcium burden (arc calcification >180°). The findings support the use of IVL to expand the population of patients who can undergo TF-TAVR without the increased risks associated with the various forms of alternative access.
SUMMARY FOR ANNOTATED TABLE OF CONTENTS: IVL-facilitated TF-TAVR is safe and feasible. Despite its introduction to TAVR clinical practice in 2018, IVL-facilitated TF-TAVR is not regularly performed and could increase the population of patients eligible for TF-TAVR.
