Title: Acute isolated vertigo with vertical up-beating nystagmus: A rare case of nucleus intercalatus of Staderini ischemia.

Abstract: The role of intercalatus nucleus of Staderini (INS), the most caudal of the perihypoglossal nuclei, is much debated. Last research seems to suggest that this nucleus plays a role as a vertical eyes movements integrator. The few clinical reports present in the literature that describe isolated lesions of the INS have described patients presenting in acute with up-beating vertical spontaneous nystagmus. Isolated acute lesion of INS is, in fact, much rare, and, without other neurological signs, is exceptional. We present a case of acute isolated vertigo with no other neurological signs or symptoms, due to INS ischemia provoked by vertebral artery stenosis. The patient presented with spontaneous vertical up-beating nystagmus that showed at videonystagmographic recording, a clear exponential decay of angular slow-phase velocity, that is considered a typical sign of neural integrator impairment. This case seems to represent a further confirm that INS is part, as a vertical-to-position neural integrator, of the neural circuit controlling the vertical eyes movements.
