Title: Safety and Performance of a Cell-Impermeable Endoprosthesis for Hemodialysis Vascular Access Outflow Stenosis: A Brazilian Multicenter Retrospective Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and performance of Wrapsody™, a cell-impermeable endoprosthesis (CIE), for treating hemodialysis vascular access outflow stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Investigators retrospectively analyzed 113 hemodialysis patients treated with a CIE (11/2021-12/2022) across four centers in Brazil. De novo or restenotic lesions were treated. The primary efficacy outcome measure was target lesion primary patency (TLPP) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; the primary safety outcome measure was the absence of serious local or systemic adverse events within the first 30 days post-procedure. Secondary outcome measures included technical and procedural success, access circuit primary patency (ACPP), and secondary patency at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (34.5%) had thrombosed access at the initial presentation, and 38 patients (33.6%) presented with recurrent stenosis. TLPP rates at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 100%, 96.4%, 86.4%, and 69.7%, respectively. ACPP rates were 100% at 1 month, 89.2% at 3 months, 70.9% at 6 months, and 56.0% at 12 months. The target lesion secondary patency rates at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 100%, 97.3%, 93.6%, and 91.7%, respectively. In the adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis, male sex and endoprosthesis with diameters of 10, 12, 14, and 16 mm were associated with improved primary patency rates. No localized or systemic serious adverse event was observed through the first 30 days post-procedure.
CONCLUSION: The CIE evaluated in this study is safe and effective for treating peripheral and central outflow stenoses in hemodialysis vascular access.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2b, cohort study.
