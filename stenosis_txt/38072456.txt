Title: [Successful portal vein stent placement for chronic portal vein stenosis 5 years after pancreatoduodenectomy:a case report].

Abstract: A 73-year-old man underwent pancreatoduodenectomy 5 years previously, and portal vein stenosis was observed immediately after surgery. A collateral vein with varices around the hepaticojejunostomy gradually developed. The patient experienced repeated episodes of melena that required transfusion. Enteroscopy confirmed varices around the hepaticojejunostomy, caused by portal vein stenosis, which was the source of intestinal bleeding. Varices were treated by placing an expandable metallic stent in the stenotic portal vein through a percutaneous transhepatic route. Although the portal vein stenosis was severe, the guidewire was successfully maneuvered into the superior mesenteric vein and stent placement was successful. Subsequently, the collateral vein disappeared and no further melena was observed.
