Title: Cerebral ischemic injury after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with pure aortic regurgitation.

Abstract: Considering the surgical risk stratification for patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a reliable alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) (Fan et al., 2020, 2021; Lee et al., 2021). Despite the favorable clinical benefits of TAVR, stroke remains a dreaded perioperative complication (Auffret et al., 2016; Kapadia et al., 2016; Kleiman et al., 2016; Huded et al., 2019). Ischemic overt stroke, identified in 1.4% to 4.3% of patients in TAVR clinical practice, has been associated with prolonged disability and increased mortality (Auffret et al., 2016; Kapadia et al., 2016; Levi et al., 2022). The prevalence of hyperintensity cerebral ischemic lesions detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) was reported to be about 80%, which is associated with impaired neurocognitive function and vascular dementia (Vermeer et al., 2003; Barber et al., 2008; Kahlert et al., 2010).
