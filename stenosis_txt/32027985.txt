Title: Inferior Vena Cava Reconstruction in Symptomatic Patients Using Palmaz Stents: A Retrospective Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The use of stents for treating central venous occlusion is well described. Limited evidence exists related to Palmaz balloon-expandable stent use in inferior vena cava (IVC) reconstruction. We analyzed patency and complication rates after IVC reconstruction using Palmaz stents.
METHODS: From 2002 to 2019, 37 patients (mean age: 51 year) underwent IVC reconstruction with 68 Palmaz stents. Indications were symptomatic chronic venous obstruction in the infrarenal (n = 25) and intrahepatic (n = 12) IVC. Demographic, operative, and imaging data were evaluated. Clinical data, abdominal CT, and/or duplex ultrasound were used to determine patency at follow-up.
RESULTS: Restoration of caval patency was achieved in all patients, with complications in 2/37 (5.4%) patients (thrombus formation within the stent; stent embolization eight days after placement). Follow-up data were available for 27 patients. Primary patency was maintained through last follow-up in 19/27 (70%) patients (mean: 1.1 year), with successful stent redilation performed in 6 patients. Mean duration of primary-assisted patency (n = 5) was 1.2 year. Late lumen loss was (n = 13) was 40% during a mean time to follow-up of 2.0 years. Primary patency in patients with occlusion secondary to malignancy was 109 day (range: 1 day-1.0 year), whereas primary patency in patients with occlusion from other etiologies was 1.1 year (range: 2 day-5.9 year). The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated primary and primary-assisted patency of 66% and 84%, respectively, at 24 and 48 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Palmaz balloon-expandable stents for IVC reconstruction is feasible and effective for symptomatic IVC occlusion. Risk of stent migration was low.
