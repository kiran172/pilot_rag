Title: Iliac "paving & cracking" technique for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Challenging femoral/iliac access (CA) can lead to vascular complications which can hamper the clinical benefit of transfemoral (TF) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In this sense, iliac artery rupture is a severe complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report a case of TF-TAVI managed with the "paving and cracking technique" to overcome CA.
