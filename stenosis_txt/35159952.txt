Title: An Update on New Generation Transcatheter Aortic Valves and Delivery Systems.

Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the management of aortic valve disease has been changed by transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which has become the standard of care across the entire spectrum of surgical risk. As a result of continuous evolution of this technique, several next-generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs) have been developed to minimize procedural complications and improve patient outcomes. This review aims to provide an update on the new generation THVs and delivery systems.
