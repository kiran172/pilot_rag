Title: Subclavian Artery-Carotid Artery Bypass for Subclavian Artery or Common Carotid Artery Severe Stenosis or Occlusion.

Abstract: Various surgical treatments are available for occlusive subclavian and common carotid artery diseases. Nevertheless, to date, when cerebral endovascular treatment is utilized, revascularization via direct surgery may be required. This study reported five symptomatic cases of revascularization for CCA and SCA occlusive and stenotic lesions that were expected to be challenging to treat with endovascular treatment. We performed subclavian artery-common carotid artery or internal carotid artery bypass using artificial blood vessels or saphenous vein grafts in five patients with subclavian steal syndrome, symptomatic common carotid artery occlusion, and severe proximal common carotid artery stenosis. In this study, good bypass patency was achieved in all five cases. Although there were no intraoperative complications, one patient had a postoperative lymphatic leak. Moreover, there was no recurrence of stroke during postoperative follow-up for an average of 2 years. Conclusively, subclavian artery-common carotid artery bypass can be an effective surgical treatment for common carotid artery occlusion, proximal common carotid artery stenosis, and subclavian artery occlusion.
