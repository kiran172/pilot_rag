Title: Mid-aortic syndrome is associated with increased left ventricular mass index in Takayasu arteritis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mid-aortic syndrome (MAS) may induce changes in cardiac structure among patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA).
METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with TA (January 1, 2011 to January 1, 2018) were enrolled and their data was retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Patients were divided into MAS group (100/457 patients, 21.8%) and non-MAS group (357, 78.1%). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was higher in the MAS group than the non-MAS (113.78±26.82 versus 100.74±23.66 g/m2, respectively; P&lt;0.001). The MAS group showed higher prevalence than the non-MAS group of mild-to-severe mitral regurgitation (9.0% and 3.9%, respectively; P=0.040) and aortic regurgitation (26% and 14.8%, respectively; P=0.003). No difference was found in the rates of heart failure (27.0% and 19.9% for MAS and non-MAS, respectively; P=0.126). The MAS group also showed lower estimated glomerular filtration rates than the non-MAS group (89.93±18.89 versus 96.16±21.60 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively; P=0.009) and higher prevalence of renal artery stenosis (57% versus 43.7%; P=0.018). MAS was independently related to greater LVMI in both unadjusted model [β=12.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.09-18.11; P&lt;0.001] and the model adjusted for multiple indices (β=9.91; 95% CI: 4.57-15.25; P&lt;0.001) in multivariate linear analysis. The LVMI significantly decreased from 111.49±25.65 to 100.36±22.91 g/m2 (P&lt;0.001) among 55 patients who underwent successful revascularization treatment for MAS, while no significant difference (P=0.635) was observed among patients treated with medicine alone.
CONCLUSIONS: TA-induced MAS is a potential independent risk factor for increased LVMI, and revascularization therapy for MAS is effective in reversing structural changes in the heart.
