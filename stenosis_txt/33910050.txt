Title: Outcomes of Aortic Valve Replacement for Chronic Aortic Insufficiency: Analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluated outcomes and risk factors for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for aortic insufficiency (AI) in a national cohort. We analyzed the incidence, outcomes, and risk factors for SAVR for AI in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database.
METHODS: The national database was queried for patients with moderate or greater AI undergoing isolated SAVR between July 2011 and December 2018. Patients with moderate or greater aortic stenosis, acute dissection, active endocarditis, concomitant procedures, or emergent operation were excluded. AI was staged using guideline criteria based on symptoms and ventricular remodeling. Operative mortality and morbidity were compared between stages, and risk factors for operative death were identified.
RESULTS: A total of 12,564 patients underwent isolated SAVR for AI from 2011 to 2018. Patients were most frequently AI stage D (7019 [57.5%]), compared with B (1405 [11.2%]), C1 (1128 [9.0%]), or C2 (1325 [10.5%]). Operative mortality was 1.1% overall, and increased between stage C1, C2, and D (0.4% vs 0.7% vs 1.6%, respectively, P < .01), along with major morbidity (5.1% vs 7.5% vs 9.9%, respectively; P < .01). Mortality was higher in patients with severe ventricular dilation and an ejection fraction of less than 0.30 (2.7% vs 1.0%, P < .01). Risk factors for death were symptomatic AI, decreased ejection fraction, age, weight, body surface area, and dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Operative mortality and morbidity for isolated SAVR for AI is very low in a national cohort, providing a benchmark for future transcatheter approaches. Operative risk increases with advanced ventricular remodeling. SAVR before development of ventricular remodeling may be appropriate in patients with severe AI.
