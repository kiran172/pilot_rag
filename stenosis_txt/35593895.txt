Title: Successful biliary cannulation using the hybrid endoscopic ultrasound-guided rendezvous technique for bile duct stenosis after endoscopic papillectomy.

Abstract: Management of papillary stenosis after endoscopic papillectomy is technically challenging. Yamamoto et al. report a case of successful biliary cannulation for bile duct stenosis after endoscopic papillectomy using the "guidewire placed in the scope" technique, which is a hybrid procedure that combines the advantages of conventional endoscopic ultrasound-guided rendezvous techniques.
