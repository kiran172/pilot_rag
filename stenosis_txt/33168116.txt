Title: Mid-term outcomes of cor triatriatum repair: comparison of biventricular physiology and univentricular physiology.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cor triatriatum is the rarest of all congenital cardiac diseases, accounting for 0.1-0.4% of congenital heart diseases. Atrial septal defect is the most common associated defect; however, cor triatriatum is sometimes associated with univentricular heart.
METHODS: This single-centre retrospective study involved all patients who underwent the repair of cor triatriatum at Kobe Children's Hospital between 2000 and 2020. Twenty-four patients were required surgery. We conducted a survey of survival rate, early and late pulmonary vein stenosis in each group.
RESULTS: The survival rate of 5 years after cor triatriatum resection was 100% in the biventricular group and 82.1% in the univentricular group, respectively. The free rate for pulmonary stenosis of 5 years after surgery was 100% in the biventricular group and 90.0% in the univentricular group, respectively. There was no statistical difference in survival rate and 5 years free rate for pulmonary stenosis after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that surgical correction offers good early and mid-term outcomes for both cor triatriatum with biventricular and univentricular physiologies.
