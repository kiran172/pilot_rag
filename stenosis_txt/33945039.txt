Title: Sufficient cardiac unloading by Impella 5.0 in left ventricular rupture following mitral valve replacement: a case report.

Abstract: A 72-year-old woman presented with exertional dyspnea. Echocardiography revealed severe mitral valve stenosis; therefore, mitral valve replacement was performed using a bioprosthetic valve. However, left ventricular wall rupture occurred following mitral valve replacement. Under re-cardiac arrest, we found a left ventricular tear under the posterior annulus of the mitral valve. We repaired the left ventricular muscle using a bovine pericardial patch and implanted a bioprosthetic valve again. Postoperatively, we implanted an Impella 5.0 heart pump through the right axillary artery to ensure left ventricular wall unloading. Systemic blood flow depended almost completely on mechanical circulatory assistance until postoperative day 3. After the fourth postoperative day, we started weaning the patient from Impella 5.0. Finally, it was completely discontinued on the sixth postoperative day. After that, the patient's condition was stable, and she was discharged 44Â days postoperatively. Impella 5.0 is a potentially beneficial device for left ventricular unloading in patients with left ventricular wall rupture following mitral valve replacement.
