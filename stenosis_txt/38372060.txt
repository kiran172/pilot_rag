Title: Robotic-assisted endoluminal gastric leiomyoma resection: a novel surgical technique for benign gastroesophageal junction tumors.

Abstract: Gastric leiomyomas are rare, benign smooth muscle tumors that arise from the muscularis propria and can be found in any part of the stomach. The American College of Gastroenterologists recommends resection only for symptomatic leiomyomas, which can often present with bleeding, abdominal pain, or dyspepsia. Notably, symptomatic leiomyomas that arise at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction, especially those that are large, pose unique challenges. Specifically, total gastrectomy with esophagojejunostomy is often necessary, which can be associated with a compromised quality of life and possible complications such as anastomotic stricture or reflux esophagitis. In this context, we present the case of a young, male patient with a large symptomatic leiomyoma at the GE junction who was offered a robotic-assisted endoluminal leiomyoma resection. By placing endoluminal trocars and utilizing the Da VinciÂ® robot, we were able to carefully excise the tumor without perforating the stomach or causing GE junction stenosis. This allowed the patient to preserve his stomach and avoid a high-risk anastomosis. Another notable highlight of the case included the use of the endoscope as both a bougie and a source of insufflation. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and a rapid recovery, highlighting the feasibility of this approach for patients with benign GE junction tumors.
