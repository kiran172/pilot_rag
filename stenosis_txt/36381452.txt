Title: Exoskeleton-assisted Gait Training in Spinal Disease With Gait Disturbance.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Gait impairment reduces a patient's quality of life. Exoskeletons and wearable robotics enable patients with gait disturbance to stand up and walk. An exoskeleton was developed for use in patients with stroke and spinal cord injuries. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of overground exoskeleton-assisted gait training (OEGT) in spine diseases with gait disturbance.
METHODS: This was a single-group preliminary study. Five participants with gait disorders because of root dysfunction accompanying spinal stenosis were included in this study. All participants underwent surgical treatment and an exoskeleton training protocol scheduled for 2 or 3 days per week for 4 weeks. Each session was 60 minutes. Clinical tests were performed before (T1) and at the end of the training (T2).
RESULTS: One patient dropped out of the study because of medical issues that were not associated with the exoskeleton. Exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation was feasible for all participants. All participants showed positive changes in gait performance, balance, proximal muscle strength, psychological state, and satisfaction with the rehabilitation. However, there was no significant improvement in neurological deficits.
CONCLUSION: OEGT is a feasible rehabilitation method for patients with gait disorders caused by degenerative spinal disease.
