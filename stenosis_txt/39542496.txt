Title: Combined dilation of rheumatic mitral and tricuspid stenosis in a paediatric patient with quadrivalvular disease.

Abstract: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) affecting all four valves of the heart is extremely rare. We report quadrivalvular involvement in an early adolescent male patient. The patient presented with symptomatic severe mitral and tricuspid stenosis that underscores the rapid and fulminant nature of the disease and can still be seen in developing countries. This patient underwent a combined percutaneous balloon dilation of the mitral and tricuspid valves in a single intervention and is the youngest patient to have undergone this dual intervention in RHD.
