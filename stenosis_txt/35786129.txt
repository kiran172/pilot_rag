Title: Anastomotic Pseudoaneurysm in Kidney Transplant: A Challenging Management for a Rare Entity.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Anastomotic pseudoaneurysms of transplanted kidneys are a very rare complication encountered in less than 1% of cases. They may be devastating, leading to functional impairment, kidney transplantectomy, or death. Treatment has not been standardized, with open surgical repair considered the safest procedure even if it is often complicated by bleeding and graft loss. The purpose of this case report is to describe an endovascular treatment of this condition, consisting of the combination of coil embolization and arterial stenting.
CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old woman developed an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm 2 months after kidney transplantation, causing acute kidney injury related to ab-extrinsic stenosis of the transplant renal artery (TRA) and external iliac artery. The pseudoaneurysm was successfully treated by coil embolization, and the arterial patency was restored by the stenting of TRA and external iliac artery. The patient completely recovered kidney function, and after a 6-month-follow-up, creatinine values were stable with normal renal perfusion.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular repair through coil embolization and TRA stenting can be a safe and effective option to treat anastomotic pseudoaneurysm in kidney transplant.
