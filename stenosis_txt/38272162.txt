Title: Polystyrene nanoplastics induce vascular stenosis via regulation of the PIWI-interacting RNA expression profile.

Abstract: Nanoplastics (NPs) have become common worldwide and attracted increasing attention due to their serious toxic effects. Owing to their higher surface area and volume ratios and ability to easily enter tissues, NPs impose more serious toxic effects than microplastics. However, the effect of NP exposure on vascular stenosis remains unclear. To measure the effects of polystyrene NP (PS-NP) exposure on vascular toxicity, we conducted analyses of blood biochemical parameters, pathological histology, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics. Red fluorescent PS-NPs (100Â nm) were effectively uptake by mouse vascular arterial tissue. The uptake of PS-NPs resulted in vascular toxicity, including alterations in lipid metabolism and thickening of the arterial wall. Based on PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) sequencing, 1547 and 132 differentially expressed piRNAs (DEpiRNAs) were detected in the PS-NP treatment group after 180 and 30 days, including 787 and 86 upregulated and 760 and 46 downregulated compared with the control group, respectively. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses indicated that the target genes of DEpiRNAs were mostly involved in cell growth and cell motility-related signaling, such as the MAPK signaling pathway. This is the first study to highlight the alteration in piRNA levels in mouse vascular arterial tissue after PS-NP exposure. This study adds to the knowledge regarding the regulatory mechanism of pathological changes induced by PS-NP exposure.
