Title: Evaluation of Lacrimal Drainage Function in the Anophthalmic Socket by Dacryoscintigraphy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate whether impaired lacrimal pump function is a possible cause of discharge in patients wearing an artificial eye compared with the remaining healthy eye.
METHODS: Consecutive patients wearing unilateral ocular prosthesis for ≥6 months were included in this retrospective study. Excluded were any deformities of eyelids or nasal passage, socket complications such as entropion, ectropion, ptosis, infection, pyogenic granuloma, contracted socket, obstruction of nasolacrimal duct diagnosed with lacrimal irrigation and a difference greater than 2 mm in terms of protrusion between two eyes detected by Hertel exophthalmometry. Patients were asked to score the levels of tearing and mucopurulent discharge between 0 and 5 to assess lacrimal drainage function subjectively. Furthermore, dacryoscintigraphy was performed to assess the functional status of the lacrimal system objectively.
RESULTS: Included were 32 subjects (12 females, 20 males; aged 32.94 ± 17.62, range 13-78). Mean duration of prosthetic wearing 26.41 ± 21.30 (6-72) months. The mean subjective scores of tearing and mucopurulent discharge were 1.56 ± 1.67 and 1.94 ± 1.63, respectively. The rate of functional stenosis was significantly higher in the anophthalmic socket side as compared to the healthy side (P = 0.002). The rates of a presac, preduct, and intraduct obstruction was notes as n = 9, n = 10, n = 1 and n = 0, n = 6, n = 2 in the anophthalmic side and the companion eye, respectively (P = 0.021).
CONCLUSION: Compared to paired healthy eyes, the ocular prosthesis exhibited significantly higher rates of functional lacrimal duct obstruction, especially at the presac level. The alterations in orbital volume and tear film composition in addition to reduced corneal reflex blinking may lead to the failure of lacrimal pump function in artificial eyes.
