Title: The Relative Apical Sparing Strain Pattern in Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis: A Marker of Adverse Cardiac Remodeling.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The presence of a relative apical sparing (RAS) echocardiographic strain pattern raises a suspicion of underlying cardiac amyloidosis (CA). However, it is also increasingly observed in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, dynamics, and clinical characteristics of the RAS strain pattern in severe AS patients who had been referred for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).
METHODS: A total of 77 patients with severe AS and without CA were included with a mean age of 70 (62-73) years, 58% female, a mean aortic valve area index of 0.45 ± 0.1 cm2/m2, and a mean gradient of 54.9 (45-70) mmHg.
RESULTS: An RAS strain pattern was detected in 14 (18%) patients. RAS-positive patients had a significantly higher LV mass index (125 ± 28 g/m2 vs. 91 ± 32, p = 0.001), a lower LV ejection fraction (62 ± 12 vs. 68 ± 13, p = 0.040), and lower global longitudinal strain (-14.9 ± 3 vs. -18.7 ± 5%, p = 0.002). RAS strain pattern-positive patients also had higher B-type natriuretic peptide (409 (161-961) vs. 119 (66-245) pg/L, p = 0.032) and high-sensitivity troponin I (15 (13-29) vs. 9 (5-18) pg/L, p = 0.026) levels. Detection of an RAS strain pattern was strongly associated with increased LV mass index (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p &lt; 0.001). The RAS strain pattern had resolved in all patients by 3 months after SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the RAS strain pattern can be present in patients with severe AS without evidence of CA. The presence of an RAS strain pattern is associated with adverse LV remodeling, and it resolves after SAVR.
