Title: Early postoperative duplex ultrasound findings of the hepatic artery in postoperative vascular complications from paediatric liver transplantation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate duplex US findings of the HA in all three postoperative vascular (HA, PV, HV and IVC) complications of paediatric LT for early detection and some helpful secondary signs to determine these vascular complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data from 44 post-LT paediatric patients who underwent daily duplex US for seven consecutive days and three months after LT during January 2017-June 2020. Four duplex US parameters of the HA (extrahepatic PSV, intrahepatic PSV, RI and AT) were compared in patients with and without complications.
RESULTS: The PSV of the extrahepatic HA in patients with HA complications was higher than that in patients without complications (P value = 0.019). The PSV at 107.7 cm/s is the optimal cut-off parameter associated with HA complications [a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of 80.0% (ROC area is 0.84)]. The intrahepatic RI was higher on the first day than on the last day and gradually decreased in patients without vascular complications (P value = 0.000). The intrahepatic PSV significantly decreased with time when comparing the first and last days in patients without PV and HV-IVC complications (P value = 0.014 and 0.038). In contrast, patients with vascular complications showed no significant decrease.
CONCLUSION: The extrahepatic PSV relates to HA complications after paediatric LT but not PV and HV-IVC complications. Non-significantly decreased intrahepatic RI and PSV from the first day to the day of complication diagnosis may correlate with the occurrence of vascular complications.
