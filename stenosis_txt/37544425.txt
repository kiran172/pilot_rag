Title: The Subglottic Stenosis 6 Questionnaire: A Novel Quality-of-Life Survey Validated to Predict Need for Intervention in Patients With Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is a recurrent, chronic disease defined by fibroinflammatory narrowing of the subglottic airway. A key challenge in treatment is monitoring disease progression, which may be debilitating and unpredictable in its timing.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Can the Subglottic Stenosis 6 (SGS-6) questionnaire be validated as a novel quality-of-life (QOL) instrument to monitor breathing, disease progression, and disease severity proactively in patients with iSGS?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Panel data from 51 patients with iSGS were collected from January 2012 through June 2022, representing 1,684 patient encounters including routine office visits and treatment encounters. Subjective QOL scores (including the novel SGS-6 and established RAND-36 and EuroQol Five Dimensions [EQ-5D] Visual Analog Scale) and objective pulmonary function test (PFT) results were collected at each visit. Subjective SGS-6 QOL scores were repeated within 1 week of initial reporting. Panel regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between SGS-6 scores, PFT results, and a patient's need for intervention. Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for SGS-6 and peak expiratory flow percentage (PEF%) were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and a patient's need for intervention as the external anchor.
RESULTS: Each one-point increase in SGS-6 score (of a maximum of 27) was associated with a 3.26% decrease in PEF%, a 1.93-point decrease in RAND-36 Physical Health composite score, a 1.27-point decrease in RAND-36 Mental Health composite score, and a 0.88-point decrease in EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale score. The intracorrelation coefficient for the SGS-6 composite score is 0.838 (95% CI, 0.770-0.888). Compared with patient baselines, SGS-6 scores were 4.66 points greater at the time of intervention with an MCID of 2.25 from a patient's baseline. The area under the ROC curve for SGS-6 and a patient's intervention point was 0.81.
INTERPRETATION: iSGS disease severity can be modeled using the SGS-6 questionnaire, offering physicians and patients a potentially new method of tracking disease progression and need for intervention remotely.
