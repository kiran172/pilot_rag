Title: Removal of a Tracheal Mesh Stent: How I Do It.

Abstract: We illustrate how to remove a stent from the tracheal lumen 12 years after its deployment. Maintaining the stent in situ for a long time degrades the stent materials, making it fragile and very difficult to manipulate. A rigid bronchoscopy approach was chosen for the treatment of this case. We describe the preparation of the intervention and its execution step by step.
