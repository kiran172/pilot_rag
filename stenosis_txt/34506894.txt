Title: Arteriovenous fistula formation with adjuvant endovascular maturation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of the native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) has been limited by the prolonged time required for maturation, the low overall maturation rate, and subsequent abandonment. Endovascular intervention has been increasingly accepted as the first-line therapy for AVF stenosis. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the AVF formation outcomes when early endovascular intervention was selectively performed to bring about timely AVF maturation.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study (February 2014 to February 2020) of 82 AVF consecutive patients (mean age, 62.5 ± 13.5 years; range, 17-83; 58 men [70.7%]) with end-stage renal failure who had undergone vascular access construction at a single institution. The 4-year AVF patency, vascular diameters, hemodialysis parameters, reintervention rate, and mortality were analyzed.
RESULTS: Radiocephalic AVF was the most common fistula constructed (71 patients; 88.6%). The evaluation at a mean of 46.2 ± 56.0 days (range, 5-343 days) after AVF formation revealed 33 immature AVFs (40.2%). Subsequently, 19 patients had undergone endovascular procedures, including angioplasty and/or stenting of the juxta-anastomosis, cannulation zones, and/or outflow segments to bring about timely maturation of the AVF. Hence, 93.9% of the AVFs had reached functional patency (maturation) by 6 months after formation, with a mean time to maturation of 67.8 ± 65.9 days (range, 5-320 days). After reaching maturation, the primary access functional patency was 82% ± 4.3% at 6 months, 58% ± 5.5% at 12 months, and 34% ± 6.8% at 48 months. The primary assisted access functional patency was 95% ± 2.4% at 6 months, 90% ± 3.3% at 12 months, and 83% ± 4.7% at 48 months. A total of 121 endovascular interventions were performed to maintain patency, equating to an endovascular reintervention rate of 0.37 procedure/patient year. The mean arterial, venous, and brachial flow rates did not change significantly after maturation with a mean AVF (primary assisted functional patency) survival time of 5.9 ± 0.26 years (range, 5.33-6.36 years) from maturation. Only 12 thromboses had occurred after the first follow-up review after AVF formation. These were all salvaged using endovascular techniques, leading to 100% total secondary functional patency at 4 years. The 5-year estimated all-cause mortality was 45.6% ± 12.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: The AVF maturation rate and interval to maturation were improved when early endovascular intervention was selectively performed after AVF formation. This allowed for near universal maturation. In addition, once matured, the use of ongoing endovascular reinterventions allowed for a low reintervention rate and long-term patency, providing reliable long-term renal vascular access.
