Title: Thoracolaparoscopic radical resection of esophagogastric junction cancers with a NOSE-like approach to extract large specimens.

Abstract: To investigate the efficacy and safety of combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic radical resection of esophagogastric junction cancers using a natural orifice specimen extraction-like approach for extraction of large surgical specimens. Patients who had esophagogastric junction cancers treated with thoracolaparoscopic resection using the natural orifice specimen extraction-like approach for specimen extraction were retrospectively enrolled. A 5-cm transverse incision on the abdominal wall at the middle of the superior pubic symphysis was made for surgical specimen extraction. The clinical, surgical, complications, and follow-up data were analyzed. A total of 162 patients were enrolled, and the surgery was successful in all patients (100%). The total surgical duration ranged 165 to 270 minutes, with blood loss 20 to 150â€‰mL, hospital stay 8 to 22 days, first flatus time 2 to 7 days, extubation time of drainage tubes 1 to 26 days, first oral feeding time 5 to 10 days, number of lymph nodes resected 15 to 39, postoperative ambulation time 1 to 2 days, and postoperative residual rate of cancerous cells at the surgical margins 0. Postoperative complications occurred in 14 (8.6%), including anastomotic leakage in 4 (2.5%), anastomotic stenosis in 3 (1.9%), hydrothorax in 4 (2.5%), and incision infection in 3 (1.9%). At follow-up (mean 12 months), all patients were alive, and the transverse incision was a linear scar concealed in the suprapubic pubic hair area. The combined laparoscopic and thoracoscopic surgery for radical resection of carcinomas at the esophagogastric junction is safe and effective, and a transverse incision at the suprapubic symphysis for specimen extraction results in improved minimal invasiveness and cosmesis.
