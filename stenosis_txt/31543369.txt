Title: Cecal distension on non-tumoral left colonic obstacle: Management strategy in two cases.

Abstract: Diastatic damage of the caecum is only described in left colon neoplastic obstructions. However, diverticular sigmoid stenosis can likely cause cecal diastatic distention. In emergency, ileo-cecal resection removing the area of diastatic damage or externalizing the cecal perforation can be an interesting alternative to subtotal colectomy. The left colonic stenosis is treated later so the colon can be spared with better long-term functional outcome than after subtotal colectomy.
