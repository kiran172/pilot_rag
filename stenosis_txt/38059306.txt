Title: European Society of Cardiology guidelines and 1 year outcomes of acute heart failure treatment in Central Asia and Europe.

Abstract: AIMS: Outcomes reported for patients with hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF) treatment vary worldwide. Ethnicity-associated characteristics may explain this observation. This observational study compares characteristics and 1-year outcomes of Kyrgyz and Swiss AHF patients against the background of European Society of Cardiology guidelines-based cardiovascular care established in both countries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The primary endpoint was 1 year all-cause mortality (ACM); the secondary endpoint was 1 year ACM or HF-related rehospitalization. A total of 538 Kyrgyz and 537 Swiss AHF patients were included. Kyrgyz patients were younger (64.0 vs. 83.0 years, P < 0.001); ischaemic or rheumatic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were more prevalent (always P < 0.001). In Swiss patients, smoking, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and atrial flutter/fibrillation were more frequent (always P ≤ 0.035); moreover, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was higher (47% vs. 36%; P < 0.001), and >mild aortic stenosis was more prevalent (P < 0.001). Other valvular pathologies were more prevalent in Kyrgyz patients (P < 0.001). At discharge, more Swiss patients were on vasodilatory treatment (P < 0.006), while mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (P = 0.001), beta-blockers (P = 0.001), or loop diuretics (P < 0.001) were less often prescribed. In Kyrgyz patients, unadjusted odds for the primary and secondary endpoints were lower [odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.90, P = 0.008; OR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.91, P = 0.006, respectively]. After adjustment for age and LVEF, no difference remained (primary endpoint: OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.71-1.49, P = 0.894; secondary endpoint: OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.60-1.12, P = 0.206).
CONCLUSIONS: On the background of identical guidelines, age- and LVEF-adjusted outcomes were not different between Central Asian and Western European AHF patients despite of large ethnical disparity.
