Title: Assessment of Retinal Capillary Dropout after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation by Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative to open heart surgery in the treatment of symptomatic aortic valve stenosis, which is often the treatment of choice in elderly and frail patients. It carries a risk of embolic complications in the whole cerebral vascular bed, which includes the retinal vasculature. The main objective was the evaluation of retinal emboli visible on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) following TAVI. This is a prospective, single center, observational study enrolling consecutive patients over two years. Patients were assessed pre- and post-TAVI. Twenty-eight patients were included in the final analysis, 82.1% were male, median age was 79.5 (range 52-88), median BCVA was 82.5 letters (range 75-93). Eight patients (28.6%) presented new capillary dropout lesions in their post-TAVI OCTA scans. There was no statistically significant change in BCVA. Quantitative analysis of macular or peripapillary OCTA parameters did not show any statistically significant difference in pre- and post-intervention. In conclusion, capillary dropout lesions could frequently be found in patients after TAVI. Quantitative measurements of macular and peripapillary flow remained stable, possibly indicating effective ocular blood flow regulation within the range of left ventricular ejection fraction in our cohort.
