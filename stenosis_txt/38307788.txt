Title: Optimizing throughput of babies with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Definitive surgical care is often delayed in hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). Our aim is to evaluate the effect modifiable factors in preoperative HPS management have on efficiency of care.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing pyloromyotomy for HPS at two US children's hospitals between 2008 and 2018 was performed.
RESULTS: 406 patients were included in the study. The majority (310, 76 ​%) were adequately resuscitated and ready for surgery upon diagnosis in the ER. However, only 133 patients (43 ​%) had surgery on the day of admission. Patients diagnosed between 12pm and 6pm were more likely to have surgery the next day than those diagnosed before noon (67 ​% vs 33 ​%, p ​< ​.001), which correlated with a longer length of stay (32 vs 47 ​h, p ​< ​.001).
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients presenting with HPS can safely undergo same day surgery. Delaying surgery due to an afternoon diagnosis is common, and leads to a modifiable increased total length of stay.
