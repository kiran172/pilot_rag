Title: Aortic Valve Neocuspidization in a Pulmonary Autograft.

Abstract: Management of aortic valve (AV) disease in the pediatric population is challenged by a lack of attractive valve replacement options. The Ross procedure has been prominent for these patients; however, long-term reports have revealed concerns, namely neoaortic root dilation and regurgitation. More recently, AV neocuspidization has emerged as an alternative to the Ross operation or other valve replacement procedures in pediatric patients with congenital AV disease. We report a successful case of AV neocuspidization of a previously implanted pulmonary autograft.
