Title: Subclavian Vein Stenosis Imitating Inflammatory Breast Cancer.

Abstract: Unilateral breast erythema, edema, and peau d'orange are classically associated with inflammatory breast cancer. However, occasionally this constellation of symptoms is seen with other causes. Maintaining a broad differential can therefore save a prospective patient from months of worry about a possible cancer diagnosis, untreated symptoms, and unnecessary and expensive tests. Here we present the case of a 75-year-old woman with a history of pacemaker placement complicated by left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who subsequently developed left breast peau d'orange, swelling, and erythema. After initially being worked up for inflammatory breast cancer, including multiple breast biopsies, she was then referred to specialists in cardiology, allergy, pulmonology, rheumatology, dermatology, lymphedema therapy, and vascular surgery undergoing an exhaustive workup that spanned nearly a year. Eventually, a venogram was performed, which revealed complete occlusion of her left subclavian vein. After undergoing angioplasty and stenting, her symptoms resolved.
