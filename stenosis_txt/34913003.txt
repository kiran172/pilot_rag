Title: Asia Pacific TAVI registry (an APSIC initiative): initial report of early outcomes: Asia Pacific TAVI registry.

Abstract: AIMS: The aim of the study was to report the clinical experience, 30-day mortality and acute outcomes of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the Asia Pacific region.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Asia Pacific TAVI registry is an international, multicentre, prospective, observational registry managed under the auspices of the Asian Pacific Society of Interventional Cardiology (APSIC). Patients undergoing TAVI in seven centres from Hong Kong, Japan, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan, treated with TAVI devices for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, were assessed. This first review presents the acute results and 30-day mortality. A multivariable analysis was also performed to identify independent predictors of early all-cause mortality. The enrolment was from 2009 to 2017 and a total of 1,125 patients were recruited. The 30-day mortality rate was 2.5%. Baseline logistic EuroSCORE more than 16 was independently associated with a 2.8-times increased risk of 30-day all-cause mortality (p=0.016). Post-procedural stroke (HR 4.9, p=0.008) was also associated with increased mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: This initial report of the Asia Pacific TAVI registry demonstrated good acute success and low 30-day mortality. The preprocedural logistic EuroSCORE and post-procedural stroke incidence were strongly associated with acute mortality. Further attempts to reduce post-procedural stroke should be explored.
