Title: Strategies for Preventing Esophageal Stenosis After Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection and Progress in Stem Cell-Based Therapies.

Abstract: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been widely used in the early neoplasia of the esophagus. However, postoperative esophageal stenosis is a big problem, particularly when a large circumferential proportion of esophageal mucosa is resected. Currently, there are several methods available to prevent esophageal stenosis after ESD, including steroid administration, esophageal stent implantation, and endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD). However, the therapeutic effects of these are not yet satisfactory. Stem cell-based therapies has shown promising potential in reconstructing tissue structure and restoring tissue function. In this study, we discussed the current strategies for preventing esophageal stenosis after ESD and perspectives of stem cell-based therapies for the prevention of esophageal stenosis.
