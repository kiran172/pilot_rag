Title: Association between trajectories in cardiac damage and clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is little evidence of evolution in cardiac damage after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in aortic stenosis (AS) patients. Less is known about the prognostic value and potential utility of different cardiac damage trajectories following TAVR.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the cardiac damage trajectories following TAVR and explore their association with subsequent clinical outcomes.
METHODS: AS patients undergoing TAVR were enrolled and classified into five cardiac damage stages (0-4) based on the echocardiographic staging classification retrospectively. They were further grouped into early stage (stage 0-2) and advanced stage (stage 3-4). The cardiac damage trajectories in TAVR recipients were evaluated according to their trend between baseline and 30 days after TAVR.
RESULTS: A total of 644 TAVR recipients were enrolled, with four distinct trajectories identified. Compared to patients with early-early trajectory, patients with early-advanced trajectory were at 30-fold risk of all-cause death (HR 30.99, 95% CI 13.80-69.56; p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, early-advanced trajectory was associated with higher 2-year all-cause death (HR 24.08, 95% CI 9.07-63.90; p < 0.001), cardiac death (HR 19.34, 95% CI 3.06-122.34; p < 0.05), and cardiac rehospitalization (HR 4.19, 95% CI 1.49-11.76; p < 0.05) after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provided insight into four cardiac damage trajectories in TAVR recipients and confirmed the prognostic value of distinct trajectories. Early-advanced trajectory was associated with poor clinical prognosis following TAVR.
