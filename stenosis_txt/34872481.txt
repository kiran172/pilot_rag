Title: Whole-Brain Volume CT Angiography can Effectively Detect Early Ischemic Cerebrovascular Diseases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of whole-brain volume computed tomography (CT) perfusion in assessing early ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two patients with early ischemic cerebrovascular diseases who had undergone routine CT scan and 320-row volume CT whole-brain perfusion imaging within 8 h after admission were retrospectively enrolled in this one-center case-sectional study. The perfusion parameters of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP), and dynamic CT angiogram (4D-CTA) were obtained and analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 72 patients, 29 cases with 37 cerebral ischemic lesions were found in plain CT scan, whereas 51 cases with 76 lesions were found in whole-brain CT perfusion, with 30.6% more patients being detected. The CBF value was significantly lower in the abnormal than normal corresponding perfusion area in the healthy hemisphere (P<0.05), while the MTT and TTP values were significantly higher in the abnormal than the normal corresponding area (P<0.05). 4D-CTA image suggested that 59 cases had different degrees of stenosis or occlusion, including 11 mild, 18 moderate, 21 severe, and 9 occlusive cases. Four-D-CTA imaging could detect significantly (P<0.05) more patients with abnormal perfusion in severe cerebral vascular stenosis or occlusion than those with no, mild or moderate stenosis (93.33% vs. 16.67%) (P<0.05). The stenosis of intracranial and carotid arteries was positively correlated with MTT and TTP values (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Whole-brain volume CT angiography can comprehensively display early cerebral ischemic lesions, cerebral blood perfusion status, and cerebral vascular stenosis, providing valuable information for early detection of ischemic cerebral diseases and appropriate treatment planning.
