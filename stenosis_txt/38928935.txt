Title: Atrial Fibrillation and Other Cardiovascular Factors and the Risk of Dementia: An Italian Case-Control Study.

Abstract: Dementia is a major neurologic syndrome characterized by severe cognitive decline, and it has a detrimental impact on overall physical health, leading to conditions such as frailty, changes in gait, and fall risk. Depending on whether symptoms occur before or after the age of 65, it can be classified as early-onset (EOD) or late-onset (LOD) dementia. The present study is aimed at investigating the role of cardiovascular factors on EOD and LOD risk in an Italian population. Using a case-control study design, EOD and LOD cases were recruited at the Modena Cognitive Neurology Centers in 2016-2019. Controls were recruited among caregivers of all the dementia cases. Information about their demographics, lifestyles, and medical history were collected through a tailored questionnaire. We used the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to estimate the EOD and LOD risk associated with the investigated factors after adjusting for potential confounders. Of the final 146 participants, 58 were diagnosed with EOD, 34 with LOD, and 54 were controls. According to their medical history, atrial fibrillation was associated with increased disease risk (ORs 1.90; 95% CI 0.32-11.28, and 3.64; 95% CI 0.32-41.39 for EOD and LOD, respectively). Dyslipidemia and diabetes showed a positive association with EOD, while the association was negative for LOD. We could not evaluate the association between myocardial infarction and EOD, while increased risk was observed for LOD. No clear association emerged for carotid artery stenosis or valvular heart disease. In this study, despite the limited number of exposed subjects and the high imprecision of the estimates, we found positive associations between cardiovascular disease, particularly dyslipidemia, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, and EOD.
