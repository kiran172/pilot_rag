Title: Hypogastric Artery Stenting for Chronic Intermittent Spinal Cord Ischemia After Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report a case of chronic intermittent spinal cord ischemia (SCI) after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and its successful treatment using hypogastric artery stenting.
CASE REPORT: A 79-year-old patient presented in May 2013 with a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and a contained rupture. He urgently underwent TEVAR that covered 274 mm of descending thoracic aorta without immediate postoperative signs of acute SCI. At 3-month follow-up, he reported repeating incidents of sudden lower extremity weakness leading to a fall with a humerus fracture. A neurological consultation revealed the tentative diagnosis of intermittent SCI caused by TEVAR and initially recommended a conservative approach. During the following year there was no clinical improvement of the symptoms. Computed tomography angiography showed a high-grade stenosis of the right hypogastric artery, which was stented in November 2014 to improve the collateral network of spinal cord perfusion. Following treatment, the patient had no further neurological symptoms; at 32 months after the reintervention, the imaging follow-up documented a patent stent and continued exclusion of the TAA.
CONCLUSION: Intermittent neurological symptoms after TEVAR should be suspected as chronic intermittent SCI. The improvement of collateral networks of the spinal cord by revascularization of the hypogastric artery is a viable treatment option.
