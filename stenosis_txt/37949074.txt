Title: [Laboratory diagnostics of lipid metabolism disorders].

Abstract: Clinically, disorders of lipid metabolism often remain without symptoms. Typical skin lesions, however, can be indicative. Secondary hyperlipoproteinemias (HLP) are more common than primary hyperlipoproteinemias; they can (partially) be improved by treating the underlying disease. Basic diagnostics consist of the determination of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. To exclude secondary HLP, glucose, HbA<sub>1C</sub>, TSH, transaminases, creatinine, urea, protein and protein in the urine are useful. Since virtually all routine methods for LDL-C are biased by high triglycerides, lipoprotein electrophoresis is indicated for triglycerides above 400 mg/dl (4.7 mmol/l). Primary HLPs have known or yet unknown genetic causes. Primary hyperlipidemias should be taken into consideration especially in young patients with an LDL cholesterol concentration are above 190 mg/dl (4.9 mmol/l) and/or triglycerides above 400 mg/dl (10 mmol/l) and secondary HLP (obesity, alcohol, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease) is excluded. The basic diagnostics is meaningfully extended by the measurement of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)). It is indicated in moderate and high risk of vascular disease, progression of atherosclerosis in "well-controlled" LDL cholesterol, familial clustering of atherosclerosis or high Lp(a), evidence for elevated Lp(a) coming from lipoprotein electrophoresis, aortic stenosis and in patients in whom statins have a poor effect. Genetic diagnostics needs to be considered if primary HLP is suspected. It is most frequently conducted for suspected familial hypercholesterolemia and has already been recommended in guidelines.
