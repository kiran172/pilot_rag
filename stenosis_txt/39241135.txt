Title: Ultrasonographic changes of carotid vessels in patients in the early recovery period of atherothrombotic stroke.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Aim: To study the state of extracranial carotid vessels in patients with atherothrombotic stroke in the early recovery period (ASERP) according to duplex scanning data.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and Methods: 130 patients in ASERP, were studied. 69 men and 61 women. aged (60.42}7.4) years. Duplex scanning of the vessels of the neck was performed on a Siemens Acuson X 300 device with a linear multi-frequency sensor of 4-10 MHz. The classification of stenozoocclusive lesions of vessels was carried out according to the classification of B.V. Gaidar. Atherosclerotic plaques (AP) are divided into 5 types according to the Nicolaides and Gerulaka classification.
RESULTS: Results: Atherosclerotic stenoses were found in all patients of ASERP: ( 90%),- in 3.4%. AP type 1 was found in 15% of cases; 2 types - in 33.8%; 3 types - in 26%; type 4 accounted for 12.3% and type 5 accounted for 12.3% of cases. APwhich causing moderate stenosis had a high degree of embologenicity due to the hypoechogenicity and heterogeneity of atherosclerotic plaques of types I, II and III. When the level of stenosis increased, tendency to increase the density and hyperechogenicity of the AP was noted.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: 89% patients with ASERP had non-critical, hemodynamically insignificant stenoses of the carotid arteries. Types II and III AP, mostly of an eccentric structure, dominated. Moderate stenoses were more often caused by echo-negative atherosclerotic layers, which is a source of increased embologenicity, and stenoses of a greater degree, for the most part, were echo-positive.
