Title: The impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on mitral regurgitation - a single center study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The coexistence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) has been associated with worse outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Herein, the aim was to assess the etiology and degree of MR in an unselected TAVI population and investigate the impact of MR reduction at mid-term follow-up.
METHODS: Patients subjected to TAVI as a treatment for severe AS in a single center were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint was the MR reduction after TAVI. The secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization at a 3-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing TAVI (n = 283) in the years 2017-2019 were screened for the presence of hemodynamically significant MR. Sixty-nine subjects (24.4%) with severe (16, 23.2%) and moderate (53, 76.8%) MR were included. The primary MR was predominant (39 subjects, 56.5%). The median age of the patients was 82 years. MR improved in 25 patients (36.2%, p < 0.001). Baseline severe MR was more prone to reduce (8 subjects, 50%) than moderate (17 subjects, 32.1%, p = 0.04). The primary MR improved in 14 patients (35.9%), while secondary in 11 patients (36.7%, p = 1). Patients showing MR reduction had lower mortality (8 vs. 29.55%, p = 0.047) and were less frequently hospitalized (20 vs. 45.45%, p = 0.03) at 3-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamically significant MR improves after TAVI regardless of its etiology. Moreover, MR reduction after TAVI is associated with better clinical outcomes.
