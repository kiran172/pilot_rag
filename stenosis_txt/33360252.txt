Title: Current Advances in Endovascular Treatment of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease and Future Prospective.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: Medical therapy is the first line of treatment for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) are mainly considered for those patients with severe stenosis and recurrent events despite aggressive medical therapy. In this review, we discuss the application of PTAS as a treatment option for ICAD and its future prospect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We did the literature review of the key articles and guidelines to elaborate on the role of PTAS in the management of ICAD based on the current data and expert opinion. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus up to August 2020, and included articles published only in the English language.
RESULTS: Since the publication of the results from SAMMPRIS and VISSIT trials, stenting is no longer recommended for secondary stroke prevention in patients with symptomatic ICAD. However, recent clinical studies on intracranial stenting for a subgroup of ICAD patients have shown promising results, likely due to better patient selection and continued advancement of endovascular techniques.
CONCLUSION: There exists a lack of consensus regarding the best endovascular treatment approach (e.g., angioplasty alone or balloon mounted stent vs. self-expanding stent with or without prior angioplasty) or management of in-stent restenosis. Another area of clinical controversy relates to the ideal use and duration of antiplatelet therapy.
