Title: Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valves Optimize Transvalvular Hemodynamics Independent of Intra- Versus Supra-Annular Design.

Abstract: This study sought to characterize transvalvular hemodynamics during the first 30 days after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) across various transcatheter heart valves (THVs), while adjusting for annular dimensions. This was an observational study of TAVIs from September 2021 to October 2022. The primary outcome was mean transvalvular pressure gradient (TVPG), measured using transthoracic echocardiography at day 0, day 1, and day 30 post-TAVI, and were compared across 3 THV, including the self-expandable intra-annular Portico (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) valve, the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 Ultra (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California), and the self-expandable supra-annular Evolut Pro+ (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). A total of 560 patients who underwent TAVI were identified, of which 106 (18.9%) received a Portico THV, 176 (31.4%) received a SAPIEN THV, and 278 (49.6%) received an Evolut THV. For Portico THV, the TVPG on day 0 increased from 6.0 (4.7 to 9.0) to 7.0 (6.0 to 10.0) by day 30 (p = 0.009). For SAPIEN THV, the TVPG on day 0 increased from 6.5 (5.0 to 8.0) to 12.0 (9.0 to 15.0) by day 30 (p <0.001). For Evolut THV, the TVPG on day 0 increased from 6.0 (5.0 to 9.0) to 7.2 (5.0 to 10.0) by day 30 (p = 0.001). Adjusting for time and annular diameter in a multivariable mixed effects model, the SAPIEN group had a significantly greater increase in TVPG over time than the Evolut reference group (p <0.001), while there was no difference in the change of TVPG over time for the Portico group vs. the Evolut group (p = 0.874). In conclusion, compared with balloon-expandable valves, self-expanding THV may optimize transvalvular hemodynamics across all annular diameters, independent of their supra-annular and intra-annular design.
