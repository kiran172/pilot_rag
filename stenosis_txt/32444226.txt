Title: Assessing the Breadth of Laryngology Training in Otolaryngology Residency Programs.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Laryngology is an expanding field with incorporation in resident training nationwide. However, the breadth of training in laryngology reported by residents has not been previously evaluated. This project assesses the variability in laryngology training among otolaryngology residents.
METHODS: A cross sectional, multi-institutional study was performed with an anonymous survey sent to residents and laryngology fellows nationally to assess different laryngology training practices.
RESULTS: There were 151 responses to the survey with 9.6% response rate. 49 (32.9%) did not have a designated laryngology rotation. 134 (89.3%) had a fellowship-trained laryngologist as part of their institution. The greatest percentage of respondents intended to pursue general ENT (31; 20.7%). PGY5 responses were analyzed for total residency exposure showing, 66.7% of PGY5s received training to identify different types of dysphonic voices through auditory findings alone. 61.9% could interpret a videoflouroscopic swallow study.Â  Regarding surgical cases, 52.4% had been involved in open cricopharyngeal myotomies, 76.2% in endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomies, and 100% in subglottic stenosis cases. Residents pursuing a career in laryngology and those with a designated laryngology rotation had more exposure to laryngeal surgeries and office-based procedures than their peers.
CONCLUSION: Laryngology training and exposure varies across the country. Residents are more familiar with airway than voice and swallowing related pathology. Residents with a designated laryngology rotation and those pursing laryngology fellowships were more likely to have exposure to laryngeal surgery and office-based procedures. Programs with a laryngologist likely had higher response rates so the true laryngology exposure may be more limited than our data suggests.
