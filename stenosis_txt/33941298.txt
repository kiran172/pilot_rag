Title: Abnormal drainage pathway of a supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage in a neonate: a case report.

Abstract: Supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage is commonly associated with a left-sided ascending vein draining into innominate vein. We present a case of a newborn with a right-sided ascending vein, draining into the right superior caval vein with stenosis at the SVC-ascending vein junction, posing a surgical dilemma in corrective surgery. Usage of three-dimensional computed tomographic scan was essential in delineating the anatomy and aiding surgery. The case demonstrates the rarity of this type of cardiac disease and the complications that develop.
