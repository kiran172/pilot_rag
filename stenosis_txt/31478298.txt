Title: Treatment of focal distal abdominal aortic stenosis with the GORE VIABAHN VBX balloon expandable covered stent.

Abstract: The incidence of focal infrarenal stenosis of the aorta is rare. Endovascular therapy has evolved as a first-line treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease and has been shown to substantially improve health-related quality of life. The 8 French sheath compatible, GORE VIABAHN VBX (GORE Flagstaff, AZ) balloon expandable covered stent offers the traditional benefits of a balloon expandable covered stent with a design that improves on flexibility. We report three cases with the use of this system for treatment of infrarenal stenosis of the aorta.
