Title: Managing acute cardiac valvular emergencies in the emergency department.

Abstract: Valvular heart disease is becoming more prevalent as the United States' population ages, with aortic and mitral valves most commonly affected. Complications, including syncope, heart failure, dyspnea, and chest pain, can arise from slow progression of stenosis and regurgitation, though acute regurgitation from an ischemic or traumatic event can be life-threatening. Patients with valvular disease may present with cardiogenic shock, and vasoactive agent treatment will depend on determination of the valvular etiology. This issue reviews aortic and mitral valvular disease as potential causes of a patient's emergency department presentation, including history, diagnostic testing, and physical examination findings that can help guide treatment.
