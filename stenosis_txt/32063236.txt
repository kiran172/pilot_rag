Title: Early and late outcomes of surgical repair of double-chambered right ventricle: a single-centre experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Double-chambered right ventricle is characterised by division of the outlet portion of the right ventricle by hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculations into two parts. We aim to report our experiences regarding the presenting symptoms of double-chambered right ventricle, long-term prognosis, including the recurrence rate and incidence of arrhythmias after surgery.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 89 consecutive patients who were diagnosed to have double-chambered right ventricle and underwent a surgical intervention from 1995 to 2016. The data obtained by echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation, and surgical findings as well as post-operative follow-up, surgical approaches, post-operative morbidity, mortality, and cardiac events were evaluated.
RESULTS: Median age at the time of diagnosis was 2 months and mean age at the time of operation was 5.3 years. Concomitant cardiac anomalies were as follows: perimembranous ventricular septal defect (78 patients), atrial septal defect (9 patients), discrete subaortic membrane (32 patients), right aortic arch (3 patients), aortic valve prolapse and/or mild aortic regurgitation (14 patients), and left superior caval vein (2 patients). The mean follow-up period was 4.86 Â± 4.6 years. In these patients, mean systolic pressure gradient in the right ventricle by echocardiography before, immediately, and long-term after surgical intervention was 66.3, 11.8, and 10.4 mmHg, respectively. There were no deaths during the long-term follow-up period. Surgical reinterventions were performed for residual ventricular septal defect (2), residual pulmonary stenosis (1), and severe tricuspid insufficiency (1).
CONCLUSION: The surgical outcomes and prognosis of double-chambered right ventricle are favourable, recurrence and fatal arrhythmias are unlikely in long-term follow-up.
