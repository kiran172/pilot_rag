Title: [Simultaneous surgery for papillary thyroid cancer with lymph node metastases combined with common carotid artery stenosis].

Abstract: The authors report simultaneous surgical treatment of papillary cancer of the left thyroid lobe with lymph nodes metastases and left common carotid artery stenosis over 70%. Carotid endarterectomy at the first stage made it possible to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke, restore adequate blood flow through the carotid arteries and simultaneously perform total resection for thyroid carcinoma.
