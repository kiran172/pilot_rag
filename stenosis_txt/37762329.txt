Title: The Importance of Aortic Valve Bicuspid Phenotype in Valvular Evolution in Pediatric Patients: A Case Report and Literature Mini-Review.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most commonly encountered congenital malformation in the pediatric population, associated with aortic leaflet degeneration and aortopathy. However, studies on BAV and its complications in children are limited. We present the case of a 16-year-old with type 1B BAV with a raphe with fusion between the right and non-coronary cusps who exhibited severe aortic stenosis, regurgitation, and progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta. Surgical intervention, including aortic valve and aortic root replacement, was performed due to the patient's deteriorating condition. Histopathological examination revealed degenerative changes and calcifications in the aortic valve and mucoid fibrosis in the ascending aorta. The results are consistent with BAV patients being predisposed to aortic stenosis and regurgitation due to increased mechanical stress and hemodynamic abnormalities. Although more common in adults and a rare complication in pediatric patients, calcification was previously observed concurrently with rapid valve degeneration in our daily practice. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying BAV-related complications and refine treatment strategies for pediatric patients.
