Title: Transcatheter treatment of complex pulmonic and aortic valvular disease following failed Ross procedure.

Abstract: A 63-year-old man with congenital bicuspid aortic valve disease and complex surgical history (that includes a Ross procedure complicated by cardiac arrest requiring emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery, multiple subsequent sternotomies to treat a failed pulmonic homograft and pseudoaneurysm repair of the left and right ventricular outflow tracts (LVOT/RVOT), bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, and aortic valve endocarditis) presented with worsening heart failure symptoms secondary to bioprosthetic aortic valve failure and recurrent pulmonic valve stenosis successfully treated with transcatheter intervention.
