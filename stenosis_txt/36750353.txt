Title: Predictors of mitral valve haemodynamics after mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative predictors of functional mitral valve (MV) stenosis after surgical repair of mitral regurgitation (MR) caused by prolapse remain poorly characterised. This study evaluated the effect of annuloplasty size on postoperative MV haemodynamics during exercise and evaluated predictors of MV hemodynamics.
METHODS: 104 patients were randomly assigned to leaflet resection or preservation for surgical repair of MR in the Canadian Mitral Research Alliance CardioLink-2 study. In this post hoc analysis, we compared MV haemodynamics between the two surgical groups and examined the relationship between annuloplasty size and MV haemodynamics 1 year after repair in the combined groups. Echocardiograms were performed at baseline and intraoperatively. Exercise transthoracic echocardiography was performed 1 year postoperatively. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of exercise MV gradients at follow-up.
RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 65±10 years, and 83% were male. Median annuloplasty size was 34 (IQR 32-36). Dividing by the median, 48 (46%) had annuloplasty size of <34 mm and 56 (54%) had ≥34 mm. Mean and peak exercise gradients at 1 year were 11±5 mm Hg and 22±9 mm Hg in <34, and 6±3 mm Hg and 14±5 mm Hg in ≥34 (p<0.001). Rate of residual MR was similar in both groups. In multivariable analyses, annuloplasty size of ≥34 mm was associated with lower mean and peak exercise gradients at 12 months, after adjustment for repair type, age, sex, heart rate and body surface area (β -4.1, 95% CI -6 to -3, p<0.001, and β -7 95% CI -10 to -4, p<0.001, respectively). Intraoperative mean and peak MV gradients by transesophageal echocardiography independently predicted mean and peak resting and exercise gradients at follow-up (p<0.001). Similar results were obtained in both leaflet resection and preservation.
CONCLUSION: Annuloplasty size of ≥34 mm is associated with a 4 and 7 mm Hg reduction in mean and peak exercise MV gradients, respectively, 1 year post MV repair regardless of the repair strategy used. Intraoperative TEE MV gradients predict exercise MV gradients 1 year post repair.
