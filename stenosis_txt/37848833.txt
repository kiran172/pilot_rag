Title: The efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and arteriovenous fistula reconstruction for immature arteriovenous fistula.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To access the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and arteriovenous fistula reconstruction for immature arteriovenous fistula, compare the long-term patency and post-operative complications between them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records and Hemodialysis record sheets from 44 patients between May 2020 and January 2022 who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or arteriovenous fistula reconstruction treatment for immature autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of surgery they received, including 25 patients in the PTA group and 19 patients in the AVF reconstruction group. Clinical outcomes were included, such as the primary and secondary patency rates following the procedure, maturation time, peak systolic velocity (PSV) of brachial artery, maximum pump-controlled blood flow at initial dialysis, and post-operative complications rates in the two groups.
RESULTS: Technical and clinical success was achieved in 100% of the 44 cases. For patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, the primary patency rate at 3, 6, and 9 months was 84.0%, 68.0%, 60.0%, and the secondary patency rate was 92.0%, 84.0%, 80.0%, respectively. And for patients who underwent arteriovenous fistula reconstruction, the primary patency rate at 3, 6, and 9 months was 89.5%, 73.7%, 68.4%, and the secondary patency rate was 100.0%, 94.7%, 94.7%, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of patency rates (p > .050). In patients whose maturation was successful, the average maturation time of fistula after the PTA procedure was 19.36 ± 13.94 days, and 58.63 ± 18.95 days for the reconstruction procedure (p < .010). The PSV of brachial artery before and after the procedure was 87.64 ± 23.87 cm/s and 153.20 ± 21.69 cm/s in PTA group, for reconstruction group, the number was 86.26 ± 20.59 cm/s and 151.26 ± 29.94 cm/s, respectively. No statistically significant differences (p > .050). The maximum pump-controlled blood flow at initial dialysis was 232.60 ± 16.72 ml/min in PTA group, which was significantly higher than 197.11 ± 10.45 ml/min in reconstruction group (p < .010). Subcutaneous hematoma, restenosis, thrombus formation, and pseudoaneurysm were major complications in PTA group. Restenosis, thrombus formation, and pseudoaneurysm were major complications in reconstruction group, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups (p > .050).
CONCLUSION: When immature AVFs require reconstruction surgery, the patency outcomes are comparable to AVFs that undergo successful management by PTA. While, when AVFs are successfully managed by PTA, they have significantly less maturation times and higher maximum pump-controlled blood flow rates at initial dialysis AVF use.
