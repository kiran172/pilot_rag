Title: A brief overview of a mouse model of cerebral hypoperfusion by bilateral carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) refers to all forms of cognitive disorder related to cerebrovascular diseases, including vascular mild cognitive impairment, post-stroke dementia, multi-infarct dementia, subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD), and mixed dementia. Among the causes of VCI, more attention has been paid to SIVD because the causative cerebral small vessel pathologies are frequently observed in elderly people and because the gradual progression of cognitive decline often mimics Alzheimer's disease. In most cases, small vessel diseases are accompanied by cerebral hypoperfusion. In mice, prolonged cerebral hypoperfusion is induced by bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) with surgically implanted metal micro-coils. This cerebral hypoperfusion BCAS model was proposed as a SIVD mouse model in 2004, and the spreading use of this mouse SIVD model has provided novel data regarding cognitive dysfunction and histological/genetic changes by cerebral hypoperfusion. Oxidative stress, microvascular injury, excitotoxicity, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, and secondary inflammation may be the main mechanisms of brain damage due to prolonged cerebral hypoperfusion, and some potential therapeutic targets for SIVD have been proposed by using transgenic mice or clinically used drugs in BCAS studies. This review article overviews findings from the studies that used this hypoperfused-SIVD mouse model, which were published between 2004 and 2021.
