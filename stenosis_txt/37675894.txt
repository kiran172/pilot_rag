Title: NT-proBNP/urine hepcidin-25 ratio and cardiorenal syndrome type 1 in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Background: This study aimed to determine whether novel and conventional cardiorenal biomarkers in patients before transcatheter aortic valve implantation may be associated with cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) type 1. Methods: Serum NT-proBNP and urine biomarkers (hepcidin-25, NGAL, IL-6) were measured before and 24 h after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Results: 16/95 patients had CRS type 1. Those patients had longer length of stay in hospital (12.5 [9.0-16.0] vs 9.0 [8-12] days; p = 0.025) and were more frequently readmitted to hospital within 6 months after discharge (46.7 vs 15.6%; odds ratio: 4.7; 95% CI: 1.5-15.5; p = 0.007). The NT-proBNP/urine hepcidin-25 ratio (odds ratio: 2.89; 95% CI: 1.30-6.41; p = 0.009) was an independent modifier of CRS type 1. Conclusion: The NT-proBNP/urine hepcidin-25 ratio appears to be a modifier of risk of CRS type 1.
