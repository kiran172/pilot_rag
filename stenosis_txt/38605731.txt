Title: Assessment of central nervous system vasculitis in children based on high-resolution vascular wall imaging.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV) is a rare disease. High-resolution vessel wall imaging (HR-VWI) enables the identification of inflammatory changes within the vessel wall. Few studies have applied HR-VWI to assess CNSV in children. This study delves into the utility of HR-VWI for diagnosing and treating CNSV in children, with the aim of enhancing clinical diagnosis and efficacy evaluation.
METHODS: Imaging data were acquired from children who underwent HR-VWI examinations. The study meticulously analysed clinical data and laboratory tests to discern the characteristics and distribution patterns of diverse vasculitis forms.
RESULTS: In children, CNSV mainly involves medium vessels with grade 1 and 2 stenosis (grade 4 stenosis is rare), and the imaging features generally show centripetal and moderate enhancement, suggesting that this feature is specific for the diagnosis of CNSV. High-grade stenosis, concentric enhancement and strong enhancement of the vasculature indicate more severe disease activity. Remarkably, HR-VWI proved to be significantly more sensitive than magnetic resonance angiography in detecting CNSV. Among the 13 cases subjected to imaging review, 8 demonstrated a reduction or resolution of vessel wall inflammation. In contrast, five patients exhibited worsening inflammation in the vessel wall. HR-VWI demonstrated that changes in vessel wall inflammation were closely correlated with changes in brain parenchymal lesions and symptoms.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the diagnostic value of HR-VWI in CNSV assessment and treatment monitoring, offering a quantitative evaluation of CNSV in children.
