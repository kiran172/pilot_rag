Title: Restrictive cardiomyopathy caused by diffuse calcification of the left ventricle after 20 years of haemodialysis.

Abstract: Valvular and vascular calcifications are common among patients with end-stage renal disease, but diffuse calcification of the left ventricle is rarely reported. We report on a rare case of restrictive cardiomyopathy resulting from severe myocardial calcification and review the literature. A 77-year-old man was diagnosed with end-stage renal disease after having received regular haemodialysis for 20 years. He was referred to our emergency room due to exertional dyspnoea and exacerbated shortness of breath. A chest X-ray revealed severe pulmonary oedema and bilateral massive pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed impaired diastolic function of the left ventricle but preserved systolic function with a 50% ejection fraction. Repeat chest computed tomography demonstrated exacerbation of the calcification from the mitral annulus to the whole circular left ventricle. A coronary angiogram revealed non-significant stenosis, and right heart catheterisation demonstrated elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. He was discharged after two weeks of conservative medication.
