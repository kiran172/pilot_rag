Title: Left ventricular hypoplasia: to septate or not?

Abstract: When do we label a left ventricle as small? How is the decision made regarding suitability for a two-ventricle repair? Are dimensions the only criteria with which we decide, whether a ventricle will support the systemic circulation? Can we actually stimulate the growth of a borderline small left ventricle, so that it could support the systemic circulation in future? What role does mass and shape have to play in whether a borderline ventricle will support a biventricular repair? What role does the morphology and segmental anatomy play in this decision-making? This is a review article to address these issues.
