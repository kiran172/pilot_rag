Title: Learned high-resolution cardiac CT imaging from ultra-high-resolution PCD-CT.

Abstract: Coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) is a widely used non-invasive diagnostic exam for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, most clinical CT scanners are limited in spatial resolution from use of energy-integrating detectors (EIDs). Radiological evaluation of CAD is challenging, as coronary arteries are small (3-4 mm diameter) and calcifications within them are highly attenuating, leading to blooming artifacts. As such, this is a task well suited for high spatial resolution. Recently, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT became commercially available, allowing for ultra-high resolution (UHR) data acquisition. However, PCD-CTs are costly, restricting widespread accessibility. To address this problem, we propose a super resolution convolutional neural network (CNN): ILUMENATE (Improved LUMEN visualization through Artificial super-resoluTion imagEs), creating a high resolution (HR) image simulating UHR PCD-CT. The network was trained and validated using patches extracted from 8 patients with a modified U-Net architecture. Training input and labels consisted of UHR PCD-CT images reconstructed with a smooth kernel degrading resolution (LR input) and sharp kernel (HR label). The network learned the resolution difference and was tested on 5 unseen LR patients. We evaluated network performance quantitatively and qualitatively through visual inspection, line profiles to assess spatial resolution improvements, ROIs for CT number stability and noise assessment, structural similarity index (SSIM), and percent diameter luminal stenosis. Overall, ILUMENATE improved images quantitatively and qualitatively, creating sharper edges more closely resembling reconstructed HR reference images, maintained stable CT numbers with less than 4% difference, reduced noise by 28%, maintained structural similarity (average SSIM = 0.70), and reduced percent diameter stenosis with respect to input images. ILUMENATE demonstrates potential impact for CAD patient management, improving the quality of LR CT images bringing them closer to UHR PCD-CT images.
