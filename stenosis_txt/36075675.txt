Title: Outcomes of Repair of Congenital Aortic Valve Lesions Using Autologous Pericardium vs Porcine Intestinal Submucosa.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Outcomes following congenital aortic valve (AoV) repair are plagued by progressive dysfunction of currently available leaflet substitute materials.
OBJECTIVES: We compared the long-term outcomes of congenital AoV repair using porcine intestinal submucosa vs autologous pericardium (AP).
METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective review of all patients who underwent congenital AoV repair with either porcine intestinal submucosa or AP from October 2009 to March 2013. The primary outcome was postdischarge (late) unplanned AoV reintervention. Secondary outcomes included number of late AoV reinterventions and a composite of at least moderate aortic regurgitation or stenosis at latest follow-up or before the first reintervention. Associations between leaflet repair material and outcomes were assessed using multivariable regression models, adjusting for prespecified patient-related and operative variables.
RESULTS: Of 26 porcine intestinal submucosa and 49 AP patients who met entry criteria, the median age was 11.0 years (IQR: 4.7-16.6 years). At a median follow-up of 8.5 years (IQR: 4.4-9.6 years), 17 (65.4%) porcine intestinal submucosa and 22 (44.9%) AP patients underwent at least 1 AoV reintervention. On multivariable analysis, porcine intestinal submucosa use was significantly associated with unplanned AoV reintervention (HR: 4.6; 95% CI: 2.2-9.8; P < 0.001), number of postdischarge AoV reinterventions (incidence rate ratio: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.9; P = 0.037), and at least moderate aortic regurgitation or stenosis at latest follow-up or before the first reintervention (OR: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.2-21.0; P = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valvuloplasty with porcine intestinal submucosa is associated with earlier time to reintervention compared with autologous pericardium. The search for the ideal AoV leaflet repair material continues.
