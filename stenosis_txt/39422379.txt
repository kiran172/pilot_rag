Title: Technical aspects of the new BYCROSSTM atherectomy device - preliminary results after 28 patients.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Purpose: Technical aspects are crucial for the planning and performing of the atherectomy to treat peripheral arterial disease. This report illustrates the use of a novel atherectomy device and investigates the feasibility, efficacy, and safety procedures involved in performing the atherectomy on 28 patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective analysis of patients who underwent an atherectomy with the BYCROSSTM Atherectomy device between August 2022 and September 2023 at a tertiary referral centre. Patients with a lesion below the aortic bifurcation (vessel diameter ≥ 3mm) having a de novo or restenotic (stent-included) present were recruited. Major adverse events (MAE) are defined as amputation, death, myocardial infarction, or angiographic distal embolization that require a separate intervention.
RESULTS: Of the 28 patients treated with the BYCROSS device, 23 were men with a mean age of 65.6 ± 9,6 years and a mean BMI of 24,6 ± 3.9 kg/m2. Most patients had a typical atherogenic risk profile as well as multiple preexisting comorbidities. In all patients, a symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was the main reason for an intervention. The most common Rutherford category was 5 (12/28). The most common lesion region was the femoropopliteal segment (25/28) with 23 de novo stenosis. Mean lesion length was 218,0 ± 93,7 mm. The mean PACCS Score was 3,0 ± 1,0. Stenosis grade was by mean 99,3 ± 3,7%. Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) increased significantly after BYCROSS atherectomy (pre- 0,44 ± 0,43 vs. post-procedure 0,84 ± 0,30 P&lt;0,001. Target lesion/vessel revascularization (TLR/TVR) within the first 30 days was 3,6% (1/28). 30-day MAE rate was 14,3% (vessel perforation in 3/28 patients, embolism in 1/28). There were no deaths, index limb amputations, or myocardial infarctions.
CONCLUSION: The BYCROSSTM atherectomy system is a new device with numerous advantages in treating high-grade, calcifying stenosis and occlusion processes in PAD. Based on the above findings, the BYCROSSTM Atherectomy device represents a feasible, safe, and effective method for endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial disease.
