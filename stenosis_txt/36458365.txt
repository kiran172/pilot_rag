Title: Clinical value of long non-coding RNA KCNQ1OT1 in estimating the stenosis, lipid level, inflammation status, and prognostication in coronary heart disease patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNA KQT-like subfamily, member 1 opposite strand/antisense transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) could regulate lipid metabolism, vascular smooth muscle cell function, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. This study aimed to evaluate whether lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 could serve as a biomarker for reflecting coronary heart disease (CHD) patients' disease situation and prognosis.
METHODS: LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 expression was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 267 CHD patients, 50 disease controls (DCs) (unexplained chest pain), and 50 healthy controls (HCs) by the RT-qPCR method. TNF-α, IL-17A, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 were determined by the ELISA procedure in serum from CHD patients only. The mean (95% confidential interval) follow-up duration was 16.0 (15.3-16.8) months.
RESULTS: LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 was highest in CHD patients, followed by DCs, and lowest in HCs (p < 0.001). LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 could distinguish the CHD patients from DCs (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.757) and from the HCs (AUC: 0.880). LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 was positively associated with triglyceride (p = 0.026), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.023), cardiac troponin I (p = 0.023), and C-reactive protein (p = 0.001). Besides, lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 was also positively linked with the Gensini score (p = 0.008). Furthermore, lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 was positively related to the TNF-α (p < 0.001), IL-17A (p = 0.008), and VCAM-1 (p = 0.003). LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 was elevated in CHD patients with MACE compared to those without MACE (p = 0.006); moreover, lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 high was associated with shorter MACE-free survival (p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: Circulating lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 expression not only reflects the stenosis degree, blood lipid level, and inflammation status but also predicts the MACE risk, while a large-scale study is needed for verification.
