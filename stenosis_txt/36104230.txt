Title: Successful Preoperative Partial Splenic Artery and Aneurysm Embolization for Thrombocytopenia Associated with Failed Fontan Circulation.

Abstract: Long-term complications after the Fontan procedure are important concerns for patients with pediatric and adult congenital heart disease. Although thrombocytopenia due to portal hypertension and hypersplenism is a well-known complication of the Fontan circulation, few studies have reported on its management. Herein we describe a young adult Fontan patient with thrombocytopenia and a splenic artery aneurysm caused by conduit stenosis. The patient required conduit replacement due to high venous pressure. We performed partial splenic artery embolization (PSE) and embolization of the aneurysm preoperatively to reduce the risk of bleeding, resulting in successful subsequent cardiac surgery. Preoperative evaluation of the splenic artery aneurysm was informative, and PSE was a safe and effective treatment option for thrombocytopenia to avoid bleeding during open-heart surgery in this patient.
