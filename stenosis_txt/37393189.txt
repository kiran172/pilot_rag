Title: Trends in outcomes associated with the use of Auryon atherectomy system in a real-world setting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: While endovascular approaches are considered first line treatment for stenosis or occlusion of the lower limb arteries, major dissections and embolic events remain procedural risks. Newer technologies are needed which limit these complications while achieving desired clinical outcomes.
METHODS: The Auryon atherectomy system (AngioDynamics) consists of a 355-nm wavelength solid-state Nd:YAG short pulse laser combined with dedicated optical catheters. This single-center, retrospective chart review assessed the safety and efficacy of this device in patients with PAD treated at our center between March and December 2020.
RESULTS: A total of 55 patients were included. Mean age was 73.7 ± 9.3 years with 63.6 % of patients being males. Lesions were above the knee only for 16.4 % of patients, below the knee only for 3.6 %, and both above and below the knee for 80.0 % of patients. One patient had in-stent restenosis. Chronic total occlusions and critical limb ischemia were present for 43.6 % of patients respectively. Procedural success, defined as <30 % residual stenosis without any complications, was achieved in 85.5 % of patients. Stenosis/re-occlusion occurred in 25.5 % of patients at a mean of 168.9 ± 73.4 days with resultant target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 218.3 ± 92.4 days. Four patients underwent minor amputations. No patients experienced procedure-related complications. One patient died unrelated to the procedure.
CONCLUSION: The Auryon laser system was shown to be safe and effective in this real-world patient population with no procedural adverse events or deaths and improvements in patient outcomes.
