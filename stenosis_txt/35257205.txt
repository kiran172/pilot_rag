Title: A retrospective study of drug-coated balloon angioplasty for vertebral artery origin stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Angioplasty using drug-coated balloon (DCB) for treatment of symptomatic vertebral artery origin stenosis (VAOS) is promising, but of uncertain benefit. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of using DCB in the treatment of severe VAOS.
METHODS: This study included 20 patients with severe VAOS treated with DCB alone between April 2018 and December 2019. Vascular death, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and stroke related to the responsible artery within 30 days after procedure were recorded as primary endpoints. Restenosis, late TIA, and stroke related to VAOS and satisfied clinical outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤ 2] were documented at follow-up visit as secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: Of 20 patients, 16 were performed DCB dilation successfully, and 4 were excluded due to further bailout stenting. After the procedure, no adverse event occurred within 30 days. Ten of 16 patients achieved residual VAOS (rVAOS) < 50% (lower rVAOS group), and the remaining 6 patients achieved rVAOS ≥ 50% but < 70% (higher rVAOS group). During follow-up, vertebral artery origin restenosis was detected in 3 (18.8%) of 16 patients by ultrasound. Among the 3 patients with restenosis, 2 were belonged to the higher rVAOS group, which might indicate a tendency that the more severe the residual stenosis, the higher the restenosis rate. All patients had no complaint in the whole follow-up period (median, 7 months; InterQuartile Range, 1-18 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty using DCB for VAOS may be feasible, safe, and effective. The degree of residual stenosis after using DCB alone may affect the restenosis rate.
