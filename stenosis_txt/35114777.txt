Title: The value of high-resolution MRI in the diagnosis, efficacy of treatment, and prognosis of central nervous system vasculitis.

Abstract: AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) characteristics of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis and to explore the value of HR-MRI in the treatment effect and prognosis evaluation of CNS vasculitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the follow-up of 24 patients diagnosed as CNS vasculitis by the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, 3.0T HR-MRI was used for imaging examination and HR-MRI characteristics were analysed.
RESULTS: The affected vessel wall of 24 patients showed diffuse uniform centripetal thickening. The HR-MRI examination showed varying degrees of lumen stenosis, including 5 cases (20.8%) involving a single arterial segment, and 19 cases (79.2%) involving multiple arterial segments. And most cases (92.9%) showed grade 2 enhancement of the involved vessel wall. Except for one case involving the basilar artery at the same time, the remaining 23 cases involved only the anterior circulation vessels. We analysed and compared the affected vessels between the relapsed group and the non-relapsed group, and found that the average number of involved vascular segments was 6.5 ±3.4 (3-11) in the relapsed group and 3.5 ±2.1 (1-8) in the non-relapsed group, with a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: The CNS vasculitis was more likely to involve the anterior circulation vessels. The number of affected vascular segments in the relapsed group of CNS vasculitis was higher than in the non-relapsed group, suggesting that the more vascular segments involved, the more prone to recurrence.
