Title: The interplay of cardiac hemodynamics in rheumatic triple valve stenosis.

Abstract: Rheumatic heart disease is among the common causes of cardiovascular morbidity in developing countries. Here we present the hemodynamic interplay of stenotic rhematic involvement of aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves in a 35-year-old female. Though noninvasive imaging by echocardiography and doppler has taken the upper hand today, this case illustrates the crucial role of cardiac catheterization in understanding the hemodynamics and patient management of rheumatic multivalvular heart disease.
