Title: Tips and Tricks in Transaortic TAVR.

Abstract: Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is currently the standard catheter-based treatment of severe aortic stenosis patients. Being the transfemoral route not feasible, other access sites could be chosen. Transaortic TAVR via either a J mini-sternotomy or a right anterolateral mini-thoracotomy is a good option for patients having tricky thoracoabdominal aorta. Some tips and tricks may help in getting a fast and safe transaortic procedure.
