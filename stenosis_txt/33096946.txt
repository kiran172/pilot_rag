Title: Long-Term Outcomes of Two Ipsilateral vs Single Double-J Stent After Laser Endoureterotomy for Bilharzial Ureteral Strictures.

Abstract: Background: Laser endoureterotomy became a preferable choice for managing benign ureteral strictures. Ureteral stricture caused by bilharzias is characterized by focal destruction of ureteral musculature, ending by fibrosis, making it poor responder to endoureterotomy. There is no consensus about the ideal ureteral stent size after endoureterotomy. However, many researches recommend larger stents caliber (12-14F). We assess long-term efficacy of insertion of two ipsilateral Double-J stents vs single Double-J stent after laser endoureterotomy for bilharzial ureteral stricture. Materials and Methods: Within 4 years, 70 patients underwent retrograde laser endoureterotomy for bilharzial ureteral stricture (diagnosed by positive history of bilharziasis, positive serology test, and/or bilharzial cystoscopic finding). Patients with history of stone, urologic or pelvic surgery were excluded. Patients were randomized into two groups: the first group (35 patients) received ipsilateral two Double-J (7F each) postendoureterotomy, whereas the second group (35 patients) received one Double-J (7F). Double-Js were removed after 8 weeks. Follow-up was done regularly by clinical interpretation and imaging studies. Patients' characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcomes (subjectively and objectively) were compared in both groups. Results: Sixty-three patients completed follow-up &gt;18 months, mean follow-up 30 ± 4 months [19-41], and mean stricture length 1.4 ± 0.6 cm [0.5-3.0], with no statistical significance between both groups. Success proved by relief of symptoms and radiographic resolution of obstruction. The overall success rate was significantly better in 2-Double-J group than in 1-Double-J group (83.9% vs 53.1%) p = 0.009, and also for stricture &gt;1.5 cm (85.7% vs 38.5%) p = 0.018, respectively. Conclusions: Insertion of two ipsilateral Double-J, after laser endoureterotomy for bilharzial ureteral stricture associated with long-term success rate better than insertion of 1-Double-J, especially for stricture segment &gt;1.5 cm.
