Title: Reproducibility of artificial intelligence-enabled plaque measurements between systolic and diastolic phases from coronary computed tomography angiography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Current coronary CT angiography (CTA) guidelines suggest both end-systolic and mid-diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle can be used for CTA image acquisition. However, whether differences in the phase of the cardiac cycle influence coronary plaque measurements is not known. We aim to explore the potential impact of cardiac phases on quantitative plaque assessment.
METHODS: We enrolled 39 consecutive patients (23 male, age 66.2 ± 11.5 years) who underwent CTA with dual-source CT with visually evident coronary atherosclerosis and with good image quality. End-systolic and mid- to late-diastolic phase images were reconstructed from the same CTA scan. Quantitative plaque and stenosis were analyzed in both systolic and diastolic images using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled plaque analysis software (Autoplaque).
RESULTS: Overall, 186 lesions from 39 patients were analyzed. There were excellent agreement and correlation between systolic and diastolic images for all plaque volume measurements (Lin's concordance coefficient ranging from 0.97 to 0.99; R ranging from 0.96 to 0.98). There were no substantial intrascan differences per patient between systolic and diastolic phases (p &gt; 0.05 for all) for total (1017.1 ± 712.9 mm3 vs. 1014.7 ± 696.2 mm3), non-calcified (861.5 ± 553.7 mm3 vs. 856.5 ± 528.7 mm3), calcified (155.7 ± 229.3 mm3 vs. 158.2 ± 232.4 mm3), and low-density non-calcified plaque volume (151.4 ± 106.1 mm3 vs. 151.5 ± 101.5 mm3) and diameter stenosis (42.5 ± 18.4% vs 41.3 ± 15.1%).
CONCLUSION: Excellent agreement and no substantial differences were observed in AI-enabled quantitative plaque measurements on CTA in systolic and diastolic images. Following further validation, standardized plaque measurements can be performed from CTA in systolic or diastolic cardiac phase.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Quantitative plaque assessment using artificial intelligence-enabled plaque analysis software can provide standardized plaque quantification, regardless of cardiac phase.
KEY POINTS: • The impact of different cardiac phases on coronary plaque measurements is unknown. • Plaque analysis using artificial intelligence-enabled software on systolic and diastolic CT angiography images shows excellent agreement. • Quantitative coronary artery plaque assessment can be performed regardless of cardiac phase.
