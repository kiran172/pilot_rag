Title: Association between Carotid Bifurcation Angle and Vulnerable Plaque Volume Using Black Blood Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Abstract: The morphology of the internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation is increasingly being recognized as the cause of atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaque leading to cerebral infarction. In this study, we investigated the relationship between carotid bifurcation angle and carotid plaque volume evaluated using black blood magnetic resonance imaging (BB-MRI). Among the 90 patients who underwent revascularization for atherosclerotic symptomatic carotid stenosis between April 2016 and October 2022 using BB-MRI, carotid plaque was evaluated in 57 patients. Relative overall signal intensity (roSI) was defined as the signal intensity of the plaque on T1-weighted images relative to the signal intensity of the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the same slice as the common carotid bifurcation. Regions showing roSI ≥ 1.0 were defined as plaque, and the plaque volume and relative plaque volume were measured from roSI ≥1.0 to ≥2.0 in 0.1 increments. We calculated the angles between the common carotid artery (CCA) and the ICA and between the CCA and the external carotid artery (ECA) on magnetic resonance angiography. We classified two groups according to carotid bifurcation angles based on the ICA angle: Group A = <35° and Group B = ≥35°. Compared with Group A (n = 42), Group B (n = 15) showed a greater relative plaque volume between roSI ≥ 1.3 and roSI ≥ 1.5. A significant correlation was identified between relative plaque volume with roSI ≥ 1.4 and ICA angle (p = 0.049). Vulnerable plaque was significantly more frequent in the group with an ICA angle of ≥35. Moreover, the ICA angle was significantly greater in patients with a roSI of ≥1.4.
