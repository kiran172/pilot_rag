Title: Emerging Spine Care Trends and Innovations.

Abstract: The spine is an anchoring structure that is the base for mechanical motion of the body and a protector of neuroelements. Spinal disorders continue to plague generations with issues. Management options continue to evolve, allowing for operative and nonoperative pathways to treat underlying causes. Positive patient outcomes and long-term relief are achieved through evidence-based practice and innovative trends. The future of spine care will continue to push boundaries, allowing patients to return to activity at a much faster rate, with decreased restrictions and lower rates of future complications.
