Title: Massive Pyometra Due to Senile Endometritis in a Postmenopausal Woman: A Rare Entity.

Abstract: An 83-year-old postmenopausal female P5L5 (all full-term normal deliveries) presented with complaints of foul-smelling purulent discharge per vagina for 15 days associated with pain in abdomen. A midline mass was palpable per abdomen in the suprapubic region corresponding to 16 weeks size gravid uterus, which was soft to firm in consistency. On examination per vaginum, the atrophied cervix was found flush with the vagina and purulent discharge was seen draining through the cervix. Blood reports showed raised total leucocyte countÂ with granulocyte predominance. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a uterine cavity filled with echogenic contents, with no abdominal cavity collection. The patient was started on IV antibiotics and planned for dilatation and curettage. On histopathology acute on chronic senile endometritis was found with no evidence of malignant cells. Tuberculosis gene testing was found to be negative. We conclude that the senile endometritis leading to cervical stenosis as seen during dilatation and curettage had led to the pyometra and no evidence of malignancy was found.
