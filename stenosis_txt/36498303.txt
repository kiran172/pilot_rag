Title: Clinical Outcomes of a Non-Compliant Balloon Dilatation Catheter: MOZEC™ NC Study.

Abstract: The present study sought to assess the clinical outcomes of the Mozec™ Non-compliant (NC) Rx PTCA balloon dilatation catheter (BDC) (Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Vapi, India) for dilatation of coronary lesions. This was a post-marketing, single-centre, single-arm, retrospective study. In total, 57 patients who had undergone post-dilatation with the Mozec™ NC Rx PTCA balloon dilatation catheter were evaluated. The primary endpoint was procedural success defined as (i) successful delivery of the investigational device to and across the target lesion; (ii) successful inflation, deflation, and withdrawal of the investigational device; (iii) absence of vessel perforation, flow-limiting vessel dissection, increase in thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow from baseline, clinically significant arrhythmia requiring medical treatment; and (iv) achievement of final TIMI flow grade 3 after percutaneous coronary intervention of the target lesion after single or multiple attempts to cross the target lesion. Procedural success was achieved in 57 (100%) patients. There were no incidences of major adverse cardiac events (MACE)/target lesion failure (TLF). Mozec™ NC Rx PTCA balloon dilatation catheter has demonstrated favourable outcomes for the dilatation of routine and complex coronary lesions in a small cohort, as evidenced by its 100% procedural success rate and absence of MACE.
