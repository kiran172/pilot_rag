Title: Identification of S100A8/A9 involved in thromboangiitis obliterans development using tandem mass tags-labeled quantitative proteomics analysis.

Abstract: Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is characterized by inflammation and obstruction of small-and medium-sized distal arteries, with limited pharmacotherapies and surgical interventions. The precise pathogenesis of TAO remains elusive. By utilizing the technology of tandem mass tags (TMT) for quantitative proteomics and leveraging bioinformatics tools, a comparative analysis of protein profiles was conducted between normal and TAO rats to identify key proteins driving TAO development. The results unveiled 1385 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the TAO compared with the normal group-comprising 365 proteins with upregulated expression and 1020 proteins with downregulated expression. Function annotation through gene ontology indicated these DEPs mainly involved in cell adhesion, positive regulation of cell migration, and cytosol. The principal signaling pathways involved regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, vascular smooth contraction, and focal adhesion. The roles of these DEPs and associated signaling pathways serve as a fundamental framework for comprehending the mechanisms underpinning the onset and progression of TAO. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of S100A8/A9 and its inhibitor, paquinimod, on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and in TAO rats. We observed that paquinimod reduces SMCs proliferation and migration, promotes phenotype switching and alleviates vascular stenosis in TAO rats. In conclusion, our study revealed that the early activation of S100A8/A9 in the femoral artery is implicated in TAO development, targeting S100A8/A9 signaling may provide a novel approach for TAO prevention and treatment.
