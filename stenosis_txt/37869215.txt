Title: Drug-Coated Balloon Venoplasty to Treat Iatrogenic Pulmonary Vein Stenosis.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is a condition that has seen a decrease in incidence in recent years. Whereas balloon angioplasty and stenting are both acceptable treatment options for PVS, they are limited by the high rate of restenosis. This research paper presents 4 cases of severe symptomatic PVS that were successfully treated with the use of drug-coated balloons, resulting in positive outcomes. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
