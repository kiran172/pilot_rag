Title: Usefulness of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the role of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in aortic stenosis (AS). Although CMR is undeniably the gold standard for assessing left ventricular volume, mass, and function, the assessment of the left ventricular repercussions of AS by CMR is not routinely performed in clinical practice, and its role in evaluating and quantifying AS is not yet well established. CMR is an imaging modality integrating myocardial function and disease, which could be particularly useful in a pathology like AS that should be considered as a global myocardial disease rather than an isolated valve disease. In this review, we discuss the emerging potential of CMR for the diagnosis and prognosis of AS. We detail its utility for studying all aspects of AS, including valve anatomy, flow quantification, left ventricular volumes, mass, remodeling, and function, tissue mapping, and 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging. We also discuss different clinical situations where CMR could be useful in AS, for example, in low-flow low-gradient AS to confirm the low-flow state and to understand the reason for the left ventricular dysfunction or when there is a suspicion of associated cardiac amyloidosis.
