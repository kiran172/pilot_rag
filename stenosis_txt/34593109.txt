Title: Conduction Disturbances and Pacing in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Conduction disturbances (CDs) after transcatheter artic replacement remain a clinical concern and relatively common complication. A recent meta-analysis showed both new-onset persistent left bundle branch block and new permanent pacemaker implantation were related to all-cause death with risk ratio 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 1.49; P<.001) and 1.17 (95% CI 1.11-1.25; P<.001) at 1 year, respectively. Preprocedural computed tomography imaging can highlight potential risk factors for CDs, such as membranous septum length, device landing zone calcium, and the annulus size/degree of device oversizing.
