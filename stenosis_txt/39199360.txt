Title: Omics Science and Social Aspects in Detecting Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Risk Prediction, and Outcomes of Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: Carotid stenosis is characterized by the progressive narrowing of the carotid arteries due to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, which can lead to stroke and death as major complications. Numerous biomarkers allow for its study and characterization, particularly those related to "omics" sciences. Through the most common research databases, we report representative studies about carotid stenosis biomarkers based on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in a narrative review. To establish a priority among studies based on their internal validity, we used a quality assessment tool, the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). Genes, transcriptomes, proteins, and metabolites can diagnose the disease, define plaque connotations, predict consequences after revascularization interventions, and associate carotid stenosis with other patient comorbidities. It also emerged that many aspects determining the patient's psychological and social sphere are implicated in carotid disease. In conclusion, when taking the multidisciplinary approach that combines human sciences with biological sciences, it is possible to comprehensively define a patient's health and thus improve their clinical management through precision medicine.
