Title: Implications of Elevated Fibrosis-4 Index in Patients Receiving Trans-Catheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognostic implication of the fibrosis-4 index, which represents the degree of hepatic injury, on patients receiving trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unknown.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR to treat severe aortic stenosis at our institute between 2015 and 2020 were included in this retrospective study and followed for 2 years from the index discharge. The impact of the fibrosis-4 index, which was calculated using age, hepatic enzymes, and platelet count, on 2-year heart failure readmissions was investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 272 patients (median age 85 (82, 88) years old, 76 (28%) men) were included. The median baseline fibrosis-4 index was 2.8 (2.2, 3.7). A high fibrosis-4 index (&gt;3.79) was associated with higher cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint (18% versus 4%, p &lt; 0.001) and higher event rates (0.1041 versus 0.0222 events/year, p &lt; 0.001), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.54, p = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: an elevated fibrosis-4 index at baseline, indicating the existence of persistent hepatic congestion, was associated with incidences of heart failure following TAVR. Calculating the fibrosis-4 index before TAVR is highly encouraged for risk stratification and shared decision making.
