Title: Improvement of Pulmonary Function in Heart Failure Patients with Restrictive Patterns Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the improvement of pulmonary function in heart failure patients with restrictive patterns undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: A total of 80 patients with heart failure and restrictive patterns undergoing TAVR due to severe aortic stenosis were included in this study. Spirometry and gas diffusion were assessed before and 4-6 months after TAVR. Pre- and post-TAVR measures were compared using paired t-tests.
RESULTS: Spirometry demonstrated increased absolute and percentage predicted total lung capacity (TLC), forced vital capacity (FVC), residual volume (RV), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and forced vital capacity (FVC). FEV1/FVC decreased due to a pronounced increase in FVC. Additionally, the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) increased significantly.
CONCLUSION: Pulmonary function improves in heart failure patients with restrictive patterns undergoing TAVR.
