Title: Dysplastic Mitral Valve in Costello Syndrome.

Abstract: Costello syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition caused by variants in the HRAS gene. Cardiac presentation includes valvular disease (usually valvar pulmonary stenosis), arrhythmias, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first such report of dysplastic mitral valve associated with Costello syndrome.
