Title: Effects of and prognostic factors affecting endovascular mechanical thrombectomy of acute vertebrobasilar artery occlusion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical outcome and factors affecting the prognosis of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy of acute vertebrobasilar artery occlusion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients with acute vertebrobasilar artery occlusion were treated with endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, and the recanalization rate, clinical outcomes at three months, modified DWI-PC-ASPECTS, and MRA-BATMAN scores were analyzed.
RESULTS: Following acute mechanical thrombectomy, the TICI 2B-3 score was achieved in all patients (100%). At three-month evaluation, 56 (67.5%) patients had good prognosis with the mRS score of 0-2, including 13 (23.2%) patients who had arterial occlusion caused by emboli and 43 (76.8%) who had atherosclerotic stenosis. In analyzing factors affecting the prognosis, a significant difference (P < 0.05) existed between patients with good (mRS 0-2) and poor (mRS 3-6) prognosis in the NIHSS (17.3 vs. 31.2, P = 0.000001), modified DWI-PC-ASPECTS (10.4 vs. 7.8, P = 0.021), and MRA-BATMAN (6.3 vs. 4.6, P = 0.003) scores. Univariate Logistic regression analysis demonstrated NIHS score ≥ 21, modified DWI-PC-ASPECTS score ≤ 8.5, and MRA-BATMAN score ≤ 6.5 to be the risk factors for poor prognosis. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis revealed NIHSS score ≥ 21 as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy is safe and effective in recanalizing occluded vertebrobasilar artery occlusion, and NIHS score ≥ 21, modified DWI-PC-ASPECTS score ≤ 8.5, and MRA-BATMAN score ≤ 6.5 are the risk factors for poor prognosis.
