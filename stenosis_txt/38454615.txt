Title: Handmade Bicuspid Valved Polytetrafluoroethylene Conduit for Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction.

Abstract: Background: Excellent outcomes of right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) valves have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze the short-term results of our handmade PTFE bicuspid valved conduit (VC) for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction. Methods: Between September 2019 and May 2023, bicuspid PTFE-VC was implanted in 17 patients at a median age of 2.5 years (range, 3 months to 13.6 years). The PTFE-VC was fashioned from a commercially available PTFE tube graft (14 mm in three patients, 16 mm in three patients, 18 mm in one patient, 20 mm in three patients, and 22 mm in seven patients) and 0.1 mm thick PTFE membrane for the leaflet material. Valve function was assessed by echocardiogram after the implantation. The conduit reoperation and the conduit dysfunction were analyzed. There were no early deaths, but there was one late death. Results: There were no postoperative in-hospital deaths. Follow-up echocardiograms were available for 14 of 17 patients. The median follow-up was 21 months (range, 7-49 months). Conduit stenosis was none or trivial in 11 patients while it was mild in two and moderate in one patient and severe in 0 patients. Conduit insufficiency was mild or trivial in all 14 patients. By the end of the study period, freedom from reoperation/reintervention was 100%. There were no episodes of aneurysmal dilatation of the conduit or endocarditis. Conclusions: Handmade bicuspid PTFE VC shows good short-term outcome, with no significant valve dysfunction and no reintervention. A longer follow-up is necessary to evaluate the long-term advantages of using the handmade bicuspid PTFE VC.
