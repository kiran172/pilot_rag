Title: A case of ulcerative colitis with a variety of autoimmune diseases including ankylosing spondylitis, type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Abstract: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) are known as extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) of ulcerative colitis (UC). A 74-year-old Japanese man visited our hospital because of white stool. He had been diagnosed with AS when he was 30Â years old, and he was HLA-B27-positive. Based on various examination results, it was suspected that AIP had caused bile duct stricture. During the clinical course, he was diagnosed with UC and PSC. Then, AIP was diagnosed because he had localized pancreatic enlargement, irregular stenosis of the main pancreatic duct, PSC, and no tumor cells of pancreas. A patient with all four of these diseases, AS, AIP, PSC, and UC, is very rare. Therefore, we report a quite rare case with three EIMs (AS, PSC, and AIP) of UC.
