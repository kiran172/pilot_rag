Title: Midterm results of arch augmentation with autologous vascular patch in interrupted aortic arch.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Aortic arch reconstruction of interrupted aortic arch remains challenging, and subsequent problems, including arch and airway stenosis, may occur. Thus, we investigated midterm results of an augmentation technique using autologous vascular patch.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 24 patients who underwent arch reconstruction with an autologous vascular patch for interrupted aortic arch with biventricular physiology from 2006 to 2018. The median age and body weight at operation were 10 days (range 4-77 days) and 3 kg (range 2.5-5.1 kg), respectively. The reconstructed arch was supplemented in the lesser curvature with an autologous vascular patch that was harvested from main pulmonary artery (n = 19), left subclavian artery (n = 3) or aberrant right subclavian artery (n = 1). One patient used patches from both the main pulmonary and left subclavian artery.
RESULTS: There was 1 early death due to right heart failure. All survivors were discharged 15 days (range 9-58 days) after surgery without residual arch stenosis. Late death occurred in 1 patient with Cri-du-chat syndrome and airway stenosis. Two reoperations and 1 intervention for arch stenosis were performed. The 1-, 5- and 10-year survival was 92%. Freedom from reoperation or intervention for arch stenosis was 86% 1, 5 and 10 years after surgery. No occurrence of arch aneurysm formation, left main bronchial stenosis and significant hypertension was found during a median follow-up period of 5.5 years (range 0.3-13.3 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Augmenting the lesser curvature with an autologous vascular patch during arch reconstruction resulted in reasonable midterm outcomes.
