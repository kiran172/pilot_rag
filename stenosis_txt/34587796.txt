Title: Detection of Advanced Lesions of Atherosclerosis in Carotid Arteries Using 3-Dimensional Motion-Sensitized Driven-Equilibrium Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (3D-MERGE) Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Screening Tool.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Two-dimensional high-resolution multicontrast magnetic resonance imaging (2D-MC MRI) is currently the most reliable and reproducible noninvasive carotid vessel wall imaging technique. However, the long scan time required for 2D-MC MRI restricts its practical clinical application. Alternatively, 3-dimensional motion-sensitized driven-equilibrium prepared rapid gradient echo (3D-MERGE) vessel wall MRI can provide high isotropic resolution with extensive coverage in two minutes. In this study, we sought to prove that 3D-MERGE alone can serve as a screening tool to identify advanced carotid lesions.
METHODS: Two hundred twenty-seven subjects suspected of recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack were imaged using 2D-MC MRI with an imaging time of 30 minutes, then with 3D-MERGE with an imaging time of 2 minutes, on 3T-MRI scanners. Two experienced reviewers interpreted plaque components using 2D-MC MRI as the reference standard and categorized plaques using a modified American Heart Association lesion classification for MRI. Plaques of American Heart Association type IV and above were classified as advanced. Arteries of American Heart Association types I to II and III were categorized as normal or with early lesions, respectively. One radiologist independently reviewed only 3D-MERGE and labeled the plaques as advanced if they had a wall thickness of >2 mm with high or low signal intensity compared with the adjacent sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for 3D-MERGE were calculated.
RESULTS: Four hundred forty-nine arteries from 227 participants (mean age 61.2 years old, 64% male) were included in the analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identification of advanced lesions on 3D-MERGE were 95.0% (95% CI, 91.8-97.2), 86.9% (95% CI, 81.4-92.0), 93.8% (95% CI, 91.1-95.8), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: 3D-MERGE can accurately identify advanced carotid atherosclerotic plaques in patients suspected of stroke or transient ischemic attack. It has a more extensive coverage and higher sensitivity and specificity for advanced plaque detection with a much shorter acquisition time than 2D-MC MRI.
