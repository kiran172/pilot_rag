Title: EUS-guided fine needle aspiration provides an open view for duodenal obstruction caused by urothelial carcinoma: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a good alternative and diagnostic tool for gastrointestinal wall thickening with prior negative endoscopic biopsies.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we reported a case of a 60-years-old woman admitted with atrophic right kidney and hydronephrosis and intermittent postprandial bloating. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and small bowel endoscopy revealed wall thickening and stenosis at the junction of the descending and inferior duodenum. Biopsies from endoscopy showed no specific findings. EUS-FNA of the thickened duodenal wall was performed and histopathological examinations revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma. Immunohistochemically staining was positive for pan-cytokeratin, CK7, CK20, and weakly positive for GATA-3 and P63. These results were highly suggestive of metastatic urothelial cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: EUS-FNA played an important role in the diagnosis of unexplained gastrointestinal wall thickening and rare metastases to the gastrointestinal wall.
