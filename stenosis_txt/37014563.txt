Title: Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Significant Mitral Stenosis-a Preliminary Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and concomitant moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis (MS) are listed as a contraindicated population to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) because of the traditional tenet of high stroke risk, despite scarce evidence. With accumulating data, we sought to conduct a systematic meta-analysis to preliminarily explore the efficacy and safety of DOAC versus warfarin in patients with AF and concomitant significant MS.
METHODS: We searched the Medline, Embase databases, and the Cochrane Library (assessed October 10th, 2022) for eligible studies. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were synthesized in Stata 16.1 (StataCorp).
RESULTS: In random-effects meta-analyses, DOACs demonstrated a similar risk of stroke or systemic embolism (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.09-2.96), all-cause death (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.35-1.87), major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.24-1.39), and silent cerebral ischemia (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.64-1.58) when compared with warfarin.
CONCLUSIONS: DOACs were similar to warfarin in the efficacy and safety profiles in patients with AF and concomitant significant MS. Future evidence is expected from other large trials.
