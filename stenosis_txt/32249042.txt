Title: Electrocardiography-gated computed tomography angiography analysis of cardiac pulsatility-induced motion and deformation after endovascular aneurysm sealing with chimney grafts.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the proximal stability of the chimney endovascular aneurysm sealing configuration (chEVAS) during the cardiac cycle by investigating the cardiac pulsatility-induced movement and deformation.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed postoperative electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography angiography scans of 11 chEVAS cases (9 primary chEVAS plus 2 chEVAS-in-chEVAS). ChEVAS procedures were conducted between September 2013 and June 2016. Motion and deformation of the EVAS stents, the chimney grafts, and the stented branch vessels were evaluated during the cardiac cycle using an established combination of image registration and segmentation techniques.
RESULTS: Electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography angiography scans of 11 chEVAS configurations including 22 EVAS stents and 20 chimney grafts were analyzed. The three-dimensional displacement was at most 1.7 mm for both the EVAS stents and the chimney grafts. The maximum change in distance between components was no more than 0.4 mm and did not differ between EVAS-to-EVAS stent and EVAS stent-to-chimney stent (0.2 ± 0.1 mm vs 0.2 ± 0.1 mm; P = .823). The mean change in chimney deflection angle was 1.2 ± 0.7°; the maximum change was greatest for the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (2.6°). The EVAS stent-to-chimney angles for the left renal artery, right renal artery, and SMA varied on average by 0.7 ± 0.3° (range, 0.4°-1.3°), 1.0 ± 0.3° (range, 0.5°-1.7°), and 0.8 ± 0.4° (range, 0.3°-1.3°), respectively, during the cardiac cycle. The end-stent angles for the left renal artery, right renal artery, and SMA varied on average by 1.7 ± 0.9° (range, 0.5°-3.3°), 1.9 ± 0.8° (range, 0.7°-3.3°), and 1.3 ± 0.4° (range, 0.7°-1.6°), respectively, during the cardiac cycle. Overall, the end-stent angles varied on average by 1.7 ± 0.8° (range, 0.5°-3.3°).
CONCLUSIONS: The chEVAS configuration proved to be stable during the cardiac cycle, as demonstrated by minimal cyclical changes in distance between device components and angulation between the EVAS stents and the chimney grafts. The limited deflection angles of the chimney grafts decrease the risk of bending fatigue, but the more apparent change in end-stent angle distal to the chimney graft may raise concerns regarding late branch occlusion or stenosis.
