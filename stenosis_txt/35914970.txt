Title: Bail-Out Implantation of an Embolized Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Heart Valve in the Aortic Arch Using Self-Expandable Stents.

Abstract: Embolization of a balloon expandable valve during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) is a rare complication which generally can be managed by implantation of the embolized valve into the aorta. We present a TAVR case where the combination of an ascending aortic aneurysm and a narrow aortic arch precluded implantation of an embolized balloon-expandable valve into either the ascending and descending aorta. As a bailout strategy, the embolized valve was secured in the aortic arch using two self-expandable stents. Six month after the procedure, computed tomography confirmed a stable valve position with unobstructed blood flow into the supra-aortic arteries.
