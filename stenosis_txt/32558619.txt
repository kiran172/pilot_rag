Title: Circulating miR-106b-5p serves as a diagnostic biomarker for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and predicts the occurrence of cerebral ischemic events.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the expression and diagnostic value of miR-106b-5p in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) patients, and further explore its predictive value for the occurrence of cerebral ischemic events (CIE). A total of 58 asymptomatic CAS cases and 61 healthy controls were recruited. Quantitative RT-PCR was applied for the measurement of the miR-106b-5p level. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to assess the diagnostic value of miR-106b-5p for CAS. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression analysis were performed to assess the predictive value of miR-106b-5p for the occurrence of CIE. In patients with asymptomatic CAS, miR-106b-5p was highly expressed. The miR-106b-5p level showed a significant association with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and the degree of carotid stenosis. miR-106b-5p had a relative accuracy in differentiating patients with asymptomatic CAS from healthy individuals, with a sensitivity of 89.7% and specificity of 83.6% at the cutoff value of 0.198. Patients with high miR-106b-5p expression experienced more CIE. miR-106b-5p was highly expressed in patients with asymptomatic CAS. Our present results provide evidence for miR-106b-5p as a promising biomarker for CAS diagnosis, and for predicting the risk of future CIE in patients with asymptomatic CAS.
