Title: Sex Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women. It remains underdiagnosed, undertreated, and portends worse outcomes in women than men. Disparities exist in every stage of science, from bench research to the editorial board of major journals and in every cardiovascular subspecialty. This review summarizes differences in cardiovascular risk factors and disparities in management and outcomes of ischemic heart disease, heart failure, aortic stenosis, and atrial fibrillation. It also provides an overview of female representation as participants and leaders of clinical trials, editorial boards, and academic institutions. Strategies to overcome these disparities are proposed with examples of successful programs.
