Title: Fate of target visceral vessels in fenestrated and branched complex endovascular aortic repair.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess branch vessel outcomes after endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms analyzing possible factors influencing early and long-term results.
METHODS: The Italian Multicentre Fenestrated and Branched registry enrolled 596 consecutive patients treated with fenestrated and branched endografts for complex aortic disease from January 2008 to December 2019 by four Italian academic centers. The primary end points of the study were technical success (defined as target visceral vessel [TVV] patency and absence of bridging device-related endoleak at final intraoperative control), and freedom from TVV instability (defined as the combined results of type IC/IIIC endoleaks and patency loss) during follow-up. Secondary end points were overall survival and TVV-related reinterventions.
RESULTS: We excluded 591 patients (3 patients with a surgical debranching and 2 patients who died before completion from the study cohort) were treated for a total of 1991 visceral vessels targeted by either a directional branch or a fenestration. The overall technical success rate was 98.4%. Failure was related to the use of an off-the-shelf (OTS) device (custom-made device vs OTS, HR, 0.220; P = .007) and a preoperative TVV stenosis of >50% (HR, 12.460; P < .001). The mean follow-up time was 25.1 months (interquartile range, 3-39 months). The overall estimated survival rates were 87%, 77.4%, and 67.8% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively (standard error [SE], 0.015, 0.022, and 0.032). During follow-up, TVV branch instability was observed in 91 vessels (5%): 48 type IC/IIIC endoleaks (2.6%) and 43 stenoses-thromboses (2.4%). The extent of aneurysm disease (thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm [TAAA] types I-III vs TAAA type IV/juxtarenal aortic aneurysm/pararenal aortic aneurysm) was the only independent predictor for developing a TVV-related type IC/IIIC endoleak (HR, 3.899; 95% confidence interval [CI]:, 1.924-7.900; P < .001). Risk of patency loss was independently associated with branch configuration (HR, 8.883; P < .001; 95% CI, 3.750-21.043) and renal arteries (HR, 2.848; P = .030; 95% CI, 1.108-7.319). Estimated rates at 1, 3, and 5 years of freedom from TVV instability and freedom from TVV-related reintervention were 96.6%, 93.8%, and 90% (SE, 0.005, 0.007, and 0.014) and 97.4%, 95.0%, and 91.6% (SE, 0.004, 0.007, and 0.013), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative failure to bridge a TVV was associated with a preoperative TVV stenosis of >50% and the use of OTS devices. Midterm outcomes were satisfying, with an estimated 5-year freedom from TVV instability and reintervention of 90.0% and 91.6%, respectively. During follow-up, the larger extent of aneurysm disease was associated with an increased risk of TVV-related endoleaks, whereas a branch configuration and renal arteries were more prone to patency loss.
