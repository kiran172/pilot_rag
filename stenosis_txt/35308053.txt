Title: Infective endocarditis in an adult with unrepaired corrected transposition.

Abstract: We report a case of a 28-year-old man with unrepaired congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis who presented with septic shock due to infective endocarditis by Abiotrophia defectiva. The cardiac catheterization had the risk of vegetation scattering. Without invasive hemodynamic assessment, the degree of pulmonary stenosis and left ventricle preparation as a systemic ventricle could not be accurately determined, making surgical planning difficult. We chose a staged approach with pulmonary valve replacement first for source control, followed by a more definitive operation following recovery from endocarditis.
