Title: [Heyde syndrome successfully treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation to prevent recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia].

Abstract: While hospitalized due to severe aortic stenosis, an 84-year-old woman developed repeated bleeding from angiodysplasia in the stomach leading to a diagnosis of Heyde syndrome. Following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), there was no recurrence of bleeding from the angiodysplasia, and the decrease in von Willebrand factor levels that caused Heyde syndrome also improved. It was felt that the TAVI was able to prevent the recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia in Heyde syndrome.
