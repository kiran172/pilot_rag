Title: Bioabsorbable Microplates as an External Stent for Suprastomal Collapse: A Retrospective Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the long-term decannulation outcomes of bioresorbable microplates as an external stent for pediatric tracheostomy patients with suprastomal collapse.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Hospital records of all patients who underwent a bioresorbable microplate for suprastomal collapse from 2016 to 2019 were reviewed at a single institution. The primary outcome measure was tracheostomy decannulation.
RESULTS: A total of nine patients underwent placement of bioabsorbable microplates to treat suprastomal collapse. After initial tracheostomy, four patients received a laryngotracheal reconstruction prior to their external stent placement, and one patient received a mandibular distraction. The average age at the time of external stent placement was 32 (±21) months, excluding one patient who received a stent at the age of 29 years. Eight patients (88.9%) were successfully decannulated following the procedure. Decannulated patients were followed for an average of 21 (±12.5) months postoperatively, and all these patients have remained decannulated since their initial procedure. This is a total of 173 months (14.4 years) of observation postprocedure in which these patients have remained decannulated. One patient experienced postoperative crepitus requiring washout but still maintained decannulation.
CONCLUSION: Bioabsorbable microplates have a reasonable chance of long-term successful decannulation when an appropriate patient is selected. Decannulation is maintained beyond the 6-month time frame in which the 85:15 poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer that comprises the external stent takes to bioabsorb. This procedure should be considered for the often difficult problem of pediatric tracheostomy with isolated suprastomal collapse.
