Title: Multicenter Experience with the Surfacer Inside-Out Access Catheter System in Patients with Thoracic Venous Obstruction: Results from the SAVE Registry.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report the device performance and safety for the Surfacer Inside-Out access catheter system in patients with thoracic central venous obstruction (TCVO) requiring central venous access (CVA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five sites prospectively enrolled 30 patients requiring a tunneled dialysis catheter between February 2017 and September 2018 in the SAVE (Surfacer System to Facilitate Access in Venous Obstructions) registry. Patient demographics, medical history, and type of TCVO were documented at enrollment. Device performance and adverse events were collected during the procedure and upon hospital discharge. Twenty-nine of the 30 patients enrolled required CVA for hemodialysis. Retrospective classification of TCVOs according to SIR reporting standards showed 9 patients (30%) had Type 4 obstructions, 8 (26.7%) had Type 3, 5 (16.7%) had Type 2, and 8 (26.7%) had Type 1 obstruction.
RESULTS: Central venous catheters (CVCs) were successfully placed in 29 of 30 patients (96.7%). The procedure was discontinued in 1 patient due to vascular anatomical tortuosity. All 29 patients with successful CVC placement achieved adequate catheter patency and tip positioning. There were no device-related adverse events, catheter malposition, or intra- or postprocedural complications. Mean time from device insertion to removal for the 29 patients who successfully completed the procedure was 24 ± 14.9 (range, 6-70) minutes. Mean fluoroscopy time was 6.8 ± 4.5 (range, 2.2-25.5) minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: The Surfacer Inside-Out procedure provided an alternative option to restore right-sided CVA in patients with TCVO.
