Title: Value of the systemic immune-inflammation index in predicting poor postoperative outcomes and the short-term prognosis of heart valve diseases: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a novel biomarker that can predict poor outcomes in tumours, nervous system diseases and chronic heart failure. Here, we investigated the predictive value of SII on the poor postoperative outcomes and short-term prognosis of heart valve diseases (HVDs).
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled all consecutive patients with HVDs (aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation) who underwent surgery (valve replacement or valve repair) at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College between 2017 and 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Major complications in the perioperative period, all-cause mortality within 30 days and readmission within 30 days.
RESULTS: A total of 431 patients with HVDs were enrolled in this study, including 202 males and 229 females, aged 58.9±27.3 years. SII levels of patients in the poor outcomes group were significantly higher than those of patients in the favourable outcomes group (658.40±436.29 vs 335.72±174.76, respectively; p&lt;0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (OR 1.064, 95% CI 1.026 to 1.104, p=0.025), SII (OR 1.034, 95% CI 1.012 to 1.631, p=0.008) and aortic cross-clamping time (OR 1.013, 95% CI 1.004 to 1.023, p=0.006) were independent risk factors for poor outcomes and short-term prognosis in patients with HVD. The area under the curve of poor outcomes predicted by SII in patients with HVD was 0.806 (95% CI 0.763 to 0.848) and the optimised cut-off value 423.8×109 /L, with a sensitivity of 70.3% and specificity of 81.1%. The incidence of poor outcomes (p&lt;0.001), 30-day mortality (p&lt;0.001) and 30-day readmission rate (p=0.026) in the high SII group was significantly higher than that in the low SII group.
CONCLUSIONS: SII is closely related to poor postoperative outcomes and short-term prognosis of HVD and can serve as an independent predictive factor.
