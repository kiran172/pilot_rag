Title: [Chinese expert consensus on clinical application of endobiliary radiofrequency ablation therapy for malignant biliary obstruction].

Abstract: Endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (EB-RFA) is a novel therapy for malignant biliary obstruction (MBO), which is considered as a palliative treatment for MBO caused by cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic head carcinoma, metastatic lymphadenopathy and other causes. Due to the advantages of minimal invasiveness and repeatability, EB-RFA plays an important role in the combination of stent implantation in the initial treatment of MBO or in the recanalization of stent stenosis/obstruction. In this expert consensus, the indications, contraindications, operation protocol and evaluation criteria of efficacy of EB-RFA were sufficiently discussed, which was organized by the Professional Committee of Minimally Invasive Therapy of China Anti-cancer Association.
