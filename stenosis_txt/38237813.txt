Title: Inpatient outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement based on class of obesity.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a transformative option for severe aortic stenosis, especially in elderly patients. obesity's impact on TAVR outcomes is limited. Using the National Inpatient Sample from 2016 to 2020, We analyzed 217,300 TAVR hospitalizations across BMI groups. No difference in in-hospital mortality was observed, class III obesity experienced longer hospital stays (adjusted β: 0.43 days, P < 0.05), higher costs (adjusted β: $3,126, P < 0.05), increased heart failure exacerbation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.03-7.01], p < 0.05), vascular access complications (aOR: 1.29, 95% CI: [1.07-1.52], P < 0.05), and post-operative pulmonary complications (Pneumonia (aOR: 1.42, 95% CI: [1.16-1.74], p < 0.05), acute hypoxic respiratory failure (aOR: 1.99, 95% CI: [1.67-2.36], p < 0.05), and non-invasive ventilation (aOR: 1.62, 95% CI: [1.07-2.44], p < 0.05). Complete heart block and permanent pacemaker requirement were higher in both class II and class III ((aOR: 1.30, 95% CI: [1.11-1.51], P < 0.05), (aOR:1.25, 95% CI: [1.06-1.46], P < 0.05) and ((aOR: 1.18, 95% CI: [1.00-1.40], P < 0.05), (aOR:1.22, 95% CI: [1.02-1.45], P < 0.05)) respectively. Understanding these links is crucial for optimizing TAVR care in obesity, ensuring enhanced outcomes, and procedural safety.
