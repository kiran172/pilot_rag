Title: The Role of MicroRNAs in Aortic Stenosis-Lessons from Recent Clinical Research Studies.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent primary valve lesion demanding intervention. Two main treatment options are surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation. There is an unmet need for biomarkers that could predict treatment outcomes and become a helpful tool in guiding Heart Team in the decision-making process. Micro-ribonucleic acids (microRNAs/miRs) have emerged as potential biomarkers thoroughly studied in recent years. In this review, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge about the role of miRNAs in AS based on human subject research. Much research investigating miRNAs' role in AS has been conducted so far. We included 32 original human subject research relevant to the discussed field. Most of the presented miRNAs were studied only by a single research group. Nevertheless, several miRNAs appeared more than once, sometimes with high consistency between different studies but sometimes with apparent discrepancies. The molecular aspects of diseases are doubtlessly exciting and provide invaluable insights into the pathophysiology. Nevertheless, translating these findings, regarding biomarkers such as miRNAs, into clinical practice requires much effort, time, and further research with a focus on validating existing evidence.
