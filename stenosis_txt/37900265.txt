Title: Variant of Wellen's syndrome in type 1 diabetic patient: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Wellen's syndrome is a form of acute coronary syndrome associated with proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis and characteristic electrocardiograph (ECG) patterns in pain free state. The abnormal ECG pattern is classified into type A (biphasic T waves) and type B (deeply inverted T waves), based on the T wave pattern seen in the pericodial chest leads.
CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a 37-year-old male with history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), gastroparesis, mild peripheral artery disease and right toe cellulitis on IV antibiotics who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain for 3 d and as a result couldn't take his insulin. Noted to have fasting blood sugar 392 mg/dL. Admitted for diabetic gastroparesis. During the hospital course, the patient was asymptomatic and denied any chest pain. On admission, No ECG and troponin draws were performed. On day 2, the patient became hypoxic with oxygen saturation 80% on room air, intermittent mild right-sided chest pain which he attributed to vomiting from his gastroparesis. Initial ECG done was significant for Biphasic T wave changes in leads V2 and V3 and elevated high sensitivity troponin. Patient was transitioned to cardiac intensive care unit and cardiac catheterization performed with result significant for extensive coronary artery disease.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights an exceptional manifestation of Wellen's syndrome, wherein the right coronary artery and circumflex artery display a remarkable 100% constriction, alongside a proximal LAD stenosis of 90%-95%. Notably, this occurrence transpired in a patient grappling with extensive complications arising from T1DM. Moreover, it underscores the utmost significance of promptly recognizing the presence of Wellen's syndrome and swiftly initiating appropriate medical intervention.
