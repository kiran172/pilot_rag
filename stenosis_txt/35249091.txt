Title: [Subcutaneous Bronchogenic Cyst in the Anterior Chest Diagnosed before Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting:Report of a Case].

Abstract: A 65-year-old woman was transported to our hospital by ambulance because of severe dyspnea. She had had a subcutaneous tumor on her anterior chest since her childhood. Coronary angiography revealed three vessel disease with significant stenosis in the left main trunk. Excision of anterior chest tumor, 70×60×50 mm in size, was performed before coronary artery bypass grafting( CABG). It was a unilocular cyst adhering to the sternum, and was composed of ciliated epitheliums, goblet cells and smooth muscle cells. Based upon the existence of smooth muscle cells, the tumor was diagnosed as bronchogenic cyst. CABG was performed through mid-sternum about two months after the tumor excision, and the postoperative course was uneventful.
