Title: Successful laparoscopy-assisted en bloc resection of bulky omental malignant lymphoma involving the ascending colon and multiple lymph node metastases: Report of a technically demanding case in a pediatric patient.

Abstract: We herein report a 13-year-old boy with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and a palpable mass. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed an abdominal bulky tumor involving the ascending colon causing severe stenosis, with multiple abdominal lymph node metastases detected by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. Laparoscopic radical resection with right hemicolectomy and lymph node dissection was planned. The bulky tumor was dissected from the retroperitoneum and resected en bloc with the right-side colon and omentum. The preoperatively detected metastatic lymph nodes were resected along with the tumor. A 6-cm longitudinal umbilical incision was made, and the huge tumor was removed, with functional end-to-end anastomosis performed for intestinal reconstruction. The pathological diagnosis was Burkitt-like lymphoma with 11q aberration. The postoperative course was uneventful. Laparoscopy-assisted extirpation is feasible for pediatric solid tumors involving other organs, but indications and procedures should be carefully determined based on preoperative imaging, intraoperative findings and surgeon's skills.
