Title: Impact of allograft types on outcomes after pediatric liver transplantation due to biliary atresia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several surgical strategies, including split donor transplantation and living donor transplantation, have been used to increase the donor liver pool. This report focuses on the effects of whole, split, and LDLT on recipient outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of all patients with biliary atresia at Tianjin First Central Hospital between April 2013 and December 2019.
RESULTS: A total of 882 patients were included and divided into three groups by graft type, with 198 in the whole-liver-transplantation group, 78 in the split liver transplantation group, and 606 in the LDLT group. The median follow-up time was 39 months, patient survival rates of three groups were 94.4%, 88.5%, and 95.0%, respectively, and graft survival rates were 90.2%, 83.3%, and 94.7%, respectively. We divided the split liver transplantation group into two subgroups according to the donor's age, and patient survival rates exhibited a significant difference only in the group whose donor age was over 45 years. The postoperative complication rates were significantly higher with respect to hepatic artery thrombosis, portal stenosis, and AR; and lower in hepatic venous stenosis, PTLDs, CMV virus, and EBV infection in the WLT group. Our multivariate model showed that donor age ≥45 years, RBC transfusion, pneumonia, and HAT were the independent predictors of allograft loss.
CONCLUSIONS: The survival of split liver transplantation group was slightly lower. The types of complications are different from different graft types. Therefore, postoperative monitoring and treatment need to be adjusted according to the different graft types used.
