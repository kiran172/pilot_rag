Title: Pacemaker implantation in a COVID-19 patient. Balancing the patient's needs and the team's risk of exposure.

Abstract: COVID-19 patients may have cardiovascular complications requiring invasive treatment. Pacemaker implantation procedure may be challenging because of the necessity of personal protective equipment use. We report pacemaker implantation in a 78-year-old man with severe bilateral COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia, a second degree 2:1 atrioventricular block, and concomitant aortic stenosis.
