Title: Effect of Implantation of a new Domestic Prosthesis in the Aortic Position on the Quality of Life of Patients With Degenerative Aortic Stenose, Survival Assessment and Development of Complications 1 Year Post-Surgery.

Abstract: Aim      To evaluate quality of life (QoL), general survival, and development of complications in patents one year after surgical aortic valve (AV) replacement with a MedInzh-BIO xenopericardial carcass prosthesis.Material and methods  Degenerative AV disease is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases that gives place only to ischemic heart disease. Surgical correction of the AV defect should be aimed not only at hemodynamic outcomes but also at improvement of QoL. This study included 91 patients (48 women and 43 men), who were implanted with a MedInzh-BIO biological xenopericardial prosthesis in aortic position from January 2017 through March 2020. Mean age of patients was 69.96±4.4 years. QoL was evaluated with a standard SF-36 questionnaire. Also, survival and complications were analyzed one year after surgery.Results Data analysis before and one year after surgery showed a significant improvement of QoL. Postoperative one-year survival was 95.4 %, and major valve-associated complications were absent in 94.5% of cases. During one year, four patients died after 1, 6, 8, and 10 months of follow-up, respectively.Conclusion      The improvement of QoL following the AV replacement with a novel xenopericardial carcass prosthesis with the "easy change" system indicates the clinical and functional effectiveness of the used method. The results of the study demonstrated improvements of both the physical health component and the subjective emotional assessment. Postoperative one-year survival was 95.4 %, and major valve-associated complications were absent in 94.5% of cases.
