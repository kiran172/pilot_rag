Title: Oblique Lateral Interbody Fusion (OLIF) with Supplemental Anterolateral Screw and Rod Instrumentation: A Preliminary Clinical Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the technical details, clinical effectiveness, and complications of oblique lateral interbody fusion supplemented with anterolateral screw-rod instrumentation in managing degenerative lumbar diseases.
METHODS: The clinical data of 14 patients with lumbar degenerative diseases who underwent oblique lateral interbody fusion and anterolateral screw-rod instrumentation in the Department of Neurosurgery, Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, from April 2015 to May 2018, were retrospectively analyzed. The duration of operation, estimated blood loss, radiological exposure, length of hospital stay, and complications were recorded. The visual analog scale score, Oswestry Disability Index, and radiologic parameters were evaluated before and after surgery.
RESULTS: The diagnosis included degenerative/isthmic spondylolisthesis (grade I), degenerative lumbar stenosis, disc hernia with instability, and adjacent segment disease. The follow-up period was 12-45 months. The clinical symptoms improved significantly after the operation according to the visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores. The average operation time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay were 72.50 ± 21.46 minutes, 53.21 ± 19.07 mL, and 5.57 ± 2.21 days, respectively. The postoperative radiographic examination demonstrated increased intervertebral height and foramen area (P < 0.05). The radiologic fusion rate was 95% at the last follow-up; cage subsidence was found in 1 case. No major complications, such as vascular injury, ureteral injury, or infection, occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: As an alternative method of instrumentation, anterolateral screw-rod fixation minimized the total operation time, blood loss, radiological exposure, and soft tissue disruption, and realized 1-stage intervertebral fusion and instrumentation through a single small incision.
