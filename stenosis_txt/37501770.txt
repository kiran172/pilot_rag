Title: A Patient with a Large Aneurysm Complicated by Stenosis of the Internal Carotid Artery Distal to the Aneurysm in Whom Treatment Using a Pipeline Flex Was Performed.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We report a case of in-stent stenosis as a complication at 6 months after the deployment of Pipeline Flex. This case necessitated retreatment for parent artery occlusion.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old woman with right-side visual disorder was referred to our hospital for the deployment of Pipeline Flex. Cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated a large right-side paraclinoid aneurysm in combination with severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis just beyond the aneurysm. We deployed Pipeline Flex under general anesthesia. After deployment, we performed angioplasty through the Pipeline. Six months after deployment, this patient exhibited exacerbation of visual disorder. Follow-up DSA revealed in-stent stenosis at 6 months after the deployment of Pipeline Flex. Therefore, we performed parent artery occlusion. Right-side visual disorder was improved in this patient.
CONCLUSION: If Pipeline is deployed for patients with ICA stenosis just beyond an aneurysm, we need to be aware of in-stent stenosis after deployment.
