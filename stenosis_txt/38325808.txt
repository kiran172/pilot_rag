Title: Aortic root enlargement and replacement of the ascending aorta in type 0 aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This case report aims to describe an aortic root enlargement in combination with the replacement of the ascending aorta in a patient presenting with severe aortic valve stenosis.
CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis due to a type 0 bicuspid aortic valve and an aortic aneurysm underwent surgery for treatment. The annulus was preoperatively measured with 19 mm. Enlargement was performed by using a tissue patch to create a neo-noncoronary sinus and enlarge the root.
DISCUSSION: Patients with a small aortic root face an increased risk of patient prosthesis mismatch. Enlarging the aortic root can mitigate this, but it extends cross-clamp and overall operative times. This case shows the need for carefully planned surgical interventions to optimize outcomes in complex anatomies.
CONCLUSIONS: Each step of the performed surgery is well-established, however the combination and the creation of a neo-noncoronary sinus is not described so far.
