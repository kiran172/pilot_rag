Title: Therapy for Renal Artery Stenosis: A Call for Change.

Abstract: We present a brief case description of a patient who benefitted from stenting in ARAS and provide a comprehensive review of ARAS; its prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment. We review the evidence for and against stenting in ARAS as well as consensus guidelines for stenting. Our review is valuable as we argue that stenting in ARAS is underutilized and the randomized control data for stenting in those patients who may benefit most is lacking. Our review will provide an important perspective for clinicians faced with decisions of how to treat ARAS.
