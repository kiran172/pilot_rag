Title: Preliminary evaluation of an indwelling epidural catheter for repeat methylprednisolone administration in canine lumbosacral stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the complications, outcomes, and patency of a permanent epidural catheter and subcutaneous access port system (ECAPS) as part of conservative management of degenerative lumbosacral stenosis in dogs.
ANIMALS AND PROCEDURE: Medical records of 11 client-owned dogs that underwent an ECAPS insertion were evaluated retrospectively. Clinical signs, complications related to the procedure, and system patency are reported.
RESULTS: All dogs had lumbosacral pain at their initial neurological assessment, with comfort levels adequately controlled following epidural infiltrations. None suffered from complications related to the ECAPS procedure. In 10 dogs, there were no malfunctions for the duration of the study. However, in 1 dog, there was a suspected leak at Day 814. The longest duration of patency reported in this study was 870 d (at the time of writing).
CONCLUSION: Placement of an ECAPS is a feasible technique and a viable option to permit repeated epidural injections of steroids in dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis that is managed conservatively. Further studies are required to evaluate complication rates.
