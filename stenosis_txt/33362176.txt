Title: [Two cases of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma treated with bronchial recanalization and first-line therapy with afatinib.].

Abstract: In 2019, we admitted two non-smoking patients with severe dyspnea from invasion of the main airway due to lung cancer. The patients were 57 and 67 years old; both presented with critical stenosis due to infiltration of the right main bronchus and in both cases, due to severe respiratory insufficiency, an indication of unclogging of the right stenotic main bronchus with rigid bronchoscope and Laser yttrium aluminum perovskite (YAP)-Nd in the operating room was given. At the end of the recanalization operation, a tracheobronchial prothesis, the GSS-Y 40x30x30 mm by Novatech, was positioned in Case 1; a nitinol self-expanding prothesis, the SILMETÂ® 14x40 mm by Novatech, was positioned in Case 2. Once the histological diagnosis of EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma was established, we started first-line treatment with afatinib 40 mg die tablets.
