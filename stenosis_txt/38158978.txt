Title: [Type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease: features of perfusion volume computed tomography of the heart in a pharmacological test with adenosine triphosphate].

Abstract: AIM: To study myocardial perfusion in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using volumetric computed tomography (VCT) of the heart with a pharmacological test with adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 93 patients, of which 18 had CAD with DM, and 50 had CAD without DM. All patients underwent one of the stress tests, cardiac VCT with ATP test, invasive coronary angiography, or CT coronary angiography. Left ventricle (LV) myocardial perfusion was evaluated for hypoperfusion zones and the calculation of semi-quantitative indices: decrease of LV myocardial density, LV myocardial perfusion index, transmural perfusion coefficient, and our proposed new indicator - myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR).
RESULTS: The MPR index value in the hypoperfusion zones in patients with CAD and DM was 0.64 [0.62-0.66], in patients with CAD without diabetes 0.65 [0.63-0.66]; p=0.4; the value of the transmural perfusion coefficient in the areas of abnormal LV myocardial perfusion in patients with CAD and DM was 0.81 [0.80-0.86] versus 0.83 [0.80-0.85] in patients with CAD without DM (p=0.6). More hypoperfusion segments were observed in patients with CAD and DM (33.3%) compared to those without DM (14%; p=0.029). The MPR index in the hypoperfusion zones in patients with CAD with intact coronary arteries (CA) and DM was 0.56 [0.54-0.60] versus 0.55 [0.54-0.62] in patients with CAD with intact CA without DM; p=0.2.
CONCLUSION: In patients with CAD and type 2 DM, according to the VCT with ATP test, more foci hypoperfusion areas were detected, regardless of the severity of coronary artery involvement, compared with patients with CAD without DM, which may be due to the microangiopathy in the myocardium. The similarity of the MPR parameters in the hypoperfusion zones associated with hemodynamic stenosis of the CA and with intact CAs indicates the ischemic genesis of these zones.
