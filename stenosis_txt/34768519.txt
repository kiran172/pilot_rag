Title: Prevalence of Restless Legs Syndrome and its Symptoms among Patients with Spinal Disorders.

Abstract: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder that causes uncomfortable sensations in the legs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the symptoms of RLS in patients with spinal disorders and the impact of RLS on the clinical outcomes of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The records of 278 patients (age range 65-92 years) with spinal disorders who visited our outpatient clinic were reviewed. We used a survey to identify subjects with RLS based on the International RLS Study Group diagnostic criteria. We further recorded patient characteristics, surgical outcomes, sleeping time, mental health condition, and the occurrence of leg cramps. Thirty-two patients (11.5%) met the criteria for RLS. The prevalence of anxiety (46.9% vs. 26.6%, p = 0.023) and leg cramps (90.6% vs. 73.2%, p = 0.030) was higher in patients with RLS than in those without. RLS was present in 12.3% of LSS patients. The visual analog scale score for lower back pain before surgery and at the final follow-up was significantly higher in LSS patients with RLS than in those without. However, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, JOA score improvement ratio, and VAS score for leg numbness were not significantly different between the groups.
