Title: A Cadaveric Evaluation of Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) describes a pathologic state in which the subaortic region of the interventricular septum undergoes significant hypertrophy and fibrosis, resulting in septal bowing into the left ventricle. The reduced left ventricular chamber size and altered cardiac function impair diastolic filling, stroke volume, and cardiac output. This case report evaluates the cardiac tissue of a 36-year-old, formalin-embalmed cadaver affected by HOCM, with the goal of providing a comprehensive overview of the gross and pathologic findings associated with the condition. This donor's heart was found to be larger than average, weighing 510.1 g, which is 52% heavier than the predicted value of 335.6 g for a male of similar stature. The thickness of the interventricular septum, right ventricular free wall, and left ventricular free wall was comparable to other reports of HOCM. However, asymmetrical thickening of the left ventricular walls, which is characteristic of HOCM, was less prominent than expected. Histologic staining of the cadaveric tissue, with hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, and desmin, further bolstered the diagnosis. Importantly, this also showed that histologic examination of embalmed tissue is effective and diagnostic, even 11 months after embalming. The report herein demonstrates that morphologic and histologic analysis of cadaveric cardiac tissue is sufficient to support a diagnosis of HOCM. To the researchers' knowledge, this is the first case report evaluating HOCM in a cadaver donated for medical education.
