Title: Disparate trends of atherosclerotic plaque evolution in stroke patients under 18-month follow-up: a 3D whole-brain magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The trend of atherosclerotic plaque feature evolution is unclear in stroke patients with and without recurrence. We aimed to use three-dimensional whole-brain magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging to quantify the morphological changes of causative lesions during medical therapy in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease.
METHODS: Patients with acute ischemic stroke attributed to intracranial atherosclerotic disease were retrospectively enrolled if they underwent both baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging. The morphological features of the causative plaque, including plaque volume, peak normalized wall index, maximum wall thickness, degree of stenosis, pre-contrast plaque-wall contrast ratio, and post-contrast plaque enhancement ratio, were quantified and compared between the non-recurrent and recurrent groups (defined as the recurrence of a vascular event within 18 months of stroke).
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included in the final analysis. No significant differences were found in plaque features in the baseline scan between the non-recurrent (n = 22) and recurrent groups (n = 7). The changes in maximum wall thickness (-13.32% vs. 8.93%, P = 0.026), plaque-wall contrast ratio (-0.82% vs. 3.42%, P = 0.005) and plaque enhancement ratio (-11.03% vs. 9.75%, P = 0.019) were significantly different between the non-recurrent and recurrent groups. Univariable logistic regression showed that the increase in plaque-wall contrast ratio (odds ratio 3.22, 95% confidence interval 1.55-9.98, P = 0.003) was related to stroke recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Morphological changes of plaque features on magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging demonstrated distinct trends in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease patients with and without stroke recurrence.
