Title: Inflammatory Gene Expression in Neck Perivascular and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue in Men With Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: The inflammatory phenotype of neck adipose tissue (NAT) might reflect its involvement in the pathogenesis of carotid atherosclerosis. We investigated inflammatory gene expression in the subcutaneous and the perivascular (pericarotid) adipose tissue from patients with carotid stenosis (CS) undergoing endarterectomy and a control group of patients without significant carotid atherosclerosis undergoing thyroid surgery. Only male patients were included (n = 13 in each study group). Clinical and biochemical data along with serum leptin, adiponectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were collected. Adipose tissue samples were obtained from both the subcutaneous and pericarotid compartments. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure gene expression of macrophage markers and adipokines. The CS group had higher subcutaneous and pericarotid visfatin gene expression and higher pericarotid expression of MCP-1 and CD68 genes. The ratio between pericarotid CD206 and CD68 gene expression was similar between study groups. Adiponectin gene expression in both NAT compartments did not differ between groups, but it was negatively associated with body weight. These observations suggest that NAT, and especially the pericarotid compartment, express enhanced inflammatory properties in patients with CS, but the proportion of anti-inflammatory macrophages in advanced atherosclerosis seems to be maintained.
