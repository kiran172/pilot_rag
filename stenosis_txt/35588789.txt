Title: Long-term Follow-up and Success Rate of Ventral Inlay Buccal Mucosal Graft Urethroplasty for Female Urethral Stricture Disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term success of ventral inlay buccal-mucosal graft urethroplasty (Vi-BMGU) for female urethral strictures (FUS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained data on patients who underwent Vi-BMGU between May 2016 and January 2020 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. The primary outcome was the long-term success after 2 to 5 years of surgery. Patients were followed with American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score, uroflowmetry, and post-void residual (PVR) urine measurement. Failure (recurrence) was defined by an increase in the AUA symptoms score by 3 on subsequent follow-up visits and maximum flow rate (Qmax) <12 cc/s and inability to calibrate with an 18 Fr catheter.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included. The Median follow-up was 42 months (range: 24-64 months). The AUA symptom scores, Q<sub>max</sub>, and PVR, improved in all except 3 patients. The median AUA score fell from 27 (range 18-34) at diagnosis to 9 (range 6-24), at the last follow-up. Similarly, the median PVR values decreased from 138 ml (34-290) to 24 ml (19-360) and the mean Q<sub>max</sub> improved from 7.7 ± 2.2 ml/s to 22.6 ± 5 ml/s. None experienced urinary incontinence. There were 2 failures, 1 at 6 months and the other at 24 months. The overall success rate was 90.5 %. Success rates on life table analysis were 95%, 85%, 85%, 85%, and 85% after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years respectively.
CONCLUSION: The 95% success at 1 year and 85% sustained success at 2 to 5 years of follow-up establishes the long-term success of Vi-BMGU.
