Title: Japanese Lead EXtraction (J-LEX) registry: Annual report 2019.

Abstract: Along with the incremental cases of cardiac implantable electronic devices implantation or upgrade, the lead-related complications are also in rise year after year. The most common and serious lead-related complication is infection that needs a transvenous lead extraction (TLE) as the first-line therapy. TLE is also performed for abandoned leads in case of lead failure or device upgrade, and for lead-related trouble such as pain, vessel stenosis or occlusion, too many leads, tricuspid valve regurgitation, and difficulty of radiation therapy. This registration has been performed by the Japanese Heart Rhythm Society and started in July 2018. The first reported data of the Japanese Lead Extraction (J-LEX) from July 2018 to December 2019 were underestimated since the number of patients and hospitals increased gradually because of the approval process of each hospital's IRB. The TLE procedure was attempted to 1253 leads among 661 patients. Complete removal was achieved in 96.7% of the target leads and the clinical success was obtained in 98.9% of the patients. Perioperative complications were observed in 4.1% of the patients. The annual J-LEX report reflects a real-world TLE medicine in Japan and demonstrates that the clinical outcome is similar to former reports from high-volume centers in North America and European countries.
