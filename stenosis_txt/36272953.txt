Title: Dedicated Next Day Discharge Post Minimalist TAVI: The Tasmanian Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety, feasibility and independent predictors of next day discharge (NDD) in patients undergoing minimalist transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) in a real-world Australian population.
METHODS: This single centre study reviewed 135 consecutive patients who underwent minimalist transfemoral TAVI from June 2020 to February 2022. Baseline demographics, procedural characteristic and outcomes were obtained. All patients were assessed by the local protocol for NDD. Patients were then divided into two groups: those who achieved next day discharge (NDD) and those requiring >1 overnight hospital stay. Univariate, bivariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression modelling was used to identify the predictors of successful next day discharge.
RESULTS: The mean age of the cohort was 82.9±5.7 years with 62.3% patients male, the average STS score was 4.1±2.4. All 135 patients underwent a successful transfemoral TAVI procedure, with 131 (97%) receiving a balloon-expandable valve. Ninety-seven (97) (71.9%) patients achieved NDD. Thirty (30)-day outcomes were excellent with a 30-day mortality of 0.7%, transient ischaemic attack/cardiovascular accident (TIA/CVA) 1.5%, major vascular complication 1.5% and 11.4% need for permanent pacemaker (PPM). In patients not achieving NDD, the average length of stay (LOS) was 3.0 days. Baseline characteristics demonstrated pre-existing first degree atrioventricular (AV) block and right bundle branch block (RBBB) as statistically significant negative predictors of NDD on univariate analysis. Next day discharge was achievable in only 50% of patients who suffered any minor or major procedural complication (15/30). Stepwise multivariate logistic regression modelling demonstrated female gender (OR 3.094, 95% CI 1.141-8.391, p=0.026), smaller aortic valve area (AVA) (OR 48.265, 95% CI 2.269-102.6, p=0.013), the presence of diabetes mellitus (OR 0.594, 95% CI 0.356-0.991, p=0.046) and a longer procedure time (OR 0.960, 95% CI 0.935-0.986, p=0.002) as statistically significant negative predictors of NDD. In addition, there was no difference in 30-day readmission rates between the NDD and non-NDD cohort (7.2% vs 10.5%, p=0.386).
CONCLUSION: Next day discharge is safe and feasible in almost three quarters of patients undergoing minimalist TAVI for severe AS in a predominantly balloon expandable valve cohort, with a very low rate of 30-day readmission. NDD provides advantages for hospital efficiency and improved cost-effectiveness. Female gender, smaller AVA, the presence of diabetes mellitus and a longer procedure time were independent negative predictors of successful NDD.
