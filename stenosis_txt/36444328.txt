Title: Lipoprotein(a) and Cardiovascular Disease in Chinese Population: A Beijing Heart Society Expert Scientific Statement.

Abstract: Elevated concentration of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and so on. Emerging data suggest that Lp(a) contributes to the increased risk for cardiovascular events even in the setting of effective reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Nevertheless, puzzling issues exist covering potential genetic factors, Lp(a) assay, possible individuals for analysis, a cutoff point of increased risk, and clinical interventions. In the Chinese population, Lp(a) exhibited a distinctive prevalence and regulated various cardiovascular diseases in specific ways. Hence, it is valuable to clarify the role of Lp(a) in cardiovascular diseases and explore prevention and control measures for the increase in Lp(a) prevalence in the Chinese population. This Beijing Heart Society experts' scientificÂ statement will present the detailed knowledge concerning Lp(a)-related studies combined with Chinese population observations to provide the key points of reference.
