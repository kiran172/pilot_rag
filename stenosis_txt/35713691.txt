Title: Carotid web: the challenging diagnosis of an under-recognized entity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Determining the cause of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for patient management, particularly for preventing future stroke. In recent years, carotid web (CW), a non-atherosclerotic disorder of the carotid wall, has been found to be an underestimated source of cerebral emboli.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to analyze the clinical, radiological, and pathological findings, along with the treatments performed in patients with CW and ipsilateral ischemic events.
METHODS: Patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and ipsilateral CW were prospectively included from January 2019 to December 2021.
RESULTS: Nine patients were enrolled. The median age was 55 (43-62) years, with a female-to-male ratio of 3.5:1. Of the total, seven patients (78%) consulted for recurrent ipsilateral ischemic events. Despite medical treatment, 44% of the patients experienced new episodes. Computed tomographic angiography was suggestive of CW in all cases in which it was performed. The interval between the first ischemic event and diagnosis of CW was of 13 (6-68) months. After ruling out any other possible etiology, every patient underwent carotid revascularization, one underwent stenting and eight underwent carotidectomy. No severe or long-term complications were noted. Histological studies confirmed the diagnosis of CW. There were no recurrences after carotid revascularization during a follow-up of 24 (13-35) months.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of CW and differentiating it from atheroma plaques is essential, as medical management seems to be insufficient in many cases. Revascularization, which has been shown to be safe and effective, might be the best treatment modality.
