Title: Economic burden related to fistulas or strictures among commercially insured patients with Crohn's disease in the United States.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, progressive, immune-mediated gastrointestinal condition that can lead to fistulizing or stricturing complications. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the burden of illness related to fistulas and/or strictures in patients with CD. METHODS: Using the Optum Research Database from October 2015 to December 2019, patients with CD were classified according to 1 of 3 condition cohorts: CD with fistula (CD-F), CD with stricture (CD-S), or CD with fistula and stricture (CD-FS). Each cohort was matched to a nonfistula, nonstricture CD cohort. Postdiagnosis per patient per year (PPPY) costs and health care resource utilization were assessed, accounting for variable lengths of follow-up periods. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to estimate the adjusted mean costs in each cohort. RESULTS: The CD-F, CD-S, and CD-FS cohorts included 1,317; 4,650; and 894 patients, respectively. The mean age of patients within the CD-S and their comparator cohorts was higher than in the CD-F or CD-FS cohorts (59.9 vs 49.5 vs 49.6 years). At baseline, cardiovascular disease was the most common comorbidity across all condition and comparator cohorts. Condition cohorts had 2-4 times more inpatient visits, 5-8 times more surgical visits, and 2-3 times more endoscopies PPPY than comparator cohorts. Compared with their respective comparator cohort, patients in the 3 condition cohorts had higher medication, medical, and total health care costs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a significant economic burden related to fistulas and/or strictures among patients with CD, highlighting the importance of prevention, early recognition, and appropriate management of CD-related complications. DISCLOSURES: Yanni Fan, Ling Zhang, Jennifer S Thompson, and Kimberly G Brodovicz are employees of Boehringer Ingelheim. Rhonda L Bohn, Monik C Jim√©nez, and Stephani Gray (Bohn Epidemiology, LLC) are paid consultants to Boehringer Ingelheim. Gil Y Melmed reports receiving grants from Pfizer; consulting fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, AbbVie, Arena, BMS, Celgene, Entasis, Ferring Lilly, Fresenius Kabi, Medtronic, Samsung Bioepis, Janssen, Takeda, Pfizer, Prometheus Labs, and TechLab. We conducted a retrospective study using administrative claims data from the Optum Research Database, a database of a commercially insured population in the United States. All patient data were anonymized and deidentified; therefore, informed consent was not necessary. Restrictions apply to the availability of these data because of a contract between Optum and Boehringer Ingelheim, and data are thus unavailable to the public.
