Title: Endoscopic transstomal stent insertion: a novel approach for a stenosed stoma in a challenging patient.

Abstract: Transstomal stent deployment to maintain the patency of stoma in a challenging patient who developed stoma stenosis, is a minimal invasive, novel technique. This is a new and alternative approach in management of stoma stenosis in a difficult case using a biodegradable stent for end colostomy.
