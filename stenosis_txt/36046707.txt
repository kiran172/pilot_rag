Title: Management of traumatic sacral spondyloptosis: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Grade V spondylolisthesis, or spondyloptosis, is a complication of high-energy trauma that is most commonly reported at the lumbosacral junction. Sacral intersegmental spondyloptosis is extremely rare. The authors present a case of spondyloptosis of S1 on S2 with a comminuted fracture of S2 and complex fractures of the L4 and L5 transverse processes, resulting in severe stenosis of the lumbosacral nerve roots.
OBSERVATIONS: The patient was a 70-year-old woman with a history of a fall 3 weeks prior and progressive L5 and S1 radiculopathy. Instrumentation and fusion were undertaken, extending from L3 to the pelvis because degenerative stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 was also found. Reduction was achieved, leading to diminished pain and partial resolution of weakness.
LESSONS: Traumatic sacral spondyloptosis adds a degree of difficulty to reduction, fixation, and fusion. The technique presented herein achieved sagittal realignment via a distraction maneuver of S1-2 in which rods were attached to bilateral dual S2 alar-iliac screws with reduction screws placed at S1, ultimately pulling L5 and S1 up to the rod for fixation.
