Title: Factors involved in the success and failure of endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy from our experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Chronic dacryocystitis is the condition secondary to permanent lacrimonasal duct stenosis (LNDS) that generates epiphora and recurrent conjunctivitis. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (EDCR) is a more natural route than the external route and offers higher success rates than the laser technique. We value this centre's experience in this procedure.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out in our centre of the medical records of adult patients undergoing EDCR due to LNDS between 1995 and 2019. The minimum follow-up period required after surgery was 6 months.
RESULTS: Over 297 months, 167 EDCR procedures were performed on 156 patients, with an average age of 65.7 ± 11.6 years and a male/female ratio of 1/1.98. The functional improvement was 86%, with an anatomical success rate of 87%. Lack of clinical improvement statistically significantly correlated with the age of the patient and the time since onset of the LNDS, the presence of concomitant systemic (especially diabetes mellitus) or ophthalmological disease, the intraoperative finding of a thickened tear sac and absence of drainage of the tear sac when marsupialised. Longer-term stent carriers in the rhinostomy had poorer outcomes. There were no postoperative complications of interest.
CONCLUSIONS: EDCR is an effective and safe technique, based on stable anatomical references. Failure rate seems to be multifactorial and should be considered in older, multipathological patients, with a long duration of the condition.
