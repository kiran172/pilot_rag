Title: Pericardial fat versus BMI in the assessment of coronary atherosclerotic burden in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: AIMS: To investigate the association of obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) versus pericardial fat volume (PFV) measured by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) with coronary atherosclerotic markers (coronary artery calcium score (CAC), coronary stenosis severity and coronary plaque presence) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
METHODS: Among 496 patients with suspected coronary artery disease who underwent 64-slice MDCT angiography to exclude occlusive coronary artery disease, 102 patients with DM were enrolled in the present study.
RESULTS: PFV showed a significant association with CAC (r = 0.2, P = 0.01) and significant coronary artery stenosis [PFV median (IQR) = 75 (51-136) in patients with coronary stenosis < 50% versus PFV median (IQR) = 113 (68-140) in patients with coronary stenosis ≥ 50%, P = 0.01] while there was no significant association of PFV with coronary plaque presence (PFV median (IQR) = 84 (56-140) in patients without plaque versus PFV median (IQR) = 109 (70-136) in patients with plaque presence, P = 0.4). The association between PFV with CAC persisted after adjustment for conventional cardiac risk factors. BMI showed no significant association with CAC, coronary stenosis severity and coronary plaque presence (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PFV was independently associated with CAC in diabetic patients. PFV, rather than obesity measured by BMI, could be used as an imaging biomarker for assessing coronary atherosclerotic burden in patients with DM.
