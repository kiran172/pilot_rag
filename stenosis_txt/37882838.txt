Title: Leaving behind a diseased small bowel during surgery for Crohn's disease: Long-term outcomes.

Abstract: PURPOSES: Stricture is a common complication of Crohn's disease (CD) and may be treated with bowel-sparing procedures. Our study analyzed what happens in terms of intestinal and systemic inflammation when the diseased bowel is left behind following surgery.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 42 consecutive patients who underwent strictureplasty (alone or with resection) for stricturing CD. Control patients who underwent complete diseased bowel resection were identified and propensity score-matched for the sex, age, and history of abdominal surgery. Biohumoral values were collected at follow-up examinations at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before and after strictureplasty in 19 patients.
RESULTS: In the strictureplasty group, fecal calprotectin levels were decreased at 12 months (p = 0.03), whereas in the resectiongroup, they were decreased at 6 months (p = 0.02). On MRI, the ADC [apparent diffusion coefficient] (p < 0.001), wall thickness (p = 0.046) and Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) (p < 0.001) and Clermont (p < 0.001) scores were improved after strictureplasty. Surgical recurrence was more frequent in the strictureplasty group than in the resection group (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study showed that even if the diseased bowel was left behind after surgery, the intestinal inflammatory activity still decreased. However, the permanence of the diseased bowel still increased the risk of reoperation, probably because of the fibrotic nature of the stenosis and the multifocality of CD.
