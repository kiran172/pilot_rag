Title: Balloon Valvuloplasty in Congenital Critical Aortic Valve Stenosis in Neonates and Infants: A Rescue Procedure for the Left Ventricle.

Abstract: Congenital critical aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a life-threatening disease requiring urgent treatment. First-line therapy is still controversial. The aim of our study was (1) to analyze retrospectively the patients of our institution who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) due to CAVS and (2) describe the techniques for improved feasibility of intervention using microcatheters and retrieval loops. Twelve patients underwent 23 BAVs: 1 BAV was performed in 3 patients, 2 BAVs were performed in 7 patients, and 3 BAVs were performed in 2 patients. The peak trans-valvular pressure gradient (Δp) and left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF) improved significantly in the first two interventions. In the first BAV, Δp decreased from 73.7 ± 34.5 mmHg to 39.8 ± 11.9 mmHg (p = 0.003), and the LVSF improved from 22.3 ± 13.5% to 31.6 ± 10.2% (p = 0.001). In the second BAV, Δp decreased from 73.2 ± 33.3 mmHg to 35.0 ± 20.2 mmHg (p &lt; 0.001), and the LVSF increased from 26.7 ± 9.6% to 33.3 ± 7.4% (p = 0.004). Cardiac surgery during the neonatal period was avoided for all children. The median time to valve surgery was 5.75 years. Few complications occurred, namely mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, one remediable air embolism, and one intimal injury to the ascending aorta. We conclude that BAV is a successful emergency treatment for CAVS, resulting in left ventricular relief, clinical stabilization, and a time gain until cardiac surgery.
