Title: [Complex right cervical aortic arch repair: less is more].

Abstract: Cervical aortic arch is a rare malformation that often has anatomical abnormalities of the supra-aortic trunks and may also be associated with aortic stenosis, aneurysms, or cardiac malformations. To correct them, symptomatic patients undergo surgery, which usually consists of a prosthetic graft repair, aortoplasty patch, or an end-to-end anastomosis. In addition, circulatory arrest and deep hypothermia are often required, as in aortic arch surgery. We report the case of a 13-year-old patient who underwent correction of a right cervical aortic arch stenosis with a post-stenotic aneurysm between the origin of the right carotid artery and the right subclavian artery. The anatomy of the aortic branches was abnormal. The surgical procedure consisted of an extensive resection with direct end-to-end anastomosis, without the use of a prosthetic graft, using moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and without circulatory arrest.
