Title: Atheromatosis of the brain-supplying arteries: Circle of Willis, basilar, vertebral and their branches.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Atherosclerotic plaques in the brain-supplying arteries are slowly-developing alterations of vascular structures that can lead to neurological impairment due to stenosis and insufficient oxygenation of eloquent brain areas. The aim of this study is to provide detailed demographic information related to the incidence of atherosclerotic plaques in the cerebral arteries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight circles of Willis (21 men, 21 women, mean age: 70.26, six samples unknown) were macroscopically analyzed for length, diameter, and presence of atherosclerotic plaques. Statistical analysis was used to identify potential differences in the locations and frequencies of atherosclerotic plaques in relation to age and sex.
RESULTS: The study sample revealed 261 atherosclerotic plaques. The key findings were significant correlations between plaque development and age and between plaque location and age; however, there was no significant sex difference.
CONCLUSION: The upper and lower branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were novel locations predisposing to plaque development. A cut-off value at 60 years revealed a significant difference in plaque development and distribution. There were no significant sex differences in the occurrence of atherosclerotic plaques.
