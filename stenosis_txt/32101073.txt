Title: Recent advances in devices for minimally invasive aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Introduction: Aortic valve disease is the most common valvular heart disease. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the treatment of choice for aortic valve stenosis (AS). Multiple options have been developed to treat AS, corresponding to the steadily growing AVR case volume. The increased adoption of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (mini-AVR) techniques, despite being technically challenging, is reflected in its advantageous outcomes. Continuous device development can add a critical value to the technical expertise and advance the proficiency of mini-AVR.Areas covered: The literature related to Mini-AVR is reviewed for the current state-of-the-art approach to treating valvular diseases. The latest technologies to treat AS were reviewed and compared with outcomes. A brief expert review of the current state of structural heart and valvular surgery programs is discussed to address collaboration and future challenges.Expert commentary: The treatment of aortic valve disease has evolved in a manner which cardiac surgeons and cardiologists would have never imagined. Advances in surgical techniques and increased training courses have improved adoption of minimally invasive aortic valve procedures. In addition, the recent development of facilitating devices has significantly improved the exposure necessary to perform an expeditious and safe operation.
