Title: Incidence and risk factors of spinal cord stimulation for persistent or recurrent pain after lumbar spine surgery: a population-based study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aims to elucidate the incidence of and independent risk factors for spinal cord stimulator implantations for patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery.
METHODS: The PERFormance, Effectiveness, and Cost of Treatment (PERFECT) episodes database, which was established for selected diseases and procedures in Finland, includes all patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery for degenerative spine conditions or spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in Finland from 1986 to 2018. The data on age, sex, hospital diagnoses, surgical procedures, and causes of death were imported from the Finnish national registers into the PERFECT database.
RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2018, 157,824 patients had their first lumbar spine procedure and for 1769 (1.1%) of them, a subsequent SCS procedure was observed during the follow-up. The cumulative incidence of SCS for persistent or recurrent pain after lumbar disk herniation, spinal stenosis, degenerative disk disease, and spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis surgery at 15 years was 1.2%, 1.0%, 2.7%, and 2.6% respectively. At 15 years, the cumulative incidence of SCS for persistent or recurrent pain after lumbar spine surgery after five or more lumbar spinal operations was 11.9%.
CONCLUSION: Repeated surgery was the most prominent significant risk factor for SCS for persistent or recurrent pain after lumbar spine surgery. The risk of SCS for persistent or recurrent pain after lumbar spine surgery increases significantly along with the number of lumbar spine procedures. When considering repeated lumbar spine surgery, careful evaluation of treatment options should take place to ensure good patient outcomes.
