Title: Efficacy and safety of recanalization with transseptal needle for chronic total occlusion of the brachiocephalic vein in hemodialysis patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Whilst there are effective techniques for the recanalization of central venous occlusions, recanalization of chronic total occlusions remains particularly challenging. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recanalization using a transseptal needle in chronic total occlusions of the right brachiocephalic vein (RBV) in long-term hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study, maintenance hemodialysis patients with chronic total occlusion of the RBV were enrolled between February 2017 to March 2019 from West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Refractory lesions were defined as complete vascular occlusions with failed recanalization using conventional techniques. Occlusions were approached using a transseptal needle to penetrate which offers an alternative strategy with firm support force. Patient data, treatment outcomes and patency rates were collected and analyzed to assess the safety and efficacy of the technique.
RESULTS: A total of 16 eligible patients were analyzed. The operation was successful in 13 of the 16 patients and the success rate was 81.25% (13/16). Twelve patients underwent percutaneous balloon dilatation and stent implantation after sharp recanalization, whilst one patient underwent balloon dilatation only. We achieved procedural success in 13 patients without surgical complications, and all of the patients were discharged in a stable condition. The primary patency rates at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery were 100%, 84.6% and 69.2%, respectively. The primary assisted patency rates were 100%, 84.6% and 76.9%, respectively, and the secondary patency rates were 100%, 84.6% and 76.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that recanalization of chronic total occlusions to the RBV using a transseptal needle is a safe and effective method after traditional guide wire and catheter techniques fail. It was also found that additional techniques are needed for recanalization in patients with RBV occlusion combined with proximal stenosis or occlusion of the right subclavian vein.
