Title: Patients with achondroplasia have increased risk of 90-day adverse events following laminectomy: A matched comparison using a national database.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Performing laminectomies in patients with achondroplasia-a common skeletal dysplasia-can present unique challenges. There are a limited number of studies that have reported on the adverse effects of laminectomies in patients with achondroplasia. To compare the 90-day postoperative adverse events following laminectomy in patients with and without achondroplasia.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the 2010-2020 PearlDiver Mariner 91 administrative database was used to identify patients who underwent thoracic, thoracolumbar, or lumbar laminectomy. Patients with achondroplasia were matched 1:4 to patients without achondroplasia based on age, sex, insurance, and ECI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses assessed and compared 90-day adverse events. Odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values were reported with significance set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: A multivariate analysis revealed that when laminectomy was performed, patients with achondroplasia were 2.82 times more likely to have 90-day AE compared to those without achondroplasia (p < 0.001). When comparing individual subtypes of adverse events, patients with achondroplasia were found to have significantly greater odds of a transfusion (OR 6.40, p < 0.001), UTI (OR 3.79, p < 0.001), disruption of wound (OR 3.71, p < 0.001), and hematoma (OR 2.94, p = 0.032). Pneumonia, cardiac arrest, AKI, other perioperative events, durotomy, and VTE were not significantly different between the two cohorts.
CONCLUSION: This study uses one of the largest cohorts to compare patients with and without achondroplasia undergoing laminectomy. Patients with achondroplasia were found to have a significantly greater risk of 90-day adverse events following laminectomy compared to their matched cohort of patients without achondroplasia.
