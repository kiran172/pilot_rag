Title: Evaluation of Acquired Thrombocytopenia According to the Balloon-Expandable Versus Self-Expandable Valves in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: In patients with severe aortic stenosis, the data about the incidence of acquired thrombocytopenia according to the use of balloon-expandable or self-expandable valves are limited. We investigated the relationship between the post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) thrombocytopenia and the balloon-expandable or self-expandable valves. A total of 127 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR were retrospectively analyzed. Among the study population, 61 (48%) patients underwent TAVR with the balloon-expandable valve and the 66 (52%) patients with the self-expandable valve. Procedural success did not differ between the groups (P = .575). The access site complications and in-hospital mortality were the same across the groups (P = .225 and P = .466). However, paravalvular (PV) leaks were significantly higher in the self-expandable valve group (P = .007). Among all, 65 patients experienced thrombocytopenia, which was more frequent in the self-expandable valve group (63.6 vs 37.7%, P = .005). In multivariate analyses, admission platelet count, PV leak, and self-expandable valve deployment were the predictors of thrombocytopenia (P = .001, P = .002, and P = .021, respectively). The present study showed a higher incidence of acquired thrombocytopenia in the self-expandable valve group. Although the procedural success was similar between the groups, postprocedural PV leaks were more common in the self-expandable valve group.
