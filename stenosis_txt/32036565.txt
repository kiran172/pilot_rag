Title: Pulmonary venous obstruction after extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection in right atrial isomerism.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with functional single ventricle and right atrial isomerism (RAI) often have multiform cardiac pulmonary venous (PV) connection, which could be a risk factor for pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO) after extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (EC-TCPC) owing to compression of the conduit.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anatomical risk factors for PVO after EC-TCPC in RAI.
METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with RAI without extracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection were enrolled. No patients had PVO before EC-TCPC. A total of 14 and 15 patients had PV orifices ipsilateral and contralateral to the extracardiac conduit, respectively. The former 14 patients were assigned to two groups based on development of PVO after EC-TCPC (groups O and N). The pre- and post-operative cardiac morphologies and their relationship with the conduit were compared.
RESULTS: After the EC-TCPC, the pressure gradients between the atrium and the PV were 5.0 ± 2.5 and 0.44 ± 0.2 mmHg in groups O and N, respectively (p < 0.01); however, the pressure gradients in the left and right PVs were not significantly different, suggesting stenosis of the common PV orifice. The ratio of the horizontal distance from the vertebrae to the PV orifice and to the lateral edge of the atrium was significantly higher (0.38 ± 0.2 vs. 0.17 ± 0.1; p = 0.04) and the orifice was smaller (8.9 ± 2.0 vs. 15 ± 4.7 mm; p < 0.01) in group O than in group N.
CONCLUSION: In cases with ipsilateral locations of the conduit and PV orifice, small size and more lateral location of the PV orifice may be preoperative risk factors for development of PVO.
