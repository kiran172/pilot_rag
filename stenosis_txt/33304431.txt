Title: Immediate postoperative inferior vena cava stenting to improve hepatic venous outflow following orthotopic liver transplantation.

Abstract: Orthotopic liver transplantation can be a surgically complex undertaking, with hepatic venous outflow obstruction occurring at a rate of 1%-6% due to inferior vena cava (IVC) torsion, compression, or anastomotic stenosis. In this report, we present 2 cases of immediate postoperative hepatic venous outflow obstruction in the setting of Budd-Chiari syndrome successfully treated with immediate IVC stenting. Although IVC stenting has been reported for management of long-term IVC anastomotic stenosis after orthotopic liver transplantation, use of stenting to address immediate postoperative caval outflow obstruction is less commonly described. We describe the potential utility of immediate stenting to improve outflow from the transplanted liver and highlight the value of this approach in addressing early postsurgical IVC pathology.
