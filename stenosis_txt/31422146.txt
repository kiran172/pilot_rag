Title: Prediction of Coronary Revascularization in Stable Angina: Comparison of FFR<sub>CT</sub> With CMR Stress Perfusion Imaging.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare head-to-head fractional flow reserve (FFR) derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) stress perfusion imaging for prediction of standard-of-care-guided coronary revascularization in patients with stable chest pain and obstructive coronary artery disease by coronary CTA.
BACKGROUND: FFR<sub>CT</sub> is a novel modality for noninvasive functional testing. The clinical utility of FFR<sub>CT</sub> compared to CMR stress perfusion imaging in symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease is unknown.
METHODS: Prospective study of patients (n = 110) with stable angina pectoris and 1 or more coronary stenosis ≥50% by coronary CTA. All patients underwent invasive coronary angiography. Revascularization was FFR-guided in stenoses ranging from 30% to 90%. FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤0.80 in 1 or more coronary artery or a reversible perfusion defect (≥2 segments) by CMR categorized patients with ischemia. FFR<sub>CT</sub> and CMR were analyzed by core laboratories blinded for patient management.
RESULTS: A total of 38 patients (35%) underwent revascularization. Per-patient diagnostic performance for identifying standard-of-care-guided revascularization, (95% confidence interval) yielded a sensitivity of 97% (86% to 100%) for FFR<sub>CT</sub> versus 47% (31% to 64%) for CMR, p &lt; 0.001; corresponding specificity was 42% (30% to 54%) versus 88% (78% to 94%), p &lt; 0.001; negative predictive value of 97% (91% to 100%) versus 76% (67% to 85%), p &lt; 0.05; positive predictive value of 47% (36% to 58%) versus 67% (49% to 84%), p &lt; 0.05; and accuracy of 61% (51% to 70%) versus 74% (64% to 82%), p &gt; 0.05, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stable chest pain referred to invasive coronary angiography based on coronary CTA, FFR<sub>CT</sub> and CMR yielded similar overall diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity for prediction of revascularization was highest for FFR<sub>CT,</sub> whereas specificity was highest for CMR.
