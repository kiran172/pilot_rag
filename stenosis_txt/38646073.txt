Title: Infolding of Evolut PRO+ during transcatheter aortic valve implantation and bailout by post-balloon dilation: A case report.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: An 89-year-old man with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation due to old age and a history of coronary artery bypass grafting. Computed tomography showed a tricuspid aortic valve and severe calcification at the aortic valve annulus, with a perimeter of 88.7 mm. The 34-mm Evolut PRO+ (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was selected. After balloon aortic valvuloplasty, deployment of the Evolut PRO+ was attempted, but significant expansion failure was observed. Upon retraction and removal of the Evolut PRO+ from the body, frame deformation was observed. A new Evolut PRO+ was tried again, but a similar finding was noted as a magatama-like infolding on transesophageal echocardiography. Fortunately, the patient's hemodynamics were relatively stable. Post-dilation was performed using a 25 mm Z-MED II (NuMED, Inc., Montreal, Canada) for reshaping.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: In self-expanding transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs), bending of the TAV frame is widely known as one of the key problems. However, this is rare and infrequently encountered. In this case, TAV frame infolding occurred repeatedly, and the morphology of the infolding was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we report that some TAVs can be reshaped by post-dilation.
