Title: Delayed subclavian vein stent perforation causing adjacent arterial pseudoaneurysm formation in a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Abstract: Stenting is necessary when vascular patency is not adequately achieved with angioplasty alone. Common causes of pseudoaneurysms are iatrogenic and traumatic. We describe a case of a perforated left subclavian vein Gianturco stent causing a pseudoaneurysm of the left common carotid artery in a patient with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, detected 8 years after stent insertion.
