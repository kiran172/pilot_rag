Title: Adverse Cardiovascular Events Associated With Kopi Jantan.

Abstract: Energy drinks (EDs) are widely accessible worldwide. In Malaysia, it is common for EDs to be premixed with sexual stimulants. ED consumption has been shown to have an association with cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and coronary vasospasm. In addition to this, EDs are associated with arrhythmias, which significantly prolong the QTc interval. Myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA) is defined as a patient presenting with myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary artery disease or â‰¤50% stenosis. It is a challenging and complex pathophysiology compared to obstructive coronary artery disease. MINOCA is more frequently associated with younger patients and women. Here, we report two cases related to a Malaysian local energy drink Kopi Jantan, which presented with atrial flutter and MINOCA.
