Title: Double Stenting in 19-Year-Old Patient With Tetralogy of Fallot With Prior Fractured Stent.

Abstract: A 19-year-old patient with tetralogy of Fallot was referred to the cath lab because of persistent desaturation and a fractured right ventricular outflow tract stent. Restenting was done because the infundibular stenosis was very tight. Total repair was completed 1Â week after the procedure, and at that time, the patient's hemodynamics had greatly improved. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
