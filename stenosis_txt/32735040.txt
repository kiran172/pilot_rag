Title: Nasolacrimal duct stenosis-Surgery with a novel robotic endoscope positioning system.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Distal nasolacrimal duct stenosis is usually treated by head and neck surgeons with transnasal endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). The presented clinical study discusses advantages and drawbacks of a robot-assisted endoscope positioning system, which allows for hands-free visualization of the surgical field.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two patients were treated by surgical DCR. The endoscopic positioning system (MedineeringÂ® ) features a mechatronic holding arm with four segments and seven degrees of freedom. It is driven by using a foot pedal.
RESULTS: Visualization and instrumentation of the surgical field including the relevant anatomical landmarks were feasible. The endoscope position could be controlled with sufficient precision. The surgeon was able to maintain bimanual instrumentation.
CONCLUSION: The endoscope positioning system allows for two-handed surgery, which facilitates the essential steps of the surgical procedure. If the benefit of the system is sufficient for the use in clinical routine, it has to be evaluated in repeated applications.
