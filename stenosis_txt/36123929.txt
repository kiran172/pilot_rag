Title: Effects of carotid artery stenting on cognitive impairment in patients with severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: The effect of carotid artery stenting and medication on improvement of cognitive function in patients with severe symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is unknown. To investigate the effect of stenting compared with medication alone for severe carotid atherosclerotic stenosis on cognitive impairment. Patients with carotid stenosis and cognitive impairment were prospectively randomly divided into 2 groups of stenting or medication alone. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), Mini-Mental State Examination, and Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (BI). Continuous data in normal distribution were tested with the t-test but with the Mann-Whitney U test if not in normal distribution. Categorical data were presented as frequency and percentages and tested with the Fisher exact test. A P value < .05 was regarded as statistical significant. Carotid artery stenting was successfully performed in all patients (100%) in the stenting group. Compared with before treatment, the Mini-Mental State Examination, MoCA and BI scores at 6 months in the medication alone group and at 1, 3, and 6 months in the stenting group were significantly (P < .005) improved. The stenting group had significantly (P < .05) better scores than the medication alone group at the same time. At 6-month follow-up, the visuospatial/executive functions (3.69 ± 1.42 vs 2.42 ± 1.23), attention (5.24 ± 1.52 vs 3.63 ± 1.47), and language (2.64 ± 0.71 vs 1.96 ± 0.69) were significantly (P < .05) improved in the stenting group compared with the medication alone group. Carotid artery stenting may significantly improve cognitive impairment and neurological function compared with medication alone in patients with severe carotid atherosclerotic stenosis concurrent with cognitive impairment.
