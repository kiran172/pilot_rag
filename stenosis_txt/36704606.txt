Title: Simultaneous Kissing Balloon Stenting Technique in Management of Two Branches of Right Renal Artery Bifurcation: A Case Report.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia are the commonest types of diseases associated with renovascular hypertension, with atherosclerosis accounting for 70%-80% of all cases and the latter accounting for 10% of cases. We report a case of a 65-year-old asian male with stenosis of the right renal artery with early bifurcation treated by percutaneous balloon dilation and simultaneous kissing balloon stenting technique.
