Title: A comparison of sciatica in young subjects and elderly person.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sciatica is a common symptom for many people with degenerative lumbar spine diseases. It is by far the most common symptom of disc herniation. However, disc herniation is not the only cause of sciatica. Other degenerative lumbar spine diseases can provoke Sciatica. To date, few studies have analysed the cause of sciatica in particularly in elderly patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed retrospectively records of patients aged between 35 and 55 (first group) and between 65 and 85 (second group) visited in our departments for sciatica between December 2009 and November 2018.
RESULTS: In elderly patients, disc herniation from upper levels (L2-L3 and L3-L4) is more common than younger people. Sciatica as a result of exclusive disc herniation reduces with age. Foramen stenosis produces sciatica in elderly patients more than twice as high in younger patients. Statistically, more patients needed to surgery in elderly patients in comparison with younger population.
CONCLUSION: Sciatica in elderly patients takes a different clinical aspect in comparison with younger population. The clinical picture associates pain less severe but more persistent, more resistant to treatment. It is caused in less than 50% by disc herniation.
