Title: Endovascular Treatment of Cerebral Venous Sinus Stenosis Based on Hemodynamic Assessment Using Pressure Wire.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A pressure wire offers a dynamic tool to assist in the measurement of the pressure gradient and assessment of the functional significance of stenosis. The author presents a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who was diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS). Venography accompanied by pressure measurement was used to guide the stent placement for CVSS.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of headache and neckache lasting for 7 weeks, with an 8-day history of binocular diplopia and blurred vision. Magnetic resonance venography and digital subtraction angiography showed a filling defect in the right transverse sinus. A pressure wire was used before endovascular treatment and showed that the pressure gradient was 10 mm Hg, which meets the surgical indication. After a stent was placed, no pressure gradient was recorded by the pressure wire.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report about using a pressure wire for CVSS. The finding suggests that use of a pressure wire can be a new approach in the diagnosis and treatment of CVSS.
