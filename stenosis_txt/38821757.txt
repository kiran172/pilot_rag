Title: Relationship between pericoronary fat-attenuation values quantified by coronary computed tomography angiography and coronary artery disease severity.

Abstract: AIM: To explore the relationship between pericoronary fat-attenuation index (FAI) values and coronary artery disease (CAD) severity measured using coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively included 428 patients with CAD who were eligible and underwent CCTA at our hospital. CAD severity on CCTA images including obstructive stenosis and extensive lesions, and segment stenosis and involvement score (SSS, SIS), and CAD-RADS classification were assessed. FAI values for left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX) branches, and right coronary artery (RCA) were quantified using fully automated software. The relationship between FAI values and CAD severity was assessed using univariate and multivariate regression models.
RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that sex and current smoking were associated with elevated FAI<sub>LAD</sub> and FAI<sub>LCX</sub> values (all P&lt;0.05), whereas CAD severity was not relevant (all P&gt;0.05). Not only clinical factors such as sex, current smoking, and hypertension were associated with elevated FAI<sub>RCA</sub>, but also indicators to assess CAD severity including obstructive stenosis, SIS, and SSS were related to it (all P&lt;0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that after correcting for the effects of other conventional cardiovascular risk factors and CCTA imaging features, current smoking was an independent risk factor for elevated FAI values (odds ratio [OR] = 0.569, 0.458, and 0.517; all P&lt;0.05), whereas that SSS (OR=1.041, P=0.027) for elevated FAI<sub>RCA</sub> values.
CONCLUSION: Following correction for conventional cardiovascular risk factors and imaging characteristics, current smoking was an independent clinical risk factor for elevated FAI values, and SSS was an independent risk factor for elevated FAI<sub>RCA</sub> values.
