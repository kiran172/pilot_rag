Title: Paclitaxel-coated balloon catheter for benign esophageal stenosis in a rabbit model.

Abstract: Most patients with benign esophageal stenosis require multiple or even continuous balloon dilation treatments to achieve symptom relief. In this study, eighteen rabbits were used to establish an esophageal benign stenosis model and were divided into a control group (n = 6), a balloon group (n = 6) and a PTX-coated balloon group (n = 6) to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of paclitaxel (PTX)-coated balloons for the rabbit esophageal benign stenosis model. The weight and esophageal diameter were recorded every 2 weeks until 8 weeks post-surgery. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed for pathological analysis. Four weeks post-operation, there was a significant difference in weight between the control group and the balloon group (p = 0.01) and between the control group and the PTX balloon group (p = 0.01). There was a significant difference in the esophageal diameter between the balloon group and the PTX balloon group at 8 weeks post-operation (p = 0.02). Four weeks post-operation, the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration in the PTX balloon group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p = 0.002) and balloon group (p = 0.001). The degree of collagen deposition in the PTX balloon group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p = 0.002) and balloon group (p = 0.03). Eight weeks post-operation, the percentage of cells positive for TGF-β (p < 0.001), the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration (p = 0.02) and the degree of collagen deposition (p = 0.02) in the PTX balloon group were significantly lower than those in the balloon group. Therefore, PTX-coated balloons may alleviate the local inflammatory response and collagen deposition when used during dilation treatment of benign esophageal stenosis.
