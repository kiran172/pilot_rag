Title: The Utility of Prophylactic Antibiotics for Laparoscopic Pyloromyotomy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP) for the treatment of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a clean case with low expected rates of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI). Previous studies have shown a low risk of SSI following LP but also large variations in the utilization of prophylactic antibiotics. The goal of this study was to review the use of preoperative antibiotics for LP and to compare this with SSI incidence.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center analysis of patients undergoing LP for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis at a large quaternary children's hospital from January 2017 to June 2020. Subjects were <4 mo old. Exclusion criteria were those lost to follow-up within 30 d postoperatively and those who required open conversion intraoperatively. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test, two-tailed independent t-tests, and descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Two-hundred twenty-seven patients were included, mean population age was 5.7 wk, and 81.1% were male. Preoperative antibiotics were administered in 39% of patients. Only 1.3% (n = 3) of all patients developed an SSI within 30 d of their operation. Analysis between patients who received preoperative antibiotics and those who did not revealed no difference in age (5.72 wk versus 5.72 wk, t (225) = 0.38, P = 0.70), sex (41% of males versus 32% of females, P = 0.39), length of stay (t(225) = -0.94, P = 0.35), or postoperative SSI (1.1% versus 1.4%, P > 0.999). Large variability was noted in antibiotic utilization by surgeon.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing LP, there was no difference in SSI rates whether or not patients received preoperative antibiotics and, there is large variation in utilization. Measures are needed to decrease usage of prophylactic antibiotics before LP.
