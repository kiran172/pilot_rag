Title: Platelet-Leucocyte Aggregates as Novel Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Diseases.

Abstract: Platelet-leucocyte aggregates (PLA) are a formation of leucocytes and platelets bound by specific receptors. They arise in the condition of sheer stress, thrombosis, immune reaction, vessel injury, and the activation of leukocytes or platelets. PLA participate in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Increased levels of PLA were revealed in acute and chronic coronary syndromes, carotid stenosis cardiovascular risk factors. Due to accessible, available, replicable, quick, and low-cost quantifying using flow cytometry, PLA constitute an ideal biomarker for clinical practice. PLA are promising in early diagnosing and estimating prognosis in patients with acute or chronic coronary syndromes treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). PLA were also a reliable marker of platelet activity for monitoring antiplatelet therapy. PLA consist also targets potential therapies in CVD. All of the above potential clinical applications require further studies to validate methods of assay and proof clinical benefits.
