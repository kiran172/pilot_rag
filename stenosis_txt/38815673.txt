Title: Clinical impact of multiple resheathing during transcatheter aortic valve implantation with Evolut self-expanding valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The possibility to resheath some transcatheter heart valves (THV) facilitates the optimization of self-expandable devices implantation. However, resheating manoeuvres (expecially when repeated) increase the interaction between the transcatheter prosthesis and the patient's tissues potentially causing side-effects.
AIMS: To assess the clinical outcomes of resheathing at midterm follow-up with a focus on the safety of multiple resheathing.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with a self-expandable supra-annular THV between December 2018 and December 2022. Primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular (CV) mortality, neurological events, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and CV rehospitalizations. All clinical endpoints were assessed according to VARC-3 criteria.
RESULTS: 469 TAVI procedures with self-expandable supra-annular THV were included in the study. The attempt to resheath and the resheath manoeuvres number was prospectively recorded into an electronic database. Resheating was attempted in 253 (53.9%) cases; 1, 2 and ≥ 3 resheathing were performed in respectively 122 (26.0%), 63 (13.4%) and 68 (14.5%) procedures. At a median follow-up of 640 days (interquartile range 340-1033 days), the incidence of the primary endpoint did not differ between 0 vs. ≥1 (22.7 vs. 26.1%, LogRank p = 0.584) and < 3 vs. ≥3 resheathing groups (24.2 vs. 26.5% LogRank p = 0.963). Furthermore, no significant differences in the primary endpoint were observed between 0, 1-2 and ≥ 3 resheathing (p = 0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that resheathing of self-expandable THVs during TAVI did not result in worse clinical outcomes compared with no resheathing at mid-term follow-up. These results are independent from the number of resheathing, underling the safety of multiple resheathing in terms of peri-procedural and mid-term outcome.
CONDENSED ABSTRACT: In this retrospective observational study of 469 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with self-expanding valves, we investigated the influence of resheathing on mid-term clinical outcomes. Specifically, we focused on the safety of multiple resheathing procedures. Our findings revealed no significant impact of resheathing on medium-term outcomes. The primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular mortality, neurological events, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular rehospitalizations, did not show statistically significant differences between no resheathing, single resheathing and multiple resheathing groups. Our study suggests that resheathing, even when performed multiple times, does not appear to significantly affect clinical outcomes at mid-term follow-up.
