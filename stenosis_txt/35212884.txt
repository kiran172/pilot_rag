Title: Endoscopic Management of Luminal Strictures: Beyond Dilation.

Abstract: Luminal strictures can occur as part of many different gastrointestinal (GI) disorders anywhere along the GI tract and affect all age groups. The end goal of managing any stricture is to re-establish an adequate and durable luminal patency that is sufficient to resolve the presenting clinical symptoms. Treatment options can be generally categorized into medical, endoscopic, and surgical. However, within each of these categories, multiple different options are available. Therefore, choosing the best treatment modality is often challenging and depends on multiple factors including the type, location, and complexity of the stricture, as well as the preference of the treating physician. In this article, we will review the most current literature regarding foregut strictures, particularly esophageal and gastric, beyond dilation.
