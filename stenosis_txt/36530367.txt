Title: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for thyroid surgery in patients with severe tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is effective for maintaining gas exchange in patients with respiratory failure or severe tracheal stenosis. Perioperative anesthetic management of severe airway obstruction can be associated with ventilation or intubation difficulties. Consequently, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation could be an option for treating such patients to avoid potential risks. However, only a limited number of similar cases have been reported. Therefore, we have summarized two cases to provide theoretical and practical references for treating patients with respiratory failure or severe tracheal stenosis using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
