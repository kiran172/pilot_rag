Title: Postpercutaneous Nephrolithotomy Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction.

Abstract: Percutaneous endoscopic renal surgery such as percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a safe and effective treatment for patients with large and/or complex renal calculi. However, a unique set of complications can occur with this surgical approach that may involve the targeted kidney and surrounding structures. Renal collecting system obstruction after PCNL is rare, but may result from ureteral avulsion, stricture formation, transient mucosal edema, blood clot, or infundibular stenosis. Impaction of stone and trauma during PCNL could induce stricture formation and obstruction. Use of proper percutaneous and endoscopic techniques and instruments will help to reduce the chances of developing such strictures and obstruction.
