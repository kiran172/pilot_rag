Title: Homelessness and Race are Mortality Predictors in US Veterans Undergoing CABG.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease requiring surgical revascularization is prevalent in United States Veterans. We aimed to investigate preoperative predictors of 30-day mortality following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the Veteran population. The Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement (VASQIP) national database was queried for isolated CABG cases between 2008 and 2018. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess for independent predictors of the primary outcome. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 32,711 patients were included. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.37%. Multivariable analysis identified the following predictors of 30-day mortality: African-American race (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.96); homelessness (OR 6.49, 95% CI 3.39-12.45); female sex (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.08-4.30); preoperative myocardial infarction within 7 days (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.06-2.10) or more than 7 days before CABG (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.04-1.72); partially/fully dependent functional status (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.07-1.93); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.24-1.92); mild (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.04-2.11) and severe aortic stenosis (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.37-3.09); moderate (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.31-2.72), or severe (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.71-5.22) mitral regurgitation; cardiomegaly (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.35-2.22); NYHA Class III/IV heart failure (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.10-3.83); and urgent/emergent operation (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08-1.87). The 30-day mortality rate in US Veterans undergoing isolated CABG between 2008 and 2018 was 1.37%. In addition to established clinical factors, African-American race and homelessness were independent demographic predictors of 30-day mortality.
