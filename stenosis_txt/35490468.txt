Title: Late-onset cerebral embolism after transcatheter aortic valve implantation under direct oral anticoagulant therapy.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke is a devastating complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), mainly occurring in the early postoperative period. The risk of a transplanted heart valve (THV) thrombosis causing stroke may be underestimated in the late postoperative phase. We describe the case of a 92-year-old woman with delayed valve thrombosis causing stroke after TAVI, who developed recurrent strokes eight months after TAVI for severe aortic valve stenosis. Transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography revealed a string-like thrombus attached to the implanted valve. With the administration of warfarin, the clot regressed, and the patient was discharged home without recurrence of stroke. Our case demonstrates the importance of THV thrombosis as an embolic source of stroke even in the late postoperative phase and provides a discussion on optimal antithrombotic therapy after TAVI.
