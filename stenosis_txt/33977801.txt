Title: One-year results of stent graft repair for carotid artery pseudo-aneurysm in patients with Behcet's disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology with vascular complications. This study reviewed the mid-term outcome of Behcet's disease patients with carotid artery pseudo-aneurysms treated by endovascular stent-graft repair at our unit.
METHODS: During a period of 11 years, six cases were included. Postoperative ultrasound duplex results were recorded along with computed tomography angiography report done a year after intervention.
RESULTS: The mean age (±SD) was 38 (±5.2) years. The mean (±SD) pseudo-aneurysm size was 33 (±12.2) mm. Technical success was 83%; failed cannulation of the internal carotid artery was encountered in one case. On day 2 post-operative, a duplex ultrasound revealed complete exclusion and thrombosis of the false aneurysm in all cases. A year later, a computed tomography angiography revealed a primary patency rate of 80%, and only one case had a recurrent pseudo-aneurysm at the distal margin of the stent graft. All cases, however, had complete thrombosis in the pseudo-aneurysms lumen with a mean (±SD) regression in size of 18 (±6) mm. The mean (±SD) percentage of in-stent stenosis was 34.5% (±11.73%).
CONCLUSIONS: Stent graft repair for carotid artery pseudo-aneurysm in Behcet's disease patients might be the preferable first line of treatment since it had a high technical success and mid-term primary patency rates, with additional fact that it obviously avoids the hazardous complications of surgery.
