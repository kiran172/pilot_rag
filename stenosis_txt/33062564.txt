Title: Full-endoscopic Decompression of Foraminal Stenosis Caused by Facet Hypertrophy Contralateral to the Dominant Hand in a Baseball Pitcher: A Case Report.

Abstract: Back pain and lower extremity pain have various causes and occasionally occur simultaneously, creating diagnostic difficulties. In addition, athletes require special consideration in terms of treatment. Here, we report a case of foraminal stenosis as a result of lumbar disc prolapse combined with facet hypertrophy contralateral to the dominant hand in a baseball pitcher that was successfully treated by minimally invasive full-endoscopic surgery. A 31-year-old left-handed male baseball pitcher presented with complaints of low back pain and right buttock pain while pitching. A diagnosis of foraminal stenosis caused by a disc bulge combined with facet hypertrophy contralateral to the dominant hand was made on the basis of physical and radiological findings. His symptoms improved immediately after transforaminal full-endoscopic lumbar discectomy and foraminoplasty under local anesthesia. He returned to play 3 months after surgery. Foraminal stenosis due to facet hypertrophy may occur in the side contralateral to the throwing arm in pitchers. Minimally invasive decompression using a full-endoscopic procedure is required for high-level athletes at this position.
