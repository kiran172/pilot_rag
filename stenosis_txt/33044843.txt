Title: Montgomery Salivary Bypass Tube in Head and Neck Cancer: The Experience of Our Otolaryngology Clinic.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: One of the most common complications in the immediate and late postoperative period following total laryngectomy or pharyngolaryngectomy is pharyngocutaneous fistulae (PCF) formation and pharyngoesophageal stenosis (PES), causing significant mortality and morbidity. Since 1978, Montgomery salivary bypass tube (MSBT) has been used to reduce the incidence of PCF and PES. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the outcomes of using MSBT both as a tool to prevent PCF and PES and to treat these complications in the postoperative period.
METHODS: Between January 2013 and December 2019, we inserted 109 MSBT in 87 patients with laryngeal/hypopharyngeal cancer treated in the Unit of Otolaryngology of our University Hospital.
RESULTS: Sixty (86.9%) patients healed from complications with primary and secondary placement of MSBT. Seven patients presented a persistence of PCF and 2 presented a recurrence of PES. Secondary placement of MSBT allowed treating successfully 15 (83%) of 18 patients. Only 3 of them presented a PCF at the end of the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: According to our experience, the MSBT is an affordable, easy to apply and well-tolerated tool. Although it is generally used for PCF treatment, it can also be used intraoperatively for PCF and PES prevention.
