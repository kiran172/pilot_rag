Title: [Evaluation of papilledema and visual improvement in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension after venous sinus stenting].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the improvement of papilledema and visual acuities in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) after venous sinus stenting. Methods: The clinical data of 8 IIH patients who met the inclusion criteria underwent venous sinus stenting between January 2013 and December 2016 at Department of Neurosurgery, Tianjin Huanhu Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. There were 6 females and 3 males,aged (32.9±14.4)years (range:19 to 57 years).The thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) was measured by optical coherence tomography. Fundus,visual acuity and visual field examination were performed before and after operation. If pressure gradient ≥10 mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) across the venous stenosis was indicated by intraoperative pressure measurement,the patient would be treated with venous sinus stenting. Intracranial pressure was measured by lumbar puncture 3 to 7 days after operation. RNFL thickness and eye examination were detected 6 months after surgery. CT venogram was used to observe the sinus venous conditions. Paired t test was used to compare the data before and after surgery. Results: All the 8 patients underwent venous sinus stenting successfully. The mean pressure gradient across the venous stenosis was reduced from (24±9.2) mmHg to (2.6±2.0) mmHg (t=8.02,P&lt;0.01). Intracranial pressure decreased from preoperative (41.4±12.7) cmH<sub>2</sub>O(1 cmH<sub>2</sub>O=0.098 kPa) to postoperative (12.9±3.3) cmH<sub>2</sub>O (t=7.08, P&lt;0.01). The RNFL thickness decreased from (275.3±68.3)μm to (131.4±31.8)μm(t=5.80,P&lt;0.05) 6 months after surgery and the baseline visual acuity was improved from(M(Q<sub>R</sub>))0.24 (0.25) to 0.65 (0.23)(Z=-2.52,P&lt;0.05).Papilledema was significantly improved in 6 patients,and no significant change in 2 patients. CT venogram indicated adjacent stent restenosis in 1 patient. Conclusion: Venous sinus stenting can effectively improve papilledema and visual acuity caused by IIH.
