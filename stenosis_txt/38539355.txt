Title: Laryngeal Mask Airway Versus Endotracheal Intubation during Lacrimal Duct Stenosis Surgery in Children-A Retrospective Analysis.

Abstract: Background: The use of laryngeal masks in the surgical treatment of infantile lacrimal duct stenosis is controversial due to the potential risk of aspiration. Aims: This study investigates airway procedures in children aged &lt;6 years for surgery of lacrimal duct stenosis in a tertiary care university hospital. Methods: After institutional approval, airway procedures, duration of anesthesiological measures, and airway-related complications were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the airway procedures used (endotracheal tube [ET] vs. laryngeal mask [LMA] airway). Associations were calculated using the Chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: Clinical data of 84 patients (ET n = 36 [42.9%] vs. LMA n = 48 [57.1%]) were analyzed. There were no significant differences in surgical treatment, age distribution, and pre-existing conditions between the groups. None of the patients showed evidence of tracheal aspiration or changes in measured oxygen saturation. LMA airway shortened time for anesthesia induction (p = 0.006) and time for recovery/emergence period (p = 0.03). In contrast, the time to discharge from the recovery room was significantly prolonged using LMA (p = 0.001). A total of 7 adverse events were recorded. Five of these were directly or indirectly related to ET (laryngo-/bronchospasm; muscle relaxant residual). Conclusions: LMA airway for infantile lacrimal duct stenosis seems to be a safe procedure and should be used in appropriate pediatric patients due to its lower invasiveness, low complication rate, and time savings.
