Title: Inverse Relationship between Plasma Tumor Necrosis Factor-Like Weak Inducer of Apoptosis and Carotid Intima-Media Thickness among Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the level of soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) and its correlation with micro-inflammation and atherosclerosis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study involved 23 healthy subjects (control group), 23 hemodialysis (HD) patients (HD group) and 26 PD patients (PD group). Serum biochemical measurements and sTWEAK assessments were tested. The association between intima-media thickness (IMT) and sTWEAK concentrations was evaluated.
RESULTS: The TWEAK level was lower in PD (155.16 ± 3.69 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and the HD group (150.16 ± 7.23 pg/mL, p < 0.001) than that in the control group (193.05 ± 5.36 pg/mL), with no significant difference between the PD group and the HD group. In the PD and HD groups, sTWEAK was significant negatively correlated with CPR, fibrinogen, and white blood cell (p < 0.05). Besides, compared to lower sTWEAK concentration end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (no >161.9 pg/mL), patients who had a higher level of sTWEAK (>161.9 pg/mL) had a lower IMT (0.97 ± 0.04 vs. 0.84 ± 0.03 cm, p = 0.029). After adjusted for sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, duration of dialysis, triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and serum glucose, sTWEAK (B = -0.002, r = 0.015) and CRP (B = 0.022, r = 0.015) were independent risk factors for the IMT of ESRD patients.
CONCLUSION: Plasma TWEAK is inversely associated with carotid IMT among patients undergoing HD and PD.
