Title: Abdominal vascular compression syndromes encountered in the emergency department: cross-sectional imaging spectrum and clinical implications.

Abstract: This is a review article on cross-sectional imaging spectrum of abdominal and pelvic vascular compression syndromes in emergency settings, discussing about pathophysiology, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and appropriate management of such entities. It is important to understand the overlap of imaging findings with common anatomic variations. Equally, the subtle imaging features of abdominal vascular compression syndrome may be equivocal for interpreting radiologist. Early recognition is important, in order to refer patients for appropriate treatment. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually performed to detect such abdominal vascular compression syndromes. For comprehensive review, the utility of color Doppler in evaluation and diagnosis is also emphasized in each section. Percutaneous angiography is usually considered as a reference standard for the diagnosis but limited due to its invasive nature. Surgical and endovascular management of these vascular compression syndromes is briefly described.
