Title: Native Americans have comparable transcatheter aortic valve replacement outcomes but higher stroke and venous thromboembolism after surgical aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in aortic valve replacement outcomes have been established. However, the current literature lacks comprehensive studies that examine the outcomes for Native Americans, probably due to their limited population size. This study aimed to investigate whether disparities in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) also exist for outcomes among Native Americans.
METHODS: Patients who underwent SAVR and TAVR were identified in National Inpatient Sample from the last quarter of 2015 to 2020. A 1:5 propensity score matching was conducted between Native Americans and Caucasians. In-hospital perioperative outcomes, length of stay, wait from admission to operation, and total hospital charge, were compared.
RESULTS: In TAVR, 51,394 (84.41 %) were Caucasians and 171 (0.28 %) were Native Americans. In SAVR, there were 50,080 (78.52 %) Caucasians and 279 (0.44 %) Native Americans. After propensity matching, no significant difference was found in post-TAVR outcomes between Native Americans and Caucasians. However, Native Americans have a higher risk of neurological complications (2.88 % vs 0.79 %, p < 0.01) with stroke being the primary contributor (2.52 % vs 0.5 %, p < 0.01), as well as a higher incidence of venous thromboembolism (1.8 % vs 0.57 %, p < 0.05) after SAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine aortic valve replacement outcomes in Native Americans. Native Americans were found to be more likely to undergo SAVR than TAVR. Moreover, Native Americans were found to have five times higher stroke and three times higher VTE after SAVR. These disparities faced by Native Americans underscore the need for increased attention and targeted actions to guarantee health equity.
