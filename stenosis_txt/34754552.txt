Title: C6 nerve root palsy after double-door cervical laminoplasty.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study correlated the relationship between postoperative C6 nerve root palsies and various patient-related clinical, radiographic, and surgical parameters.
METHODS: The medical records of 318 patients undergoing double-door cervical laminoplasty for myelopathy were reviewed. Twelve (3.8%) had postoperative C6 nerve root palsies. Their clinical, radiographic, and surgical procedures were analyzed looking for a correlation/explanation for these new C6 root deficits.
RESULTS: The following factors correlated with patients' developing new postoperative C6 nerve root deficit following double-door cervical laminoplasty; a high correlation with additional C5 palsies, narrower C6 intervertebral foraminal widths, greater anterior protrusions of the C6 articular process, and larger posterior shifts of the spinal cord on magnetic resonance (MR) between the C4/C5-C6/C7 levels.
CONCLUSION: Factors correlating with the new onset of C6 nerve root palsies following double-door cervical laminoplasty included; a high correlation with new C5 palsies, more severe foraminal stenosis, greater anterior protrusions of the C6 articular process, and more extensive dorsal spinal cord migration.
