Title: Predictors of Pacemaker Insertion Post-Sutureless (Perceval) Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The use of rapid deployment sutureless aortic valve replacement (AVR) has become a viable alternative to conventional AVR especially in intermediate and high-risk patients. However, sutureless AVR has been associated with increased rates of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation compared with conventionally implanted aortic valve prostheses. The aim of this study was to determine predictive factors for complete heart block requiring insertion of a PPM post-AVR with a Perceval S sutureless valve (LivaNova, London, UK). Such knowledge will help to improve patient counselling, selection and management of patients undergoing sutureless AVR.
METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cohort study assessed all patients who underwent insertion of the Perceval sutureless aortic valve prosthesis between July 2015 and September 2019. Medical records were reviewed for demographic, preoperative electrocardiograph (ECG), and operative features related to postoperative PPM implantation and follow-up in the electrophysiology clinic.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty (130) patients without pre-existing PPM underwent sutureless AVR (66.9% male, average age 74.4±6.6 years). Fifty-seven (57) underwent concomitant cardiac surgical procedures. Eight (8) patients underwent redo cardiac surgery. Nineteen (19) of the 130 (14.6%) patients required insertion of a PPM during their postoperative course. Factors associated with PPM insertion were right bundle branch block (overall n=15, PPM vs No PPM: 8/19 vs 7/111 [42.1 % vs. 6.31 %; p<0.01]), longer QRS duration 113.32ms±22.24 ms vs 100.52±20.96 ms (p=0.017) and longer PR Interval 185.166±42.38 ms vs 169.23±25.70 ms (p=0.03).
CONCLUSION: Insertion of rapid deployment sutureless aortic valves in the setting of pre-existing right bundle branch block, prolonged QRS complex and longer PR intervals is associated with increased risk of postoperative PPM requirement. These factors should be considered when preoperatively counselling and postoperatively managing patients when balloon expandable sutureless valves are used.
