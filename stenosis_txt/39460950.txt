Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement failure: surgical valve explantation after more than a decade.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an established alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis. However, the long-term outcomes and need for surgical reintervention following TAVR remain uncertain. This case report describes a 76-year-old woman who underwent surgical explantation of a SAPIEN-XT valve more than a decade after initial TAVR implantation due to late valve failure. The patient presented with severe aortic insufficiency and heart failure symptoms. Surgical intervention involved concomitant ascending aortic replacement, tricuspid annuloplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting. The TAVR valve was successfully explanted using careful blunt dissection to avoid annulus damage. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with the patient discharged after 4â€‰weeks. This case highlights the potential need for long-term surgical management of patients after TAVR and emphasizes the importance of surgical preparedness as TAVR indications expand. It also provides valuable insights for surgeons encountering similar cases of late TAVR failure requiring explantation.
