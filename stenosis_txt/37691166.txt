Title: Current and Expanded Indications for Cervical Disc Arthroplasty: Beyond the FDA IDE Studies.

Abstract: The widespread success of cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) has led to an interest in expanding indications beyond those outlined in the initial Food and Drug Administration investigational device exemption studies. Some of these off-label indications currently include 3-level and 4-level CDA, hybrid constructs with adjacent segment anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or corpectomy constructs, pre-existing kyphosis, revision of a failed anterior cervical discectomy and fusion to a CDA, CDA in the setting of significant degenerative disc disease and/or facet joint arthropathy, CDA for congenital cervical stenosis, and CDA in the presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. This review article will summarize the current literature pertaining to the aforementioned indications.
