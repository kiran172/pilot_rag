Title: Comparison of Frequency of Vascular Complications With Ultrasound-Guided Versus Fluroscopic Roadmap-Guided Femoral Arterial Access in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: To compare outcomes of ultrasound guidance (USG) versus fluoroscopy roadmap guidance (FG) angiography for femoral artery access in patients who underwent transfemoral (TF) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to determine whether routine USG use was associated with fewer vascular complications. Vascular complications are the most frequent procedural adverse events associated with TAVI. USG may provide a decreased rate of access site complications during vascular access compared with FG. Patients who underwent TF TAVI between July 2012 and July 2017 were reviewed and outcomes were compared. Vascular complications were categorized by Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria and analyzed by a multivariable logistic regression adjusting for potential confounding risk factors including age, gender, body mass index, peripheral vascular disease, Society of Thoracic Surgeons score and sheath to femoral artery ratio. Of the 612 TAVI patients treated, 380 (63.1%) were performed using USG for access. Routine use of USG began in March 2015 and increased over time. Vascular complications occurred in 63 (10.3%) patients and decreased from 20% to 3.9% during the study period. There were fewer vascular complications with USG versus FG (7.9% vs 14.2%, p = 0.014). After adjusting for potential confounding risk factors that included newer valve systems, smaller sheath sizes and lower risk patients, there was still a 49% reduction in vascular complications with USG (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.88, p = 0.02). In conclusion, USG for TF TAVI was associated with reduced vascular access site complications compared with FG access even after accounting for potential confounding risk factors and should be considered for routine use for TF TAVI.
