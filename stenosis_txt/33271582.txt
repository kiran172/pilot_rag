Title: [Aortic Regurgitation and Stenosis Associated with Ventricular Septal Defect in the Elderly;Report of a Case].

Abstract: A 63-year-old man had ventricular septal defect (VSD) and had been followed up without heart failure. Recently, he had palpitation caused by atrial fibrillation and the echocardiography revealed moderate aortic valve regurgitation and stenosis with right coronary cusp prolapse due to subpulmonary ventricular septal defect. He underwent patch closure of VSD, aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve, and maze procedure. In recent years, advanced case like this patient is rare because most of patients with subpulmonary VSD and right coronary cusp prolapse are operated in childhood.
