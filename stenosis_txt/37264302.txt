Title: Long- and short-term outcomes of balloon dilation for benign choledochojejunal anastomotic stricture using balloon endoscopy-assisted ERCP: a multi-center retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Benign choledochojejunal anastomotic stricture (CJS) is a common complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy and choledochojejunostomy. CJS is generally treated with balloon dilation, using balloon endoscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (BE-ERCP); however, its long- and short-term outcomes have not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we evaluated the treatment outcomes of balloon dilation with BE-ERCP for CJS.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients who had undergone balloon dilation with BE-ERCP for CJS between January 2009 and December 2022. The primary outcomes were technical and clinical success, and adverse event rates of balloon dilation using BE-ERCP for CJS. The secondary outcomes were long-term treatment outcomes for CJS recurrence, and evaluation of risk factors for recurrence.
RESULT: Technical and clinical success rates were 93% (37/40) and 100% (37/37), respectively. CJS recurrence occurred in 32% (20/37). No procedure-related adverse events were observed. The significant risk factors of CJS after balloon dilation were its early occurrence after surgery (unit hazard ratio [HR] for month, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.99; p-value = 0.04) and residual waist during balloon dilation (HR, 5.46; 95% CI, 1.18-25.1; p-value = 0.03). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of time from surgery to balloon dilation revealed an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65-0.94) and the cut-off value was 13.2 months.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of CJS with balloon dilation was effective, although CJS recurrence occurred in one-third of the patients. The risk factors for recurrence were early occurrence of CJS after surgery and remaining waist circumference during balloon dilation.
