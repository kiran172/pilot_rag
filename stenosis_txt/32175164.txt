Title: Aortic valve replacement using valve-in-valve procedure in a patient with left atrial appendage thrombus.

Abstract: In recent years, indications and age range of patients who are eligible for transcatheter aortic valve replacement have been increasingly extended. The presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage is an exclusion criterion in many studies using transcatheter aortic valve replacement. An 86-year-old male patient was admitted with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis secondary to degeneration of a 22-mm bioprosthetic valve implanted 14 years ago. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a thrombus in the left atrial appendage and it was confirmed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. The balloon-expandable valve was successfully implanted into the degenerated aortic bioprosthesis. In conclusion, we aimed to show that valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement can be performed in a patient with thrombus in the left atrial appendage.
