Title: Diagnosis and Therapeutic Cardiac Catheterization of Symptomatic Bicuspid Aortic Stenosis in the Pediatric Population.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart disease with a prevalence of 0.5%-1.3% of the population. Many children with BAV are asymptomatic. Clinically relevant abnormal valve function usually occurs in adulthood. However, in rare cases, children can fail to thrive which requires valvular intervention. In this review, we will explore in more detail the anatomy of the BAV, clinical presentation of BAV, diagnosis of BAV, and its function by echocardiography, and indications for transcatheter intervention in the pediatric population.
