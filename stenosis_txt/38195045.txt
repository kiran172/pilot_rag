Title: Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Chronic Total Occlusion.

Abstract: Although a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome is associated with greater risk, the prognosis of patients with a CTO and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate adverse event rates in patients with stable CAD with and without a CTO. In 3,597 patients with stable CAD (>50% coronary luminal stenosis) who underwent cardiac catheterization, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and the composite major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rates for cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization were evaluated. Cox proportional hazards and Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard models were used to compare event-free survival in patient subsets after adjustment for covariates. Event rates were higher in patients with CTOs than in those without CTOs after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics (cardiovascular death hazard ratio [HR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 to 1.57, p = 0.012). Patients with CTO revascularization had lower event rates than those of patients without CTO revascularization (cardiovascular death HR 0.43, CI 0.26 to 0.70, p = 0.001). Those with nonrevascularized CTOs were at particularly great risk when compared with those without CTO (cardiovascular death HR 1.52, CI 1.25 to 1.84, p <0.001). Moreover, those with revascularized CTOs had similar event rates to those of patients with CAD without CTOs. Patients with CTO have higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events than those of patients with significant CAD without CTO. This risk is greatest in patients with nonrevascularized CTO.
