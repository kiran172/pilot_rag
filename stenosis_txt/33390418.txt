Title: Return to the Original Work Activity Following the Full-endoscopic Lumbar Surgery under the Local Anesthesia.

Abstract: Transforaminal full-endoscopic spine (TF-FES) surgery is minimally invasive and can be performed under local anesthesia. Thus, it is expected that the patient can return to work (RTW) quickly. However, information in the literature regarding this is sparse. The purpose of this study is to review the timing of RTW after TF-FES surgery. This study involved 50 patients (14 women, 36 men; mean age 44.5 years, age range: 20-65 years) who underwent TF-FES surgery between January 2016 and April 2018. All the patients were active workers. Occupations varied widely (e.g., physician, nurse, helper, clerk, construction worker, chef, and schoolteacher). There were no surgery-related complications. Median time to RTW was 21 days. More than half of the patients could RTW within 21 days. In all, 12 cases (24%) could have RTW within 7 days. Occupations of 12 patients who achieved RTW within 7 days included physician, company owner, and restaurant owner, with 11 in the Light work, 1 was in the Medium work, and none in the Heavy work. All 12 had a quick RTW because their work was Light and they could not take prolonged sick leave. Prompt RTW is possible with TF-FES surgery. The biggest merit of TF-FES surgery is minimal invasiveness to the muscles of the back. Also, it can be performed under local anesthesia. Our findings reveal quicker RTW after surgery, depending on occupational type.
