Title: The Cupidon's Strike Technique: How to Never Miss a Rendezvous While Going on SAFARI.

Abstract: One of the difficulties of the subintimal arterial flossing with antegrade-retrograde intervention technique (SAFARI) technique is to properly achieve a rendezvous between both antegrade and retrograde accesses. We propose a new technique to overcome this difficulty. It consists of directly percutaneously puncturing 2 loop snares, placed via each access, which are then both used to snare an externally introduced guidewire introduced through the needle. The snares are then moved en bloc, bringing both snares and the wire into the same channel.
