Title: Upper Airway Complications in COVID-19: A Case Series.

Abstract: Prolonged intubation is associated with several complications leading to upper airway obstruction, including tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia. Tracheostomy may potentially decrease the risk of tracheal injury in patients with upper airway obstruction. The ideal timing to perform tracheostomy remains controversial. Prolonged intubations were particularly common during the initial phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to present a series of five cases of upper airway complications in patients who underwent mechanical ventilation in the setting of COVID-19 and discuss their clinical aspects, risk factors, and therapeutic strategies.
