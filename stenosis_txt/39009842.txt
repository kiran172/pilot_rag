Title: Percutaneous Endovascular Creation of a Neo-arteriovenous Fistula in Dysfunctional Hemodialysis Fistulas.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) is the preferred type of hemodialysis access, but when an arteriovenous anastomosis (AVA) calcifies, surgical revision of the AVF may be required. We report a technique to create percutaneous artery-to-vein intervascular neo-fistulas for re-anastomosis of AVA and evaluate its safety and efficacy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9 patients who failed either guidewire navigation or conventional balloon dilation for calcified AVA stenosis/occlusion underwent a salvage procedure of their dialysis shunt by the percutaneous creation of a new arteriovenous fistula. Needle puncture of the adjacent supplying artery and outflow vein under ultrasonographic and/or fluoroscopic guidance was performed and followed by balloon dilation, with or without stent graft placement. The detailed techniques, technical success, primary neo-fistula patency, primary and secondary access patency rates were reported herein.
RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 100% of the 9 patients treated (7 neo-fistulas with stents and 2 neo-fistulas without stent placement). The median primary neo-fistula and access patencies were 15 and 5 months, respectively. The primary neo-fistula patency rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 72.9%, 54.7% and 27.9%, respectively, with secondary neo-fistula and access patency rates of 72.9%, 72.9% and 72.9%, respectively. One delayed complication of pseudoaneurysm formation occurred, which was managed by the successful endovascular deployment of a stent graft on an out-patient basis.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous artery-to-vein intervascular neo-fistula creation is feasible for re-anastomosing calcified AVA, with low adverse effects and acceptable primary neo-fistula and secondary access patency.
