Title: Mesenteric Arteriovenous Dysplasia/Vasculopathy Mimicking Crohn's Disease: A Case Report.

Abstract: Mesenteric arteriovenous vasculopathy (MAVD/V) is an extremely rare and poorly understood disease and its incidence is probably underestimated. It is an uncommon, non-inflammatory and non-atherosclerotic form of mesenteric vascular injury, first reported in 2016, with characteristic histopathologic evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia-like vascular changes. We present the case of a chronically ill 84-year-old female with a 5 year history of recurrent small bowel obstruction, who underwent segmental resection of the small bowel. Intraoperative examination showed bowel stricture with fibrosis, intraluminal pill fragments and creeping mesenteric adipose tissue clinically compatible with Crohn's disease. Histological examination showed acute and chronic mucosal injury characterized by crypt distortion, ulcerations with granulation tissue, pseudo-pyloric metaplasia, areas of fibrosis and serosal adhesions. Multiple blood vessels (including both veins and arteries) demonstrated wall hyalinization, elastic degeneration and non-atherosclerotic luminal occlusion. The pattern of the mucosal injury is, in this case, potentially a consequence of acute and chronic ischemic processes secondary to mesenteric arteriovenous vasculopathy.
