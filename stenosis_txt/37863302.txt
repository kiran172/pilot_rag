Title: Impact on Kidney Function and Medium-Term Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now widely approved for the treatment of aortic stenosis, regardless of the patients' surgical risk. However, the outcomes of TAVR and their determinants in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) beyond 1 year of follow-up are unknown. We aimed to assess the medium-term outcomes of TAVR in CKD, develop a risk score to estimate the 2-year mortality in patients with CKD, and evaluate the changes in kidney function at discharge after TAVR. Adults who underwent TAVR were retrospectively identified. The CKD stage was determined using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology 2021 creatinine formula. Improved kidney function was defined as post-TAVR creatinine ≤50% of pre-TAVR creatinine or decrease in creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/100 ml compared with pre-TAVR creatinine. Overall, 1,523 patients (median age 82 years; 59% men; 735 with CKD stage II or less, 661 with CKD III, 83 with CKD IV, and 44 with CKD V [of whom 40 were on dialysis]) were included. The all-cause mortality was higher in CKD stages IV and V on the multivariable analysis (p <0.001) at median follow-up of 2.9 (interquartile range 2.0 to 4.2) years. Moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, anemia, right ventricular systolic pressure >40 mm Hg and CKD stages IV and V were independent predictors of 2-year mortality and were used to develop a risk score. At hospital discharge, persisting acute kidney injury after TAVR occurred in 88 of 1,466 patients (6%), whereas improved kidney function occurred in 170 of 1,466 patients (12%). In conclusion, CKD stage was an independent determinant of mortality beyond 2 years after TAVR. Kidney function was more likely to improve than worsen at the time of hospital discharge after TAVR.
