Title: Postinfarction Ventricular Septal Ruptures During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Two Case Series.

Abstract: This case series highlights the occurrence of hemodynamically significant ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in two patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to emphasize the delayed presentation of cardiac emergencies, such as STEMI, due to concerns about contracting COVID-19. This delay has led to an increased risk of rare complications, including VSD, associated with STEMI. The first case involves a 92-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. He presented with acute chest pain, and diagnostic tests revealed ST elevations and a VSD. Despite intervention efforts, including hemodynamic support, the patient's condition deteriorated, and he passed away due to advanced age and high surgical risk. The second case involves a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with left-sided chest pain, and an angiogram revealed a mid-right coronary artery stenosis and a thrombus. During the procedure, the patient experienced hypotension, requiring hemodynamic support. Subsequent evaluations identified a large VSD with right ventricular dysfunction. The patient underwent a series of interventions, including a ventricular assist device and VSD closure, but experienced multi-organ failure and ultimately passed away. VSDs following acute myocardial infarction (MI) are rare but life-threatening complications. Early revascularization is crucial in preventing the development of VSDs. These cases demonstrate the importance of prompt diagnosis and intervention, as delayed presentation increases the risk of mechanical complications. Surgical closure remains the definitive treatment for postinfarction VSDs.
