Title: [Development and clinical application of a new transverse process retractor based on computer-aided design and 3D printing technology].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To manufacture a new type of transverse process retractor by using computer-aided design(CAD) combined with 3D printing technology and investigate its clinical application effect.
METHODS: A new type of transverse protrusion retractor was developed by CAD combined with 3D printing technology. From September 2018 to September 2019, the new transverse process retractor was applied in clinic. Sixty patients with lumbar single segment lesions who needed treatment by pedicle screw fixation, bone grafting and interbody fusion were divided into new transverse process retractor group and control group, with 30 cases in each group. There were 14 males and 16 females in new type transverse process retractor group, the age was (68.0±4.3) years old on average; lesion segment of 8 cases were L<sub>3,4</sub>, 9 cases were L<sub>4,5</sub>, 13 cases were L<sub>5</sub>S<sub>1</sub>;5 cases of lumbar disc herniation, 20 cases of lumbar spinal stenosis, 5 cases of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis;new transverse process retractor was used to pedicle screw placement. While there were 15 males and 15 females in control group, with an average age of (69.2±4.5) years old;lesion segment of 8 cases were L<sub>3,4</sub>, 10 cases were L<sub>4,5</sub>, 12 cases were L<sub>5</sub>S<sub>1</sub>;5 cases of lumbar disc herniation, 21 cases of lumbar spinal stenosis, 4 cases of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis;the traditional lamina retractor was used for soft tissue pulling and finished pedicle screw placement by freehand. The length of surgical incision, the time required for inserting a single screw, fluoroscopy times, the times of adjusting the positioning needle or screw in insertion process, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) of surgical incision 72 hours after operation were compared between two groups.
RESULTS: Using CAD and 3D printing technology, a new type of transverse protrusion retractor was developed quickly. The length of surgical incision, the time required for inserting a single screw, fluoroscopy time, and the times of adjusting the positioning needle or screw in insertion process in new transverse process retractor group were less than those in control group(P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in VAS of lumbar incision pain at 72 hours after operation between two groups(P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Using CAD combined with 3D printing technology to develop a new transverse protrusion retractor has the advantages of convenient design, short development cycle and low cost. It provides a new idea for the research and development of new medical devices. The new transverse process retractor has the advantages of easy operation, reliable fixation, less damage to paravertebral muscle, convenient pedicle screw placement, reducing fluoroscopy time and so on.
