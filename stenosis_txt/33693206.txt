Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis in Japan　- Analysis of a Nationwide Inpatient Database.

Abstract: Background: Nationwide data on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in Japan are scarce. Methods and Results: Using a nationwide inpatient database, we analyzed patients undergoing TAVI (n=8,338) or SAVR (n=16,298) due to aortic stenosis between 2014 and 2017. The annual number of TAVI increased rapidly from 2014 to 2017, particularly in older patients. In-hospital deaths were lower and the length of hospital stay was shorter for patients undergoing TAVI than SAVR. Conclusions: TAVI has been penetrating in Japan as an alternative therapeutic option for aortic stenosis and is associated with acceptable clinical outcomes.
