Title: Prognostic Impact of Peak Aortic Jet Velocity on Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) leads to increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, and recent studies reported that even mild-to-moderate AS was associated with poor prognosis in the general population. This study investigated the prognostic impact of mild or moderate AS, defined as 2.0 m/s ≤ peak aortic jet velocity (Vmax) ≤3.9 m/s using echocardiography in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study enrolled 3,049 AMI patients using data from the Mie ACS registry. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to Vmax: Group 1: Vmax <2.0 m/s and/or visually intact aortic valve in which all 3 leaflets are fully and evenly open; Group 2: 2.0 m/s ≤ Vmax ≤ 3.9 m/s. There were 2,976 patients in Group 1and 73 patients in Group 2. The Group 2 patients were older, had a higher percentage of males and had lower body mass index and Killip ≥2 than the Group 1 patients. Angiographic data, door-to-balloon time, and mechanical support were not different between the 2 groups. The Group 2 patients demonstrated a significantly higher all-cause mortality rate (P<0.01) and composite of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization (P<0.01), and Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the same tendency in propensity score-matched patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that mild or moderate AS based on Vmax is associated with poor prognosis following AMI.
