Title: Life expectancy of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement compared with that of the general population.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) changes the natural history of severe aortic stenosis. However, whether the life expectancy of patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing this surgical procedure is fully restored is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess if the life expectancy of patients aged >75 years is fully restored after undergoing surgery for severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS: We compared long-term survival of a group of patients aged >75 years, who underwent SAVR at our institution with the long-term survival of the general population. We matched each patient with 100 simulated individuals (control group) of the same age, sex and geographical region who died as indicated by the National Institute of Statistics. We compared survival curves and calculated hazard ratio (HR) or incidence rate ratio. Statistical significance existed if confidence intervals (CIs) did not overlap or did not include the value 1, as appropriate.
RESULTS: Average life expectancy of surgical patients who survived the postoperative period was 90.91 months (95% CI 82.99-97.22), compared to 92.94 months (95% CI 92.39-93.55) in the control group. One-, 5- and 8-year survival rates for SAVR patients who were discharged from the hospital were 94.9% (95% CI 92.74-96.43%), 71.66% (95% CI 67.37-75.5%) and 44.48% (95% CI 38.14-50.61%), respectively, compared to that of the general population: 95.8% (95% CI 95.64-95.95%), 70.64% (95% CI 70.28%-71%) and 47.91% (95% CI 47.52-48.31%), respectively (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94-1.22).
CONCLUSION: For patients over the age of 75 years who underwent SAVR and survived the postoperative period, life expectancy and survival rates were similar to that of the general population.
