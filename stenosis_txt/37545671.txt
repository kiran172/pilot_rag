Title: Right Ventricular Apical Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Association With Infundibular, Valvular, and Supravalvular Pulmonary Stenosis.

Abstract: A 31-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of exertional dyspnea and palpitations. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur in the pulmonic area. Owing to the suspicion of pulmonary stenosis, cardiac magnetic resonance was notable for apical hypertrophy of the right ventricle and mixed pulmonary stenosis. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
