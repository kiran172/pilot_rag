Title: Post cholecystectomy benign biliary stricture-isolated hepatic duct stricture: a proposed modification of the BISMUTH classification.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Post-cholecystectomy, benign biliary strictures are challenging for both patients and surgeons. Bismuth classified benign biliary strictures into 5 types. This study aimed to review these isolated hepatic duct strictures which were not included in Bismuth classification.
METHODS: The case records of all patients who presented with post-cholecystectomy benign biliary strictures between January 2005 and December 2020 at our centre were reviewed. Data regarding demography, type of stricture, and treatment strategy were entered into the standard proforma.
RESULTS: There were 242 patients [type I-3.7%, type II-41.7%, type III-38.0%, type IV-6.6%, and type V-7.8%]. Five (2.1%) patients did not fit the Bismuth classification and were the focus of this study. In each of these patients, an isolated hepatic duct stricture (first-or second-order hepatic duct) was present, with no involvement of the common hepatic duct or hilar confluence.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of isolated hepatic duct stricture [type VI] to the Bismuth classification will enhance the original classification, help in reporting and management of this sub-set of patients.
