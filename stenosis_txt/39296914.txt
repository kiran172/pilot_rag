Title: Effects of intracoronary administration of small doses of nicorandil and verapamil on blood pressure and heart rate.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nicorandil and verapamil can improve coronary blood flow and coronary microcirculation during percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the effects of intracoronary (IC) administration of nicorandil and verapamil on hemodynamics remain unclear.
AIMS: To clarify the safety and effects of IC administration of nicorandil and verapamil on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) to provide evidence-based basis for clinical intervention.
METHODS: The study cohort included 70 patients with coronary artery stenosis recruited from Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IC administration of 2 mg/2 ml of nicorandil and 200 μg/2 ml of verapamil) or the control group (IC administration of 2 ml of saline). BP and HR were compared before medication, after medication, and when stabilized.
RESULTS: IC administration of verapamil at 200 μg significantly reduced systolic BP as compared to the control group (113.72 ± 3.40 vs. 123.63 ± 3.33 mmHg, respectively, p &lt; 0.05) for a short period of time, and returned to baseline within 2 min, but had no effect on diastolic BP and HR. IC administration injection of nicorandil at 2 mg had no effect on BP or HR. There were no instances of major cardiovascular events.
CONCLUSION: IC administration of nicorandil at 2 mg is safe as an adjunctive medication during interventional angiography. Verapamil can also be used as an IC adjuvant, although BP and HR must be monitored for patients with low basal BP, especially systolic BP.
