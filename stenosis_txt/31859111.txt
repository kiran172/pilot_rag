Title: TAVI Care and Cure, the Rotterdam multidisciplinary program for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Design and rationale.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The capacity of TAVI-programs and numbers of sites performing TAVI has rapidly increased. This necessitated the initiation of the Rotterdam TAVI Care & Cure Program, aiming to improve patient-centered care during the TAVI pathway.
METHODS: Consenting patients with severe aortic stenosis and an indication for TAVI will be included. The TAVI Care & Cure program will facilitate prognostic contributions to improve outcomes, patient satisfaction and quality of life in patients with valvular heart disease who are treated with a transcatheter aortic valve implantation in collaboration with the departments of cardiology, cardio-thoracic surgery, anesthesiology and geriatrics.
CONCLUSION: With a single center observational registry, we aim to assess the TAVI patient clinical pathway, focusing on pre, peri and post interventional variables including functional status and HRQoL. We will evaluate the patient's complexity by applying an extended multidisciplinary approach, which includes a systematic application of geriatric assessments of frailty and cognitive function.
