Title: A novel TAB2 nonsense mutation (p.S149X) causing autosomal dominant congenital heart defects: a case report of a Chinese family.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: TAB2 is an activator of MAP 3 K7/TAK1, which is required for the IL-1 induced signal pathway. Microdeletions encompassing TAB2 have been detected in various patients with congenital heart defects (CHD), indicating that haploinsufficiency of TAB2 causes CHD. To date, seven variants within TAB2 were reported associated with CHD, only two of them are nonsense mutations.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe a three-generation Chinese family that included five CHD patients with heart valvular defects, such as mitral or tricuspid valves prolapse or regurgitation, and aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation. Our proband was a pregnant woman presenting with mitral, tricuspid, and aortic defects; her first child experienced sudden cardiac death at the age of 2 years. Whole-exome sequencing of the proband revealed a novel nonsense variant in TAB2 (c.C446G, p.S149X), which results in the elimination of the majority of C-terminal amino acids of TAB2, including the critical TAK1-binding domain. The variant was identified in five affected patients but not in the eight unaffected family members using Sanger sequencing and was classified as "pathogenic" according to the latest recommendation on sequence variants laid out by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology.
CONCLUSION: We described a family with CHD caused by a novel TAB2 nonsense mutation. Our study broadens the mutation spectrum of TAB2; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pathogenic mutation within TAB2 in a Chinese population.
