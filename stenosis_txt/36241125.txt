Title: Females are less likely to receive best medical therapy for stroke prevention before and after carotid revascularization than males.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Current professional guidelines recommend best medical therapy (BMT) with statin agents and antiplatelet therapy for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with carotid artery stenosis. We aimed to assess the association of patient sex with preoperative BMT in patients undergoing carotid revascularization.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of Vascular Quality Initiative patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting between January 2003 and February 2022. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association of patient sex with preoperative BMT after adjusting for sociodemographic, comorbidity, and disease severity characteristics. In-hospital outcomes were assessed by sex and preoperative BMT status.
RESULTS: Of 214,008 patients who underwent carotid revascularization, 38.7% (n = 82,855) were female and 61.3% (n = 131,153) were male. Overall, 77.2% (n = 63,922) of females were on preoperative BMT, compared with 80.4% (n = 105,375) of males (P < .001). After adjusting for baseline differences, females had 11% lower odds of being on BMT compared with males (adjusted odds ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.91). Postoperatively, females had 18% lower odds of being prescribed BMT than males (adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.84). In-hospital stroke (1.20% vs 1.51%), death (0.37% vs 0.66%), and stroke/death (1.46% vs 1.98%) were all significantly lower for patients on BMT (all P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant discrepancy in the proportion of females versus males receiving preoperative BMT for stroke prevention before carotid artery revascularization. In-hospital outcomes are worse in patients without BMT, highlighting the importance of raising awareness and implementing targeted interventions to improve preoperative adherence to stroke prevention guidelines.
