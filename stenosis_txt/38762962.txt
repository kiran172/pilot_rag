Title: Sex differences in transcatheter aortic valve replacement outcomes among patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite comprising almost half of all patients undergoing valvular repair, data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis (BAS) are limited.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether there are any sex differences in trends and outcomes of TAVR in this population.
METHODS: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample from 2012 to 2020 to identify admissions with BAS who underwent TAVR and analyzed trends and outcomes. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications. We used two models to adjust for demographics (A) and interventions (B).
RESULTS: Between 2012 to 2020, there were 76,540 hospitalizations for BAS patients who underwent AVR, among which 6,010 (7.9 %) underwent TAVR. There was an overall increasing trend in number of TAVR cases with a decreasing trend in mortality (2013: 8.7 %, 2020: 1.3 %). TAVR was performed more in males (61.1% vs 38.9 %). Despite the worse baseline characteristics in males, in-hospital mortality (2.4% vs. 1.5 %; OR: 1.584; 95 % CI: 0.621-4.038; p = 0.335) and secondary outcomes were similar across both sexes, even after adjusting for demographics and interventions.
CONCLUSION: TAVR in BAS has grown rapidly in the last decade. Males comprised the majority and had more comorbidities, but mortality and complications were similar in both sexes. Despite the increasing number of cases, a decreasing trend in mortality was observed for both sexes ultimately approaching that of SAVR, suggesting that TAVR may be a safe alternative among eligible males and females with bicuspid AS.
