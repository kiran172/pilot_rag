Title: Predictors for Small Bowel Stenosis in Balloon-Assisted Enteroscopy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Predictors besides symptoms of obstruction indicating small bowel stenosis are little known.
AIMS: To detect predictors of small bowel stenosis in balloon-assisted enteroscopy.
METHODS: Over a 6-year period, 461 patients had enteroscopy for suspected small intestinal disease. Details of clinical manifestations, medical history, demographic characteristics, findings of examinations, information on enteroscopy, and treatment were retrospectively collected based on medical records. Small bowel stenosis was defined as stricture that over-tube cannot go through in enteroscopy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors for small bowel stenosis.
RESULTS: A total of 314 patients had definite diagnosis after enteroscopy, imaging modalities, and/or even surgical exploration. They were included in this study for analyses. Mean age for them was 48.2 years old (range 15-81 years). Small bowel stenosis was present in 59 patients (18.8%). Analyses showed that CT/MRI indicating stenosis was significantly associated with severe stenosis (p = 0.014) but insignificant related to general stenosis (p = 0.097). Predictive factors that accompanied stenosis were age ≥ 60 years (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.0), underweight (BMI ≤ 18.5) (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.4-8.4), symptoms of obstruction (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.8-7.4), and overt small bowel bleeding (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Small bowel stenosis more tended to occur to patients with symptoms of obstruction, no overt small bowel bleeding, age ≥ 60 years, or underweight.
