Title: Contemporary trends in mitral valve surgery in East China: a 10-year experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Contemporary nationwide data from mainland China on trends in mitral valve surgery are scarce. The purpose of the present study was to review a single-center experience with mitral valve surgery over a 10-year period in East China.
METHODS: Between July 2009 and June 2019, 3238 consecutive patients who underwent mitral valve surgery in our center were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were evenly divided into three periods: July 2009 to October 2012 (period I), November 2012 to February 2016 (period II), March 2016 to June 2019 (period III).
RESULTS: The 3238 patients included 536 (16.6%) who had mitral valve repair and 2702 (83.4%) who had mitral valve replacement. Early mortalities for mitral valve repair and mitral valve replacement were 0.2% and 0.9%, respectively. There were trends towards a higher proportion of degenerative valve lesions (24.6%, 35.8%, 54.7% in periods I, II, and III, respectively) and a lower proportion of rheumatic valve lesions (71.0%, 62.6%, 38.0%) in more recent years. The proportions of minimally invasive surgery (0.7%, 2.1%, 30.2%), mitral valve repair (8.3%, 15.4%, 27.5%), use of a bioprosthesis (10.1%, 17.0%, 23.1%), and concomitant tricuspid valve procedures (13.2%, 28.5%, 46.0%) increased dramatically, while early mortality remained constant during the 10-year period (1.0%, 0.3%, 0.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: In the past 10 years, the spectrum of mitral valve disease experienced a trend towards more degenerative valve lesions and less rheumatic valve lesions in East China. Mitral valve repair, bioprostheses, tricuspid valve repair, and minimally invasive surgery have been more often applied in recent years.
