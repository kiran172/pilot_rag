Title: Assessment of CVD Risk Factors in Secondary Prevention after Ischemic Stroke Using the ICF.

Abstract: Background: Patients after undergoing ischemic stroke have a high risk of further cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidents. Monitoring risk factors is critical to prevent the recurrence of CVD. Objective: The aim of the study was to determine differences in the incidence of risk factors for CVD in a post-ischemic stroke patient group (SG) compared to the control group, which had not undergone ischemic stroke (CG), and to characterize them using the ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) classification system. Materials and Methods: The incidence of risk factors for recurrent CVD events were retrospectively analyzed in 55 patients in SG and 55 patients in CG. The results were translated into categories from the ICF classification system. Results: Atrial fibrillation (p = 0.013), carotid artery stenosis > 50% (p < 0.001), LDL > 71 mg/dL (p < 0.001), heart rate > 80/min (p = 0.007), taking NOAC (p = 0.008) and NSAIDs (p < 0.001) as well as nicotinism (p = 0.001) were significantly more common in SG compared to CG. The value of the distribution of the total incidence of CVD risk factors were observed to be higher for SG than for CG. In SG, both for males (p < 0.001) and females (p < 0.001) more risk factors for recurrent CVD incidents were observed compared to CG. Conclusions: Patients in SG differ in the occurrence of risk factors for CVD event compared to CG. The use of a single tool, such as the ICF assessment sheet, can be useful in assessing and analyzing risk factors for recurrent CVD events. This may help to reduce the risk of subsequent CVD events in secondary prevention.
