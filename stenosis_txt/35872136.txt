Title: Impact of membranous septum length on pacemaker need with different transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems: The INTERSECT registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: New permanent pacemaker implantation (new-PPI) remains a compelling issue after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). Previous studies reported the relationship between a short MS length and the new-PPI post-TAVR with a self-expanding THV. However, this relationship has not been investigated in different currently available THV. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between membranous septum (MS)-length and new-PPI after TAVR with different Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV)-platforms.
METHODS: We included patients with a successful TAVR-procedure and an analyzable pre-procedural multi-slice computed tomography. MS-length was measured using a standardized methodology. The primary endpoint was the need for new-PPI within 30 days after TAVR.
RESULTS: In total, 1811 patients were enrolled (median age 81.9 years [IQR 77.2-85.4], 54% male). PPI was required in 275 patients (15.2%) and included respectively 14.2%, 20.7% and 6.3% for Sapien3, Evolut and ACURATE-THV(p ​< ​0.01). Median MS-length was significantly shorter in patients with a new-PPI (3.7 ​mm [IQR 2.2-5.1] vs. 4.1 ​mm [IQR 2.8-6.0], p ​= ​<0.01). Shorter MS-length was a predictor for PPI in patients receiving a Sapien3 (OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.79-0.96], p ​= ​<0.01) and an Evolut-THV (OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.84-0.98], p ​= ​0.03), but not for an ACURATE-THV (OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.79-1.21], p ​= ​0.91). By multivariable analysis, first-degree atrioventricular-block (OR 2.01 [95% CI 1.35-3.00], p = <0.01), right bundle branch block (OR 8.33 [95% CI 5.21-13.33], p = <0.01), short MS-length (OR 0.89 [95% CI 0.83-0.97], p ​< ​0.01), annulus area (OR 1.003 [95% CI 1.001-1.005], p ​= ​0.04), NCC implantation depth (OR 1.13 [95% CI 1.07-1.19] and use of Evolut-THV(OR 1.54 [95% CI 1.03-2.27], p ​= ​0.04) were associated with new-PPI.
CONCLUSION: MS length was an independent predictor for PPI across different THV platforms, except for the ACURATE-THV. Based on our study observations within the total cohort, we identified 3 risk groups by MS length: MS length ≤3 ​mm defined a high-risk group for PPI (>20%), MS length 3-7 ​mm intermediate risk for PPI (10-20%) and MS length > 7 ​mm defined a low risk for PPI (<10%). Anatomy-tailored-THV-selection may mitigate the need for new-PPI in patients undergoing TAVR.
