Title: Role of 3D reconstructed images in primary pulmonary vein stenosis.

Abstract: Primary pulmonary vein stenosis (PPVS) is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly. The surgical management of PPVS requires anatomical delineation of pulmonary venous drainage along with exact localization of the stenosis. Since echocardiography cannot visualize the whole length of pulmonary veins (PV), computed tomography (CT) pulmonary venography becomes necessary. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction helps in planning PV augmentation and for prognostication. Here, we present 3D reconstructed CT pulmonary venography images of a 3-month-old child who presented to us with PPVS.
