Title: Interventional compared with medical management of symptomatic carotid web: A systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid web (CaW) is non-atheromatous, shelf-like intraluminal projection, generally affecting the posterolateral wall of the proximal internal carotid artery, and associated with embolic stroke, particularly in younger patients without traditional stroke risk factors. Treatment options for symptomatic CaWs include interventional therapy with carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting versus medical therapy with antiplatelet or anticoagulants. As safety and efficacy of these approaches have been incompletely delineated in small-to-moderate case series, we performed a systematic review of outcomes with interventional and medical management.
METHODS: Systematic literature search was conducted and data analyzed per PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) from January 2000 to October 2021 using the search strategy: "Carotid web" OR "Carotid shelf" OR "Web vessels" OR "Intraluminal web". Patient-level demographics, stroke risk factors, technical procedure details, medical and interventional management strategies were abstracted across 15 series. All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Among a total of symptomatic 282 CaW patients across 14 series, age was 49.5 (44-55.7) years, 61.7% were women, and 76.6% were black. Traditional stroke risk factors were less frequent than the other stroke causes, including hypertension in 28.6%, hyperlipidemia 14.6%, DM 7.0%, and smoking 19.8%. Thrombus adherent to CaW was detected on initial imaging in 16.2%. Among 289 symptomatic CaWs across 15 series, interventional management was pursued in 151 (52.2%), carotid artery stenting in 87, and carotid endarterectomy in 64; medical management was pursued in 138 (47.8%), including antiplatelet therapy in 80.4% and anticoagulants in 11.6%. Interventional and medical patients were similar in baseline characteristics. The reported time from index stroke to carotid revascularization was median 14 days (IQR 9.5-44). In the interventional group, no periprocedural mortality was noted, major periprocedural complications occurred in 1/151 (0.5%), and no recurrent ischemic events were observed over follow-up range of 3-60 months. In the medical group, over a follow-up of 2-55 months, the recurrence cerebral ischemia rate was 26.8%.
CONCLUSION: Cumulative evidence from multiple series suggests that carotid revascularization is a safe and effective option for preventing recurrent ischemic events in patients with symptomatic carotid webs.
