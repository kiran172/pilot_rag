Title: Balloon Angioplasty Combined with Tirofiban as a First-Line Rescue Treatment After Failed Mechanical Thrombectomy for Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion with Underlying Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The standard rescue modality for patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis after failed mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is not well established. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of balloon dilation in combination with tirofiban as the first-line salvage therapy when MT failed in these patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 47 patients admitted between January 2018 and June 2021, with middle cerebral artery atherosclerotic occlusion, who underwent balloon angioplasty in combination with tirofiban as the first-line salvage therapy after the failure of MT. The recanalization outcome, procedure-related complications, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and functional outcome at 90 days were reviewed.
RESULTS: Recanalization with a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade of 2b-3 was achieved in 41 (87.2%) of the 47 patients. Acute stents were deployed in another 6 patients who did not achieve successful re-perfusion after balloon angioplasty. Successful recanalization was achieved in 3 of them. One patient (2.1%, 1/47) experienced re-occlusion several days later due to the withdrawal of antiplatelet therapy for parenchymal hematoma. Seven patients (14.9%, 7/47) underwent stent angioplasty in the stable stage (range: 1-2 months) because severe residual stenosis was detected on follow-up imaging. There was only one event of periprocedural complication, namely ectopic migration of emboli. The good functional outcome rate was 55.3% (26/47), without the events of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Balloon angioplasty in combination with tirofiban is safe and effective for middle cerebral artery atherosclerotic occlusion after the failure of MT.
