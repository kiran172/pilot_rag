Title: Outcome of Central Vein Occlusion Recanalization in Hemodialysis Patients and Predictors for Success: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Catheter-directed treatment is the standard approach for the management of chronic central venous occlusion.
PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to report the outcome of conventional recanalization of chronic central vein occlusion in hemodialysis patients and to determine the predictors for success.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All hemodialysis patients who underwent endovascular recanalization of central vein occlusion from January 2012 to December 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. The procedure was percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Stenting was performed in case of a significant recoil stenosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate central vein patency. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the predictive factors.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients (mean age, 61.2 years; range, 25‒89 years old) with 97 central vein occlusions were enrolled. Technical success was achieved in 49 patients (50.5%). The primary patency rates of central veins at 6 and 12 months were achieved in 17 patients (34.4%) and 8 patients (15.8%), respectively. The assisted primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were achieved in 38 patients (77.3%) and 30 patients (61%), respectively. Patient age ≥60 years and a tapered-type of lesion were significant predictive factors for successful recanalization.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of the central vein occlusion using a conventional technique is moderately effective and safe. Angioplasty alone and stenting were not significantly different in terms of patency rate. The age of the patients and type of occlusion were significant predictors for successful recanalization.
