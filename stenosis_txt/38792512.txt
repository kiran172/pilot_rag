Title: Contrast Volume-to-Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Ratio as a Predictor of Short-Term Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with early mortality and adverse events. However, in the setting of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), previous literature has failed to establish a correlation between the absolute volume of contrast media administered and mortality. We aimed to investigate the impact of contrast volume administered normalised to estimated glomerular filtration rate (CV/eGFR) on the development of AKI and on 30-day all-cause mortality in TAVI patients. Methods: We retrospectively analysed a cohort of 1150 patients who underwent TAVI at our unit between 2015 and 2018. Results: Follow-up was complete for 1064 patients. There were 23 deaths within the follow-up period and 76 cases of AKI, 9 of which required new renal replacement therapy (RRT). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed fair discrimination for 30-day all-cause mortality at a CV/eGFR ratio of 3.6 (area under the ROC curve (AUC) 0.671). Of patients in whom CV data were available, 86.0% (n = 757) had a CV/eGFR &lt; 3.6 and 14.0% (n = 123) had a CV/eGFR ≥ 3.6. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, CV/eGFR ≥ 3.6 was the strongest predictor of 30-day all-cause mortality (odds ratio 5.06, 95% confidence interval [1.61-15.7], p = 0.004). Other independent predictors were procedural urgency (3.28 [1.04-10.3], p = 0.038) and being under general anaesthesia (4.81 [1.10-17.3], p = 0.023). CV/eGFR ≥ 3.6 was also independently associated with significantly increased odds of AKI (2.28 [1.20-4.17], p = 0.009) alongside significant non-left main stem coronary artery disease (2.56 [1.45-4.66], p = 0.001), and diabetes (1.82 [1.03-3.19], p = 0.037). In supplementary ROC curve analysis, a similar CV/eGFR cut point of 3.6 was found to be an excellent predictor for new RRT (AUC 0.833). Conclusions: In conclusion, a CV/eGFR ≥ 3.6 post-TAVI was found to be a strong predictor of 30-day mortality and AKI. The maximum contrast volume that can be safely administered in each patient without significantly increasing the risk of mortality and AKI can be calculated using this ratio.
