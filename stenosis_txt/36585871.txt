Title: Implementation of a spine triage program and its effect on outpatient radiology utilization.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Clinical care pathways designed to triage spinal disorders have been shown to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction. The goal of this study was to perform an analysis of outpatient radiology costs before and after the implementation of a spine care triage pathway.
METHODS: All imaging orders and surgical procedures were captured in a prospective spine registry for patients referred to the department of neurosurgery within a single academic center between July 1, 2017, and November 3, 2020. A spine triage algorithm was developed and implemented January 1, 2018. Healthcare utilization was recorded for 1 year after the first appointment in the department of neurosurgery. Imaging costs were estimated using publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Statistical analysis consisted of an independent sample t-test or randomization test for continuous variables and a chi-square test for categorical variables.
RESULTS: A total of 3854 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 60 years (50.8% female) and 89.8% had undergone advanced imaging before being referred to the department of neurosurgery. In total, 12.6% of patients were referred with a specific surgical diagnosis (i.e., spinal stenosis, lumbar spondylolisthesis, etc.). During the pretriage phase 1810 patients were enrolled, and there were 2044 patients enrolled after the triage algorithm was implemented. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) was ordered more frequently by providers before the triage program was initiated, with imaging ordered in 34% (617/1810) of patients pretriage versus 14.8% (302/2044) after the triage pathway was implemented (p < 0.001). The authors calculated a significant reduction in cost associated with reduced radiology utilization. Before triage, the cost of radiology utilization was $85,475/1000 patients compared with $40,107/1000 patients afterward (p < 0.001). The triage program did not change the utilization of surgery (14.6% before, 13.6% after).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients treated after a spinal triage program was implemented in a single neurosurgery department, there was a substantial reduction in the use of advanced imaging and a 50% reduction in cost associated with outpatient radiology utilization. The triage program did not change the rate of spine surgery being performed.
