Title: Effect of systemic lidocaine on postoperative quality of recovery, the gastrointestinal function, inflammatory cytokines of lumbar spinal stenosis surgery: a randomized trial.

Abstract: Surgery is one of the most frequent and effective intervention strategies for lumbar spinal stenosis, however, one-third of patients are not satisfied with postoperative outcomes. It is not clear whether perioperative systemic lidocaine could accelerate the early postoperative quality of recovery in patients undergoing lumbar spinal stenosis surgery. 66 patients were enrolled in this trial. Lidocaine or placebo was administered at a loading dose of 1.5 mg/kg for 10 min and then infused at 2.0 mg/kg/hour till the end of surgery. Continued infusion by postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia with a dose of 40 mg/hour. The primary outcome was the quality of recovery. Secondary outcomes included the time of the patient's first flatus, catheter removal time, underground time from the end of the surgery, pain score, levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), sufentanil rescues, patients' satisfaction scores, and complications of lidocaine. Eventually, 56 patients were in the final analysis with similar age, Body Mass Index (BMI), duration of surgery and anesthesia, and median QoR-15 score (a development and Psychometric Evaluation of a Postoperative Quality of Recovery Score). The difference in median QoR-15 score in placebo versus lidocaine patients was statistically significant (IQR, 106 (104-108) versus 114 (108.25-119.25), P < 0.001). The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at the 12th hour, median sufentanil rescue consumption, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) of patients treatment with lidocaine were lower. Nevertheless, patients given lidocaine had high satisfaction scores. Suggesting that lidocaine enhanced the postoperative quality of recovery, met early postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery, provided superior pain relief, lessened inflammatory cytokines, etc., indicating it may be a useful intervention to aid recovery following lumbar spinal stenosis surgery.
