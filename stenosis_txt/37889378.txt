Title: Sems Sensibility: Biliary Stent Migration into the Oesophagus.

Abstract: Endoprostheses are commonly used in the treatment of biliary and pancreatic disorders. Fully-covered metal stents are intended for the palliation of malignant strictures in the biliary tree.Â We report a case of a patient affected by cancer of the pancreas who was treated with a proximal metallic biliary stent. The stent migrated to the oesophagus and was endoscopically removed. Proximal migration, although rare, should be kept in mind as a potential complication of the procedure.
