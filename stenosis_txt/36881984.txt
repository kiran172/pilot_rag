Title: Outcomes and predictors of periprocedural stroke after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Risk factors for stroke after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are currently incompletely understood.
PURPOSE: To identify possible predictors of early post-TAVI stroke and explore its short-term outcomes.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients (pts) submitted to TAVI between 2009 and 2020 in a tertiary center. Baseline characteristics, procedural information and stroke in first 30 days after TAVI were collected. In-hospital and 12 months outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 512pts (56,1% female, mean age of 82 ± 6years.) were included. In the first 30 days after TAVI 19pts (3,7%) had a stroke. In univariate analysis stroke was associated with higher body mass index (29 vs 27kg/m2, p=0.035), higher triglyceridemia (&gt; 117,5mg/dL, p=0,002), lower high-density lipoprotein (&lt; 38,5mg/dL, p=0,009) and porcelain aorta (36,8% vs 15,5%, p=0,014) and more frequent use of post-dilatation (58,8% vs 32%, p=0,021). In multivariate analysis, triglycerides &gt; 117,5mg/dL (p=0,032, OR = 3,751) and post-dilatation (p=0,019, OR = 3,694) were the independent predictors. Stroke after TAVI was associated with longer intensive care unit stay (12 vs 4 days, p&lt;0,001) and post-TAVI hospital stay (25 vs 10 days, p&lt;0,0001), higher intra-hospital mortality (21,1% vs 4,3%, p=0,003), cardiovascular 30-day mortality (15,8% vs 4,1%, p=0,026) and 1-year stroke (13,2% vs 1,1%, p=0,003).
CONCLUSION: Periprocedural and 30-day stroke is a relatively uncommon but potentially devastating complication after TAVI. In this cohort, 30-day stroke rate after TAVI was 3.7%. Hypertriglyceridemia and post-dilatation were found to be the only independent risk predictors. Outcomes after stroke, including 30-day mortality, were significantly worse.
