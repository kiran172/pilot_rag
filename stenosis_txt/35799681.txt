Title: Transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve implantation for very early bioprosthetic tricuspid stenosis secondary to pacemaker lead entrapment: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tricuspid stenosis (native and prosthetic) is rare. Redo-sternotomy for isolated tricuspid replacement is associated with a higher risk. The efficacy and durability of transcatheter valve implantation for severe tricuspid stenosis are unclear.
CASE SUMMARY: Successful tricuspid valve-in-valve implantation (Edwards 26â€…mm Ultra) was performed to exteriorize a retained, unextractable pacemaker lead causing very early surgical bioprosthetic valve dysfunction in a 66-year-old Caucasian woman. The original indication for surgical replacement was pacemaker lead-related severe tricuspid regurgitation. History of CABG and subsequent surgical replacement rendered the risk of a third sternotomy and open-heart surgery prohibitive.
CONCLUSION: Successful reduction in the severity of bioprosthetic tricuspid stenosis and improvement of right heart failure with transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation was observed. Percutaneous tricuspid valve implantation could be considered an alternative to redo-sternotomy for severe bioprosthetic tricuspid stenosis.
