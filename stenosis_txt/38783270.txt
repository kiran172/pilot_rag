Title: Triglyceride-glucose index and health outcomes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Numerous meta-analyses have explored the association between the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and diverse health outcomes, yet the comprehensive assessment of the scope, validity, and quality of this evidence remains incomplete. Our aim was to systematically review and synthesise existing meta-analyses of TyG index and health outcomes and to assess the quality of the evidence.
METHODS: A thorough search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted from their inception through to 8 April 2024. We assessed the quality of reviews using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD: 42024518587).
RESULTS: Overall, a total of 95 associations from 29 meta-analyses were included, investigating associations between TyG index and 30 health outcomes. Of these, 83 (87.4%) associations were statistically significant (P < 0.05) according to the random effects model. Based on the AMSTAR tool, 16 (55.2%) meta-analyses were high quality and none was low quality. The certainty of the evidence, assessed by the GRADE framework, showed that 6 (6.3%) associations were supported by moderate-quality evidence. When compared with the lowest category of the TyG index, the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) [relative risk (RR) = 2.25, 95%CI 1.82, 2.77], the risk of stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.26, 95%CI 1.18, 1.33) or with acute coronary syndrome disease (RR = 1.56, 95%CI 1.06, 2.28), the prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD)-non-fatal MI (RR = 2.02, 95%CI 1.32, 3.10), and the severity of CAD including coronary artery stenosis (RR = 3.49, 95%CI 1.71, 7.12) and multi-vessel CAD (RR = 2.33, 95%CI 1.59, 3.42) increased with high TyG index.
CONCLUSION: We found that the TyG index was positively associated with many diseases including the risk of CIN and stroke, the prognosis of CAD, and the severity of CAD which were supported by moderate-quality evidence. TyG index might be useful to identify people at high-risk for developing these diseases.
