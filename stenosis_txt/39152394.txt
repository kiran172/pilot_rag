Title: Aphasia due to right hemisphere infarction in a patient with situs inversus after carotid artery stenting: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Situs inversus (SI) is a rare congenital anomaly in which systemic organs and vessels are positioned in a mirror image of their normal positions. An interesting issue regarding individuals with such a condition is whether they also have reversed brain asymmetries. Most of studies on this issue indicate that, similarly to many people with normal visceral alignment, patients with SI have a left hemispheric dominance for language functions.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare occurrence of anomalous cerebral dominance for language in a patient with complete situs inversus. The right-handed patient developed aphasia after carotid stenting, and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebral infarction in the right parietal lobe.
CONCLUSION: Anomalous cerebral dominance for language and visceral situs inversus in our patient both may result from a single, genetically coded atypicality of developmental gradient.
