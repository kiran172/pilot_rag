Title: Risk and incidence of colorectal stricture progressing to colorectal neoplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: This study aims to assess the risk of colorectal stricture progressing to colorectal neoplasia (CRN) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The literature from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was searched from the date of databases' creation to 5 November 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature. Meta-analysis was conducted using the Stata 15 software and R 4.04 software. Two case-control studies and 12 cohort studies were eventually included. Colorectal stricture in patients with IBD increased the risk of progressing to CRN [odds ratio (OR): 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-2.29, P = 0.042], but was irrelevant to the risk of progressing to ACRN (OR: 3.56, 95% CI 0.56-22.70, P = 0.180). The risk of CRN were further distinguished in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) Our findings showed that colorectal stricture may increase the risk of progressing to CRN in patients with UC (OR = 3.53, 95%CI 1.62-7.68, P = 0.001), but was irrelevant to the risk of progressing to CRN in patients with CD (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.54-2.21, P = 0.811). In conclusion, colorectal stricture in patients with IBD can be used as a risk factor for predicting CRN but cannot be used as a risk factor for predicting ACRN. Stricture is a risk factor for CRN in patients with UC but not in patients with CD. More prospective, multi-center studies with large samples are expected to confirm our findings.
