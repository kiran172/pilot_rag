Title: [Clinical analysis of 25 cases of acute oral 84 disinfectant poisoning].

Abstract: Objective: To summarize the clinical characteristics and treatment effect of patients with acute oral 84 disinfectant poisoning, so as to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Methods: In January 2022, 25 hospitalized patients with acute oral 84 disinfectant poisoning admitted to our department from March 2016 to August 2021 were selected as the research objects, and their general conditions, poisoning reasons, poisoning time, dose of poisoning, clinical manifestations, blood routine and biochemical indicators, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis were selected. Results: A retrospective analysis was performed. Among the 25 patients, there were 4 males and 21 females, aged from 20 to 91 years, and M (Q(1), Q(3)) was 38.7 (27, 46) years; The poisoning time (from exposure to poison to treatment) was 1~72 h, and M (Q(1), Q(3)) was 10.5 (3, 11.5) h. The length of stay was 1~20 days, and M (Q(1), Q(3)) was 5.72 (2, 7) days.The dose was 40-500 ml, and the M (Q(1), Q(3)) was 219.6 (100, 330) ml. Chest CT showed exudative changes in both lungs in 4 patients, excessive decreased permeability in 1 case and pleural effusion in 1 case. Gastroscope showed 2 cases of erosive inflammation of gastric body and antrum, 1 case of esophageal ulcer and cardiac ulcer, 1 case of corrosive gastritis, gastric fundus ulcer and esophageal stenosis. Abdominal X-ray showed 1 case of abdominal intestinal dilatation and pneumatosis with multiple gas-liquid planes.There were 1 case of type I respiratory failure, 6 cases of gastrointestinal bleeding and 1 case of incomplete intestinal obstruction. There were 19 cases of nausea and vomiting, 9 cases of abdominal pain, 6 cases of pharyngeal pain and 6 cases of retrosternal burning pain, 1 case of cough and 2 cases of fatigue. Conclusion: Acute oral 84 disinfectant will cause varying degrees of damage to the human digestive tract and lungs. In severe cases, gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, hypoxemia, etc, and even life-threatening, should be paid attention to clinically. The treatment is mainly symptomatic support treatment, such as protecting gastrointestinal mucosa, controlling acute inflammatory reaction, protecting the functions of liver and kidney and other important organs.
