Title: Ticagrelor versus aspirin 2 years after coronary bypass: Observational analysis from the TARGET trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Compared to conventional aspirin therapy, ticagrelor did not improve vein graft patency 1 year after coronary bypass surgery (CABG) in the ticagrelor antiplatelet therapy to reduce graft events and thrombosis (TARGET) trial. However, it is unknown whether ticagrelor may impact graft patency long-term following surgery.
METHODS: In the TARGET multicenter trial, 250 CABG patients were randomized to aspirin 81 mg or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. In this observational analysis, 2 years after surgery, vein graft occlusion and clinical events were compared among subjects who agreed to a second year of double-blind study drug administration (N = 156).
RESULTS: Two-year graft assessment was performed for 142 patients (80 aspirin patients, 62 ticagrelor patients, 425 total grafts), with an overall 2-year graft occlusion rate of 10.6%. Vein graft occlusion at 2 years, the primary outcome of this study, did not significantly differ between the two groups (15.7% vs. 13.2%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = .71). The incidence of vein grafts with any disease (stenosis or occlusion) did not significantly differ between the groups (19.4% vs. 19.8%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = 1.00), and the number of patients with vein graft disease did not significantly differ between the groups (30.0% vs. 29.0%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = 1.00). Vein grafts developing new disease did not significantly differ between the two groups (1.5% vs. 3.8%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = .41). Freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events at 2 years was similar between the groups (p = .75).
CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional aspirin therapy, ticagrelor did not significantly reduce vein graft disease 2 years after CABG.
