Title: Outcome of Percutaneous Intervention in Dysfunctional Loop versus Straight Arteriovenous Grafts in Hemodialysis Patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the patency control of dysfunctioning forearm arteriovenous graft (AVG) using percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with loop versus straight grafts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2012 and March 2017, hemodialysis patients with forearm AVG were treated with PTA at two hospitals. We reviewed technical and clinical success rates of each procedure. Procedure time and patency of the graft were compared for all patients as well as for subgroups of stenosis only and thrombosis using paired-sample t-test and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (mean age, 62.11 ± 11.85 years) underwent PTA. Thirty-eight patients (58%) had loop grafts and 28 (42%) had straight grafts. Among 66 patients, 54 (82%) had thrombosis. Technical success rate was 95.5% (only stenosis: 100%; thrombosis: 94%) and the mean procedure time was 48.00 ± 16.75 minutes in all patients. Although there was a tendency towards shorter procedure time in patients with loop grafts (45.24 ± 20.24 minutes) than those with straight grafts (51.85 ± 22.76 minutes), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.217), with or without thrombi. There was no statistical significance in primary and assisted primary patency (log rank 0.78, p = 0.38 in primary patency; log rank 0.88, p = 0.35 in assisted primary patency).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests there is no different patency outcome between straight and loop arteriovenous grafts after PTA.
