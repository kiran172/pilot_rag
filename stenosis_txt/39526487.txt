Title: A miniature marvel: left main coronary stenting in a tiny newborn after left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery surgery.

Abstract: Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a congenital coronary artery anomaly comprising 0.5% of all CHDs. Stenosis in the left coronary artery implanted in the sinus valsalva is one of the complications of surgical repair.Management of coronary stenosis after surgery is very critical and difficult, especially in newborns and infants. Transcatheter procedures can be lifesaving. Herein, the coronary stenting procedure applied to a 3-month-old patient with post-surgical coronary stenosis is presented.
