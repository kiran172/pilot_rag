Title: Combination of rescue balloon pulmonary angioplasty and riociguat therapy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension with nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: A case report.

Abstract: We encountered a case of frequent nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (NSPVT) due to hemodynamically unstable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). A 78-year-old woman was taking anticoagulants for CTEPH. She had refused specific treatment for CTEPH, including pulmonary vasodilators, because she was then asymptomatic. She fell and sustained a femoral neck fracture, and she was referred to our hospital in anticipation of a surgical repair. Her condition on admission was complicated by respiratory failure, and electrocardiogram monitoring showed frequent NSPVT. A right heart catheterization revealed high mean pulmonary artery pressure with severely reduced cardiac output. Pulmonary angiography showed bilateral stenosis and multiple obstructions. Because NSPVT was attributed to low cardiac output syndrome caused by CTEPH, rescue balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) was performed, and riociguat treatment was initiated. Afterward, the NSPVT resolved. This case suggests that the combination of rescue BPA with riociguat therapy might be an immediate and effective treatment for patients with inoperable CTEPH and severe hemodynamic instability.
