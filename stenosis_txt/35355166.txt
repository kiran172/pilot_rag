Title: Optical cohorence tomography angiography findings in carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: AIM: To investigate vascular density (VD) changes in the superficial (SCP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP), radial peripapillar capillary plexus (RPCP), Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and thickness changes of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (ppRNFL) and choroid (CT) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) ipsilateral eyes of patient with internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) and to compare the obtained values with kontralateral eyes of patients with İCAS and healthy individuals.
METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional case-control study was conducted in 43 patients with a diagnosis of unilateral ICAS and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of ipsilateral eyes of patients with ICAS, group 2 consisted of contralateral eyes of patients with CAS and group 3 comprised healthy individuals without ICAS, All participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination including OCTA.
RESULTS: FAZ, Superficial parafoveal and superficial superior VD were significantly lower in group 1 compared to group 2 (p =  < 0.001, p = 0.018 and 0.021, respectively). Group 1 also had lower superficial superior (p = 0.038), superficial inferior (p = 0.034), deep superior (p = 0.034), and deep inferior (p = 0.012) VD compared to group 3. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of ppRNFLT, whereas CT and RPC mean, superior, and inside-disc VD values were significantly lower in group 1 compared to both group 2 and 3 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: OCTA measurements may be useful in preventing irreversible ocular complications by detecting early structural changes in patients with ICAS before the development of symptomatic ocular ischemic syndrome.
