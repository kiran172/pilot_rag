Title: Less-invasive decompression procedures can reduce risk of reoperation for lumbar spinal stenosis with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis extended to the lumbar segment: analysis of two retrospective cohorts.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Clinical outcomes after decompression procedures are reportedly worse for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), especially DISH extended to the lumbar segment (L-DISH). However, no studies have compared the effect of less-invasive surgery versus conventional decompression techniques for LSS with DISH. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term risk of reoperation after decompression surgery focusing on LSS with L-DISH.
METHODS: This study compared open procedure cohort (open conventional fenestration) and less-invasive procedure cohort (bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach) with ≥ 5 years of follow-up. After stratified analysis by L-DISH, patients with L-DISH were propensity score-matched by age and sex.
RESULTS: There were 57 patients with L-DISH among 489 patients in the open procedure cohort and 41 patients with L-DISH among 297 patients in the less-invasive procedure cohort. The reoperation rates in L-DISH were higher in the open than less-invasive procedure cohort for overall reoperations (25% and 7%, p = 0.026) and reoperations at index levels (18% and 5%, p = 0.059). Propensity score-matched analysis in L-DISH demonstrated that open procedures were significantly associated with increased overall reoperations (hazard ratio [HR], 6.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-27.93) and reoperations at index levels (HR, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.04-22.23); there was no difference in reoperation at other lumbar levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Less-invasive procedures had a lower risk of reoperation, especially at index levels for LSS with L-DISH. Preserving midline-lumbar posterior elements could be desirable as a decompression procedure for LSS with L-DISH.
