Title: [Progression of precerebral atherosclerosis and predictors of ischemic complications in cardiac patients].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of progression of precerebral atherosclerosis in long-term period after coronary artery bypass surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 97 procedures of carotid endarterectomy in patients after previous coronary artery bypass grafting for the period from 2006 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were previous CABG, no significant (over 60%) stenosis of internal carotid arteries at discharge after CABG. The control group included 447 patients without progression of precerebral atherosclerosis in long-term period after CABG.
RESULTS: Careful monitoring of progression of precerebral atherosclerosis and therapeutic prevention of ischemic stroke are required in patients with mild-to-moderate ICA stenosis after CABG. The most significant predictors of progression of precerebral atherosclerosis after CABG were AF (OR=1.97, 95% CI 1.04-3.73), previous occlusion of stent (OR=7.89, 95% CI=2.3-27.0), chronic brain ischemia grade II or III (OR=22.45, 95% CI=11.9-42.3), chronic kidney disease (OR=15.8, 95% CI=5.04-49.5).
CONCLUSION: It was revealed that the majority of predictors of adverse ischemic cerebral and myocardial events are indirectly associated with atrial fibrillation.
