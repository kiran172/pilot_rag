Title: Drug-Coated versus Uncoated Balloon for Side Branch Protection in Coronary Bifurcation Lesions Treated with Provisional Stenting Using Drug-Eluting Stents: A Meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Provisional stenting using drug-eluting stents (DES) has become the preferred treatment for coronary bifurcation lesions (CBLs). We performed a meta-analysis to compare the effects of side branch (SB) protection using a drug-coated balloon (DCB) versus an uncoated balloon (UCB) during the procedure.
METHODS: Relevant randomized and nonrandomized studies were identified by searching the Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang, and CNKI databases. We used a random-effect model to pool the data by incorporating the heterogeneity between the included studies.
RESULTS: Overall, 803 patients with CBLs treated with provisional stenting using DES were included from seven studies. With a follow-up duration of 6 to 12 months, SB protection with DCB was associated with a lower degree of postoperative diameter stenosis (mean difference (MD): -11.35%, 95% confidence interval (CI): -14.17 to-8.53, p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 0%) and less late lumen loss (MD: -0.19 mm, 95% CI:-0.28 to-0.10, p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 69%) of SB compared to those with UCB. Moreover, SB protection with DCB was associated with reduced risks of target lesion revascularization (risk ratio [RR]: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.88, p = 0.02; I2 = 0%) and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.66, p &lt; 0.01; I2 = 0%). Subgroup analysis according to the study design showed similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with CBL treated with provisional stenting using DES, SB protection with DCB was associated with better angiographic and clinical outcomes than those with UCB.
