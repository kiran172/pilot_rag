Title: A New "Ice Globe" Method for Dilating Leaking Cervical Esophageal Strictures.

Abstract: An esophageal stricture may develop during healing of a large esophageal perforation. When such a stricture occurs, mechanical dilatation is the treatment of choice. As in our case, if a cervical esophageal stricture and leakage are present together, the treatment becomes even more challenging. As a new treatment method, we made spherical ice globes of various sizes using molds created with a 3D printer to treat the esophageal stricture and prevent its progression. This method can be used to safely treat leaking cervical esophageal strictures. A step-by-step of how to do it has been described.
