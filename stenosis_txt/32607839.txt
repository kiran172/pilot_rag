Title: Intraoperatively self-made bovine pericardial graft for portomesenteric reconstruction in pancreatic surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Vascular encasement or infiltration of the portomesenteric veins can compromise resectability and local tumour control in pancreatic resections. So far, there is no consensus on how vascular reconstruction should be performed. Bovine pericardium has shown promising results, particularly in infected arterial vascular reconstructions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and technical success of portomesenteric venous vascular reconstruction using bovine pericardium in pancreatic resections.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of portomesenteric reconstruction using bovine pericardium (patches, self-made tube grafts) in pancreatic resections between 2014 and 2019. The primary endpoint examined was the technical success rate and short-term patency of vascular reconstruction. In addition to clinical surveillance and laboratory routine testing, patency was tested with duplex scans (4 h postoperatively) and computed tomography imaging in case of an abnormal clinical course and as part of the oncological follow-up.
RESULTS: In 15 surgical procedures (pancreaticoduodenectomy (12, 80%), pancreatic left resection (3, 20%)), vascular reconstruction was performed with superior mesenteric vein (6/15), portal vein (7/15) and the junction between superior mesenteric and splenic vein (2/15). Eighty percent of the reconstructions were tube grafts (12/15), and the remaining were patch plasties. In 13/15 (87%) of the cases, the vascular reconstruction was patent; in 2/15 (13%), there was one stenosis without reintervention need and one graft failure with complete thrombosis. Out of 15 patients, 4 major complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification (IIIa n = 2, 13%; IIIb n = 1, 7%; V n = 1, 7%) were documented. Latest re-imaging after surgery among the 10 patients with imaging follow-up more than 1 month postoperatively was after 6.5 months ((median, interquartile range 4-12 months), and clinical follow-up was at 6.7 months (median, 3.3-13 months)).
CONCLUSION: Due to its off-the-shelf availability, portomesenteric reconstruction using bovine pericardium seems to be a feasible and safe method in pancreatic resection with vascular encasement. Xenopericardial grafts can be crafted to any size and are applicable in potentially infected environment.
