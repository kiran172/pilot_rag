Title: Long-term follow-up of patients with contained annulus ruptures after TAVI: the EuropeaN COntained RupturE (ENCORE) registry.

Abstract: AIMS: The purpose of this registry was to determine the long-term outcomes in patients with asymptomatic contained annulus rupture (CR) as a rare complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The ENCORE registry is a multicentre registry (six centres across Europe) of patients with CR diagnosed on post-TAVI computed tomography angiography (CTA) or transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). A total of 21 patients (mean age 81.9±4.1 years, 81% balloon-expandable TAVI prostheses) were diagnosed with CR (mean size of lesions was 15.3±6.9 × 8.5±3.3 × 8.5±2.3 mm). Seventeen were diagnosed among a total of 1,602 consecutive routine post-TAVI CTA (incidence 1.1%), two in TEE and two in post-TAVI CTA (each conducted due to suspicion of peri-interventional complications). During a mean follow-up of 2.3±1.7 years (cumulative 48.6 patient-years), nine patients (43%) died from non-cardiac causes. None of the patients exhibited symptoms or underwent interventional treatment related to the CR; no sudden cardiac death occurred. A follow-up CTA, performed in eleven patients 240±176 days post TAVI, revealed stable CR findings in seven, regression in one, and remission in three patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our international multicentre registry demonstrate favourable long-term outcomes of CR after TAVI supporting a watch-and-wait strategy in these patients.
