Title: Matched comparison of uncoated and paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty for isolated popliteal lesions excluding bail-out stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drug-coated balloon angioplasty (DCB) in isolated popliteal lesions.
BACKGROUND: The benefit of using DCB in femoropopliteal arteries including the proximal popliteal artery has been demonstrated, but has not yet been evaluated for isolated popliteal lesions.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study includes patients requiring treatment with DCB of isolated popliteal lesions. Two cohorts matched (Plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) versus DCB) by their baseline and lesion characteristics were compared. Lesions receiving bail-out stents were excluded. Primary endpoint was the 1-year target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate. Secondary endpoints included the procedural success and complication rate, primary patency, changes in Rutherford-Becker class (RBC) and ankle-brachial index (ABI).
RESULTS: One hundred and seven patients were included in this study. More than one third of the patients had critical limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) (35 % (POBA) versus 40.4 % (DCB), p = 0.354. The technical success rate of the procedure was 85.1 % (n = 40/47) in the DCB group and 83.3 % (n = 60) in the POBA group (p = 0.510). There were three complications in the POBA group (5.0 %) but none in the DCB group (p = 0.172). After 12 months, in the entire cohort 14 patients (13.1 %) had to undergo a TLR. The TLR-free survival was 81.7 % in the POBA and 93.6 % in the DCB group (p = 0.060). Primary patency rates after POBA and DCB were 65.1 % and 87.5 % at 6 months (p = 0.024), respectively. At 12 months, the patency rates were 71.7 % and 85.1 % (p = 0.076), respectively. For both treatment arms, there was a significant improvement in ABI and RBC compared to baseline. Four patients from the DCB group and two from the POBA group received a minor amputation (p = 0.232). One patient in the DCB group died within 12 months.
CONCLUSION: After one year the use of DCB is by trend more effective for the treatment of isolated popliteal stenosis compared to POBA. A larger scale prospective study is mandatory.
