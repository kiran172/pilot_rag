Title: In-hospital and Readmission Outcomes With Percutaneous Balloon Mitral Valvuloplasty.

Abstract: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is primarily performed for rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS). Therefore, limited data exist on PBMV in countries with a low incidence of rheumatic disease. Using the Nationwide Readmission Database, we examined trends in in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission among patients who received PBMV for rheumatic and non-rheumatic MS. We also examined the change in 90-day hospitalization rate before vs after PBMV. Between 2016 and 2019, there were 1109 hospitalizations in which patients received PBMV for rheumatic (n = 955, 86.1%) vs non-rheumatic MS (n = 154, 13.9%). The all-cause in-hospital mortality for rheumatic and non-rheumatic MS did not change over time (0.9% → 2.0%, P = 0.94, and 5.9% → 9.5%, P = 0.09 respectively). Similarly, the 30-day readmission for patients with rheumatic and non-rheumatic MS did not change over time (12.4% → 9.9%, P = 0.26, and 4.4% → 10.5%, P = 0.30, respectively). The 90-day all-cause hospitalization rate remained the same before vs after PBMV for rheumatic and non-rheumatic MS (25.5% → 21.8%; P = 0.14, and 24.0% → 33.7%; P = 0.19, respectively). Although no statistically significant change was noted over time for trends in in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmission, or even in the change in 90-day all-cause hospitalizations before and after PBMV for both types of MS, among those with non-rheumatic MS, there was a signal of an increase in the in-hospital mortality, and 30-day readmission, even more, there was 29% relative increase in 90-day hospitalizations after PBMV. Future studies are needed to examine the role of PBMV in patients with non-rheumatic MS.
