Title: [How to deal with elevated gradient following TAVR?].

Abstract: Over the past two decades, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a safe and effective therapeutic option for symptomatic and severe aortic stenosis, regardless of the surgical risk spectrum. With the expansion of TAVI indications to low-risk and younger patients, it is crucial to ensure satisfactory and durable hemodynamic outcomes to guarantee transcatheter heart valve (THV) longevity. However, secondary THV dysfunction may occur, often manifested by an increased transvalvular gradient. According to VARC-3 criteria, these dysfunctions can be attributed to four main mechanisms: 1) structural valve deterioration; 2) non-structural valve dysfunction; 3) thrombosis; 4) and endocarditis. Each mechanism leads to specific abnormalities, requiring a systematic diagnostic approach and appropriate treatment. This article illustrates, through two clinical cases, the diagnosis and management of secondary transvalvular gradient elevation after TAVI.
