Title: Physiological reno-portal bypass in liver transplantation with non-tumorous portal vein thrombosis.

Abstract: Reno-portal anastomosis (RPA) in presence of spleno-renal shunts (SRS) is a physiological option to restore blood flow in liver transplantation with portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Diffuse splanchnic venous system thrombosis (complex PVT) is its main indication but RPA proved to be useful in selected cases of less extensive thrombosis (non-complex PVT). Up until now only two monocentric and one multicentric case series has been published on this topic in addition to few anecdotal reports. After 2014, we introduced RPA in our institution to manage some cases of complex PVT in presence of SRS. Here, we present the evolution of indication to RPA. From 2014 to 2020, we performed ten RPA: nine patients presented non-complex and one complex PVT. Overall early and late complication rates were 66.6% and 50%, respectively. Two patients developed RPA stenosis, treated by interventional radiology. Self-resolving acute kidney injury (AKI) was observed in three cases. No re-transplantation was necessary. RPA was patent in all patients, with a mean follow-up of 41.9 months. The overall patient survival was 70% at 1 year and 60% at 3 and 5 years. Four patients died at 1, 2, 3 and 20 months from LT. Causes of deaths were, respectively, stroke, cerebral infection, sepsis (MOF) and sudden variceal bleeding in sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. The relative simplicity and effectiveness of RPA in presence of SRS allowed us to rely more and more often on this technique in liver transplantation with challenging non-complex PVT.
