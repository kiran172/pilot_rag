Title: Upper Airway Nerve Block for Rigid Bronchoscopy in the Patients with Tracheal Stenosis: A Case Serie.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rigid bronchoscopy is often used to diagnose and treat the location of resection of the tracheal stenosis. It is a selective procedure for the dilatation of tracheal stenosis, especially when accompanied by respiratory distress.
OBJECTIVES: We introduced patients who were diagnosed with tracheal stenosis and candidate for rigid bronchoscopy dilatation by the upper airway nerve blocks.
METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted on 17 patients who underwent dilatation with rigid bronchoscopy in tracheal stenosis at Hospitals affiliated with Babol University of Medical Sciences from 2002 to 2017. The patients were given three nerve blocks, 6 bilateral superior laryngeal nerve block, bilateral glossopharyngeal nerve block, and recurrent laryngeal nerve block (transtracheal) before awake rigid bronchoscopy using 2% lidocaine. We evaluated the demographic data, the cause of tracheal stenosis, the quality of the airway nerve block (Intubation score), patients' satisfaction from bronchoscopy and thoracic surgeons' satisfaction. Complications of nerve blocks were recorded.
RESULTS: From 2002 to 2017, 17 patients (14 were male and 3 were) female with tracheal stenosis who were candidates for dilatation with bronchoscopy and accepted the upper nerve block were included. The quality of the block was acceptable in 16 (94%) patients. 15 patients received fentanyl, and only two patients did not need to intravenous sedation. The mean age of patients was 29.59 ± 11.59. The average satisfaction of the surgeon was 8.82 ± 1.13 and the satisfaction of patients with anesthesia was 8.89 ± 1.16. There was one serious complication (laryngospasm) in one patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The upper airway nerve block method is a suitable anesthesia technique for patients with tracheal stenosis who are candidates for the tracheal dilatation with rigid bronoscopy, especially when the patient has respiratory distress and has not been evaluated before surgery.
