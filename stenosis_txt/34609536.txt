Title: [Chronic brachioradial pruritus in cervical spine meningioma].

Abstract: We report a case of a 57-year-old slightly obese woman with localized itch on the arms accompanied by stinging and burning sensations. A few excoriations were observed upon clinical examination. The MRI examination of the cervical spine revealed a meningioma at C5/C6 level. The diagnosis of brachioradial pruritus due to compression of the cervical myelon was further supported by a positive ice-pack sign. Disc herniation or prolapse, foraminal stenosis and degenerative alterations constitute other possible causes of brachioradial pruritus.
