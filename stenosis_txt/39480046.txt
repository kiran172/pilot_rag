Title: Traumatic Central Cord Syndrome.

Abstract: Central cord syndrome (CCS) is the most common form of incomplete spinal cord injury, with an increasing incidence with the aging population. This is a clinical diagnosis defined by weakness greater in the upper than lower extremities and often prominent sensory complaints in the hands. CCS is typically seen in individuals with underlying cervical canal stenosis from spondylosis who experience sudden forceful movement of the neck, especially hyperextension, resulting in contusion of the spinal cord. The prognosis in CCS is relatively favorable with improvement in neurological deficits, except for fine motor control of the hands. Neuropathic pain may persist even in those with excellent motor recovery. Nonoperative management may be appropriate in selected patients, but surgery is usually necessary in those with poor neurological recovery or further deterioration. The optimal timing of surgical intervention has not been defined, but recent evidence suggests that early surgery (≤24 h) may lead to greater neurological recovery, shorter hospital stay, and fewer inpatient complications. Management in any given patient must be considered in the context of the anatomy and location of spinal cord compression, the presence of fractures or ligamentous instability, the temporal course of signs and symptoms, as well as the patient's overall health.
