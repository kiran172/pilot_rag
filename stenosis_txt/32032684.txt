Title: Impact of Spinal Defects on Urinary and Sexual Outcome in Adults With Anorectal Malformations-A Cross-sectional Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of spinal defects on urinary function, sexual outcome and quality of life in adult patients born with anorectal malformations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study at Odense University Hospital in Denmark was conducted. From 1985 to 2000, 93 patients were found eligible for participation. Twenty-seven (29%) consented to participate. One patient refrained from clinical examinations. Patients were examined with magnetic resonance imaging, uroflowmetry, and validated questionnaires on urinary function, sexual function, and quality of life.
RESULTS: There were 14 were females and 13 were males, median age of 25 (range 19-31) years and 23 (18-32) years, respectively. The type of anorectal malformations in females were vestibular fistula (n = 6), anocutaneous fistula (n = 4), anal stenosis (n = 3), and cloaca (n = 1). In males the type of malformations were anocutaneous fistula (n = 4), bulbar fistula (n = 4), rectovesical fistula (n = 2), anal stenosis (n = 1), rectal atresia (n = 1), and anal atresia with no fistula (n = 1). Patients with spinal defects had a lower average voiding rate compared to patients with normal spinal anatomy (P .03), a lower voiding-related quality of life (P .02), and a tendency was observed toward a worse total urinary incontinence-related quality of life score (P .06). Moreover in patients with spinal defect a tendency was seen toward a worse general quality of life (P .09).
CONCLUSION: Spinal defects detected by magnetic resonance imaging in adults with anorectal malformations were found to be associated with urinary voiding function.
