Title: Single coronary artery with aortic valve replacement followed by aortic root replacement due to endocarditis: A case report.

Abstract: A woman with a single coronary artery underwent aortic valve replacement due to aortic stenosis. Two years later, she developed an aortic annular abscess around the right coronary cusp and non-coronary cusp. Significant adhesions to the right coronary artery (RCA) resulted from the abscess, making artery separation challenging, and raising concerns about potential future RCA stenosis. The patient subsequently underwent aortic root replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. Utilizing a freestyle valve and a saphenous vein graft for the RCA. Following the procedure, the patient was discharged and has remained symptom-free without any recurrence of infection for 2â€‰years.
