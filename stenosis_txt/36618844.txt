Title: A rare case of fibromuscular dysplasia with multifocal coronary artery involvement evaluated by intravascular ultrasound.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory vascular disease that results in arterial stenosis. The lesions in FMD are commonly found in the renal and extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries, but the prevalence of FMD with lesions in the coronary artery is unclear. Although the vascular morphology of coronary artery lesion in FMD is mostly dissection, the following case of FMD showed the stenotic and aneurysmal lesions in coronary arteries, which was treated by percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Several vascular imaging modalities including computed tomographic angiography and catheter angiography are used for diagnosing FMD, however, the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging of the coronary artery in FMD has not been well studied. Here we describe a rare case of FMD involving multifocal coronary artery lesions with coronary aneurysm which was evaluated by IVUS imaging.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: The vascular morphologies of coronary artery lesion in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) mostly appear as coronary dissection, however, multifocal stenotic and aneurysmal lesions can occur in coronary arteries in FMD as the following case shows. The intravascular ultrasound findings of the stenotic coronary lesions in FMD, that were circumferential thickening of intima with various echo patterns and echolucent circumferential thickened media, may help in the diagnosis of FMD involving coronary arteries.
