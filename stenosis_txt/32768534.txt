Title: Treatment of an Infected, Bovine Pericardial Carotid Patch: Excision and Reconstruction with a Superficial Femoral Arterial Interposition Graft.

Abstract: Carotid patch infection is a rare complication but one often associated with severe morbidity, including hemorrhage, stroke, cranial nerve injury, and mortality. We present a case of a gram-negative bacterial infection of a bovine pericardial carotid patch. Treatment ultimately required patch explantation and reconstruction with a femoral arterial interposition graft.
