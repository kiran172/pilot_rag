Title: Effect of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement on Retinal Layer Thickness Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with clinically significant cerebral microembolism and cognitive status changes. There are no data on the impact of TAVR on retinal layers. We assessed the influence of TAVR on the retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell complex (GCC), and macular thickness (MT) measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Elderly patients (n = 50) with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR were included in this study (mean age: 78.5 ± 6.9 years). Retinal nerve fiber layer, GCC, and MT were measured with SD-OCT by an ophthalmologist before and on the first day and in the first month after TAVR. The average MT was significantly increased on the first day after TAVR compared with the basal value (P = .04). Ganglion cell complex thickness was significantly thinner on the first day after TAVR than the basal value in the inner inferior quadrant and outer temporal quadrant of the left eye (P = .03 and .04, respectively). Postoperative changes observed on the first day compared with the preoperative period returned to basal values in the first month. In conclusion, TAVR did not cause permanent changes in retinal layers.
