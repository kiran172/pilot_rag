Title: Tubular Pouch Technique Using Aortic Tissues for Single Coronary Artery Transfer.

Abstract: A single coronary artery with a single ostium from sinus 2 (2 R L Cx) is rare and difficult to transfer. A 6-day-old male neonate was diagnosed with dextro-transposition of the great arteries with an intact ventricular septum at birth. Computed tomography revealed the presence of a single coronary artery with a single ostium from sinus 2 (2 R L Cx). We performed a new coronary transfer technique involving a tubular pouch using the original aortic tissue for this single coronary artery. The postoperative course was uneventful, and postoperative computed tomography revealed a smooth coronary route with no stenosis.
