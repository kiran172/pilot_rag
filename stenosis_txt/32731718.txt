Title: Peculiar features of aortic wall structure among children with coarctation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study to evaluate the peculiarities of the aortic wall structure at the place of coarctation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Studying of the aortic sections removed during operative correction at the place of constriction. 10 children at the age between 1 to 6 months were undergone the operation. Intraoperative aortic biopsy specimens were observed in 10% neutral formalin. Histologic sections were prepared in a conventional way followed by staining them with hematoxylin-eosin.
RESULTS: Results: Histological examination in the areas of constriction revealed that the endothelium in all the preparations had poor expressiveness. The most significant changes were recorded in the middle layer of the aorta in the form of reduced development of elastic fibers, their fragmentation and chaotic arrangement. Angiomatosis with the formation of thin-layer small vessels by capillary type was found out. In all the preparations, areas of emptying of cells and fibers of the middle cover with the formation of cystic structures were revealed.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The histological examination has revealed changes in the structure of the aorta wall, which may indicate the systemic nature of the lesion and make it possible to consider coarctation of the aorta to be a manifestation of systemic vasculopathy. The above-mentioned facts determine the need for a more detailed examination of children with the specified pathology at different stages of observation.
