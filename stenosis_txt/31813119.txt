Title: Cardiovascular Comorbidities in Psoriatic Disease.

Abstract: Psoriatic disease (PsD) is a multisystem inflammatory disorder with a high prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors contributing to accelerated atherosclerosis and its sequelae. Imaging studies, notably with ultrasound, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning have confirmed significant atherosclerotic change with plaque formation and vessel stenosis. Atherosclerosis is likely driven by a combination of traditional risk factors which occur more frequently in PsD and by systemic inflammation with associated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. While the mechanisms driving atherosclerosis in PsD are incompletely understood, it is now best practice to try to minimize the impact of CV risk factors by regular assessment, prevention, and treatment and also by ensuring that inflammatory musculoskeletal and cutaneous disease is adequately suppressed. Future studies need to focus on improving our understanding of the mechanisms driving atherosclerosis and, as a consequence, developing more rationale approaches to prevention and treatment.
