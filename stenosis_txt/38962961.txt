Title: Accuracy of subtraction fractional flow reserve with computed tomography in identifying early revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic performance of fractional flow reserve with computed tomography (FFR-CT) is affected by the presence of calcified plaque. Subtraction can remove the influence of calcification in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to increase confidence in the diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis. Our purpose is to investigate the accuracy of post-subtraction FFR-CT in predicting early revascularization.
DESIGN: Based on CCTA data of 237 vessels from 79 patients with coronary artery disease, subtraction CCTA images were obtained at a local post-processing workstation, and the conventional and post-subtraction FFR-CT measurements and the difference in proximal and distal FFR-CT values of the narrowest segment of the vessel (ΔFFR-CT) were analyzed for their accuracy in predicting early coronary artery hemodynamic reconstruction.
RESULTS: With FFR-CT ≤ 0.8 as the criterion, the accuracy of conventional and post-subtraction FFR-CT measurements in predicting early revascularization was 73.4% and 77.2% at the patient level, and 64.6% and 72.2% at the vessel level, respectively. The specificity of post-subtraction FFR-CT measurements was significantly higher than that of conventional FFR-CT at both the patient and vessel levels (P of 0.013 and 0.015, respectively). At the vessel level, the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic was 0.712 and 0.797 for conventional and post-subtraction ΔFFR-CT, respectively, showing a difference (P = 0.047), with optimal cutoff values of 0.07 and 0.11, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The post-subtraction FFR-CT measurements enhance the specificity in predicting early revascularization. The post-subtraction ΔFFR-CT value of the stenosis segment > 0.11 may be an important indicator for early revascularization.
