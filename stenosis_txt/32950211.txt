Title: [Assessment of peripheral artery disease in proven coronary patients in Abidjan Heart Institute of Côte d'Ivoire].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is mainly due to atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of peripheral arterial disease in proven coronary artery disease and to determine the associated factors in our context.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included in a cross-sectional descriptive and analytical study 224 patients with proven coronary artery disease confirmed on coronary angiography from March 1 to October 30, 2019. It took place in the external exploration department of the Abidjan Heart Institute. An ultrasonographic exploration of the supra-aortic trunks and arteries of the lower extremity with measurement of the ankle brachial index (ABI) was carried out.
RESULTS: The mean age was 57.4±10.9 years (27-81years). There was a clear male predominance with a sex-ratio of 5. The prevalence of carotid artery disease was 56.4% of patients. The main factors associated with elevated Intima Media Thickness (IMT) and the presence of carotid plaques were male sex (OR=8.8; P=0.038), smoking (OR=2.5; P=0.049) and multi-truncular involvement (OR=3.2; P=0.014). In the lower extremities, there was a prevalence of peripheral arterial disease of 48.5%. The main factors associated with the decrease of ABI were age ≥50 years (OR=2.6; P=0.043), diabetes (OR=2.8; P=0.02), dyslipidemia (OR=3.8; P=0.001) and pluri-truncular involvement (OR=4.5; P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The presence of significant coronary artery disease in our context is associated with a high prevalence of peripheral carotid artery and lower extremity artery disease. This is all the more so as we are male, over 50 years old, pluri-truncular with many cardiovascular risk factors.
