Title: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy for shunt malfunction in the pediatric population: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Despite growing published evidence of the merits of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) instead of shunt revision at the time of shunt malfunction (secondary ETV), concerns about its efficacy and complications remain and ETV is still not used widely in this context. This study aimed to carry out a comprehensive meta-analysis and reports on the success and safety of secondary ETV in the pediatric age group.
METHODS: In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central were undertaken from database inception to September 7, 2022. ETV success was defined as the lack of need for a shunt and was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were the rates of complications and mortality. A random-effects model was used. Summary-level meta-regression was performed to identify predictors for success in accordance with the ETV Success Score (ETVSS).
RESULTS: Sixteen studies reporting on 584 patients who underwent secondary ETV for shunt malfunction were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled mean (95% CI) age was 6.1 (3-9) years, and 57.0% of patients were male. The pooled prevalence rates of the hydrocephalus etiologies were as follows: aqueduct stenosis (39.3%); myelomeningocele (27.6%); postinfectious (17.1%); posthemorrhagic (13.0%); neoplasm (13.0%); and malformation (11.3%). The overall pooled success rates of ETV for shunt malfunction at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months were 65.69% (95% CI 52%-77%, prediction interval 47%-81%, I2 = 0, p = 0.775); 63.25% (95% CI 54%-72%, prediction interval 38%-83%, I2 = 65, p < 0.001); and 53.37% (95% CI 24%-81%, prediction interval 1%-99%, I2 = 47, p = 0.154). The overall pooled prevalence of intraoperative bleeding was 4.96% (95% CI 0%-64%, prediction interval 0%-99%, I2 = 85, p < 0.001). The overall rates of complications were low, with new neurological deficit (transient or permanent) having the highest rate at 1.61% (95% CI 0.68%-3.72%, prediction interval 0.67%-3.78%, I2 = 0, p > 0.999). On meta-regression, age (p = 0.138), proportion of patients with postinfectious hydrocephalus (p = 0.8736), and number of shunt revisions (p = 0.1775) were not statistically significant predictors of secondary ETV success at 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that secondary ETV after shunt malfunction in pediatric patients is a feasible option with acceptable success rates and low complication rates. Clinical trial registration no.: CRD42022359573 (PROSPERO).
