Title: Simultaneous stent implantation for pulmonary artery bifurcation stenosis in infants.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary artery (PA) bifurcation stenosis often requires simultaneous stent placement, which may be technically challenging. Limited data exist regarding this practice in infants. We aim to report the procedural outcomes and safety of bifurcation stent placement in infants.
METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective review of infants younger than 12 months who underwent simultaneous stent placement for PA bifurcation stenosis from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2019.
RESULTS: Seventeen infants underwent simultaneous PA bifurcation stent placement. The median age was 6.4 months (1.1-10.1 months), and weight was 5.8 kg (3-10.6 kg). Nine (52.9%) patients had had prior PA intervention. Most stents were placed in central PAs (28, 82.4%), followed by lobar branches (6, 17.6%). All patients received pre-mounted stents. The peak gradient across each branch decreased from 47.4 ± 16 to 18.7 ± 13 mm Hg (P less than .0001). The right ventricle to systemic systolic pressure ratio decreased from systemic (1.0 ± 0.3) to just over half systemic (0.58 ± 0.2) (P = .0001). The minimum vessel diameter increased from 3.6 ± 1.5 to 6.0 ± 1.9 mm (P less than .0001). There were 4 (23.5%) patients with high severity adverse events. There were no procedure-related deaths. The median follow-up period was 83.8 months (5.3 months-19.4 years). All patients had subsequent PA re-intervention at a median time of 8.1 months (2.9 months-8.8 years), and median time to re-operation was 19.1 months (2.9 months-7.5 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous PA stent placement is an effective strategy for relief of bifurcation stenosis in infants. Future transcatheter interventions are necessary to account for patient growth, but may delay the need for re-operation.
