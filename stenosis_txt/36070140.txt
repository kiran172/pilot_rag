Title: Safety and Efficacy of Carotid Artery Stenting with the CGuard Double-layer Stent in Acute Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Double-layer stents show promising results in preventing periinterventional and postinterventional embolic events in elective settings of carotid artery stenting (CAS). We report a single-center experience with the CGuard stent in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion with or without intracranial occlusion.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who received a CGuard stent in the setting of AIS at our institution. Neuroimaging and clinical data were analyzed with the following primary endpoints: technical feasibility, acute and delayed stent occlusion or thrombosis, distal embolism, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and functional outcome at 3 months.
RESULTS: In 33 patients, stenting with the CGuard was performed. Stent deployment was successful in all patients (28 with tandem occlusions, 5 with isolated ICA occlusion). Transient acute in-stent thrombus formation occurred in three patients (9%) without early stent occlusion. Delayed, asymptomatic stent occlusion was seen in 1 patient (3%) after 49 days. Asymptomatic periinterventional distal emboli occurred in 2 patients (6%), 1 patient experienced a transient ischemic attack 79 days after the procedure and 1 patient (3%) developed sICH. Favorable clinical outcome (mRS 0-2) at 3 months was achieved in 12 patients (36%) and the mortality rate was 24%.
CONCLUSION: The CGuard use in emergencies was technically feasible, the safety has to be confirmed by further multicentric studies.
