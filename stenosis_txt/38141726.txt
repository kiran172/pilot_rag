Title: Impact of carotid artery stenosis on outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid Artery Stenosis (CAS) is common in elderly patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). However, the impact of CAS on the outcomes of TAVR is unclear.
PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the clinical and periprocedural outcomes in patients with and without CAS undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched until February 2023. We included studies that performed a direct comparison of outcomes of TAVR in CAS versus non-CAS patients. Data was extracted from published reports and the ROBINS-I tool was utilized for quality assessment. The R studio software (version 4.2.2) was adopted for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Five observational studies and 111.915 patients were included. The mean age was 80.7 ± 8.2 years and 46.3% were female. The risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack was elevated in the group of patients with CAS (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.07-1.95; p = 0.016). In contrast, myocardial infarction (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.05-1.47; p = 0.074) and all-cause mortality (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.73-1.35; p = 0.95) were not significantly different between CAS and non-CAS groups. Acute kidney injury and new pacemaker implantation did not differ between patients with and without CAS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CAS is significantly associated with cerebrovascular events in patients undergoing TAVR, without significantly impacting all-cause mortality. Further prospective studies are needed for a more granular assessment of additional determinants of this association, such as unilateral vs. bilateral involvement and whether there is a threshold of CAS severity for increased risk.
