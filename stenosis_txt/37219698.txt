Title: Calcium Fracture and Device Over Expansion in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Bicuspid Aortic Valves.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease (BAV) has potential risks of under expansion and non-circularity which may compromise long-term durability. This study aims to investigate calcium fracture and balloon over expansion in balloon-expandable TAVs on the stent deformation with the aid of simulation. BAV patients treated with the SAPIEN 3 Ultra with pre- and post-TAVR CTs were analyzed (n = 8). Simulations of the stent deployment were performed (1) with baseline simulation allowing calcium fracture, (2) without allowable calcium fracture and (3) with balloon over expansion (1 mm larger diameter). When compared to post CT, baseline simulations had minimal error in expansion (2.5% waist difference) and circularity (3.0% waist aspect ratio difference). When compared to baseline, calcium fracture had insignificant impact on the expansion (- 0.5% average waist difference) and circularity (- 1.6% average waist aspect ratio difference). Over expansion had significantly larger expansion compared to baseline (15.4% average waist difference) but had insignificant impact on the circularity (- 0.5% waist aspect ratio difference). We conclude that stent deformation can be predicted with minimal error, calcium fracture has small differences on the final stent deformation except in extreme calcified cases, and balloon over expansion expands the waist closer to nominal values.
