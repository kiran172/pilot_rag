Title: Widespread mesenteric phlebosclerosis presenting as intestinal obstruction due to stenosis of the right-sided colon.

Abstract: Mesenteric phlebosclerosis is a rare form of intestinal ischemia characterized by thickening of the right-sided colon and calcification of the mesenteric vein. We describe the case of a 58-year-old woman admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and distension. An abdominal computed tomography study revealed remarkable dilatation and fluid collection of the small intestine compatible with intestinal obstruction, which was considered to be the result of stenosis of the ascending colon. The thickened wall of the cecum and ascending colon was associated with calcification of the colonic wall and mesenteric veins. Colonoscopy showed dark purple discoloration of the edematous mucosa from the splenic flexure through the hepatic flexure, at which point the colonoscope could not be advanced further because of stenosis of the ascending colon. Over 10Â years previously, the patient had taken an herbal medicine containing gardenia fruit, which can cause mesenteric phlebosclerosis. An extensive colonic resection was performed after intestinal decompression. This case highlights extensive mesenteric phlebosclerosis causing intestinal obstruction from the cecum through the proximal portion of the sigmoid colon, which was treated with extensive colonic resection.
