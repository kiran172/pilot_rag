Title: Bicuspid aortic valve and sports: From the echocardiographic evaluation to the eligibility for sports competition.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect in adults. Although a BAV may remain without clinical consequences for a lifetime, it can deteriorate in aortic valve stenosis and regurgitation and aortic dilatation. Unfortunately, the impact of regular training on patients with BAV and its natural course is not fully understood, although preliminary evidence suggests that the progression of valvular disease occurs primarily in an independent manner from sports practice. The current review aims to report how to perform a comprehensive echocardiographic examination in athletes with BAV and analyze the current literature on the influence of sports practice and how it impacts the aortic valve in athletes with BAV. The article also summarizes the current recommendations on sports eligibility and disqualification for competitive athletes with BAV.
