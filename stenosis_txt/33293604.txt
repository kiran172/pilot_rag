Title: Postoperative nutritional outcomes and quality of life-related complications of proximal versus total gastrectomy for upper-third early gastric cancer: a meta-analysis.

Abstract: Although proximal gastrectomy (PG) provides superior nutritional outcomes over total gastrectomy (TG) in upper-third early gastric cancer (EGC), surgeons are reluctant to perform PG due to the high rate of postoperative reflux. This meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively compare operative outcomes, nutritional outcomes, and quality of life-related complications between TG and PG performed with esophagogastrostomy (EG), jejunal interposition, or double-tract reconstruction (DTR) to reduce reflux after PG. After searching PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science databases, 25 studies comparing PG with TG in upper-third EGC published up to October 2020 were identified. PG with DTR was similar to TG regarding operative outcomes. Patients who underwent PG with DTR had less weight reduction (weighted mean difference [WMD] 4.29; 95% confidence interval [0.51-8.07]), reduced hemoglobin loss (WMD 5.74; [2.56-8.93]), and reduced vitamin B<sub>12</sub> supplementation requirement (odds ratio [OR] 0.06; [0.00-0.89]) compared to patients who underwent TG. PG with EG caused more reflux (OR 5.18; [2.03-13.24]) and anastomotic stenosis (OR 3.94; [2.40-6.46]) than TG. However, PG with DTR was similar to TG regarding quality of life-related complications including reflux, anastomotic stenosis, and leakage. Hence, PG with DTR can be recommended for patients with upper-third EGC considering its superior postoperative nutritional outcomes.
