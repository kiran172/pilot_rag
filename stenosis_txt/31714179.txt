Title: Flow resistance coefficient analysis of left anterior descending artery stenosis: A preliminary study.

Abstract: As a non-invasive diagnosis method, computed tomographic angiography-based computational fluid dynamics is used to estimate fractional flow reserve of coronary arteries (FFRct). However, FFRct uses hypothetical hemodynamic flow conditions, and thus FFRct might cause mismatches (fractional flow reserve &gt; 0.8) with invasive fractional flow reserve (≤0.8). Additional computational fluid dynamics-based criteria are still needed to improve the accuracy of non-invasive diagnosis. In this article, a new concept of computed tomographic angiography-based flow resistance coefficient (FRCct) is proposed, and it tests pressure drops at coronary arteries under different blood flow rates and returns two constant flow resistance coefficients (A and B) for each artery. Specifically, 30 patients who were suspected to meet the treatment indication of their left anterior descending stenosis were tested with invasive fractional flow reserve and FRCct. The invasive fractional flow reserve divided the patients into a safe group (invasive fractional flow reserve &gt; 0.8, 15 patients) and a sick group (invasive fractional flow reserve ≤ 0.8, 15 patients). A following FRCct indicated that the flow resistance coefficient always displayed a low value (A = 0.0039 ± 2.7e-5; B = 0.079 ± 0.0025) for the safe group, while the flow resistance coefficient always exhibited a high value (A = 0.0235 ± 0.001; B = 0.270 ± 0.108) for the sick group. The results of the statistical test indicated that the p-value was less than 0.05 for both A and B of the two groups. In conclusion, in addition to the FFRct, FRCct is a supplementary non-invasive method to evaluate the treatment indication of left anterior descending stenosis.
