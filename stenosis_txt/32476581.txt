Title: Facet Arthrosis and Spinal Lipomatosis-Related Spinal Canal Stenosis.

Abstract: A 33-year-old man was referred to physical therapy by his primary care physician for low back pain that had been present for 7 months. The neurologic screen with mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs was of concern for spinal cord involvement. The primary care physician was contacted and magnetic resonance imaging ordered. Facet arthrosis and epidural lipomatosis were present, resulting in thoracic and lumbar spinal stenosis. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2020;50(6):345. doi:10.2519/jospt.2020.9059.
