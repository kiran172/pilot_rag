Title: Fatal cerebral air embolism post esophageal endoscopy with dilatation: A case report.

Abstract: This is a case of a patient who underwent an esophageal dilatation for benign esophageal strictures. As a consequence of the procedure, she developed an esophageal rupture and multiple cerebral and cerebellar air emboli resulting in infarction. The patient died after being placed on comfort care measures. The postmortem examination revealed focal breach of the esophageal mucosa but no sites of cardiac or vascular shunting that could account for the transit of air from the esophagus to the central nervous system. The phenomenon of vascular air entry as a consequence of upper gastrointestinal endoscopic intervention is an uncommon but very serious complication of balloon dilatation therapy. Instances of progression to intracranial arterial gas embolism are even less common, but are well described in a small number of case reports. We present a fatal case of central nervous system air embolism post-balloon dilatation therapy with associated antemortem imaging, autopsy, and microscopic images followed by a discussion of potential mechanisms of entry of air into the brain.
