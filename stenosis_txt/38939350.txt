Title: Beyond Cardiology: A Rare Encounter With Small Bowel Obstruction Disguised as Inferior Wall ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: ST segment elevations (STEs) on an electrocardiogram (EKG) gravitate immediate attention to the heart. However, these EKG changes can sometimes be the result of noncardiac pathologies. Here, we present an interesting case of small bowel obstruction (SBO) masquerading as an inferior wall myocardial infarction. A 77-year-old woman with a history of aortic stenosis status postsurgical aortic valve replacement presented with chest pain. Workup revealed elevated high-sensitivity troponins and STE in the inferior leads. She subsequently underwent a left heart catheterization, which showed no critical plaques or stenosis. Persistent abdominal pain prompted further evaluation with a computed tomography scan of the abdomen, which demonstrated evidence of SBO. Conservative treatment with bowel decompression resulted in symptom improvement and complete resolution of the STEs on a follow-up EKG. This case underscores the importance of considering noncardiac etiologies, such as SBO, in the differential diagnosis of STE on EKG for accurate diagnosis and management.
