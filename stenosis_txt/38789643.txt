Title: Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of immediate postoperative symptomatic spinal epidural hematoma after lumbar stenosis surgical decompression in the elderly: a proof-of-concept case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Symptomatic spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is one of the most feared complications and source of litigation in spine surgery. Its occurrence rises up to 2% in minimally invasive spine surgery. In parts of the world where the population is aging, more fragile patients are expected to undergo degenerative spine surgery. Management of the SSEH includes emergent spine MRI, though some experts advocate for direct second-look surgery without imaging. Then, an urgent revision surgery under general anesthesia for hematoma evacuation is warranted. We report the case of a threatening SSEH in an 88-year-old patient after lumbar spine stenosis surgery. In order to spare a second general anesthesia for this fragile patient, we opted for a percutaneous ultra-sound guided drainage of the hematoma under local anesthesia as a first line treatment. The procedure was successful, we report an instant relief of his neurological deficit while performing the procedure.
CONCLUSION: Ultra-sound guided percutaneous drainage of hyperacute SSEH successfully avoided a revision surgery. It spared a second general anesthesia in a fragile patient. This procedure could be an alternative first-line treatment of SSEH for fragile patients.
