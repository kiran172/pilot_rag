Title: Pure Interstitial 7q21.3-q 31.1 Duplication: A Rare Segmental Genomic Aneuploidy: Case Report and Review of Cases with Distal and Similar Segment Involved.

Abstract: In children with developmental delay (DD) and neurologic impairment, diagnosis can be challenging because of the wide spectrum of causes. Since the last decade, the use of array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) offered a great contribution to get a diagnosis in complex phenotypes. The chromosome 7 is subject of interest in medical genetics because of its frequent association with chromosome aberrations, rearrangements, and deletions involving clinical manifestations. We hereby reported a 3-year-old male child patient with severe neuro-DD, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and pulmonary stenosis, whose array CGH analysis disclosed a duplication of 14.4â€‰Mb on chromosome 7 (7q21.3-7q31.1). By reviewing the current literature to date, we first reported on neurologic and dysmorphic anomalies related to this rearrangement which was not previously reported.
