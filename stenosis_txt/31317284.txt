Title: Safety and completeness of using indocyanine green videoangiography combined with digital subtraction angiography for aneurysm surgery in a hybrid operating theater.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and completeness of using intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography (ICGV) combined with intraoperative angiography (IOA) for aneurysm clipping in a hybrid operating room (hOR). All patients who underwent microsurgical clipping in the hOR were identified from prospectively maintained neurosurgical databases. Medical charts and operative videos with ICGV and IOA were reviewed to determine the adequacy of clipping, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Fifty-four cerebral aneurysms (ruptured, 31; unruptured, 23) in 50 patients (mean age, 59.4 ± 10.9 y; M:F, 22:28) were evaluated with ICGV and IOA during clipping. Additional IOA led to a clip adjustment during surgery in 9/54 (16.7%) aneurysms for which ICGV had been initially performed. Post-clip perforator compromise occurred in two (3.7%) cases, with a patient with an unruptured aneurysm experiencing permanent injury (grade 3 hemiparesis) and patient with a ruptured aneurysm experiencing transient deficit. Post-clip parent vessel stenosis occurred in one (1.9%) case; however, an ischemic event did not occur because the flow patency was identified by IOA. No other patients with unruptured aneurysms developed new neurologic deficits at discharge. Favorable outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Score [GOS], 4 or 5) were observed in 26/31 patients with ruptured aneurysms. Five patients had unfavorable outcomes (GOS, 2 or 3) from the initial insult. Post-treatment angiography within 1 week showed complete occlusion in 52 (96.3%) aneurysms and minor remnants in two (3.7%) aneurysms. Using combined ICGV and IOA in a hOR may improve the safety and completeness of microsurgical aneurysm clipping.
