Title: Optimizing Care of Patients With Right Bundle Branch Block Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of temporary-permanent pacemaker (TPP) in patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We also sought to identify key predictors of permanent pacemaker (PPM) within 30 days of TAVR in this population.
BACKGROUND: RBBB is a well-recognized risk factor for PPM post TAVR. TPP provides stable transient pacing and reduces the need for critical care beds.
METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 371 patients who underwent TAVR at our institution. All patients with pre-existing RBBB had TPP placed prior to TAVR (n = 37). The primary outcome was the need for critical care beds. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of PPM within 30 days of TAVR.
RESULTS: 67 patients required PPM within 30 days of TAVR, and 56 implanted before discharge. 51% (19 out of 37) of TPP group required PPM before discharge compared to 11% (37 out of 334) of No TPP (p < 0.001), yet TPP group spent significantly fewer hours in a critical care bed (19 vs 28 h, p = 0.01). Length of membranous septum (LMS) <8.49 mm was the strongest independent predictor of PPM within 30 days of TAVR (RAUC of 0.80, Sensitivity 0.7 and Specificity 0.8) and 98% of patients with LMS < 7 mm required PPM within 30 days.
CONCLUSION: TPP-TAVR is a well-defined multidisciplinary protocol that reduces the need for critical care beds in patients with pre-existing RBBB referred for TAVR. Additionally, LMS is the strongest predictor of PPM implantation in this population. CONDENSED ABSTRACT (100 WORDS): This study evaluated the use of temporary-permanent pacemakers (TPP) in patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). TPP-TAVR provided stable pacing allowing for early mobilization and reduced the need for critical care beds. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified length of membranous septum (LMS) <8.49 mm in patients with RBBB as the strongest independent predictor of PPM need within 30 days of TAVR. 98% of patients with RBBB and LMS < 7 mm required PPM at 30 days regardless of other characteristics including valve type and size.
