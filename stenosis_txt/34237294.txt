Title: Thoracoscopic Completion Bilobectomy for Bronchial Stenosis.

Abstract: A 66-year-old man with primary lung cancer underwent 4-port thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy. One month postoperatively, he was diagnosed with obstructive pneumonia and bronchial stenosis of the middle lobe. Due to recurrent obstructive pneumonia, the covered self-expanding stent was placed in the middle lobar bronchus. One month later, the stent was obstructed. Six months after the initial surgery, thoracoscopic completion bilobectomy was performed; the postoperative course was uneventful. Seven years after the initial surgery, he had no recurrence. This lobectomy approach is an option for bronchial stenosis.
