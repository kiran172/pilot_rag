Title: Concordance between Coronary Artery Computed Tomography and Invasive Coronary Angiography in a Real-World Population with Suspected Chronic Coronary Syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is a non-invasive imaging technique that possesses the ability to provide detailed anatomical information about coronary arteries, avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures. Our aim was to assess the ability of CCTA to identify coronary artery disease compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in a real-life setting.
METHODS: We examined 137 consecutive patients who underwent ICA after CCTA. The latter was conducted in various non-selected centers, and data regarding stenosis were taken from individual reports without further analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 60.5% of patients who underwent CCTA were found to have at least one critical stenosis, while the remaining 39.5% underwent ICA due to concurrent clinical or instrumental indications. Among these, 29.5% had angiographically critical pathology, 20.3% underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and 1.8% had coronary artery bypass grafting. Among the 83 patients with positive CCTA results, 34.9% had negative ICA findings. CCTA demonstrated low sensitivity (57.8%) and a positive predictive value of 42.6%. However, it retained high specificity (83.6%) and a negative predictive value of 90.4% for identifying critical stenosis. Among the 18.2% of patients who underwent CCTA without a specific indication, 60% had critical coronary lesions on their ICA and 86.6% of these subsequently underwent a PCI.
CONCLUSIONS: CCTA performed in non-selective centers has a low concordance with ICA.
