Title: Efferocytosis in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, andÂ it commonly results from atherosclerotic plaque progression. One of the increasingly recognized drivers of atherosclerosis is dysfunctional efferocytosis, a homeostatic mechanism responsible for the clearance of dead cells and the resolution of inflammation. In atherosclerosis, the capacity of phagocytes to participate in efferocytosis is hampered, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic and necrotic tissue within the plaque, which results in enlargement of the necrotic core, increased luminal stenosis and plaque inflammation, and predisposition to plaque rupture or erosion. In this Review, we describe the different forms of programmed cell death that can occur in the atherosclerotic plaque and highlight the efferocytic machinery that is normally implicated in cardiovascular physiology. We then discuss the mechanisms by which efferocytosis fails in atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases, including myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus, and discuss therapeutic approaches that might reverse this pathological process.
