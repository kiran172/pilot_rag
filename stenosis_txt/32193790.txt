Title: Pet tracers for vulnerable plaque imaging.

Abstract: Most of the acute ischemic events, such as acute coronary syndromes and stroke, are attributed to vulnerable plaques. These lesions have common histological and pathophysiological features, including inflammatory cell infiltration, neo-angiogenesis, remodelling, haemorrhage predisposition, thin fibrous cap, large lipid core, and micro-calcifications. Early detection of the presence of a plaque prone to rupture could be life-saving for the patient; however, vulnerable plaques usually cause non-haemodynamically significant stenosis, and anatomical imaging techniques often underestimate, or may not even detect, these lesions. Although ultrasound techniques are currently considered as the "first-line" examinations for the diagnostic investigation and treatment monitoring in patients with atherosclerotic plaques, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging could open new horizons in the assessment of atherosclerosis, given its ability to visualize metabolic processes and provide molecular-functional evidence regarding vulnerable plaques. Moreover, modern hybrid imaging techniques, combining PET with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, can evaluate simultaneously both functional and morphological parameters of the atherosclerotic plaques, and are expected to significantly expand their clinical role in the future. This review summarizes current research on the PET imaging of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, outlining current and potential applications in the clinical setting.
