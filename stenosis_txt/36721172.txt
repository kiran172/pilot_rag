Title: Analysis of the curative effect of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy with osseous foraminal stenosis using ultrasonic osteotome in anterior cervical surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the clinical efficacy and operation points of cervical radiculopathy with osseous foraminal stenosis treated with ultrasonic osteotome in anterior cervical surgery.
METHODS: From January 2018 to June 2021，a retrospective analysis of 23 patients with cervical radiculopathy with bony foraminal stenosis during this period was retrospectively analyzed. Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) was used for all cases in this group. Intraoperative use of ultrasonic osteotome to decompress the nerve in the intervertebral foramina. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss and complication rate were recorded in this group of patients. Interbody fusion was evaluated using Brantigan criteria. The IC-PACS imaging system was used to measure the intervertebral foramen area (IFA) before and after surgery to evaluate the range of decompression. The VAS (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS) score and NDI (Neck Disability Index, NDI) score before and after surgery were recorded to evaluate the clinical efficacy.
RESULTS: All enrolled patients were followed up regularly for 1 year or more. The mean operative time was 61.5 ± 8.0 minutes. The average intraoperative blood loss was 88.3 ± 12.8 ml, and the average hospital stay was 8.1 ± 1.7d. Twenty one cases of successful fusion were followed up 1 year after operation, and the fusion rate was 91.3%. IFA expanded from 25.1 ± 4.0 mm2 before operation to 57.9 ± 3.4 mm2 at 1 year after operation, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The VAS score and NDI score of patients 3 days after surgery, 3 months after surgery, and 1 year after surgery were significantly lower than those before surgery (P < 0.001). There was 1 case of dysphagia and 1 case of Cage subsidence after operation, and the complication rate was 8.6%.
CONCLUSION: Anterior cervical surgery using ultrasonic osteotome in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy with bony foraminal stenosis has reliable clinical efficacy and high safety, and is worthy of clinical promotion.
