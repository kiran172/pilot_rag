Title: Association between RNF213 c.14576G>A Variant (rs112735431) and Peripheral Pulmonary Artery Stenosis in Moyamoya Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease (MMD) and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (PPAS) are relatively rare and demonstrate steno-occlusive vascular lesions in different organs. Genetic studies identified RNF213 polymorphism c.14576G>A (rs112735431) as a susceptibility variant for East Asian MMD. RNF213 polymorphism c.14576G>A is further associated with various vascular lesions of other organs. In this study, we aimed to clarify the incidence and clinical manifestations of PPAS in MMD patients and analyze the correlation between RNF213 genotype and PPAS.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control study investigated the association between RNF213 polymorphism and PPAS in 306 MMD/quasi-MMD patients, reviewing the medical charts and imaging records of consecutive patients with MMD admitted from January 2015 to December 2020.
RESULTS: PPAS was observed in 3 MMD/quasi-MMD patients (0.98%, 3/306). RNF213 polymorphism c.14576G>A was determined for all 306 MMD/quasi-MMD patients. The incidence of PPAS in RNF213-wildtype, RNF213-heterozygote, and RNF213-homozygote MMD/quasi-MMD patients was 0% (0/101), 0.5% (1/200), and 40% (2/5), respectively. The association between PPAS and homozygote polymorphism of RNF213 c.14576G>A was statistically significant in MMD/quasi-MMD patients (p = 0.0018). In all cases, pulmonary artery hypertension due to PPAS was evident during their childhood and young adolescent stages. Surgical indications for MMD were discouraged in 1 case due to her severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: The homozygote variant of RNF213 polymorphism c.14576G>A can be a potential predisposing factor for PPAS in MMD/quasi-MMD patients. Despite the relatively rare entity, PPAS should be noted to determine surgical indications for MMD/quasi-MMD patients.
