Title: Prevalence and Prognostic Impact of Carotid Artery Disease in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To assess the prevalence of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease (ACAD) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and postoperative cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) and evaluate its prognostic impact on postoperative CVAs.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AVS) who underwent TAVI was conducted at a single tertiary university hospital (January 2008-December 2018). Patients with AVS scheduled for TAVI and concomitant carotid stenosis were evaluated for prophylactic carotid revascularization (carotid endarterectomy [CEA] or carotid artery stenting [CAS]).
RESULTS: Seven hundred and seventy one consecutive patients (mean age: 80 years, 52% males) were treated by TAVI procedures. Carotid stenosis > 70% was detected in 69 patients (9%); it was unilateral in 47 (68%) and bilateral in 22 (32%) patients. Prophylactic carotid revascularization was performed before TAVI in 45 patients (31%): in 63.1% of patients (30/47) with unilateral carotid stenosis > 70% and in 68.1% (15/22) with bilateral carotid stenosis > 70%. Postoperative CVA following TAVI procedures were recorded in 25 patients (3.2%): 22 cases of stroke (2.8%) and 3 cases of transient ischemic attack (0.4%). At a multiple logistic regression, only bilateral carotid stenosis > 70% (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, confidence interval [CI] 95% 1.03-1.31; P = 0.0009) was found as independent predictors of periprocedural CVA.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe symptomatic AVS undergoing TAVI, carotid stenosis was frequently observed. Unilateral carotid stenosis > 70% did not show a significant association with early CVA following TAVI. However, in the cohort of patients with bilateral carotid stenosis > 70%, a significant association with postoperative CVA was observed.
