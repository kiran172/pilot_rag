Title: Novel transluminal treatment protocol for hepaticojejunostomy stricture using covered self-expandable metal stent.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepaticojejunostomy anastomotic stricture (HJS) is a rare complication after pancreatoduodenostomy. However, the rate of HJS may be increased with the expansion of operative indications, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Recently, the indications for EUS-guided biliary drainage to treat benign biliary disease have expanded. Recently, novel transluminal treatment protocol has been established in our hospital. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of our treatment protocol.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Consecutive patients with complications of HJS between January and December 2018 were enrolled in this study. EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (HGS) is firstly performed. After 7 days to create the fistula, HGS stent is removed. HJS is transluminally evaluated by a cholangioscope, and antegrade balloon dilation is attempted. After 3 months, if HJS is still presence, antegrade stent deployment is performed using a covered metal stent. Also, after 1 month, antegrade stent removal is transluminally performed.
RESULTS: Among total 29 patients, 14 patients were underwent antegrade metal stent deployment. The technical success rate of antegrade stent deployment was 92.9%. Median period of stent placement was 30.5 days (range 28-38 days), and transluminal stent removal was successfully performed in all patients. During follow-up (median 278 days; range 171-505 days), recurrence of HJS was seen in 2 patients. Severe adverse events were not seen in any patients during follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Transluminal stent deployment for HJS under EUS-guidance appears feasible and safe, although further study with a larger sample size and longer follow-up is warranted.
