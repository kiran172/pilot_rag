Title: Research progress of absorbable stents.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammation of blood vessel walls, is a progressive pathophysiological process characterized by lipid deposition and innate adaptive immune responses. Arteriosclerosis often leads to narrowing of blood vessels. At present, interventional stent therapy is the main treatment method for vascular stenosis, which has the advantages of less trauma, less risk and faster recovery. However, atherosclerosis occurs in a complex pathophysiological environment. Stenting inevitably causes local tissue damage, leading to complications such as inflammation, intimal hyperplasia, late thrombosis, stent restenosis and other complications. It is urgent to optimize interventional therapy program. This article summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of absorbable metal scaffolds and the research progress of absorbable polymer scaffolds. The optimization strategy of stent is proposed. The status quo of drug coating was summarized. The prospect of new stent. To improve the therapeutic effect of arteriosclerosis.
