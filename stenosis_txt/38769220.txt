Title: Multisystem factors contributing to redundant intracranial vascular imaging in the ED.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the multisystem factors contributing to redundant neurovascular orders in the ED.
METHODS: This was an IRB-approved, retrospective study, performed at a single institution examining a 5-year history of redundant CTA/MRA head and neck (HN) exams performed in the ED for patients with no documented clinical change in mental status/neurological exam necessitating additional imaging. Factors contributing to redundant ordering including provider experience, synchronous order placement, and radiologist recommendations were examined. Additionally, the impact of duplicative imaging in terms of medical cost and ED length of stay was evaluated.
RESULTS: 250 patients met inclusion criteria with both CTA/MRA of the HN performed during a single ED encounter (total 500 exams). 190 (76%) redundant exams were not recommended by a radiologist and contributed to an added ED length of stay of 3.6Â h on average. Provider experience was not a significant contributing factor. 60 (24%) of redundant exams were recommended by a radiologist and were most frequently CTAs needed to clarify an area of artifact/high-grade stenosis/occlusion on a primary MRA exam.
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of contributing factors to redundant CTA/MRA HN exams ordering has highlighted multiple associated factors including provider experience, recommendations by radiologists for clarification of MRA findings, as well as systems processes related to synchronous CTA/MRA order placement.
