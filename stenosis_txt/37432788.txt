Title: Subtotal Pericardiectomy and Epicardiectomy for Treatment of Septic Pericarditis and Constrictive Epicarditis in a Dog.

Abstract: A 1 yr old, 1.7 kg, spayed female Chihuahua was presented for respiratory distress and an enlarged cardiac silhouette as seen on thoracic radiographs. Echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. Computed tomography revealed marked pleural and pericardial effusion, thickening of the pericardium caudally, and a mass along the mediastinum. Pericardial fluid obtained via pericardiocentesis showed suppurative inflammation with mixed anaerobic bacteria isolated on culture. Subtotal pericardiectomy and partial lung lobectomy was performed to treat septic pericarditis. Postoperative echocardiogram showed increased right-sided pressures consistent with constrictive epicarditis, and 10 days after surgery, the dog was re-presented for right-sided heart failure. An epicardectomy was performed. A definitive source of infection was not identified, although a penetrating foreign body (e.g., grass awn) was suspected. The dog recovered and 10 yr follow up revealed no evidence of constrictive pathology on echocardiogram. This case report demonstrates the successful treatment of septic pericarditis and constrictive epicarditis via subtotal pericardiectomy and epicardiectomy.
