Title: Routine contrast enema prior to stoma reversal seems only required following treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis: An evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of the contrast enema.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Contrast enemas are often made prior to stoma reversal in order to detect distal intestinal strictures distal of the stoma. If untreated these strictures can cause obstruction which might necessitate redo-surgery. However, the value of contrast enemas is unclear. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the contrast enema's diagnostic accuracy in detecting strictures in children with a stoma.
METHODS: Young children (â‰¤3 years) treated with a stoma between 1998 and 2018 were retrospectively included. The STARD criteria were followed. Patients treated for anorectal malformations and those that died before stoma reversal were excluded. Surgical identification of strictures during reversal or redo-surgery within three months was used as gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and area under the curve (AUC) reflected diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: In 224 included children, strictures were found during reversal in 10% of which 95% in patients treated for necrotizing enterocolitis. Contrast enema was performed in 68% of all patients and detected 92% of the strictures. In the overall cohort, the sensitivity was 100%, specificity 98%, PPV 88% and NPV 100% whilst the AUC was 0.98. In patients treated for NEC, the sensitivity was 100%, specificity 97%, PPV 88% and NPV 100% whilst the AUC was 0.98.
CONCLUSION: Strictures prior to stoma reversal seem to be mainly identified in patients treated for NEC and not in other diseases necessitating a stoma. Moreover, the contrast enema shows excellent diagnostic accuracy in detecting these strictures. For this reason we advise to only perform contrast enemas in patients treated for NEC.
