Title: Frailty and Post-Operative Outcomes in the Older Patients Undergoing Elective Posterior Thoracolumbar Fusion Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Frailty is an independent predictor of mortality and adverse events (AEs) in patients undergoing surgery. This study aimed to quantify the ability of Modified Frailty Index (mFI) to predict AEs in older patients undergoing elective posterior thoracolumbar fusion surgery.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the results of 426 patients with the following diagnoses and follow-up evaluations of at least 12 months duration: lumbar disc herniation, 125; degenerative spondylolisthesis, 81; lumbar spinal canal stenosis, 187; and adult spinal deformities, 33. The cases were divided into two groups. The long spinal fusion (LSF) group was defined as â‰¥3 spinal levels with segmental pedicle-screw fixation. Short spinal fusion (SSF) were defined with at most two levels. The mFI used in the present study is an 11-variable assessment. The association of frailty with AEs was determined after adjusting for known and suspected confounders.
RESULTS: Frailty was presented in 66 patients (15.5%) within the total population (LSF, 21.9% and SSF, 11.8%). Rates of AEs assessed in the study increased stepwise with an increase in the mFI for the two groups. The severity of frailty was an independent predictor of any, major, and minor complications in the LSF group and any, minor complication in the SSF group (P<0.05). A comparison of post-operative clinical outcomes showed that the ODI and SF-36 scores deteriorated as the mFI increased.
CONCLUSION: Frailty was shown to be an independent predictor of AEs in older patients undergoing elective posterior thoracolumbar fusion surgery, especially for patients undergoing LSF.
