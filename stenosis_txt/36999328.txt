Title: [An Unusual Complication in 3 Cases: Renal��Subcapsular Hematoma Following Percutaneous Angioplasty].

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis is the leading cause of secondary hypertension. Percutaneous treatment options are safe and e���ective but can, in rare cases, entail possible complications such as renal subcapsular hematoma. Awareness of such complications will enable better management. Although post-intervention subcapsular hematomas are believed to occur secondary to wire perforation, in this report, we present 3 cases demonstrating reperfusion injury ���ndings rather than wire perforation.
