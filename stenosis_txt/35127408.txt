Title: Role of Doppler Ultrasound in Assessing the Severity of Peripheral Arterial Diseases of the Lower Limb.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease is defined as a clinical disorder in which there is a stenosis or occlusion of the arteries of the limbs. The most common etiology is ischemia due to occlusive disease. The objective of this study is to assess the severity of lower-limb peripheral arterial diseases based on various Doppler parameters.
METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study comprised 55 patients with clinical signs and symptoms of lower-limb peripheral arterial disease. Both inpatients and outpatients attending the authors' institute were taken up for the study. In this study, Doppler sonography was performed using 3-12 MHz linear array and 1-7 MHz curvilinear array transducers (SAMSUNG RS80A Ultrasound System).
RESULTS: Out of 55 patients, Doppler sonography demonstrated echogenic plaques in 32 patients and corkscrew collaterals in 15 patients. Monophasic waveform with peak systolic velocity ratio of >2:1 was found in 42 patients, which is consistent with significant stenoses.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that Duplex Doppler sonography aided by color Doppler sonography can accurately locate the site and severity of stenosis/occlusion. It is safe, cost-effective, repeatable, and noninvasive.
