Title: Candida Parapsilosis Endocarditis Following Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Fungal prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is rare and carries a high mortality rate. While uncommon, fungal endocarditis in transcatheter aortic valves has been reported. We present a unique case of Candida parapsilosis fungal PVE in a patient with a transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement.
