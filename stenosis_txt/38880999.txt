Title: Simplified balloon-BASILICA: A different perspective.

Abstract: Nowadays, the long-life management of patients with aortic stenosis has emerged as one of the most debated issues. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is more frequently performed in younger patients with lower surgical risk, and also the number of valve-in-valve (ViV) procedures has increased in the last few years. However, coronary obstruction is the most dreadful complication related to this procedure. To prevent coronary obstruction in the context of transcatheter aortic ViV implantation, the BASILICA (bioprosthetic or native aortic scallop intentional laceration to prevent iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction) technique was developed. Although effective, BASILICA is complex and time-consuming. Hence, simpler, reproducible, and faster strategies are desirable. Here we present a promising simplified BASILICA technique employing an Armada Balloon to perform the leaflet laceration.
