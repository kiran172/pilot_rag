Title: Aortic valve repair in a low-birth-weight neonate with poor ventricular function: staged tricuspidization of the unicuspid valve.

Abstract: Congenital severe isolated aortic stenosis in neonates requires prompt intervention because left ventricular function may deteriorate rapidly. Surgical repair of a stenotic aortic valve in neonates allows debridement of fibrous material and precision commissurotomy. As such, the child would end up with a much better-quality aortic valve compared to the uncontrolled tear that results following balloon dilatation. The meticulous debridement and precise commissurotomy are important in achieving long-term durability of the aortic valve repair, with the expectation that the patient may keep the native aortic valve at least into adolescence or adulthood. If feasible, it is important to avoid placement of patches while repairing the valve, so that the growth potential of the cusps is preserved. The valve could be revisited and repaired further, so that, ideally, the native valve could be retained for life, thus avoiding aortic valve replacement entirely. We present a low-birth-weight neonate with a dysplastic unicuspid aortic valve, severe aortic valve stenosis and decreased left ventricular function who underwent repair of the aortic valve.
