Title: Wellens' syndrome: a rare presentation after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

Abstract: Wellens' syndrome is a pattern of ECG changes typically seen in patients with unstable angina that has a high positive predictive value for critical left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis. Recognition of this syndrome can allow for intervention before the patient develops myocardial infarction. We report a case of Wellens' syndrome that was observed after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, whichÂ highlights risk factors that needs consideration in evaluating patients with these ECG findings after undergoing procedures even when asymptomatic.
