Title: Our Neonatal Surgery Experiences in Somalia.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to report surgical outcomes of the neonates who have undergone various surgical procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 39 neonates who have undergone a surgical procedure in Mogadishu Somalia Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Training and Research Hospital, between October 2018 and March 2019 were included. Data regarding age, gender, diagnosis, surgical procedure, length of hospital stay, mortality, and cause of mortality were recorded.
RESULTS: Of 39 neonates, 12 were female (30.7%) and 27 were male (69.3%). The mean age of the neonates at admission was 7.7 ± 7.6 days (1-30 days) days. The most common diagnoses were anal atresia (n = 12, 30.8%), esophageal atresia (n = 9, 23.1%), and pyloric stenosis (n = 5, 12.8%). The most common surgical procedures were colostomy creation (n = 10, 25.6%), esophageal anastomosis (n = 9, 20.5%), primary closure of anterior abdominal wall defects including bladder exstrophy (n = 6, 15.4%), and pyloromyotomy (n = 5, 12.8%). Mortality rate was 17.9%, and mortality causes were sepsis (n = 4, 57.1%) and congenital heart disease (n = 3, 42.9%). Neonates with the highest mortality by underlying primary surgical diagnosis were esophageal atresia (n=4, 57.1%).
CONCLUSION: The mortality rate from the surgical procedures of the neonates in Somalia is extremely high when compared with the developed countries. Employment of experienced pediatric surgeons and well-trained nurses, strict attention to the sanitary measures and shortening the time from birth to presentation might improve the surgical outcomes of the neonates in Somalia.
