Title: The association of leukocyte telomere length and intermediate coronary lesions-a retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intermediate coronary lesions (40-70% stenosis) present a higher risk for future cardiovascular events for instability of plaques. Shortened telomere is an indicator of cellular senescence, which is associated with age-related diseases. However, the relationship between telomere length and severity of intermediate coronary lesions remains largely unknown.
METHODS: A total of 121 lesions of 121 patients with intermediate coronary disease that underwent intravascular optical coherence tomography were enrolled. These patients were retrospectively divided into two groups according to whether accept percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment: non-PCI group and PCI group.
RESULTS: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in patients of PCI group were significantly shorter (12.54±2.70 vs. 15.32±3.72 kb, P<0.001) than non-PCI group. The PCI group had longer lipid length (17.17±9.94 vs. 12.21±10.15 mm, P=0.01) and greater lipid index (4,286.82±3,012.54 vs. 2,444.87±2,677.59 °*mm, P<0.001). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma (36.6% vs. 16.0%, P=0.013), macrophages (56.3% vs. 38.0%, P=0.047), plaque rupture (23.9% vs. 6.0%, P=0.009), cholesterol crystal (49.3% vs. 30.0%, P=0.034), dissection (23.9% vs. 4.0%, P=0.003) between PCI and non-PCI group. Logistic regression revealed that LTL was independently associated with PCI after adjusting for confounding factors (OR 0.952, CI: 0.930-0.974, per 1unit increase, P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed a LTL area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.714 (95% CI: 0.619-0.808, P<0.001) in the study population. Furthermore, LTL was inversely correlated with lipid length (r =-0.190, P=0.037), lipid arc (r =-0.301, P=0.001), lipid index (r =-0.182, P=0.046), and positive correlation with FCT (r =0.213, P=0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: LTL was independently associated with possibility of receiving PCI in intermediate coronary lesion patients and LTL is also significantly related to plaque instability features that evaluated by optical coherence tomography. LTL may be as an indicator to assess the necessity of PCI in intermediate coronary lesion patients.
