Title: Discordance between Invasive and Non-Invasive Coronary Angiography: An In-Depth Functional and Anatomical Analysis.

Abstract: A 79-year-old male with chronic coronary syndrome with complex coronary artery disease was included in the first-in-man trial of surgical revascularization guided solely by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and fractional flow reserve derived from CCTA (FFR<sub>CT</sub>). In CCTA analysis, the patient had calcified three-vessel disease, with a global anatomical SYNTAX score of 27. In contrast, in the initial FFR<sub>CT</sub>, only the ramus intermediate stenosis was physiologically significant, with no other vessels having an FFR<sub>CT</sub> â‰¤ 0.80 (functional SYNTAX score of 2). Discordance between the results of the CCTA and FFR<sub>CT</sub> necessitated an in-depth analysis by using both invasive and non-invasive coronary angiography. Angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) confirmed that the stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) was physiologically significant, while it remained functionally negative in the second assessment of FFR<sub>CT</sub>. Extensive calcification is the most plausible explanation for the underestimation of the stenosis of proximal LAD in CCTA-derived FFR technology.
