Title: Single Coronary Artery with Severe Coronary Artery Disease and Aortic Valve Disease.

Abstract: Coronary artery malformations are rare in the clinic. When with severe atherosclerosis, there is an additional risk. Specific coronary artery malformations, such as single right coronary artery, may be involved in the arteriosclerotic process, especially when accompanied by significant coronary artery tortuosity. It will remarkably challenge the treatment. We report a case of a single right coronary artery with severe stenosis and heart valve disease. She successfully underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement.
