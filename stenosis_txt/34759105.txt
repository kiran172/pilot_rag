Title: [A case of a patient with Crohn's disease who had vaginal delivery after abdominoperineal resection for severe anorectal complications].

Abstract: We report the case of a young female patient with Crohn's disease case who had vaginal delivery after abdominoperineal resection for severe perianal disease. The patient had Crohn's disease with anorectal complications for 13 years and underwent abdominoperineal resection for anorectal stenosis, complex anal fistula, and rectovaginal fistula in her early twenties. Seven years later, she got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy boy by vaginal delivery. No recurrence of Crohn's disease was observed during the perinatal period. There is no curative treatment for severe anorectal complications, which may be necessary for young patients to undergo abdominoperineal resection. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of Crohn's disease with anorectal complications on pregnancy and childbirth in affected patients.
