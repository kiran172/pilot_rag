Title: Outcomes of Intravascular Lithotripsy in the Treatment of Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Vascular calcification is an important risk factor for endovascular treatment failure and complications in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a pulsatile balloon-based device that has emerged as a tool in the treatment of calcified vessels. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVL in the treatment of peripheral calcified lesions in CLTI patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed within a single institution. Thirty-six CLTI patients treated with IVL for peripheral calcified lesions from 2018 to 2022 were identified. Data on pre- and post-IVL luminal stenosis measured by digital subtraction angiography, lesion location, adjunctive therapies, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and intra-procedural complications were obtained. A total of 41 target lesions in twenty-eight patients were included, with ABI data available in 20 treated lower extremities.
RESULTS: Across all 41 target lesions, IVL produced clinically significant luminal gain of 75.5% ± 23.0. Luminal gain by vessel location was 87.3% ± 15.8, 57% ± 25.7, and 78.5% ± 20.6 in the aortoiliac (n = 8), common femoral (n = 9), and femoropopliteal (n = 24) segments, respectively. Lesions treated with IVL alone yielded a luminal gain of 71.4% ± 25.6 (n = 10), while IVL alongside adjunctive therapy produced a luminal gain of 76.8% ± 22.4. In 20 treated lower extremities, ABI improvement of 0.20 ± 0.26 (p = 0.002) was recorded. Intra-procedural complications occurred in 1/36 patients, which was one instance of thrombus occurring prior to IVL.
CONCLUSION: IVL may be an effective option for creating safe luminal gain and vessel preparation in patients with CLTI. Level of Evidence 2: Retrospective Cohort Study.
