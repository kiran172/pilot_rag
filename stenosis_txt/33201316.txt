Title: Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of salvage photodynamic therapy by talaporfin sodium for cervical esophageal cancers and lesions larger than 3 cm.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Salvage photodynamic therapy with talaporfin sodium has a high local control rate for esophageal cancer after definitive chemoradiotherapy. The eligibility criteria for photodynamic therapy include the absence of invasion to the cervical esophagus and a 3 cm maximum longitudinal lesion length. There is little evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of lesions outside the eligibility criteria. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the efficacy and safety of photodynamic therapy of such lesions.
METHODS: Patients with consecutive lesions between February 2016 and May 2020 (n = 36) were enrolled. The local complete response rates and adverse events were compared between patients with cervical and non-cervical lesions and those with lesions larger and smaller than 3 cm.
RESULTS: The local complete response rate was 77.8% and was significantly lower in cervical than in non-cervical lesions (20.0% vs 80.6%, p = 0.005). Esophageal stricture, laryngeal pain, and fever were significantly higher in the cervical than in the non-cervical lesion group; however, the detected adverse events were up to grade 2. Laser exposure dose was high in lesions larger than 3 cm (median, 650 vs 400 J; p < 0.001). No significant differences in local complete response rates and adverse effects were noted. One case involving a lesion larger than 3 cm needed balloon dilations for esophageal stricture.
CONCLUSIONS: Although salvage esophageal photodynamic therapy was effective for local control with acceptable safety after definitive chemoradiotherapy failure, photodynamic therapy toward cervical lesions had a statistically lower local complete response rate. Lesions larger than 3 cm may be considered treatable.
