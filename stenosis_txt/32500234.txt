Title: Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Management of Chronic Pancreatitis.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pancreatitis (CP).
RECENT FINDINGS: EUS has evolved and become invaluable in diagnosing early CP with the use of elastography and contrast enhancement. Lumen-apposing metal stents have allowed for easier transmural drainage and necrosectomy for pancreatic pseudocyst and walled of necrosis. EUS-guided pancreatic duct drainage is being utilized for pancreatic duct complications including stenosis, stones, and duct disruptions that are not amendable to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. EUS is an effective tool that assists with the diagnosis and treatment of CP. The technology continues to evolve allowing for diagnosis of CP in earlier stages, which enables more effective therapy. The development of new EUS-guided tools and techniques has improved the treatment of complications from CP.
