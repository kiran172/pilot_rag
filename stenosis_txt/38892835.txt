Title: Short-Term Clinical Results of Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass (MIDCAB) Procedure.

Abstract: Objectives: Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) is an alternative for revascularisation of the isolated left anterior descending (LAD) artery or as a multi-vessel (MV) procedure for the diagonal branch (RD) or the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) region. Methods: From 2021 to 2022, 91 patients underwent MIDCAB or multi-vessel MIDCAB procedures in our heart center. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery via the left minithoracotomy approach in all patients. Results: Of the patients, a total of 86.8% were male. Eighty percent of the patients had two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease. The mean age was 65.1 ± 10.1 years. The mean operation time was 2.6 ± 0.8 h. The 30-day mortality was 0. The mean required packed red blood cells (pRBC) was 0.4 ± 1.2 unit. The mean intensive care unit stay (ICU) was 1.5 ± 1.6 days. The mean follow-up time was 1.5 ± 0.5 years. One patient received percutaneous coronary intervention due to de novo stenosis of the RCA. Late mortality was 2.2%. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate was 98.8% at 1 and 2 years. Conclusions: The postoperative complication rate of our MIDCAB cohort is low, and the short-term survival is favorable. Our postoperative and short-term clinical results demonstrate that this procedure is safe and feasible.
