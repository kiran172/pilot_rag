Title: Alteration of major venous drainage routes in a patient with achondroplasia after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.

Abstract: Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, caused by a mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene, leading to multiple pathological conditions. Herein, we present a case of an infant with achondroplasia associated with hydrocephalus and severe foramen magnum stenosis. Computed tomography (CT) venography showed prominent suboccipital emissary veins comprising major venous drainage routes and hypoplastic transverse sinuses, which increased the risk of foramen magnum decompression. The infant was initially treated with ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) shunt. After 8Â months, CT venography showed regression of suboccipital emissary veins and more prominent transverse sinuses. Subsequently, foramen magnum decompression was safely performed without sacrificing major venous drainage routes.
