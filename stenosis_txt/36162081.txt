Title: Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography-derived Fractional Flow Reserve: An Expert Consensus Document of Chinese Society of Radiology.

Abstract: Invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measured by a pressure wire is a reference standard for evaluating functional stenosis in coronary artery disease. Coronary computed tomography angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) uses advanced computational analysis methods to noninvasively obtain FFR results from a single conventional coronary computed tomography angiography data to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery disease. More and more evidence has found good correlation between the results of noninvasive CT-FFR and invasive FFR. CT-FFR has proven its potential in optimizing patient management, improving risk stratification and prognosis, and reducing total health care costs. However, there is still a lack of standardized interpretation of CT-FFR technology in real-world clinical settings. This expert consensus introduces the principle, workflow, and interpretation of CT-FFR; summarizes the state-of-the-art application of CT-FFR; and provides suggestions and recommendations for the application of CT-FFR with the aim of promoting the standardized application of CT-FFR in clinical practice.
