Title: Applying Nitroglycerin at Coronary MR Angiography at 1.5 T: Diagnostic Performance of Coronary Vasodilation in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of applying nitroglycerin (NTG) on detecting significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and NTG-induced coronary vasodilation using coronary MR angiography in patients suspected of having CAD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study conducted from November 2017 to September 2018, 70 consecutive participants suspected of having CAD were recruited. Of those, 57 patients successfully underwent pre- and post-NTG coronary MR angiography, both of which were performed during the end-systolic phase of the cardiac cycle. Significant coronary stenosis was defined at x-ray coronary angiography as stenosis of 50% or more. Participants were divided into a significant CAD group (significant stenosis) and nonsignificant CAD group (no significant stenosis) based on x-ray coronary angiography. Paired and unpaired Student t, generalized linear mixed model, and McNemar tests were used.
RESULTS: The diagnostic performance of coronary MR angiography was significantly improved after NTG (P &lt; .001). Per-patient for coronary MR angiography, from before to after NTG, respectively, the sensitivity was 97.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 85.6%, 99.9%) to 97.6% (95% CI: 85.6%, 99.9%), specificity was 25.0% (95% CI: 8.3%, 52.5%) to 62.5% (95% CI: 35.9%, 83.7%), positive predictive value was 76.9% (95% CI: 62.8%, 87.0%) to 87.0% (95% CI: 73.0%, 94.6%), negative predictive value was 80.0% (95% CI: 29.9%, 98.9%) to 90.9% (95% CI: 57.1%, 99.5%), and accuracy was 77.2% (95% CI: 66.3%, 88.1%) to 87.7% (95% CI: 79.2%, 96.3%). The NTG-induced coronary vasodilation was significantly lower in the significant CAD group compared with the nonsignificant CAD group.
CONCLUSION: Administration of NTG significantly improved the diagnostic performance of coronary MR angiography for detecting significant CAD; however, NTG-induced coronary vasodilation was impaired in patients with significant CAD.© RSNA, 2020See also commentary by François in this issue.
