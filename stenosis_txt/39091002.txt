Title: Transradial and Transfemoral Approaches for Vertebral Artery Stenting: A Single-Center, Prospective, Non-Inferiority Comparison.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Vertebral artery origin stenosis (VAOS) has recently gained increased attention, with endovascular treatments like stent implantation showing high success and low complication rates, although less is known about VAOS compared to carotid artery stenosis. This study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of transradial (TRA) and transfemoral (TFA) approaches for VAOS stent placement. MATERIAL AND METHODS We recruited a total of 102 patients undergoing vertebral artery stenting in our hospital between January 2020 and November 2022. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo either radial or femoral approach for stent implantation in the vertebral artery, and the radial approach group secondary divided into 2 groups by patients' consent: ipsilateral or contralateral radial approach. The success rates of VAOS stent implantation, operation time, and postoperative hospitalization time were compared between the 3 groups. In addition, we compared the outcomes of stroke within 30 days, transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 30 days, and other indicators. RESULTS Of the 102 patients, the final success rate of stent implantation was not significantly different between the 3 groups. The time from sheath insertion to stent insertion in the ipsilateral TRA group (median time: 19 min [interquartile range (IQR): 12-24.5 min]) was significantly shorter than in the transfemoral approach (TFA) group (median time: 29 min [IQR: 21-35.5 min]) (P<0.01; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 10 min [6-14 min]). There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups in terms of cerebrovascular events within 1 month, and patient satisfaction and preference favored the radial approach. CONCLUSIONS The postoperative hospitalization time and operation time associated with the ipsilateral TRA were shorter, and patient acceptance and satisfaction were higher.
