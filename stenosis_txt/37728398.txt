Title: Neurosurgical management of cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus in pediatric achondroplasia: a systematic review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Pediatric achondroplasia is often associated with conditions requiring neurosurgical intervention, including CSF diversion and multilevel spinal decompression. However, there is a lack of clinical guidelines and reliable estimates of the benefits and risks of these interventions. This study aimed to summarize the literature on the neurosurgical management of pediatric achondroplasia patients in order to aid in determining optimal treatment and standardization of care.
METHODS: A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies with an objective diagnosis of achondroplasia, patient demographic information, and available data on neurosurgical interventions performed before 18 years of age for cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus was performed. Study quality and risks of bias were assessed using standardized scores. Independent patient data on surgical indications, outcomes, reoperations, and complication risks were aggregated using means and percentages.
RESULTS: Of 204 records, 25 studies with 287 pediatric achondroplasia patients (mean age 25 ± 36 months) treated for cervicomedullary compression (n = 153), spinal stenosis (n = 100), and obstructive hydrocephalus (n = 34) were evaluated. Symptomatic cervicomedullary compression occurred early in life (mean age 31 ± 25 months), with apnea (48%), T2-weighted MRI cord signal (28%), myelopathy (27%), and delayed motor skills (15%) requiring foramen magnum decompression observed in 99% of patients, as well as cervical laminectomy in 65% of patients. Although 91% of treated patients had resolution of symptoms, 2% mortality, 9% reoperation, and 21% complication rates were reported. Spinal stenosis was treated in relatively older children (mean age 13 ± 3 years) with laminectomy (23%), as well as with instrumented fusion (73%) for neurogenic claudication (59%), back pain (15%), and sciatica (8%). Although 95% of patients had symptom resolution after surgery, 17% reported complications and 18% required reoperation. Of the hydrocephalus patients (mean age 56 ± 103 months), half were treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and half had a shunt placed for progressive ventriculomegaly (66%), headaches (32%), and delayed cognitive development (4%). The shunted patients had a 3% mortality rate and an average of 1.5 shunt revisions per patient. None of the patients who underwent ETV as the primary procedure required a revision.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical intervention for pediatric achondroplasia conditions, including cervicomedullary compression, spinal stenosis, and hydrocephalus, is associated with high recovery rates and good outcomes. However, complications and reoperations are common. Further studies with follow-up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes.
