Title: [Surgical Treatments of Renal Artery Stenosis in Takayasu Arteritis].

Abstract: Refractory hypertension and renal insufficiency caused by Takayasu arteritis with renal arteries involved are difficult to treat with medicines.Instead,surgery is often recommended for refractory renovascular hypertension with renal artery stenosis of â‰¥70%.Although both open surgery and endovascular surgery have been applied,the preferred surgical strategy remains undetermined.This article reviews the clinical effectiveness,long-term patency,and complications of open surgery,percutaneous balloon angioplasty,and stenting in patients with Takayasu arteritis-associated renal artery stenosis.
