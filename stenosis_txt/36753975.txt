Title: Impact of Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices on Cost and Length of Stay in Patients With Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement and Transcutaneous Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in aortic stenosis are associated with arrhythmic complications that can require cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantation, but impact on healthcare-associated cost (HAC) and length of stay (LOS) are unknown. This study aimed to assess differences among SAVR/TAVI patients with CIED implantation on HAC and LOS. Patients hospitalized for SAVR or TAVI between 2011 and 2017 on the National Inpatient Sample database were identified and stratified according to presence/type of CIED implantation. During this period, 95,262 patients were identified; 6,435 (6.8%) patients received CIED (median [interquartile range] age: 74.0 [66.0 to 82.0] years). The median adjusted HAC was $44,271 and LOS was 6 days. CIED implantation was associated with longer LOS and higher adjusted HAC in patients with SAVR and TAVI (p <0.0001). Patients with in-hospital death and complications because of SAVR or TAVI had longer preceding in-hospital days of admission. Male patients admitted to small hospitals and the West region had the highest HAC. In conclusion, CIED implantation for arrhythmias results in higher HAC and longer LOS in patients with aortic stenosis for both SAVR and TAVI.
