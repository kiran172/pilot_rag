Title: Deep learning artificial intelligence framework for multiclass coronary artery disease prediction using combination of conventional risk factors, carotid ultrasound, and intraplaque neovascularization.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major healthcare challenge and therefore early risk assessment is vital. Previous assessment techniques use either "conventional CVD risk calculators (CCVRC)" or machine learning (ML) paradigms. These techniques are ad-hoc, unreliable, not fully automated, and have variabilities. We, therefore, introduce AtheroEdge-MCDL<sub>AI</sub> (AE3.0<sub>DL</sub>) windows-based platform using multiclass Deep Learning (DL) system.
METHODS: Data was collected on 500 patients having both carotid ultrasound and corresponding coronary angiography scores (CAS), measured as stenosis in coronary arteries and considered as the gold standard. A total of 39 covariates were used, clubbed into three clusters, namely (i) Office-based: age, gender, body mass index, smoker, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure; (ii) Laboratory-based: Hyperlipidemia, hemoglobin A1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate; and (iii) Carotid ultrasound image phenotypes: maximum plaque height, total plaque area, and intra-plaque neovascularization. Baseline characteristics for four classes (target labels) having significant (p &lt; 0.0001) values were calculated using Chi-square and ANOVA. For handling the cohort's imbalance in the risk classes, AE3.0<sub>DL</sub> used the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). AE3.0<sub>DL</sub> used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) DL models and the performance (accuracy and area-under-the-curve) was computed using 10-fold cross-validation (90% training, 10% testing) frameworks. AE3.0<sub>DL</sub> was validated and benchmarked.
RESULTS: The AE3.0<sub>DL</sub> using RNN and LSTM showed an accuracy and AUC (p &lt; 0.0001) pairs as (95.00% and 0.98), and (95.34% and 0.99), respectively, and showed an improvement of 32.93% and 9.94% against CCVRC and ML, respectively. AE3.0<sub>DL</sub> runs in &lt;1 s.
CONCLUSION: DL algorithms are a powerful paradigm for coronary artery disease (CAD) risk prediction and CVD risk stratification.
