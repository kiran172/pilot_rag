Title: Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in the digital era: Meta-analysis based on the reconstruction of time-to-event individual patient data.

Abstract: Clinical benefits of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) over surgery emerge soon after intervention and show durable, consistent trends within 1 year. TAVR by transfemoral access is associated with improved outcomes compared with TAVR by transthoracic access. Reconstructing time-to-event individual patient data is advantageous and allows higher flexibility in terms of meta-analysis design and modeling of data.
