Title: ASSOCIATION OF FRACTIONAL FLOW RESERVE WITH CLINICAL AND ANGIOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS WITH STABLE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim: To identify clinical and angiographic factors, associated with fractional flow reserve (FFR), in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The study consecutively enrolled 68 patients with stable CAD (mean age (63±8,0) ys) and angiographically intermediate coronary lesions (diameter stenosis 50-90 %), with FFR assessment. Stable angina of CCS classes II and III was diagnosed in 42 (62 %) and 15 (22 %) patients, respectively; left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) - 27 (40 %); severe coronary stenosis (SCS) (70-90 %) - 46 (68 %). The overall CAD complexity was assessed by SYNTAX score. FFR «negative» group (FFRNEG) included the patients with non-significant FFRs (>0,80) (n=28 [41 %]). In case of at least one significant FFR (≤0,80), a patient was assigned to FFR «positive» group (FFRPOS) (n=40 [59 %]).
RESULTS: Results: FFRPOS (vs. FFRNEG, respectively) was characterized by the higher frequency of angina class III (32 % vs. 7 %; p<0,001), LVH (53 % vs. 21 %; p=0,010) and SCS (98 % vs. 25 %; p<0,001). The SYNTAX score was strongly associated with FFR ≤0,70 and ≤0,65, and moderately - with FFR ≤0,65.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: In patients with stable CAD and intermediate coronary artery stenosis, the presence of at least one functionally significant lesion (FFR ≤0,80) was associated with the higher prevalence of angina class III, LVH and more advanced coronary stenosis (≥70 %). The greater overall CAD complexity increased the probability for the angiographically significant coronary lesions to be more functionally compromised.
