Title: Intensive exercise therapy for restenosis after superficial femoral artery stenting: the REASON randomized clinical trial.

Abstract: Endovascular treatment (EVT) is the main treatment for peripheral artery disease (PAD). Despite advances in device development, the restenosis rate remains high in patients with femoropopliteal lesions (FP). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise training in reducing the 1-year in-stent restenosis rate of bare metal nitinol stents for FPs. This prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study was conducted from January 2017 to March 2019. We randomized 44 patients who had claudication with de novo stenosis or occlusion of the FP into an intensive exercise group (n = 22) and non-intensive exercise group (n = 22). Non-intensive exercise was defined as walking for less than 30 min per session, fewer than three times a week. We assessed exercise tolerance using an activity meter at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and physiotherapists ensured maintenance of exercise quality every month. The primary endpoint was instant restenosis defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio > 2.5 on duplex ultrasound imaging. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the data. There were no significant differences in background characteristics between the groups. Six patients dropped out of the study within 1 year. In terms of the primary endpoint, intensive exercise significantly improved the patency rate of bare nitinol stents at 12 months. The 1-year freedom from in-stent restenosis rates were 81.3% in the intensive exercise group and 47.6% in the non-intensive exercise group (p = 0.043). No cases of stent fracture were observed in the intensive exercise group. Intensive exercise is safe and reduces in-stent restenosis in FP lesions after endovascular therapy for PAD.
