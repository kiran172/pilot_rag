Title: Functional outcomes after transoral CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment for posterior glottic stenosis: a bicentric case series.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate functional outcomes in terms of decannulation rate and quality of life of patients affected by PGS (Grades I-IV) treated only by transoral CO<sub>2</sub> laser microsurgery (TOLMS) in two tertiary centers.
METHODS: An observational retrospective study was carried out, enrolling 22 patients affected by PGS who were treated by a transoral approach at two tertiary referral centers. Surgical treatment included TOLMS with tailored laser resection of the scar tissue combined with posterior cordotomy, resurfacing of the raw area with mucosal microflap, or placement of a Montgomery T-tube or Keel stent. All patients were evaluated and staged preoperatively and postoperatively, at least 6 months after the surgery. Functional outcomes were objectively evaluated by the Airway-Dysphonia-Voice-Swallowing (ADVS) staging system, Voice Handicap Index-30 (VHI-30), and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) questionnaires.
RESULTS: Quality of life significantly improved as measured by the VHI-30 questionnaire with a median variation of - 31.0 (p = 0.003), the EAT-10 with a median variation of - 4.0 (p = 0.042), and the ADVS with a median variation of - 3.5 (p < 0.001). No significant changes were observed in swallowing scores. We were able to decannulate 7 of 9 patients (almost 80%) with previous tracheotomy.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, even if there is still no general agreement on an exact therapeutic algorithm to treat PGS, our results confirm that transoral surgery, in terms of scar tissue removal, combined in selected patients with posterior cordotomy and pedicled local flaps and/or placement of stents, represents a safe and effective surgical approach even for more severe PGS.
