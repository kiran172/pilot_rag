Title: [Percutaneous aortic valve replacement by trans-carotid approach: First case in Chile].

Abstract: The indication for percutaneous aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has increased considerably in recent years, preferably using transfemoral access (TF); however, it is not clear which should be the preferred access in the event of contraindications to the latter. We present an 81-year-old patient with high surgical risk in whom a 50% obstruction of the descending aortic lumen was identified and so, a left transcarotid access was chosen. Numerous alternative approaches to the TF approach have been described in recent years. The transcarotid approach has been the one with the best results in different clinical reviews and the one that has been presented as the second alternative to TF in established algorithms. We report the first transcarotid TAVI implantation in Las Higueras Hospital, Talcahuano, Chile.
