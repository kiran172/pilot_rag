Title: Where are we heading in post-China angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic intracranial severe stenosis era?

Abstract: Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a globally challengeable disease. In the past 20 years, people have made a huge effort to deal with the problem including using endovascular technology and aggressive medical therapy. However, the efficacy of these methods seemed to be limited. The recent China angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic intracranial severe stenosis (CASSISS) did not support the addition of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting to medical therapy for the treatment of patients with symptomatic severe ICAD. So where are we heading in the post-CASSISS era?
