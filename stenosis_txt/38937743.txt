Title: Comparison of outcome of TIP urethroplasty with or without Buck's Fascia repair.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: TIP is the most common preformed type of Urethroplasty. The intermediate barrier is used as a waterproofing layer to prevent fistula formation. Many tissues have been utilized as a barrier layer, with varying success rates. The search for a better intermediate layer will continue. In this study, we aim to evaluate the role of Buck's Fascia as a covering for the neo-urethra to prevent fistula formation in patients who underwent Snodgrass Urethroplasty.
METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between 2018 and 2022. Patients were randomly assigned to either Group 'A' or Group 'B'. Group A included patients who underwent the Snodgrass procedure with a Buck's Fascia cover, while Group B included patients whose neo-urethra was covered with the dartos flap. These patients were closely monitored for the development of short- and long-term complications in both groups, and the results were recorded.
RESULTS: The study involved 164 patients, who underwent midpenile and distal hypospadias repair using the Snodgrass technique. In Group 'A' (84 patients), the neo-urethra was covered with Buck's Fascia, while in Group 'B' (80 patients), the neo-urethra was covered with the dartos flap. The mean age of the children was (23.06 ± 16.12) months in group 'A' & (26.06 ± 14.07) months in group 'B'. mean operating time was (40 ± 11.43) minutes, in Group 'A', and (70 ± 17.43) minutes, in Group 'B'. Meatal stenosis occurred in 3.57% of children in Group 'A' and 10% of patients in Group 'B'. Urethral fistulas were encountered in 2.35% of cases in Group 'A'and 10% in Group 'B'. The difference between the groups was statistically significant.
