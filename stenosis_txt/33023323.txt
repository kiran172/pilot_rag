Title: Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Atherosclerotic Stenosis in the Middle Cerebral Artery Using High-Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We analyzed and compared the imaging characteristics of the vessel wall of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using a 3.0-T high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) protocol, including a 3-dimensional T1-sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions sequence.
METHODS: Fifty-three patients with atherosclerotic stenosis of the MCA underwent 3.0-T HR-MRI examinations. The characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques in 53 patients (28 symptomatic, 25 asymptomatic) were analyzed, including plaque distribution and signal intensity. Plaque burden (PB), stenosis degree, and the remodeling index were measured and compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
RESULTS: The PB of the symptomatic group was significantly higher than that of the asymptomatic group (P = .006), and moderate-severe stenosis was more common (P = .01). The remodeling index of the symptomatic group was also lower (P = .015) and negative remodeling (NR) was more common (P = .043). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that stenosis degree was a risk factor in symptomatic patients (odds ratio = 135, P = .023).
CONCLUSION: There is a trend that some characteristics of plaques and vessels, including the moderate-severe stenosis, larger PB, and NR, were observed more frequently among patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the MCA than among asymptomatic patients.
