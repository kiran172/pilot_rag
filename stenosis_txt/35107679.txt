Title: Moyamoya Disease-Standards and Advances in Revascularization Procedure and Peri-operative Management.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic, occlusive cerebrovascular disease with unknown etiology characterized by progressive stenosis at the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and the abnormal vascular network formation at the base of the brain. Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass is a preferred surgical procedure for ischemic-onset MMD patients by improving cerebral blood flow. Recent evidence further indicates that flow-augmentation bypass has a potential role for preventing re-bleeding in hemorrhagic-onset MMD patients. Based on such cumulative evidence, there is a worldwide increase in the number of MMD patients undergoing bypass surgery, thus thorough understanding of the basic pathology of MMD including peri-operative hemodynamics is critical for avoiding surgical complications. The author sought to demonstrate the standard surgical procedure of STA-MCA bypass with indirect pial synangiosis for adult MMD patients and its pitfall in the early postoperative period, introducing the characteristic peri-operative hemodynamic condition of adult MMD after surgery, such as local cerebral hyperperfusion and intrinsic hemodynamic ischemia caused by watershed shift phenomenon.
