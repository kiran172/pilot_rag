Title: Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis After Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a devastating sequela of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, reoperation for post-TAVR PVE is not well described. We investigated the implications of surgically managed PVE after TAVR and SAVR.
METHODS: Reoperations for active PVE after TAVR and SAVR from 2011 to 2021 were queried using The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database. We identified 6257 patients, consisting of 374 TAVR (6%) and 5883 SAVR recipients (94%).
RESULTS: Post-TAVR case volume increased from 1 in 2011 to 116 in 2020. Compared with SAVR, the TAVR group was associated with older age, more frequent preexisting pacemaker, and fewer aortic root abscesses. Intraoperatively, TAVR patients received less aortic root repair (24.9% vs 34.8%; P < .001) and had shorter cardiopulmonary bypass/aortic cross-clamp times. Among all comers, the operative mortality in patients with previous was 13.6% for TAVR vs 10.8% for SAVR (P = .088). After risk adjustment, previous TAVR itself was not associated with operative mortality (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.72-1.38). In contrast, among 154 post-TAVR and 2232 post-SAVR patients with STS-indexed procedures (SAVR ± coronary artery bypass grafting) with available STS predicted risk of mortality, the mortality was 14.3% and 7.9% (P = .005), with corresponding observed-to-expected mortality ratio of 2.2 and 1.3, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic root repair was seen less frequently after TAVR than after SAVR. Furthermore, previous TAVR was not associated with increased operative mortality. In contrast, the post-TAVR setting was associated with higher mortality regarding isolated SAVR or SAVR plus coronary artery bypass grafting.
