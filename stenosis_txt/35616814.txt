Title: HR-MRI findings of intracranial artery stenosis and distribution of atherosclerotic plaques caused by different etiologies.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology of intracranial artery stenosis and the distribution characteristics of intracranial artery atherosclerotic stenosis using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).
METHODS: A total of 262 patients with intracranial artery stenosis that underwent HR-MRI from November 2019 to December 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. The etiology of intracranial anterior and posterior circulation artery stenosis was analyzed, and the relationship between the location of plaques and the distribution characteristics of plaques and the occurrence of ischemic stroke was summarized.
RESULTS: A total of 276 plaques were identified with HR-MRI. There were 101 cases (36.59%) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), 14 cases (5.07%) in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), 90 cases (32.62%) in vertebral artery (VA), and 71 cases (25.72%) in the basilar artery (BA). The infarct rate of ventral and superior wall MCA plaques was higher than that of dorsal and inferior wall (63.33% vs 31.25% P = 0.021) (100.00% vs 50% P = 0.022). MCA with plaques throughout the course had the greatest degree of stenosis (P < 0.001). Sphenoid segment (M1) of MCA was most susceptible (85 cases, 84.16%), MCA plaques were most common in the proximal M1 segment (35 cases, 34.65%), and most BA plaques were found in the distal segment (28 cases, 39.44%). PCA plaques were most frequently involved in traffic anterior segment (P1) (7 cases, 50.00%).
CONCLUSION: HR-MRI could provide accurate imaging reference for clinical evaluation of intracranial arterial stenosis and formulation of treatment plans. The intracranial arterial plates mostly appeared in the middle cerebral artery and vertebral artery. Middle cerebral arteries with atherosclerotic plaques are more likely to narrow.
