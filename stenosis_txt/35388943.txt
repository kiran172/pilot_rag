Title: A novel technique for management of stenosis of the postlaryngectomy stoma with preservation of a functional tracheoesophageal puncture following tracheal resection.

Abstract: Tracheostomal stenosis following total laryngectomy presents a serious concern for surgeons and patients. Although various techniques correct tracheostomal stenosis, none address an existing tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP). We present an approach to repair tracheostomal stenosis, requiring tracheal resection, and preserve the TEP in a functional position needed for speech rehabilitation. A 62-year-old male with squamous carcinoma of the right true vocal fold underwent a salvage total laryngectomy with placement of a tracheoesophageal prosthesis. Seven years later, he developed tracheal narrowing. A tracheal resection and tracheoplasty were performed to manage the stenosis while maintaining the tracheoesophageal puncture. Six months postoperatively, the patient was well, with no stomal narrowing or trend toward collapse and uneventful healing. He achieved fluent voice easily with stomal occlusion. We present a novel surgical technique to correct for tracheostomal stenosis following total laryngectomy. Our technique allows for TEP preservation to facilitate speech rehabilitation postoperatively.
