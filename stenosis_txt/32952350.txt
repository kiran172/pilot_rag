Title: Delayed Coronary Obstruction after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement - An Uncommon But Serious Complication.

Abstract: As transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) becomes the mainstream treatment for valvular aortic stenosis, it is vitally important to recognize its associated procedural complications. Among the clinically relevant but uncommonly seen complications, the development of delayed coronary obstruction (DCO) occurring during the early post-procedural phase or even later following the index TAVR procedure, has been reported. These reports have raised concerns as TAVR comes more common in lower-risk patients. In this review article, we explored the implications of DCO for pre-procedural computed tomography evaluation, valve selection and sizing, intra-procedural manipulation, and approaches to post-procedural management.
