Title: A case of picking calcified plaque in the common femoral artery with a long needle: the "calc-pick technique".

Abstract: An 88-year-old man had intermittent claudication of his right leg. Angiography revealed severely calcified plaque in the common femoral artery. Endovascular treatment was performed by contralateral approach. We attempted to penetrate the center of the calcified plaque and perform balloon dilatation. However, a 0.014-inch stiff guidewire could not enter the center of the lesion. Thus, we used an inner cylinder of 15-cm 20G long needle directly through the retrograde femoral sheath and successfully introduced the guidewire into the calcified plaque. Crosser and balloon dilatation resulted in 50â€‰% stenosis. To cross the center of calcified plaque, it is important to obtain sufficient lumen gain at the non-stenting zone.
