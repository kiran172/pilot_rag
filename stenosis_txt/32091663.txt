Title: Early restenosis of a direct flow transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis.

Abstract: Due to limited case numbers, severe Direct flowâ„¢ transcatheter device restenosis is, until now, a rare event with unknown long-term incidence, but challenging several treatment strategies. This case report gives an overview of possible interventional treatment considerations in this context that might occur more often in the future due to expected valve deterioration processes in the next years.
