Title: Trifecta Bioprosthesis Sudden-Onset Three-Leaflet Detachment.

Abstract: Acute bioprosthesis failure is an uncommon event that may require urgent surgery. This is even less frequent when it is not associated with endocarditis, thrombus formation, or structural valve deterioration. We describe an acute complete detachment of the 3 leaflets of a Trifecta tissue valve 6 years after implantation in a patient who suddenly experienced strong chest pain with severe dyspnea. In the operating room, total detachment of the 3 leaflets from the scalloped cuff and from 1 of the cusps was observed. No signs of endocarditis or leaflet calcifications were found.
