Title: Exploring the contribution of carotid artery disease to the onset of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathies: A systematic review.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The role of carotid artery disease (CAD) in the development of various types of ocular arterial occlusive disorders has often been reported. This systematic review aims to evaluate and review the current evidence regarding the role of CAD and the subsequent carotid artery hemodynamic alterations in the development of non-arteritic anterior (NA-AION) and posterior (NA-PION) ischemic optic neuropathy.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed studies following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases for relevant studies that clearly assessed the role of CAD and the subsequent carotid artery hemodynamic alterations in the development of NA-AION and NA-PION. All studies that examined the associations between CAD and the development of NA-AION and NA-PION in adults aged 18 years or older were synthesized. Quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports and Case-Series were also conducted.
RESULTS: Our search identified 1933 manuscripts published in the English language. The number of participants with non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-ION) ranged from 1 to 191, with a total of 478 patients experiencing either NA-AION (410 out of 478), NA-PION (13 out of 478), or a combination of thereof (1 out of 478). The number of participants with NA-ION due to atherosclerosis ranged from 1 to 191, with a total of 376 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Although carotid artery disease may rarely contribute to the development of NA-ION, it should be considered as a possible cause of NA-ION.
