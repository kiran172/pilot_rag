Title: Automatic 1-year follow-up appointment creation and reminders can improve long-term follow-up after carotid revascularization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term follow-up (LTFU) following carotid revascularization is important for post-surgical care, stroke risk optimization and post-market surveillance of new technologies.
METHODS: We instituted a quality improvement project to improve LTFU rates for carotid revascularizations (primary outcome) by scheduling perioperative and one-year follow-up appointments at time of surgery discharge. A temporal trends analysis (Q1 2019 through Q1 2022), multivariable regression, and interrupted time series (ITS) were performed to compare pre-post intervention LTFU rates.
RESULTS: 269 consecutive patients were included (151 pre-intervention, 118 post-intervention; mean 71 ​± ​12 years-old, 39% female, 77% White). The overall LTFU rate improved (64.9%-78.8%; P ​= ​0.013) after the intervention. After controlling for patient factors, procedures performed after the intervention were associated with increased odds of being seen for 1-year follow-up (OR: 2.2 95%CI: 1.2-4.0). Quarterly ITS analysis corroborated this relationship (P ​= ​0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Time-of-surgery appointment creation and automated patient reminders can improve LTFU rates following carotid revascularizations.
