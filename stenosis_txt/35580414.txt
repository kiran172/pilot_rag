Title: Capsule endoscopy with retention of 4 years: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Capsule endoscopy has been widely used in the diagnosis of small bowel diseases. Most CE can be smoothly excreted through the digestive tract. However, very few retention of CE may happen.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old man had been suffering from intermittent abdominal pain for 10 years. Capsule endoscopy was performed in local hospital 4 years ago. He was initially diagnosed with Crohn's disease and started on treatment. CTE and X-ray film of abdomen showed a suspected capsule endoscopy on the right side of pelvic cavity. Surgery was performed to remove the capsule. After the surgical treatment, no gastrointestinal symptoms relapsed for 9 months.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: It isn't uncommon for capsule endoscopy to be detained in Crohn's disease, because Strictures are the commonest complication of Crohn's disease. In order to prevent intestinal retention of capsule endoscopy, risk assessment should be carried out before capsule endoscopy. If detained CE isn't removed successfully by drug therapy and endoscopic therapy, surgery treatment has to be considered.
CONCLUSION: In the present case, capsule endoscopy was found in the small intestine after 4 years, and the reason is worth pondering. We strongly recommend performing routine CTE, MRE and patency capsule examination before capsule endoscopy for patients suspected of stenosis. Routine abdominal X-ray film after examination is also useful for timely detection of capsule retention.
