Title: The effect of nutrition on stroke risk: A systematic review.

Abstract: Background: An estimated 33% reduction in cardiovascular events can be achieved when incorporating whole grains, fruits, vegetables, poultry, nuts, and vegetable oils in the diet along with reduced consumption of refined carbohydrates, processed meats, and sugar sweetened beverages. We performed a systematic review to analyze the impact of nutritional intervention on stroke risk, as there is no current consensus concerning dietary recommendation for primary and secondary stroke prevention. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed database from January 2010 to June 2020 was performed using combinations of the following search terms: carotid disease, carotid artery disease, carotid stenosis, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), diet, nutrition, micronutrition, embolic stroke, and stroke. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 checklist. Results: 28 studies met our inclusion criteria. Multiple studies showed an inverse relationship between consumption of vegetables and fruits and stroke risk. Vitamin B12 or a combination of B Vitamins was the most common supplement studied in stroke prevention. Only one RCT showed the use of B12 (500 micrograms/day) correlated with lower CIMT at follow up in healthy vegetarians. Discussion: The key findings from this systematic review indicate that adopting a diet rich in fruits and vegetables earlier in life may lower stroke risk compared with meats and fat intake. B vitamins also appear to confer some protection against stroke. However, not enough data exists to support the use of multivitamins, calcium, soy products and other supplements for primary or secondary stroke prevention.
