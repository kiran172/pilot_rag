Title: Inferior-to-Superior Vena Cava Bypass for Baffle Stenosis After Atrial Switch.

Abstract: An atrial switch operation was successfully performed in an 11-month-old patient with transposition of the great arteries. Good cardiac function was noted on regular follow-ups. A severe inferior vena cava baffle stenosis was detected after a ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma at the age of 39 years. Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma could have been associated with liver congestion resulting from the stenosis. After partial hepatectomy, inferior vena cava-to-superior vena cava bypass was performed without cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, liver enzyme levels decreased to normal limits, and distant recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma has not been observed.
