Title: Efficacy of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 Inhibitor Treatment for Repeated In-stent Restenosis in a Coronary Artery.

Abstract: A 57-year-old woman experienced chest pain. A coronary angiogram revealed middle left anterior descending artery stenosis. Despite receiving adequate anti-hyperlipidemia treatment and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), she experienced angina and required PCI six more times for in-stent restenosis. As she had high lipoprotein (a) [LP-(a)] levels at the seventh PCI procedure, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) was administered, and a reduction in the LP-(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values was observed. She experienced no recurrence of angina for five years with PCSK9i treatment. PCSK9i can reduce not only LDL-C but also LP-(a) levels, resulting in cardiac event risk reduction.
