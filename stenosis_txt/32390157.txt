Title: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported percutaneous angioplasty of coronary button stenosis after aortic root replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: A 73-year-old female patient had right coronary button stenosis following aortic root replacement.
METHODS: Myocardial ischemia led to hemodynamic instability followed by cardiogenic shock, which was successfully managed using venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported right coronary button angioplasty.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of such complications is low, it is a life-threatening event that requires prompt diagnosis and it may pose a challenging clinical scenario for the treating team.
