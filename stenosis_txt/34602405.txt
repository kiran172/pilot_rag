Title: The therapeutic effect and mechanism of Chinese medicine Xuan-Yun-Ding on posterior circulation ischemia with vertigo in a rabbit model.

Abstract: The aim of research is to unveil the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of XYD on PCIV in a rabbit model. 40 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups,including normal control group (NC), model control group (MC), low-dose of XYD group (LXYD), high-dose of XYD group (HXYD) and Yang-Xue-Qin-Nao group (YXQN). PCIV rabbit model was established by feeding high-fat diet companied with paravertebral sclerotherapy and rotation exercise. The general observation, step-down test, rheoencephalogram, blood tests, histopathological detection and the plasma concentration of the effective component of XYD were investigated. After pharmacological intervening, the step-down time, REG, PL, IPL, blood viscosity, the levels of blood lipids, CRGP were significantly improved. Moreover, the vertebral artery showed the reduced stenosis of arterial lumen and less proliferation of fibrous tissue in the arterial wall in the LXYD, HXYD and YXQN group. Based on the LC-MS detection, the blood concentrations of puerarin in the LXYD and HXYD group were significantly increased after pharmacological intervening. XYD could ameliorate the symptoms of vertigo, Qi-deficiency and blood stasis in PCIV rabbits via effectively regulating the levels of blood lipids and vasoactive substances, decreasing blood viscosity, increasing CBF and protecting vestibular function.
