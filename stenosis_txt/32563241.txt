Title: Surgical procedure of canaliculoplasty in the treatment of primary canaliculitis associated with canalicular dilatation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary canaliculitis is a chronic infection of the proximal lacrimal pathway. We aimed to evaluate surgical outcomes of a canaliculoplasty procedure for primary canaliculitis associated with canalicular dilatation.
METHODS: This study enrolled 42 primary canaliculitis patients with canalicular dilatation who underwent canaliculoplasty. All patients were treated with canaliculotomy, curettage of canalicular contents and canaliculoplasty with stent placement. Patients' demographics, clinical features, and follow-up outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: There were 12 males and 30 females with a mean age of 66.1 ± 13.9 years. The mean duration time from the first onset of signs/symptoms to diagnosis was 30.6 ± 39.5 months. Epiphora (90.5%) and mucopurulent discharge from punctum (85.7%) were the most common signs. Thirty-three out of 42 patients (78.6%) achieved complete remission with a mean follow-up time of 25.3 ± 12.9 months. There were 3 patients found to have canalicular stenosis due to obstruction after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Canalicular dilatation is a severe condition of primary canaliculitis, probably due to a combined result of long standing disease and the presence of concretions. The surgical procedure of canaliculoplasty can be a highly effective treatment for primary canaliculitis associated with canalicular dilatation.
