Title: Re-sternotomy for aortic valve replacement in octogenarian patients in age of evolving transcatheter therapies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze perioperative results and long-term survival of re-sternotomy for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in octogenarians in age of transcatheter therapies.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-center study (April 2000 to December 2019). Perioperative data were compared for re-sternotomy with isolated SAVR (Isolated redoSAVR) and re-sternotomy with SAVR and concomitant cardiac procedure (Associated redoSAVR). Regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of in-patient mortality. Hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared for groups.
RESULTS: There were 163 patients (Isolated redoSAVR; 69, Associated redoSAVR; 94). Emergency/salvage cases were excluded. The median age was 83 (81-85) years and the median logEuroSCORE was 19.2 (13.0-26.7)%. The follow-up was 4.2 ± 3.5 years. Inpatient mortality was 4.9% (1.4% vs. 7.4% for Isolated redoSAVR and Associated redoSAVR respectively, p = .08). TIA/stroke rate was 8% (9% vs. 7% for Isolated redoSAVR and Associated redoSAVR, respectively, p = .78). COPD was a predictor of inpatient mortality (odds ratio: 8.86; 95% confidence interval: 1.19-66.11, p = .03). Survival was 88.7%, 86.4%, 70.1%, 49.5%, and 26.3% at 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10 years. There was no survival difference between Isolated redoSAVR and Associated redoSAVR (log rank p = .36, Wilcoxon p = .84). Significant adverse predictors of long-term survival were COPD, postoperative TIA/stroke, and length of stay. Survival was lower than age and gender-matched first-time SAVR and general population of the United Kingdom.
CONCLUSION: RedoSAVR in octogenarians is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Shared decision-making should consider emerging transcatheter therapies as a valuable option in selected patients.
