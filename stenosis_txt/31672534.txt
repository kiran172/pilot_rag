Title: In-Hospital Outcomes After Recanalization of Ostial Chronic Total Occlusions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusion (CTO) still remains a major challenge in interventional cardiology. Recanalization of ostial lesions is challenging and complex. This present study aims to evaluate the outcome of patients with ostial and non-ostial CTO-PCI with regard to acute, in-hospital outcome.
METHODS: Between 2012 and 2018 we included 600 patients. Ostial lesions (OL) were defined as a coronary arterial stenosis within 3 mm of the vessel origin. Antegrade and retrograde CTO-PCI techniques were used and a composite safety endpoint comprising in-hospital death, vascular complications, cardiac tamponade, stroke and acute myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male (82.3%) and the mean age was 62.1 years (±10.3 years). The right coronary artery (RCA) was the most frequent target vessel in 58.5%, followed by the left circumflex artery (LCX) (15.4%) and the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (26.2%). The success (p = .439) and complication rates (p = .169) were independent of the target vessel. We determined that examination and fluoroscopy time were longer in patients with OL (120.7 min vs. 99.0 min, p < .001 and 44.9 min vs. 34.5 min, p < .001) and that in this group of patients the retrograde approach was used more frequent (38.8% vs. 18.2%, p < .001). Overall success rates were lower in OL than compared to NOL (74.6% vs. 86.5%, p = .016).
CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study suggests that recanalization of ostial CTO lesions is associated with reduced PCI success rates as well as long examination and high fluoroscopy times.
