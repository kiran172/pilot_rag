Title: Emergency Ravitch Procedure for Inferior Vena Cava Compression After Surgical Scoliosis Correction.

Abstract: Pectus excavatum is a common chest malformation, classically asymptomatic. The pectus excavatum surgical procedure allows aesthetic correction. Funnel chest is a malformation frequently associated with thoracic scoliosis, especially in Marfan syndrome. Scoliosis is treated with first-line nonsurgical treatment. Second-line treatment consists of a scoliosis operation. In this case report, we present an exceptional emergency indication of funnel chest correction with the Ravitch procedure for a 14-year-old girl who presented with postoperative acute compression of the inferior vena cava due to a surgical scoliosis correction.
