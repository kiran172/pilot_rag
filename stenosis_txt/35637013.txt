Title: Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis: Underrecognized, Not So Rare, but Curable Complication.

Abstract: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) constitutes 75% of all vascular complications in kidney transplant recipients, being a significant source of graft dysfunction and loss. TRAS is a heterogeneous disease with different risk factors and causes. The incidence differs greatly, and it is likely it will increase because of the aging population of potential recipients and donors of renal grafts and the expanding use of extended-criteria donors. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of TRAS can prevent irreversible allograft dysfunction and loss. Current evidence of risk factors, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic options are presented in this short review.
