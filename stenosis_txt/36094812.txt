Title: 2022 SASCI/SCTSSA joint consensus statement and guideline on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in South Africa.

Abstract: Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) have traditionally been treated with surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR). Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a percutaneous option that has been shown to be at least as effective as sAVR in numerous subgroups of patients with severe AS. This is an update on the previous joint consensus statement and guideline on transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in South Africa, published in 2016. It provides guidance on which patients should preferably be offered TAVI over sAVR, with special consideration of the resource-constrained environment in South Africa.
