Title: Exercise training inhibits atherosclerosis progression and reduces VE-cadherin levels within atherosclerotic plaques in hypercholesterolemic mice.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) have emerged as key-factors of atherogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of exercise training (ET) on those key-factors in relation to the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic mice. Thirty male, apoE knockout (apoE-/-) mice were randomly assigned to the following equivalent groups: 1) CO-control: High-fat diet (HFD) administration for 12 weeks. 2) EX-exercise: HFD administration as in CO, and during the last 4 weeks (9th -12th week) ET on treadmill (5sessions/week, 60min/session). At the end of study, blood samples were obtained and all mice were sacrificed. Aortic roots were excised and analysed regarding the percentage of aortic stenosis, and the relative concentrations of collagen, elastin, VE-cadherin, MMP-8,-9 and TIMP-1,-2 within the atherosclerotic lesions. Aortic stenosis was significantly lower in the EX than the CO group (39.63 ± 7.22% vs 62.04 ± 8.55%; p &lt; 0.001), along with considerable increase in fibrous cap thickness and of collagen and elastin contents within plaques (p &lt; 0.05). Compared to controls, exercised-treated mice showed reduced intra-plaque relative concentrations of VE-cadherin (15.09 ± 1.89% vs 23.49 ± 3.01%, p &lt; 0.001), MMP-8 (8.51 ± 2.24% vs 18.51 ± 4.08%, p &lt; 0.001) and MMP-9 (12.1 ± 4.86% vs 18.88 ± 6.23%, p &lt; 0.001). Inversely, the relative concentrations of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the ET group were considerably higher by 62.5% and 31.2% than in the EX group (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. Finally, body weight and lipids concentrations did not differ between groups at the end of the study (p &gt; 0.05). ET treatment induced regression of established atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-/- mice and improved their stability. Those effects seemed to be mediated by favourable modification of VE-cadherin, MMPs and TIMPs.
