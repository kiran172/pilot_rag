Title: Evaluation of Hematological Parameters After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is safe and effective, mortality and bleeding events post procedure are important. The present study investigated the changes in hematologic parameters to evaluate whether they predict mortality or major bleeding. We enrolled 248 consecutive patients (44.8% male; mean age 79.0 ± 6.4 years) undergoing TAVR. In addition to demographic and clinical examination, blood parameters were recorded before TAVR, at discharge, 1 month and 1 year. Hemoglobin levels before TAVR 12.1 ± 1.8 g/dL, 10.8 ± 1.7 g/dL at discharge, 11.7 ± 1.7 g/dL at first month, 11.8 ± 1.4 g/dL at first year (Hemoglobin values compared with pre-TAVR, P &lt; .001, P = .019, P = .047, respectively). Mean platelet volume (MPV) before TAVR 8.72 ± 1.71 fL, 8.16 ± 1.46 fL at discharge, 8.09 ± 1.44 fL at first month, 7.94 ± 1.18 fL at first year (MPV values compared with pre-TAVR, P &lt; .001, P &lt; .001, P &lt; .001, respectively). Other hematologic parameters were also evaluated. Hemoglobin, platelet count, MPV, and red cell distribution width before the procedure, at discharge, and at the first year did not predict mortality and major bleeding in receiver operating characteristic analysis. After multivariate Cox regression analysis, hematologic parameters were not independent predictors of in-hospital mortality, major bleeding, and death at 1 year after TAVR.
