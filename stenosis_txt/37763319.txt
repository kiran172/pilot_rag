Title: Surgical Management of Perianal Giant Condyloma Acuminatum of Buschke and Löwenstein: Case Presentation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The Buschke-Löwenstein tumor (BLT) is an uncommon sexually transmitted ailment attributed to the human papillomavirus (HPV)-usually the 6 or 11 type (90%)-with male predominance and an overall infection rate of 0.1%. BLT or giant condyloma acuminatum is recognized as a tumor with localized aggressiveness, displaying distinctive features: the potential for destructive growth, benign histology, a rate of 56% malignant transformation, and a high rate of recurrence after surgical excision. There are several treatment choices which have been tried, including laser, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, electrocoagulation, immunotherapy, imiquimode, sincatechins, intralesional injection of 5-fluoruracil (5-FU), isolated perfusion, and local or systemic chemotherapy. In the case of an extensive tumor, preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy is used for tumor shrinkage, making the debulking procedure safer. HPV vaccines significantly decrease the incidence of genital warts, also decreasing the risk of BLT; HPV-6 and HPV-11 are included in these vaccines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a 53-year-old heterosexual man, hospitalized in our department in June 2021 with a typical cauliflower-like tumor mass involving the perianal region, which progressively increased in size for almost 7 years. The perianal mass was completely removed, ensuring negative surgical margins. The large perianal skin defect which occurred was reconstructed with fascio-cutaneous V-Y advancement flap. There was no need for protective stoma. The literature review extended from January 1980 and December 2022, utilizing Pubmed and Google Scholar as search platforms.
RESULTS: Due to the disease's proximity to the anal verge and the limited number of reported cases, arriving at a definitive and satisfactory treatment strategy becomes challenging. The optimal approach entails thorough surgical removal of the lesion, ensuring well-defined surgical margins and performing a wide excision to minimize the likelihood of recurrence. In order to repair the large wound defects, various rotation or advancement flaps can be used, resulting in reduced recovery time and a diminished likelihood of anal stricture or other complications. Our objective is to emphasize the significance of surgical excision in addressing BLT through the presentation of a case involving a substantial perianal condyloma acuminatum, managed successfully with complete surgical removal and the utilization of a V-Y advancement flap technique. In the present case, after 5 months post operation, the patient came back with a buttock abscess, which was incised and drained. After another 5 months, the patient returned for difficult defecation, with an anal stenosis being diagnosed. An anal dilatation and sphincterotomy were carried out, with good postoperative results.
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical management of Buschke-Löwenstein tumors needs a multidisciplinary team with specialized expertise. The reconstruction techniques involved can be challenging and may introduce additional complications. We consider aggressive surgery, which incorporates reconstructive procedures, as the standard treatment for Buschke-Löwenstein tumors. This approach aims to achieve optimal surgical outcomes and prevent any recurrence.
