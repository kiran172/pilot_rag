Title: Prevalence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease in Japanese patients: A single-center study.

Abstract: There are a few reports of the prevalence of extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) in Asian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This was a prospective registry study of 157 consecutive Japanese patients undergoing coronary angiography that aimed to determine the prevalence of extracranial ICAS in recent Japanese patients. The associations between ICAS and the extent or the maximal stenosis of CAD were also investigated. The 131 eligible patients with suspected CAD were prospectively analyzed. Their mean age was 69.0 ± 8.2 years, and 75.6% were males. A total of 111 patients (84.7%) were angiographically diagnosed with CAD. ICAS (area stenosis ≥50% on ultrasonography) was present in 9 patients, and the prevalence in patients with CAD was 8.1%. All patients in the ICAS group had CAD, and this group was significantly more likely to have a history of stroke (p = 0.03). Although no significant relationships were found between the severity of ICAS and the maximal stenosis of CAD, the severity of ICAS increased gradually with the extent of CAD. The prevalence of ICAS in patients with CAD treated with current medical treatment was relatively low (8.1%) compared to previous reports, and the severity of ICAS was significantly associated with the extent of CAD.
