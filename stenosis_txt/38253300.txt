Title: Bicuspid aortic valve: The most frequent and not so benign congenital heart disease.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most frequent congenital heart disease, with an incidence of approximately 1%. It can be silent and associated with normal valve function. However, a series of complications, even catastrophic, may occur with time: valve incompetence, valve stenosis by dystrophic calcification, infective endocarditis, progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta, aortic dissection, sudden death. The problem of BAV is not just about the number of semilunar cusps, but also the aortic wall. Severe noninflammatory degenerative changes (elastic fiber fragmentation, smooth muscle cells death, mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation=MEMA) are observed in the aortic wall of BAV patients, with intrinsic weakness accounting for progressive aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta, valve incompetence, and wall dissection. The link between valve and aortic wall pathology finds most probably an explanation in the embryology of the arterial pole since neurocrestal cells play a role in the development of both the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and semilunar valves. The frequent association of adult aortic coarctation and BAV provides evidence for this hypothesis. BAV has a significant genetic component as to require screening of first-degree relatives, as outlined by AHA/ACC 2022 guidelines.
