Title: Redo surgical aortic valve replacement for prosthetic valve valve-in-valve dysfunction.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the preferred intervention for patients with severe aortic stenosis and significant comorbidities. This technique can also be used for failed bioprosthetic valves and is known as the valve-in-valve (ViV) procedure. Placing TAVR in a small bioprosthesis (<23â€‰mm) can lead to delayed dysfunction of the prosthetic valve. We present a case of a late explanted ViV 8 years post-initial aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting, and 3 years post-ViV procedure in a 76-year-old female. A video of the surgical procedure is provided.
