Title: Lesion Characteristics Associated with Loss of Primary Patency After Endovascular Therapy for Common Femoral Artery Lesions.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To identify lesion characteristics associated with restenosis after endovascular therapy (EVT) for common femoral artery (CFA) lesions in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) in real-world practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 751 Japanese patients with PAD who underwent CFA EVT. Data were from a large-scale retrospective multicenter registry study. The association of lesion characteristics with the risk of restenosis was investigated with the Cox proportional hazards regression model.
RESULTS: Lesions extended to the external iliac artery in 10.0% of patients, were isolated in the CFA in 59.9%, and involved the bifurcation in 30.1%. Chronic total occlusion was noted in 21.1%, and 99% stenosis, in 19.9%. Among the limbs with CFA lesions, 16.4% had a history of CFA EVT. Mean total lesion length was 32 ± 15 mm, and reference vessel diameter, 7.3 ± 1.4 mm. Plain old balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty, and stent implantation were performed in 56.3, 23.2, and 20.5% of patients, respectively. The mean follow-up period was 10.4 ± 9.5 months. Rates of freedom from restenosis and reintervention at 1 year were 78.2 and 86.6%, respectively. Lesion characteristics independently associated with restenosis were history of CFA EVT, reference vessel diameter less than 6 mm, and lesion length greater than or equal to 50 mm; adjusted hazard ratios were 1.63 (P = 0.007), 1.93 (P = 0.006), and 1.71 (P = 0.018), respectively.
CONCLUSION: History of CFA EVT, smaller reference vessel diameter, and longer lesion length are independent risk factors for restenosis after CFA EVT.
