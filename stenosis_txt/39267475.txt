Title: Endoscopic segmentalized drainage of biliary tract obstruction complicated with duodenal stenosis.

Abstract: Biliary obstruction is a common gastrointestinal disorder with many etiological factors, such as benign and malignant diseases of the biliary tract, pancreas, and liver. Endoscopic ultrasound guided biliary drainage provides a new method for the treatment of biliary obstruction when ERCP cannula fails.
