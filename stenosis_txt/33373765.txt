Title: Endovascular Aneurysm Repair with Bifurcated Stent Grafts in Patients with Narrow Versus Regular Aortic Bifurcation: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Comparative Studies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Narrow aortic bifurcation (NAB) is considered as a risk factor for endograft limb thrombosis. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of narrow aortic bifurcation on outcomes of elective endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).
METHODS: A systematic review that conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was performed. We searched electronic bibliographic databases using a combination of controlled vocabulary (thesaurus) and free-text terms to identify relevant studies comparing outcomes of EVAR in patients with NAB versus those with regular aortic bifurcation. Pooled estimates of dichotomous outcomes were calculated using odds ratio (OR) and those of continuous outcomes using mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI). To account for expected heterogeneity, the random-effects model was applied for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Six observational studies were included, reporting a total of 2,673 patients (412 with NAR and 2,261 with friendly anatomy). Perioperative mortality was similar between the groups (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.30-4.34, P = 0.85, I2 = 0%). Limb stenosis and kinking requiring additional intraoperative procedures was significantly more common among patients with NAB (OR 3.02, 95% CI 2.16-4.22, P &lt; 0.00001, I2 = 0%). Nevertheless, 30-day reintervention rate was similar between the groups, as was the rate of limb occlusion during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests that at the expense of significantly more intraoperative additional procedures, EVAR with bifurcated devices can be safely performed in patients with NAB.
