Title: Subglottic Stenosis as a Presentation of Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Glomerulonephritis.

Abstract: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously Wegener's granulomatosis, is a necrotizing vasculitic disease process affecting the small- and medium-sized blood vessels. GPA is frequently associated with damage to the respiratory tract and kidneys but often affects other organ systems including the eyes, nasopharynx, and nervous system. Due to the vague nature of presenting symptoms and the progressive nature of GPA, it is essential to keep a broad differential to mitigate the high morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Here we introduce a case of a GPA presenting as respiratory distress, stridor, and renal injury. We also review common clinical presentations, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment options.
