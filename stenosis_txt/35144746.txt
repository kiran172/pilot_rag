Title: Lipoprotein(a) and Body Mass Compound the Risk of Calcific Aortic Valve Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: High plasma lipoprotein(a) and high body mass index are both causal risk factors for calcific aortic valve disease.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to test the hypothesis that risk of calcific aortic valve disease is the highest when both plasma lipoprotein(a) and body mass index are extremely high.
METHODS: From the Copenhagen General Population Study, we used information on 69,988 randomly selected individuals recruited from 2003 to 2015 (median follow-up 7.4 years) to evaluate the association between high lipoprotein(a) and high body mass index with risk of calcific aortic valve disease.
RESULTS: Compared with individuals in the 1st to 49th percentiles for both lipoprotein(a) and body mass index, the multivariable adjusted HRs for calcific aortic valve disease were 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-1.9) for the 50th to 89th percentiles of both (16% of all individuals) and 3.5 (95% CI: 2.5-5.1) for the 90th to 100th percentiles of both (1.1%) (P for interaction = 0.92). The 10-year absolute risk of calcific aortic valve disease increased with higher lipoprotein(a), body mass index, and age, and was higher in men than in women. For women and men 70-79 years of age with body mass index ≥30.0 kg/m2, 10-year absolute risks were 5% and 8% for lipoprotein(a) ≤42 mg/dL (88 nmol/L), 7% and 11% for 42-79 mg/dL (89-169 nmol/L), and 9% and 14% for lipoprotein(a) ≥80 mg/dL (170 nmol/L), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Extremely high lipoprotein(a) levels and extremely high body mass index together conferred a 3.5-fold risk of calcific aortic valve disease. Ten-year absolute risk of calcific aortic valve disease by categories of lipoprotein(a) levels, body mass index, age, and sex ranged from 0.4% to 14%.
