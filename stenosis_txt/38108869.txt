Title: The Allegra transcatheter heart valve: Long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The Allegra-THV is a novel, self-expanding THV with supra-annular bovine leaflets. The valve is available in 3 different sizes and is delivered through an 18 French sheath. To determine the safety and efficacy of the Allegra transcatheter heart valve (THV; Biosensors) for the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis under real-world conditions.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at the Heart-Centre Lucerne with the Allegra-THV were included. Echocardiographic data were collected at baseline, before discharge, and at 1-year follow-up; clinical outcomes were recorded for up to 3 years. Clinical endpoints were defined according to the definitions of the Valve-Academic-Research-Consortium.
RESULTS: One hundred-three patients (age 81 ± 7 years, 63% women) were enrolled. Median European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score was 4.1% (IQR 1.8%-4.2%). Mean aortic valve gradient was 6.9 ± 3.3 mm Hg and 7.7 ± 3.3 mm Hg, and an effective orifice area was 2.1 ± 0.5 cm2 and 2.0 ± 0.5 cm2 at 30 days and 1-year follow-up, respectively. More than mild paravalvular leak was observed in 2.0% of patients at 30 days and 3.3% at 1 year. At 1-year follow-up, 14.7% of patients required implantation of a new permanent pacemaker, 1 patient had endocarditis with an uneventful clinical course and good THV-function after antibiotic therapy, and no thrombosis, structural-valve-detoriation (SVD), or non-SVD had occurred. At 3-year follow-up, rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were 31.4% and 18.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Transfemoral implantation of the Allegra-THV resulted in favorable clinical and echocardiographic outcomes at up to 3-year follow-up. Head-to-head randomized clinical trials are necessary to determine if the Allegra-THV valve performs as well as current generation valves.
