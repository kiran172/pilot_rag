Title: Epidural Injection Method for Long-Term Pain Management in Rats with Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: Epidural injection is one of the most common nonsurgical treatment options for long-term pain relief in lumbar spinal stenosis. Recently, various nerve block injections have been used for pain management. Among them, nerve block through epidural injection is a safe and effective method for the clinical treatment of low back or lower extremity pain. Although the epidural injection method has a long history, the effectiveness of long-term epidural injections in disc diseases has not been scientifically proven. In particular, to verify the safety and efficacy of drugs in preclinical studies, the route and method of drug administration in terms of the clinical application method and duration of use must be established. However, there is no standardized method for long-term epidural injections in a rat model of stenosis to identify the precise efficacy and safety of epidural injections. Therefore, standardizing the epidural injection method is very important for evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs used for back or lower extremity pain. We describe the first standardized long-term epidural injection method for evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs according to their route of administration in rats with lumbar spinal stenosis.
