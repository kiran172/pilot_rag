Title: Endoscopic Posterior Cervical Foraminotomy Under Lateral Decubitus Position with Local Anesthesia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic posterior cervical foraminotomy is gaining popularity among endoscopic spine surgeons for the treatment of radiculopathy caused by foraminal stenosis.
METHODS: This study describes a technique using the lateral decubitus position for endoscopic posterior cervical foraminotomy under monitored anesthesia care and local anesthesia only.
RESULTS: A total of 10 patients with contraindications to general anesthesia underwent the procedure, resulting in improvement in cervical radicular pain with no perioperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that this approach is a viable alternative for patients at high risk of general anesthesia care, expanding the surgical options for the treatment of radiculopathy.
