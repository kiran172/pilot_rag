Title: Ultrasound-Assisted Spinal Anesthesia in a Patient with a Preexisting Lumbar Interspinous Spacer: A Case Report.

Abstract: An interspinous spacer is a minimally invasive implantable device for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. The in situ implant may prevent safe and successful spinal anesthesia because its position can obstruct the path of the spinal needle. Lumbar neuraxial ultrasonography has been shown to aid in performance of neuraxial anesthesia in patients with challenging anatomy. Currently, there are no reported cases of ultrasound-assisted spinal anesthesia in patients with interspinous spacers. We present a case in which ultrasonography assisted the successful administration of a spinal anesthetic by avoiding an indwelling lumbar interspinous spacer.
