Title: Ultra-Early "Fishmouth stenosis" and thrombosis of a Surpass Evolve flow diversion device following treatment of multiples right siphon aneurysms.

Abstract: We present a case of ultra-early symptomatic fish-mouth type stenosis (FMTS) of a Surpass Evolve flow diverter stent (SE-FDS) occurring within 24Â h after deployment for the treatment of multiple unruptured right siphon aneurysms in a 44-year-old patient. The patient developed left hemiplegia and hemineglect, and was treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and Tirofiban infusion. This is the first report of an ultra-early FMTS with a SE-FDS and its mechanism is discussed in the light of available data in the literature.
