Title: [The video capsule endoscopy].

Abstract: The video capsule endoscopy allows the exploration or the unreachable part of the small intestine by a standard bidirectional endoscopy. It requires a specific device and a bowel preparation but it's an outpatient examination with an acceptable tolerance of the patients. There are several indications including an obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, an iron deficit anemia, Crohn's disease extension and phenotype, hereditary polyposis and coeliac disease. It doesn't include therapeutic options itself requiring an assisted enteroscopy if any lesion is detected. The use of a dissolvable Patency Capsule lowers the risk of a mechanical intestinal occlusion if a stenosis is suspected. The colon capsule endoscopy is very promising for the colorectal cancer screening and follow-up of inflammatory bowel diseases but it's not currently validated nor recommended.
