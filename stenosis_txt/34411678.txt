Title: Utilization and Outcomes of Radial Artery Access for Lower Extremity Endovascular Intervention.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Radial artery access has become popular for cardiac interventions, but its role in lower extremity interventions is not well defined. We aimed to describe current utilization and outcomes of transradial access for lower extremity interventions.
METHODS: Peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) from 2016-2020 where transradial access was employed in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry were studied. Cases before 2016 were excluded as documentation of transradial access was not possible in earlier years. PVIs involving radial artery access were evaluated with regard to access guidance, access-site complications, target vessels treated and the technical success of these interventions.
RESULTS: Of 167,098 PVIs, 1,096 (0.66%) involved radial access. Utilization varied significantly by region (P < 0.01). The left radial artery was used in 66.9% of cases. Ultrasound-guided access was documented in 72.7% of cases. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, or sex between the transradial group and other PVIs. In 450 procedures, a second access site was utilized, most commonly a retrograde femoral access (60.0%) or retrograde pedal access (16.7%). The largest sheath was 6-Fr in 78.0%. Interventions documenting radial-only access more commonly treated the aortoiliac segment (49.4% vs. 29.5%, P < 0.001) and less commonly treated the tibial segments (7.1% vs. 32.1%, P < 0.001). Technical success was 94.0%, with inability to cross the lesion (3.1%) and residual stenosis after treatment (2.2%) being most common. There were access-site complications in 2.9%, with hematoma (2.4%) being most common.
DISCUSSION: Radial access is associated with high technical success rates and low access-site complication rates. Advances in device profile and shaft length may overcome shortcomings of transradial access and lead to further utilization of this access site.
