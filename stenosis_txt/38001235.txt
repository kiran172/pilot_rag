Title: Age-dependent sex differences in non-stenotic intracranial plaque of embolic stroke of undetermined source.

Abstract: Age and sex have effect on atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate their effect on non-stenotic intracranial atherosclerotic plaque (NIAP) in embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI). We retrospectively recruited consecutive ESUS patients who underwent intracranial HR-MRI to assess the plaque characteristics (remodeling index [RI], plaque burden [PB], fibrous cap [FC], discontinuity of plaque surface [DPS], intraplaque hemorrhage [IPH] and complicated plaque [CP]). We divided patients into three groups (&lt; 60 years, 60-74 years, ≥ 75 years). 155 patients with ipsilateral NIAP were found from 243 ESUS patients, with 106 men (68.39%) and 49 women (31.61%). In total population or age group under 60 years, there were no significant differences in plaque characteristics between men and women (all p &gt; 0.05). In age group of 60-74 years, men were associated with higher PB (66.27 ± 9.17% vs 60.91 ± 8.86%, p = 0.017) and RI (1.174 vs 1.156, p = 0.019), higher prevalence of DPS (82.50% vs 60.00%, p = 0.036) and complicated plaque (85.00% vs 63.33%, p = 0.036). For subjects ≥ 75 years old, PB were significantly higher in twomen vs men (68.85 ± 6.14% vs 62.62 ± 7.36%, p = 0.040). In addition, the probability for PB<sub>upper</sub> (≥ median PB), RI<sub>upper</sub> (≥ median RI) and vulnerable plaque increased as age increased, and its predictive power for index ESUS was higher in men than women. This study identified age-dependent sex differences in NIAP characteristics of ESUS patients, which will help us clarify their etiology.
