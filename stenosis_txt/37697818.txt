Title: A Pilot Study of Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Dacryocystography Imaging to Assess Functional Epiphora.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dynamic magnetic resonance dacryocystography (MRDCG) in eyes with functional epiphora.
METHODS: We included prospective eyes with epiphora if no alternative cause was found on clinical examination, were patent on syringing, had no obstruction or stenosis on DCG, and had an abnormal DSG. MRDCG was performed to qualitatively assess for block or patency and quantitatively measure tear transit time. We compared measurements to asymptomatic fellow eyes and to historical reference values from asymptomatic eyes.
RESULTS: We included 26 symptomatic eyes of 19 patients (median age 63 years). There was a block on MRDCG in 18 (69%) eyes and patency in 8 (31%) eyes. The block occurred at the sac-nasolacrimal duct (NLD) junction in 9 (50%), proximal NLD in 5 (28%), mid-NLD in 1 (5.6%), and distal NLD in 1 (5.6%) eye(s). No contrast was observed in the lacrimal system in two eyes. For eyes patent on MRDCG, median times to the sac, NLD, inferior meatus, first 25%, and first 50% of the fundus-to-nose distance (FND) were 22, 54, 118, 34, and 84 s, respectively. Times to the sac, NLD, and to fill the first 25% and 50% of the FND were significantly longer than historical values from asymptomatic lacrimal systems (p = 0.017, 0.050, 0.035, 0.017, respectively).
CONCLUSION: MRDCG shows a high rate of block in functional epiphora. However, DSG and MRDCG results may not always correlate. The improved temporal resolution of this emerging modality may be advantageous in the critical first 2 min of tear transit.
