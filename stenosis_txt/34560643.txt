Title: Intraplaque high-intensity signal on time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography and restenosis after carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that intraplaque hemorrhage is a predictor of restenosis after carotid artery stenting (CAS), the association between intraplaque high-intensity signal (HIS) on time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA), as a marker of intraplaque hemorrhage, and restenosis after CAS was assessed in the present observational study.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent initial CAS for atherosclerotic stenosis in the cervical internal carotid artery in the authors' department were enrolled. Of these, patients without preprocedural cervical TOF-MRA were excluded. Outcome measures were ≥ 50% restenosis, defined as a peak systolic velocity of > 1.3 m/sec; or occlusion and ≥ 70% restenosis, defined as a peak systolic velocity of > 2.1 m/sec; or occlusion on carotid duplex ultrasound.
RESULTS: Of 230 consecutive patients who underwent initial CAS, 22 without preprocedural cervical TOF-MRA were excluded. Of the remaining 208 patients (mean age 73 years; 33 women), 46 had intraplaque HIS. Ultrasound follow-up was not performed in 4 patients. The median follow-up duration was 3.2 years (interquartile range 1.7-5.1 years). During the follow-up period, 102 patients had ≥ 50% restenosis and 36 had ≥ 70% restenosis. Intraplaque HIS was significantly associated with increased risk of ≥ 50% restenosis (adjusted hazard ratio 2.18; 95% CI 1.28-3.68) and ≥ 70% restenosis (adjusted hazard ratio 3.12; 95% CI 1.32-7.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Intraplaque HIS on TOF-MRA was associated with increased risk of restenosis after CAS. The present results indicate that intraplaque hemorrhage is a predictor of restenosis after CAS.
