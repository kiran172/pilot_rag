Title: Subvalvular tissue mimicking valve detachment-like pathology by vertical aneurysm in Takayasu's arteritis.

Abstract: A 74-year-old woman with Takayasu's arteritis previously underwent aortic valve replacement at 59 years old. She was initially diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis and valve detachment. Moreover, preoperative computed tomography revealed ∼40 mm distance between the coronary artery ostium and the prosthetic valve (PV) and an aneurysm at the sinus of Valsalva. A Bentall procedure was subsequently performed. Intraoperative findings revealed no detachment of the PV. Following PV removal, the subvalvular tissue was noted to protrude into the left ventricular outflow tract. Subsequently, it was revealed that the tissue could have interfered with the PV; however, the PV appeared to have been detached considering the imaging findings.
