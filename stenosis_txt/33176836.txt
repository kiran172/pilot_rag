Title: The Sigma 2 receptor promotes and the Sigma 1 receptor inhibits mu-opioid receptor-mediated antinociception.

Abstract: The Sigma-1 receptor (σ1R) has emerged as an interesting pharmacological target because it inhibits analgesia mediated by mu-opioid receptors (MOR), and also facilitates the development of neuropathic pain. Based on these findings, the recent cloning of the Sigma-2 receptor (σ2R) led us to investigate its potential role as a regulator of opioid analgesia and of pain hypersensitivity in σ2R knockout mice. In contrast to σ1R deficient mice, σ2R knockout mice developed mechanical allodynia following establishment of chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, which was alleviated by the σ1R antagonist S1RA. The analgesic effects of morphine, [D-Ala, N-MePhe, Gly-ol]-encephalin (DAMGO) and β-endorphin increased in σ1R-/- mice and diminished in σ2R-/- mice. The analgesic effect of morphine was increased in σ2R-/- mice by treatment with S1RA. However, σ2R-/- mice and wild-type mice exhibited comparable antinociceptive responses to the delta receptor agonist [D-Pen2,5]-encephalin (DPDPE), the cannabinoid type 1 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 and the α2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine. Therefore, while σR1 inhibits and σ2R facilitates MOR-mediated analgesia these receptors exchange their roles when regulating neuropathic pain perception. Our study may help identify new pharmacological targets for diminishing pain perception and improving opioid detoxification therapies.
