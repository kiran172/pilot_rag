Title: Early chemotherapeutic intervention to avoid thyroidectomy in pediatric Langerhans cell histiocytosis with thyroid involvement accompanying tracheal stenosis: a report of two cases.

Abstract: Thyroid involvement is rare in pediatric Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). It may cause airway narrowing, leading to acute-onset respiratory distress. Severe cases may require emergent surgical interventions such as thyroidectomy, which should be avoided in children due to higher rates of complication, particularly in infancy. There is currently no consensus on the indications for surgical treatment in LCH with thyroid involvement. In this report, we describe the cases of two children who presented with tracheal stenosis caused by thyroid LCH, both of which were successfully treated by early induction of chemotherapy, and one of which was also treated for a shorter duration. Mutation analysis detected in-frame deletions of BRAF exon 12 in both cases. These cases suggest that timely diagnosis and administration of chemotherapy may alleviate severe airway obstruction and reduce the need for thyroidectomy in pediatric patients with thyroid LCH.
