Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in China - a review of the available evidence.

Abstract: This paper discusses aortic stenosis (AS) in China, emphasising the role of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in treating AS in an ageing population. AS characteristics, its treatment and the clinical outcomes of transfemoral TAVR in Chinese patients are described via a systematic review. AS affects >1% of the Chinese population aged â‰¥65 years, with degenerative AS predominating over rheumatic AS among this age group. Chinese patients often have high aortic valve (AV) calcification with bicuspid AV morphology. In 2021, 38,000 surgical aortic valve replacements (SAVR) were reported in China, while the number of TAVR increased from 293 in 2017 to 7,357 in 2021. There are four self-expanding valves and one balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve available in China. Among them, the Venus A-Valve is the most studied and widely used, whereas limited data are available for VitaFlow, TaurusOne, and SAPIEN 3. Notably, 10.0-16.5% of Venus A-Valve recipients and 0.2% of SAPIEN 3 recipients required multiple valve implantations. The rates of 30-day paravalvular leakage were 0-11.7%/0% for Venus A-Valve, 2.0%/0% for VitaFlow, and 0%/0% for SAPIEN 3, for moderate and severe leakage, respectively. Thirty-day all-cause mortality rates were 3.7-10.0% for Venus A-Valve, 0.9% for VitaFlow, and 0-3.2% for SAPIEN 3. One-year all-cause mortality rates were 5.9-13.6% for Venus A-Valve, 0-4.5% for VitaFlow, 6.7% for TaurusOne, and 6.2% for SAPIEN 3. The Venus A-Valve indicated lower 30-day permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) rates (7.4-20.5%) than VitaFlow and TaurusOne. Outcomes for patients with bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valves were similar. AS is rising among the elderly Chinese population; SAVR is common, and TAVR is increasing. Limited device comparisons exist, but the Venus A-Valve seems to have lower PPI rates, and SAPIEN 3 has low 30-day mortality in China.
