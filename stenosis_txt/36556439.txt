Title: Left Atrial Remodeling in Response to Aortic Valve Replacement: Pathophysiology and Myocardial Strain Analysis.

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease in the elderly and is associated with poor prognosis if treated only medically. AS causes chronic pressure overload, concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, myocardial stiffness, and diastolic dysfunction. This adverse remodeling also affects the left atrium (LA), which dilates and develops myocardial fibrosis, with a reduction in intrinsic function and a consequent high risk of the development of atrial fibrillation. Speckle-tracking echocardiography is able to detect myocardial dysfunction before other conventional parameters, such as LV ejection fraction, and also predict clinical outcomes. This review aims at describing LV and LA remodeling in AS and before and after aortic valve replacement and the usefulness of myocardial strain analysis in this clinical setting.
