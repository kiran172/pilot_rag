Title: "Whiplash" cervical trauma with fracture and migration of carotid stent fragments.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Angioplasty using a carotid stent is a treatment modality for carotid stenosis, with results similar to those obtained with endarterectomy, as demonstrated by important studies. The increasing use of this procedure has also led to a larger number of reports of complications, stent fractures among those. Stent fracture is a rare manifestation and hence needs further studying so that its actual prevalence can be determined, as well as its associated risk factors and proper clinical management. The current study reports the case of a patient who had previously undergone angioplasty with a carotid stent and, after an automobile accident, presented with a stent fracture and distal embolization of fragments thereof with neurological manifestation.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A male patient, 40 years old, presented with a history of previously stent carotid angioplasty. He had been involved in an automobile accident and suffered a stent fracture with distal fragment migration. As he was an asymptomatic patient (NIHSS 0, Rankin zero), we opted for a conservative treatment with oral anticoagulant.
CONCLUSION: Angioplasty is an effective treatment for extracranial atherosclerosis and, albeit rare, stent fractures can result in the migration of fragments thereof. This occurrence should be suspected in patients who have sustained severe neck injuries due to sudden deceleration and may be associated with thromboembolism.
