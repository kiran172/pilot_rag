Title: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation-Supported Transcatheter Mitral Valve-in-Valve Replacement and Paravalvular Plugging for Critical Prosthetic Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: We present the case of a patient with rapidly progressive bioprosthetic mitral valve stenosis in the setting of end-stage renal failure. Critical valve stenosis led to cardiogenic shock requiring full hemodynamic support. Emergent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation was successfully undertaken as a life-saving measure with an excellent final result. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
