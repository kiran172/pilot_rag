Title: Utility of the SYNTAX Score in the risk stratification of patients undergoing rotational atherectomy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The SYNTAX Score (SS) evaluates the angiographic complexity of coronary artery disease to assess the cardiovascular risk after coronary revascularization. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether SS results are associated with in-hospital and 1-year outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) requiring rotational atherectomy (RA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed data of 207 consecutive patients who underwent PCI with RA. Patients were divided into two groups: those with high SS (> 33 points) and those with low/intermediate SS (0-33 points).
RESULTS: In 21 (10%) patients SS was high and 186 (90%) patients had low/intermediate SS. Patients with high SS were older (76 vs. 71 years, p = 0.008) and more frequently diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (38% vs. 18%, p = 0.03) and heart failure (71% vs. 30%, p = 0.0001). In patients with high SS the RA procedure was longer (p = 0.004), required more contrast (p = 0.005) and higher radiation doses (p = 0.04), and contrast-induced nephropathy was more frequent (14% vs. 2%, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In our RA patients there was no significant difference between the frequency of in-hospital and 1-year adverse cardiovascular events depending on the SS result. High SS correlates only with parameters describing the extensity and technical complexity of the procedure. However, the unavailability of other risk assessment tools in this population raises the need to create a new more specific risk score for patients requiring RA.
