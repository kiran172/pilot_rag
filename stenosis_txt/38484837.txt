Title: Microglial AT1R Conditional Knockout Ameliorates Hypoperfusive Cognitive Impairment by Reducing Microglial Inflammatory Responses.

Abstract: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) can cause vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. AT1R, angiotensin II type I receptor, plays a vital role in central nervous system pathologies, but its concrete function in vascular dementia is still unclear. Herein, we investigated the effects of AT1R during CCH by conditional knockout of the microglial AT1R and candesartan treatment. Using the bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model, we found that the AT1R is crucial in exacerbating CCH-induced cognitive impairment via regulating microglial activation. The levels of AT1R were increased in the hippocampus and the hippocampal microglia after CCH induction. Microglial AT1R conditional knockout ameliorated cognitive impairment by reducing inflammatory responses and microglial activation, and so did candesartan treatment. However, we observed restoration of cerebral blood flow (CBF) but no significant neuronal loss in the hippocampus at 28Â days after BCAS. Finally, we screened three hub genes (Ctss, Fcer1g, Tyrobp) associated with CCH. Our findings indicated that microglial expression of AT1R is critical for regulating neuroinflammation in CCH, and AT1R antagonism may be a feasible and promising method for ameliorating CCH-caused cognitive impairment.
