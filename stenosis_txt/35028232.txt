Title: Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis in Dizygotic Twins: Case Report.

Abstract: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a disorder encountered in infancy that is caused by hypertrophy of the musculature of the pylorus of the stomach. It may present as partial or complete gastric outlet obstruction. Multiple previous literatures have discussed the incidences and variability in the presentation of IHPS. However, there are very few reports of IHPS occurring in dizygotic twins, especially dizygotic twins of different sexes. Here we present a very rare case of dizygotic twins (a male and a female) affected with IHPS. With this study, we aim to identify the factors that lead to variability in severity and onset of symptoms in dizygotic twins of the opposite sex. We also aim to pay special attention to the etiology and mechanism of development of IHPS in dizygotic twins of the opposite sex.
