Title: Congenital anomalies of the large intrathoracic airways.

Abstract: Congenital lung lesions are numerous but rare in individual clinical practice. They do require close multidisciplinary collaboration between health care professionals. This educational review will focus on the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, surgical approaches, and anesthetic management of congenital anomalies of the large intrathoracic airways: congenital tracheal stenosis, tracheal agenesis, tracheal diverticulum, bronchial anomalies (tracheal, esophageal, or bridging bronchus), congenital lung malformations, lung sequestrations and Scimitar syndrome, lobar emphysema, Williams-Campbell syndrome, and pleuropulmonary blastoma. In addition, this review will illustrate common pitfalls and challenges related to the anesthesia management with emphasis on ventilation and correct endotracheal tube positioning.
