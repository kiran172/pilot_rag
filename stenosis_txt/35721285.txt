Title: Biliary obstruction following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement in a patient after liver transplantation: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a method used to decrease portal hypertension. Biliary stricture is the rarest of the complications associated with this procedure with only 12 cases previously reported in the literature. None of these cases have documented the resolution of biliary stenosis induced by a stent graft. The only curative solutions reported are liver transplantation or bypassing the stenosis with an artificial biliary tract using advanced endoscopic techniques.
CASE SUMMARY: This is the first reported case of biliary obstruction secondary to TIPS placement in a transplanted liver. In our patient, a portosystemic shunt was created to treat severe veno-occlusive liver graft disease manifesting itself primarily by fluid retention. A cholestatic liver lesion and cholangitis with abscesses developed due to a stent graft-induced stricture in the dorsal segment of the right hepatic duct and the stricture diminished following percutaneous drainage. Endoscopic drainage was performed after unsuccessful removal of the percutaneous catheter resulting in a bilio-cutaneous fistula. Although the liver graft now functions well, the stricture remains refractory even after 44 mo of treatment.
CONCLUSION: Biliary strictures caused by TIPS in both transplanted and native livers seem refractory to endoscopic treatment.
