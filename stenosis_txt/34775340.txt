Title: Effects of vessel wall mechanics on non-invasive evaluation of cardiovascular intrinsic frequencies.

Abstract: Intrinsic Frequency (IF) is a systems-based approach that provides valuable information for hemodynamic monitoring of the left ventricle (LV), the arterial system, and their coupling. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the clinical significance of this method for prognosis and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In IF analysis, two dominant instantaneous frequencies (ω<sub>1</sub> and ω<sub>2</sub>) are extracted from arterial pressure waveforms. The value of ω<sub>1</sub> is related to the dynamics of the LV and the value of ω<sub>2</sub> is related to the dynamics of vascular function. This work investigates the effects of vessel wall mechanics on the accuracy and applicability of IFs extracted from vessel wall displacement waveforms compared to IFs extracted from pressure waveforms. In this study, we used a computational approach employing a fluid-structure interaction finite element method for various wall mechanics governed by linearly elastic, hyperelastic, and viscoelastic models. Results show that for vessels with elastic wall behavior, the error between displacement-based and pressure-based IFs is negligible. In the presence of stenosis or aneurysm in elastic arteries, the maximum errors associated with displacement-based IFs is less than 2%. For non-linear elastic and viscoelastic arteries, errors are more pronounced (where the former reaches up to 11% and the latter up to 27%). Our results ultimately suggest that displacement-based computations of ω<sub>1</sub> and ω<sub>2</sub> are accurate in vessels that exhibit elastic behavior (such as carotid arteries) and are suitable surrogates for pressure-based IFs. This is clinically significant because displacement-based IFs can be measured non-invasively.
