Title: Dynamic CT angiography of the head and neck in the diagnosis of Bow Hunter's Syndrome: A case report.

Abstract: Bow Hunter's syndrome is extremely rare, which is mainly caused by mechanical vertebral artery occlusion or stenosis during head and neck rotation or hyperextension. Herein, we describe the case of a 19-year-old man without a history of trauma who presented with dizziness, binocular blackness, and disturbance of consciousness after looking up when cleaning the classroom. Subsequent imaging findings revealed the blood flow of the C2 segment of the contralateral vertebral artery was interrupted when the patient turned his head to 1 side. Such patients with normal CT angiography of the head and neck scan will show that the head and neck blood vessels are normal, which will affect the prognosis of patients. This case highlights the importance and implications of dynamic CT angiography of the head and neck in the diagnosis of Bow Hunter's syndrome.
