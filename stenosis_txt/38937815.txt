Title: A massive pulmonary arteriovenous fistula complicated with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease treated by interventional therapy: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF) is a rare disease, and its symptoms lack specificity. For patients with coronary heart disease(CHD), hypertension and other common cardiovascular diseases, PAVF is easy to be ignored. We presented a case of massive PAVF complicated with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease by interventional treatment to improve the understanding of this complex disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital due to chest tightness and shortness of breath following activities, which was diagnosed with CHD and hypoxemia in other hospitals. Coronary angiography showed that the patient had severe stenosis of coronary artery while pulmonary vascular DSA showing the patient had PAVF. After interventional therapy of both coronary artery and PAVF, the patient's symptoms were significantly improved.
CONCLUSION: We presented a case of massive PAVF complicated with CHD by interventional treatment. For patients with unexplained hypoxemia and symptoms similar with CHD, the possibility of PAVF often leads to oversight, and various auxiliary examinations should be improved to avoid missed diagnosis. And intervention treatment should be carried out to improve the prognosis of patients as much as possible.
