Title: Meta-Analysis Comparing Valve Durability Among Different Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Valve Bioprosthesis.

Abstract: Durability of transcatheter heart valve (THV) is critical as the indication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) expands to patients with longer life-expectancy. We aimed to compare the durability of different THV systems (balloon-expandable [BE] and self-expandable [SE]) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) prosthesis. PUBMED and EMBASE were searched through February 2021 for randomized trials investigating parameters of valve durability after TAVI and/or SAVR in severe aortic stenosis. A network meta-analysis using random-effect model was performed. Synthesis was performed with 5-year follow-up data for echocardiographic outcomes and the longest available follow-up data for clinical outcomes. Ten trials with a total of 9,388 patients (BE-THV: 2,562; SE-THV: 2,863; SAVR: 3,963) were included. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years. SE-THV demonstrated significantly larger effective orifice area, lower mean aortic valve gradient (AVG), and less increase in mean AVG at 5-year compared with BE-THV and SAVR. Structural valve deterioration (SVD) was less frequent in SE-THV compared with BE-THV and SAVR (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.27; HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.47, respectively). Total moderate-severe aortic regurgitation and reintervention was more frequent in BE-THV (HR 4.21, 95% CI 2.40 to 7.39; HR 2.22, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.26, respectively), and SE-THV (HR 7.51, 95% CI 3.89 to 14.5; HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.13, respectively) compared with SAVR. In conclusion, TAVI with SE-THV demonstrated favorable forward-flow hemodynamics and lowest risk of SVD compared with BE-THV and SAVR at mid-term. However, both THV systems suffer an increased risk of AR and re-intervention, and long-term data from newer generation valves is warranted.
