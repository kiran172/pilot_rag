Title: A case of coronary artery compression syndrome resulting from peri-valvular regurgitation and long-standing atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: A man in his 70s with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR) and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) presented with effort angina. Coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis of the left main coronary artery (LMCA). As it was an emergent case, PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) was selected for treatment. Intravascular ultrasonography revealed no atherosclerotic lesions in the LMCA. The LMCA was effectively dilated by the drug-eluting stent. No elevation in intracardiac pressure was observed in cardiac catheterization after PCI. Computed tomography scan indicated potential compression of the LMCA by the surrounding structures. In cases of long-standing persistent AF and an enlarged atrium after MVR, the possibility of LMCA stenosis due to anatomical changes should be considered.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: ◾Peri-valvular regurgitation and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation can potentially cause atrial enlargement.◾Coronary artery stenosis without atherosclerosis can occur due to compression from surrounding structures or shifting of the coronary artery.◾Stent therapy provides a temporary solution and coronary artery bypass grafting or switching should be considered if re-stenosis occurs.
