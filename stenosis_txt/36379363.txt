Title: Results of Double Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support Blue Stenting for the Treatment of Fusiform Cerebral Aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The flow diversion technique is increasingly used for reconstructive endovascular treatment of fusiform cerebral aneurysms. Double stenting with the Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) Blue stent is one of the flow diversion techniques. The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and angiographic outcomes of LVIS Blue double stenting for fusiform cerebral aneurysms.
METHODS: Between March 2016 and July 2020, double LVIS Blue stenting was attempted in 25 fusiform cerebral aneurysms. Patient medical records and radiological images were carefully reviewed.
RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100% (25/25). Six aneurysms (24.0%) were located in the anterior circulation and 19 aneurysms (76.0%) were located in the posterior circulation. Intraprocedural thromboembolic complications occurred in 1 patient (4.0%). During the follow-up period (30.8 ± 14.2 months), there were no deaths or delayed complications. The mean angiographic follow-up duration was 28.2 ± 12.8 months. Follow-up angiography revealed complete obliteration (O'Kelly-Marotta D) in 21 (84.0%) patients and near-complete obliteration (O'Kelly-Marotta C + 2 matched with Kamran-Byrne grade 3) in 2 (8.0%) patients. Two patients (8.0%) showed worsening of obliteration grades. One (4.0%) patient required retreatment. There was no significant in-stent stenosis or branch occlusion covered by stents.
CONCLUSIONS: Double stenting using LVIS Blue stents for the treatment of fusiform cerebral aneurysms is effective and safe.
