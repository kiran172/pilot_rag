Title: Optimal reproduction of a porcine benign biliary stricture model using endobiliary radiofrequency ablation.

Abstract: The use of endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to generate a benign biliary stricture (BBS) model has a significant reproducibility problem. The aims of this animal study were to create an optimal BBS model using endobiliary RFA and determine the best way to develop it. The first step was performed on the common bile duct (CBD) of 10 miniature pigs using endoscopic RFA with a target temperature-controlled mode (80 ℃, 7 W for 90 s). The second step was performed on the CBD of five miniature pigs to understand more about the time-dependent changes in BBS development and the causes of adverse events. Using the conditions and techniques identified in the previous steps, the third step was conducted to create an optimal BBS model in 12 miniature pigs. In the first trial, four out of 10 animals died (40%) after the procedure due to cholangitis-induced sepsis. Based on this, biliary obstruction was prevented in further steps by placing a biliary plastic stent after RFA application. Histologic examinations over time showed that a severe abscess developed at the RFA application site on the fifth day, followed by fibrosis on the tenth day, and completion on the twentieth day. In the third trial, 11 animals survived (91.7%), the average BBS fibrotic wall thickness was 1107.9 µm (763.1-1864.6 µm), and the degree of upstream biliary dilation was 14.4 mm (11.05-20.7 mm). In conclusion, endobiliary RFA combined with a biliary plastic stent resulted in a safe and reproducible BBS animal model.
