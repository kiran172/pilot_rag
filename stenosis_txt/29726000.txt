Title: Illness perception in overweight and obese patients with cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study explored the relationship of illness perception with different aspects of cardiac anxiety, general anxiety and depression in a sample of male and female overweight and obese patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD).
STUDY DESIGN: The clinical sample included 165 adults (113 males) aged from 32 to 89 years. The patients were admitted to the Department of Cardiology and Cardiac Rehabilitation for a major cardiovascular event, acute myocardial infarction or myocardial revascularization.
MEASUREMENTS: Psychological measurement included questionnaires of illness perception, cardiac anxiety, general anxiety and depression.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Illness perception and cardiac anxiety in patients with CVD were associated with anxiety and depression. Regression analysis showed that illness perception accounts for a significant proportion of the variance in both anxiety and depression for males, but not for females. Gender-specific interrelations between perceptions of CVD and indices of mental health have an implication for interventions to maximize the effect of therapy with these patients.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, Descriptive study.
