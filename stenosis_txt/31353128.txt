Title: [Femoral neuropathy: Haematoma in iliac muscle and a lumbar vertebral fracture].

Abstract: 75-year-old patient with a history of acenocumarol anticoagulated atrial fibrillation, which shows pain, functional impotence and right lower limb paresthesias after fall. Studies evidenc evertebral fracture L5 and haematoma on right iliac muscle, proceeding to surgical drainage, suspension of acenocumarol, and onset of apixaban. After treatment persisted femoral neuropathy, which not allowed complete functional recovery. DISCUSSION: Femoral neuropathy as possible cause of compressive hematoma over iliopsoas muscle or secundary to lumbar canal stenosis and contact with L4 root. In both of the misit posible to observe weakness of proximal lower limb musculature. Haematoma was suspected due to lower back pain, flank mass and hypovolemia. Handlingis based on the severity of the symptomatology, from conservative to surgical drainage to reduce sequelae and bleeding complications. Apixaban has shown a higher safety profile. Stabilization of lumbar fracture allowed partial functional recovery.
