Title: Incoherent optical fluctuation flowmetry for detecting limbs with hemodynamically significant stenoses in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The development of new highly accurate, inexpensive and accessible methods for the detection of lower-extremity peripheral artery disease (LE-PAD) in diabetic patients is required. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new incoherent optical fluctuation flowmetry (IOFF) method in detecting legs with hemodynamically significant stenoses compared to ankle brachial index (ABI) and transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO2) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited into 2 groups. Group 1 included patients with DM without LE-PAD and/or diabetic foot syndrome; Group 2 included patients with DM and LE-PAD. All patients underwent the following measurements: ultrasound (reference method), ABI, TcPO2, and the new IOFF method.
RESULTS: The new IOFF method showed a sensitivity of 79.5% and a specificity of 89.8% in detecting limbs with hemodynamically significant stenosis (AUC 0.890, CI 0.822-0.957). TcpO2 allows the diagnosis of LE-PAD with 69.2% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity (AUC 0.817, CI 0.723-0.911). Using a standard ABI cut-off of less than 0.9, the sensitivity and specificity for this parameter were 34.5% and 89.7%, respectively. Increasing the diagnostic cut-off of the ABI on the study group to 0.99 improved sensitivity to 84.6% and specificity to 78% (AUC,0.824 CI 0.732-0.915).
CONCLUSIONS: The new IOFF technique has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of LE-PAD in patients with DM. The high accuracy, rapid measurement, and potential availability suggest that the new IOFF method has a high potential for clinical application in the detection of PAD.
