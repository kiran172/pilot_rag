Title: Recurrent stroke syndrome without abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging caused by stenosis of middle cerebral artery: A case report.

Abstract: Middle cerebral artery stenosis is the leading and the most frequent cause of stroke due to intracranial stenosis in Asia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than computed tomography of the head for detecting acute brain ischemia. We are reporting a case of a 28-year-old female with recurrent left hemiparesis. After the last attack, an improvement in motor function was seen in less than 24 hours. Though the restoration of motor functions is not complete yet, an MRI scan that was done two weeks later appeared normal. Ischemic stroke in middle cerebral artery stenosis is associated with hemodynamic stroke due to hypoperfusion or lack of blood flow to brain tissue. Recurrent strokes can be prevented by better medical management in patients through regulation and management of risk factors.
