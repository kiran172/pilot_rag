Title: Association Between Premorbid Metabolic Syndrome and Coronary Arterial Stenosis: Results from One Medical Center in Taiwan.

Abstract: Background: Although the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease is already well-established, there is limited evidence as to whether individuals are at risk for cardiovascular disease during the premorbid state of MetS. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between coronary arterial stenosis and MetS in a nonhypertensive and nondiabetic population. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed the data of participants who underwent annual health checkups in a medical center. These data were collected from physical examination, blood tests, cardiac computed tomography examinations, and medical charts. We excluded those with established hypertension or diabetes and age of &lt;50 or &gt;75 years. Results: This study recruited 700 participants with a mean age of 59.5 years. More than 31% had MetS, and the overall prevalence of coronary arterial stenosis was 48.0% (grade 1, 2, 3, 4: 16.3%, 20.9%, 8.4%, 2.4%, respectively). In univariate analysis, older age, male sex, smoking, body mass index, elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG), elevated triglyceride, lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and presence of MetS were all positively correlated with coronary arterial stenosis. After adjustment for confounding factors, MetS still showed strong association with high grades of coronary arterial stenosis [odds ratio (OR) 2.86, confidence interval (95% CI) 1.30-4.01]. Specific components of MetS, such as elevated triglyceride [OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.14-3.57] and elevated FPG [OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.31-3.88], were also associated with coronary arterial stenosis. Conclusion: Our study concluded that premorbid MetS was significantly associated with coronary arterial stenosis. As for the individual components, elevated triglyceride and elevated FPG were both correlated with coronary arterial stenosis. Early preventive measures would be suggested at this stage of MetS to prevent future cardiovascular events.
