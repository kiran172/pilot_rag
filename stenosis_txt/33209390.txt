Title: Clinical course of tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TPO) is characterized by the presence of diffuse cartilaginous or bony submucosal nodules that lead to airway lumen narrowing. So far, there was no study in South Korea analysing a large number of TPO patients. We aimed to elucidate its treatment strategy and clinical course by analysing the characteristics of TPO patients.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the clinical data of 40 patients diagnosed with TPO by bronchoscopy between October 1997 and April 2019 at a single referral hospital.
RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 26 (65.0%) were male and the median age was 63.0 years. The most common symptom was cough (n=12, 30%). Pulmonary function test (PFT) revealed an obstructive pattern in 10 (25.7%) patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed 23 (62.6%) patients with diffuse narrowing and calcified nodules. In bronchoscopy, the entire trachea was found to be involved in 30 (75.0%) patients and airway narrowing was identified in 6 (15.0%) patients. Endobronchial biopsies were obtained from 15 patients and the most common findings included typical cartilaginous and bony tissues (n=14, 93.3%). Since most patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, they did not undergo any specific treatment. Of the 19 symptomatic patients, 2 (5.0%) patients received laser therapy for treating tracheal stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: TPO is a slowly progressing disease and is well managed with conservative therapies. Although TPO shows a distinctive pattern by bronchoscopy, it follows a benign clinical course.
