Title: Increased plasma levels of non-sugar sweeteners in patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Purpose. The non-sugar sweeteners acesulfame K and saccharin are considered safe, but there is conflicting evidence on their effects on cardiovascular health. Materials and methods. In this explorative pilot study, we measured plasma levels of acesulfame K and saccharin in 15 patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, 18 asymptomatic patients and 15 control subjects. Fecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids were analyzed. Dietary and medical history was assessed. Results. Symptomatic patients had higher levels of acesulfame K and saccharin compared to controls. Acesulfame K was associated with increased leukocyte count. Saccharin was associated with more severe carotid stenosis, as well as lower fecal butyric acid.
