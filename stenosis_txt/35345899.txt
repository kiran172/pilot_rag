Title: Correlation between characteristics of intracranial atherosclerotic plaques and ischemic stroke in high-resolution vascular wall MRI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis is a major cause of ischemic stroke, accounting for 30% of ischemic strokes in Asian populations.
PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between the degree of arterial stenosis and enhancement grade of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD), the plaque characteristics in different remodeling patterns, and its potential impact.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 210 patients diagnosed with ICAD were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into the middle cerebral artery (MCA) group (101 cases), posterior cerebral artery (PCA) group (14 cases), basilar artery (BA) group (71 cases), and intracranial segment of vertebral artery (VA) group (90 cases) according to the difference of diseased vessels. Data on presence or absence of ischemic infarction, intracranial vascular position of lesions, plaque characteristics, ICAD enhancement grade, remodeling index, and degree of arterial stenosis were collected for analysis.
RESULTS: The incidence of ischemic infarction in enhancement grade 2 was significantly higher than that in enhancement grade 1 in MCA group (P = 0.019). Enhancement grade 2 of ICAD was an independent risk factor for the development of ischemic infarction (odds ratio = 4.60; 95% confidence interval: 1.91-11.03; P = 0.001). There was no significant statistical difference in infarct rate between different remodeling modalities (P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Enhancement grade of ICAD is significantly associated with the degree of stenosis and the occurrence of ischemic stroke, which varies in different intracranial vessels. The pattern of vascular remodeling varies among different intracranial vessels, and the pattern of vascular remodeling has a significant impact on plaque characteristics.
