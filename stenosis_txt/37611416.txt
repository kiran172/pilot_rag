Title: Coronary Embolism After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement-Case Series and Review of Literature.

Abstract: Periprocedural systemic embolism is a well-documented complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Although the most focus was given to cerebral embolism (which remains unpredictable, difficult to prevent, and a source of increased morbidity and mortality after TAVR), coronary embolism remains less investigated and potentially overlooked. This study provides a case series of 3 patients diagnosed with coronary embolism after TAVR in our institution over a 2-year period (3 of 297 cases, 1%) and a systematic literature review (4 studies; 19 case reports). Overall, coronary embolism associated with TAVR is frequently characterized by proximal vessel occlusion causing ST-elevation myocardial infarction and hemodynamic instability with lower mortality in the acute phase as compared with late coronary embolism. However, it often presents with distal vessel occlusion and minor symptoms that may be overlooked in the periprocedural period. In conclusion, we suggest that TAVR-associated coronary embolism has a much higher prevalence than previously documented. Further studies are warranted to properly assess the prevalence and impact of this phenomenon.
