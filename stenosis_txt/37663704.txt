Title: Giant left atrium and management modalities (surgical vs. conservative): a case report from Mauritania.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Giant left atrium (GLA) is a rare condition often associated with rheumatic heart disease and can lead to cardiac and extracardiac complications. In this case report, the authors present a rare case of GLA with extracardiac complications, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis and management.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old woman with a 25-year history of mitral stenosis caused by rheumatic heart disease presented with symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations. Diagnostic tests revealed an enlarged left atrium, pleural effusion, severe pulmonary hypertension, and tricuspid regurgitation. The patient was treated with diuretics and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and is currently on a medication regimen with regular follow-up appointments.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: GLA can cause cardiac and extracardiac complications, and conservative treatment and surgery are both involved in the management plan. The reduction of left atrial size by surgery may eliminate symptoms, reduce postoperative complications, and increase the probability of regaining sinus rhythm.
CONCLUSION: Observational data on managing GLA is limited, and mortality can be high. Cardiovascular surgeons should carefully consider surgical options, and screening and follow-up are essential for early detection and management in patients with long-standing rheumatic heart disease.
