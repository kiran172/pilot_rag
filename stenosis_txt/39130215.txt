Title: Vaginal Delivery in a Tracheostomised Woman: A Rare Case Scenario.

Abstract: Spontaneous vaginal delivery in a tracheostomised woman is rare and literature concerning the same is also very limited, hence this might help in considering vaginal delivery at term as an option in such patients when there are no medical or obstetrical contraindications for the same. We present a case of a 24 years female patient hailing from Tamil Nadu in South India, who was tracheostomised secondary to subglottic stenosis, presented to Otorhinolaryngology department at thirty-eight weeks of gestation to know the possibility of a vaginal delivery at term. Since the patient had an uneventful obstetrical history and no medical or obstetrical contraindications for a vaginal delivery, patient was advised breathing exercises including Valsalva manoeuvre and kept under close follow up. Patient went to labor at term at thirty-nine weeks and five days of gestation, and with the help of a panel of senior doctors underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. Vaginal delivery can be attempted in tracheostomised women, in the absence of any medical or obstetrical contra indications, if the patient is motivated and we have a panel of expert doctors from all concerned departments.
