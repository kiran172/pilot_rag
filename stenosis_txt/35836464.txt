Title: Uncommon Cause of Chronic Vomiting in Children.

Abstract: Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is unusual and must be suspected in children with chronic vomiting and abnormal weight status. The treatment depends on etiology, and surgery is not always the first remedy. Diagnosis is easily confirmed by upper gastrointestinal fibroscopy.We report the case of an 11-year-old girl, who was presented with non-bilious emesis and weight loss. Abdominal computed tomography, ultrasound, and upper gastrointestinal fibroscopy showed dilated stomach with pyloric stenosis, which was confirmed by abdominal laparoscopic exploration and cured by Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty. We also compare our study to previously reported cases.
