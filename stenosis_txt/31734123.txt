Title: The Relation of Calcium Volume Score and Stenosis of Carotid Artery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the value of extracranial carotid artery calcium score in predicting severity of carotid arterial stenosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 200 patients who had indication of contrast neck multi detector computed tomography were included. Calcium volume score of each calcified plaque (density more than 130 HU) was determined by multiplying area of calcified plaque in slice increment and presented as cubic centimeter (cc). Calcium score of each side (right or left) and each patient were determined. Severity of carotid stenosis in axial images was estimated and categorized. Statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS: 87 cases were female with mean age of 58.90 ± 10.67 and 113 cases were male with mean age of 59.61 ± 11.89 years old. The mean of volume score for all evaluated 800 vessels was .079 ± .046 cc. There was no significant difference between calcium score of right and left side (P value = .16). The mean "patient score" was .080 ± .049 cc (range: 0-.15 cc).Nine patients had volume score of 0 and all of them had no evidence of luminal stenosis. Significant increase in severity of stenosis was seen with increase in "patient score".(P value < .001, r = .875).According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, "patient score" of .09 cc with sensitivity of 97% and "patient score" of .12 cc with sensitivity of 95% can predict 50% and 70% stenosis, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Promising role of calcium score for predicting severity of carotid stenosis could be considered.
