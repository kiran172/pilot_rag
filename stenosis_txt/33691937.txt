Title: Custom nasal stent and columellar reconstruction after a rhinoplasty complication: A clinical report.

Abstract: Nostril stenosis is typically caused by retraction and contraction after trauma or infection, although loss of nasal tissue is not common during rhinoplasty. This clinical report describes the fabrication of a nasal stent to replace the lost columella and a columella prosthesis for a patient who had had reconstructive surgery for nasal valve collapse and a missing columella. The stent established a comfortable means of nasal air exchange that was also esthetically acceptable. The stent also provided the necessary support for the nasal tissue before further nasal reconstructive surgeries.
