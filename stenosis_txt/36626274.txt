Title: Long-term clinical outcomes of a fully covered self-expandable metal stent for refractory pancreatic strictures in symptomatic chronic pancreatitis: An 11-year follow-up study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A fully covered self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) has recently been applied in the management of chronic pancreatitis patients with pancreatic strictures. However, related long-term effects remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of FCSEMS placement in chronic pancreatitis patients with refractory strictures.
METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed our database for patients undergoing FCSEMS placement for refractory pancreatic strictures between September 2008 and December 2010. The main outcomes were technical, radiological, and clinical success, as well as recurrence and adverse events.
RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were included. Technical success was achieved in all patients. The median FCSEMS indwelling time was 3.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 3.0-4.9 months). Radiological success was achieved in all patients (complete, n = 2; partial, n = 33). Clinical success was achieved in 29 patients (82.9%; complete analgesic cessation, n = 19; analgesic reduction >50%, n = 11). During the median follow-up of 136 months, (IQR, 85.8-145.5 months), eight patients (22.9%) experienced recurrence. The median interval from stent removal to recurrence was 24.9 months (IQR, 11.3-30.3 months). Biliary obstruction, an early adverse event, occurred in two patients (5.7%); the late adverse event stent-induced de novo stricture was observed in 17 patients (48.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that an FCSEMS is effective for relieving refractory strictures in chronic pancreatitis. However, FCSEMSs were associated with stent-induced de novo strictures in nearly half of the patients. Prospective studies are required to further evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of FCSEMSs in chronic pancreatitis.
