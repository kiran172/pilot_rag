Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a palliative approach to infective endocarditis.

Abstract: An 88-year-old man with small lymphocytic lymphoma presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was diagnosed with heart failure. Serial blood cultures and echocardiography revealed Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis, complicated by severe aortic regurgitation. Despite intravenous antibiotic therapy and aggressive intravenous diuresis therapy in the hospital, he decompensated into cardiogenic shock, requiring invasive haemodynamic monitoring and inotrope therapy. With multidisciplinary discussion involving the patient and his children, there was a joint decision that at his advanced age, he would not pursue surgical aortic valve replacement and instead proceed with a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with palliative intent. He underwent TAVR with subsequent symptomatic and functional improvement as well as resolution of cardiogenic shock.
