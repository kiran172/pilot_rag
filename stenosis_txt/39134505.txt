Title: Application of targeted nursing intervention in patients undergoing synchronous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of targeted nursing intervention on the short-term prognosis of patients with coronary heart disease and carotid artery stenosis undergoing synchronous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: A total of 58 patients who received OPCABG + CEA from February 2018 to May 2021 at the Beijing Anzhen Hospital were selected as the study subjects. They were randomly divided into two groups, with 29 patients in each group. The control group received routine postoperative nursing care, while the observation group received targeted nursing intervention in addition to the routine care. The incidence of postoperative stroke and the length of postoperative stay were observed.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in baseline data between the two groups. Postoperative acute stroke occurred in 2 cases (6.9%) in the control group and 0 cases in the observation group, although this difference was not statistically significant. The median postoperative hospital stay was 13 days in the control group, with the earliest discharge at 10 days. In the observation group, the median postoperative hospital stay was 10 days, with the earliest discharge on the 8th day. This difference was statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted nursing intervention can improve the short-term prognosis of patients with coronary heart disease and carotid artery stenosis undergoing OPCABG + CEA, and it can also shorten the length of postoperative hospital stay.
