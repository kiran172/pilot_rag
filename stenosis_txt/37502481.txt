Title: In-stent stenosis after stenting the PulseRider for a middle cerebral artery aneurysm: A case report.

Abstract: PulseRider is a self-expanding stent implant used to treat wide-necked aneurysms. As this device has a lower metal mass than conventional stents, it is expected to have a lower rate of ischemic complications and a shorter period with antiplatelet drugs. We experienced in-stent stenosis after endovascular treatment with the PulseRider for a middle cerebral artery aneurysm. A 40-year-old woman with an unruptured aneurysm in the middle cerebral artery bifurcation underwent coil embolization using a PulseRider. The periprocedural course was not problematic, and postoperative angiography showed contrast filling in the aneurysm. The patient was discharged from our hospital on postembolization day 3. However, follow-up angiography after 6 months showed in-stent stenosis. Fortunately, no ischemic complications occurred after treatment. Although the PulseRider is characterized by a low metal mass, it should be noted that this device has some metal markers that can induce in-stent stenosis.
