Title: Effectiveness of Adding Antiplatelets to Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke with Atrial Fibrillation and Concomitant Large Artery Steno-Occlusion.

Abstract: We investigated the effectiveness of adding antiplatelet (AP) to oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment versus OAC treatment alone in patients with AIS with atrial fibrillation (AF) and significant large artery steno-occlusion (LASO). This study is a retrospective analysis of a nationwide, prospective, multicenter stroke registry between April 2008 and November 2017. Patients with acute (within 48 h of onset) and mild-to-moderate (NIHSS score ≤ 15) stroke with AF and concomitant LASO were identified. Antithrombotic regimens at discharge were categorized into OAC alone or OAC + AP. The primary outcome event was a composite of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality within 3 months of stroke. Among the 2553 patients (age, 73 ± 10 years; men, 50.4%), 78.8% were treated with OAC alone, and 21.2% were treated with OAC + AP. The primary outcome events were significantly more common in the OAC + AP group (6.7%) than the OAC alone group (4.3%) (p = 0.02). Weighted Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that OAC + AP increased the risk of 3-month primary outcome events compared with OAC alone (HR, 1.62 [1.06 to 2.46]). A potential interaction between the type of LASO and discharge antithrombotics was suggested (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.04); unlike in patients with complete occlusion (OAC + AP; HR, 2.00 [1.27-3.15]), OAC + AP was comparable with OAC alone for 3-month primary outcome in patients with moderate-to-severe stenosis (HR, 0.54 [0.17-1.70]). In conclusion, OAC + AP might increase the risk of 3-month outcome events compared with OAC alone in patients with AIS with AF and concomitant LASO. However, the effect of additional AP to OAC might differ according to LASO type.
