Title: Inverted Takotsubo Following a Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy, Treated with Levosimendan.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Takotsubo syndrome is a transient stunned myocardium that typically involves the apical and mid-ventricular segments. A variant, called Inverted Takotsubo, concerns the basal and mid-ventricular segments.
CASE SUMMARY: We present a ruptured ectopic pregnancy that was responsible for a catecholamine surge, which led to this stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mid-basal segments akinesia and hypercontractility of the apical segments. Biology has shown mild elevated troponin and NT-pro-BNP levels which led to performing a coronary angiography that showed no angiographic stenosis. A left ventricle angiography evoked the diagnosis of inverted Takotsubo. The patient has received Levosimendan to allow progressive weaning of catecholamine inotropes. The clinical evolution was favorable. Echocardiography performed after 3 weeks, showed ad-integrum restitution of the left ventricular function.
DISCUSSION: Takotsubo syndrome should be evoked whenever a context of physical or psychological stress is present. We underline the usefulness of Levosimendan as a nonadrenergic inotrope in this particular context.
