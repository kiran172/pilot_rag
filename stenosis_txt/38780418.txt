Title: Tuning Recombinant Perlecan Domain V to Regulate Angiogenic Growth Factors and Enhance Endothelialization of Electrospun Silk Vascular Grafts.

Abstract: Synthetic vascular grafts are used to bypass significant arterial blockage when native blood vessels are unsuitable, yet their propensity to fail due to poor blood compatibility and progressive graft stenosis remains an intractable challenge. Perlecan is the major heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan in the blood vessel wall with an inherent ability to regulate vascular cell activities associated with these major graft failure modes. Here the ability of the engineered form of perlecan domain V (rDV) to bind angiogenic growth factors is tuned and endothelial cell proliferation via the composition of its glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain is supported. It is shown that the HS on rDV supports angiogenic growth factor signaling, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165, while both HS and chondroitin sulfate on rDV are involved in VEGF189 signaling. It is also shown that physisorption of rDV on emerging electrospun silk fibroin vascular grafts promotes endothelialization and patency in a murine arterial interposition model, compared to the silk grafts alone. Together, this study demonstrates the potential of rDV as a tunable, angiogenic biomaterial coating that both potentiates growth factors and regulates endothelial cells.
