Title: Persistent Left Ventricular Wall Thickening after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Hidden Cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: • ATTRwt is underdiagnosed, and sometimes coexists with AS. • ATTRwt with AS tends to result in a poor prognosis after TAVR. • Recognizing coexistent ATTRwt before TAVR is crucial. • STE and cardiac scintigraphy are useful in diagnosing ATTRwt. • Persistent wall thickening after TAVR suggests an occult ATTRwt.
