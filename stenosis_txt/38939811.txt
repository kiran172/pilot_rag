Title: Atrial and Ventricular Arrhythmia in Adults With Shone Complex: A Single-Center Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multilevel obstruction in left ventricular inflow and outflow predisposes to arrhythmias in Shone's complex (SC).
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to study the prevalence and outcomes (heart failure [HF] hospitalization, cardiac transplant, death) of cardiac arrhythmias in adults with SC.
METHODS: Adults with SC (defined as ≥2 lesions out of supramitral ring, parachute mitral valve, subvalvular/valvular aortic stenosis (AS), and aortic coarctation) seen at Mayo Clinic between January 1999 and March 2020 were identified and evaluated for the presence of sustained atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to calculate the occurrence of these arrhythmias.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with SC (mean age at first visit 33 ± 13 years) were identified. Most common anomalies were valvular AS (88%), coarctation (85%), parachute mitral valve (44%), subvalvular AS (44%), and supramitral ring (25%). Atrial arrhythmias were diagnosed in 24 patients (33%) at a mean age of 34.6 ± 12.7 years. Patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter had higher number of surgeries, left atrial size, right ventricular systolic pressure, and HF hospitalizations. A rhythm control approach was used in majority of patients (75% on antiarrhythmic drugs and 50% underwent catheter ablation). Sustained VA occurred in 6 of 73 patients of whom 4 had an ejection fraction <40%. Death and cardiac transplantation occurred in 11 and 3 patients, respectively, during a median follow-up of 7.3 ± 6.0 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults with SC, atrial arrhythmias occurred in one-third of patients, were associated with more HF hospitalizations, and frequently required rhythm control. Prevalence of sustained VA was 8% and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation should be considered in those with reduced ejection fraction.
