Title: Diagnostic value of peripheral blood miR-296 combined with vascular endothelial growth factor B on the degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary heart disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a disorder resulting from organic and functional coronary artery stenosis (CAS), thus causing reduced oxygenated blood in the heart. miRNAs are useful biomarkers in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis, CHD, and acute coronary syndrome. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is closely related to CHD. This study explored the correlation of miR-296 and VEGF-B expression levels in peripheral blood with CAS degree in CHD patients.
METHODS: Totally 220 CHD patients were enrolled and classified into mild-(71 cases)/moderate-(81 cases)/severe-CAS (68 cases) groups, with another 80 healthy cases as controls. The serum miR-296 and VEGF-B expression levels were detected using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between miR-296 and CAS-related indexes was assessed via Pearson analysis. The binding relationship of miR-296 and VEGF-B was first predicted and their correlation was further analyzed via the Pearson method. The clinical diagnostic efficacy of miR-296 or VEGF-B on CAS degree was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve.
RESULTS: Serum miR-296 was downregulated in CHD patients and was the lowest in patients with severe-CAS. miR-296 was negatively-correlated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, brain natriuretic peptide, and cardiac troponin I. miR-296 targeted VEGF-B. VEGF-B was upregulated in CHD patients and inversely-related to miR-296. Low expression of miR-296 and high expression of VEGF-B both had high clinical diagnostic values on CAS degree in CHD patients. miR-296 combined with VEGF-B increased the diagnostic value on CAS.
CONCLUSION: Low expression of miR-296 combined with high expression of its target VEGF-B predicts CAS degree in CHD patients.
