Title: Increased Piezo1 expression in myofibroblasts in patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaques undergoing carotid endarterectomy: A pilot study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate Piezo1 expression in myofibroblasts in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and its relationship with atherosclerotic plaque formation.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed carotid plaques of 17 randomly selected patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy from May 2015 to August 2017. In total, 51 sections (the most stenotic lesion, and the sections 5-mm proximal and distal) stained with hematoxylin-eosin and elastica-Masson were examined. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies to Piezo1. The Piezo1 score of a section was calculated semiquantitatively, averaged across 30 randomly selected myofibroblasts in the fibrous cap of the plaque.
RESULTS: Of 17 patients (mean age: 74.2 ± 7.1 years), 15 were men, 9 had diabetes mellitus, and 13 had hypertension. Symptomatic patients had higher mean Piezo1 score than asymptomatic patients (1.78 ± 0.23 vs 1.34 ± 0.17, p &lt; .001). Univariate linear regression analyses suggested an association between plaque rupture, thin-cap fibroatheroma and microcalcifications and the Piezo1 score (p = .001, .008, and 0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased Piezo1 expression of myofibroblasts may be associated with atherosclerotic carotid plaque instability. Further study is warranted to support this finding.
