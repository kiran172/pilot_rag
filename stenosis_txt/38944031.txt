Title: Severe aortic stenosis treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation or surgical aortic valve replacement with Perimount in Western Denmark 2016-2022: a nationwide retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The healthcare registries in Denmark present a unique opportunity to gain novel insights into the outcomes associated with both transcatheter and surgical approaches to aortic valve replacement. Our objective is to enhance shared decision-making by comparing long-term mortality and clinical outcomes between treatments.
METHODS: This observational study included all patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing elective isolated transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in Western Denmark between January 2016 and April 2022. Patient population and clinical data were identified from the Western Danish Heart Registry and the National Danish Patient Registry, respectively. A propensity score-matched population was generated. Outcomes were investigated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-3.
RESULTS: A total of 2269 TAVI patients and 1094 SAVR patients where identified. The propensity score-matched population consisted of 468 TAVI patients (mean[SD]age, 75.0[5.3] years) and 468 SAVR patients (mean[SD] age, 75.1[4.6]years). The Kaplan-Meier estimate for the 5-year all-cause mortality was 29.8% in the TAVI group and 16.9% for in the SAVR group (P = 0.019). The risk of all stroke or transient ischaemic attack after five year was 15.1% in the TAVI group and 11.0% in the SAVR group (P = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of evaluating all patient factors when choosing an aortic valve replacement method. Surgical aortic valve replacement was an excellent choice, especially for patients with New York Heart Association class I/II, ≥75 age, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%, or longer life expectancy.
