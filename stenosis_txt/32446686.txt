Title: Microbiological Status as a Factor of Airway Complications After Lung Transplantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation (LTx) is the only treatment for patients with end-stage lung disease. This procedure is associated with a risk of complications related to airway stenosis, which can be treated by means of bronchoscopic interventions (BI). Microbiological colonization may have an impact on airway complications. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of presence of microbiological pathogens in graft among lung recipients and frequency of BI, considered as the indicator of severe complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was single-center retrospective cohort research; cases of 116 patients with complete microbiological data who underwent LTx from April 2013 to June 2019 were reviewed (70.3% of transplanted patients). All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 25.0 and R 3.5.3. For analyses involving the number of bronchoscopy interventions, univariate and multivariate Poisson regression were used. Interaction effect of variables in multivariate Poisson regression was assessed with partial response plot.
RESULTS: The mean number of pathogens colonizing each patient was approximately 4.66 (range, 0 to 19) with Candida albicans (n = 42, 36.2%), Aspergillus spp. (n = 33, 28.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 32, 27.59%), and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n = 29, 25%) being the most prominent. Microbiological agents causing the greatest increase in the risk of intervention are as follows: Proteus mirabilis by 3.84 times, Aspergillus spp. by 3.53 times, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by 3.09 times. Burkholderia multivorans, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella spp. do not have a statistically significant impact on the number of BI.
CONCLUSIONS: Some pathogens increase the frequency of complications, which are associated with deterioration of the general condition. Therefore, patients should be monitored for the presence of pathogens in the airways.
