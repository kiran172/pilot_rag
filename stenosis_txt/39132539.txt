Title: Intracoronary Brachytherapy for Drug-Eluting Stent Restenosis: Outcomes and Clinical Correlates.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to report outcomes of intracoronary brachytherapy (ICBT) in treating drug-eluting stent (DES) in-stent restenosis (ISR) and identify correlated factors.
METHODS: Patients who underwent ICBT for DES ISR from 2010 to 2021 were included in this single-institution retrospective PCI registry. Patients were treated with balloon angioplasty, laser atherectomy, and/or rotational atherectomy, followed by ICBT at a dose of 18.4-25 Gy delivered at the site of ISR with dose determined by the reference vessel size. The primary outcome was 3-year target lesion failure rate (TLF). Secondary end points were 1-year TLF, target lesion revascularization (TLR), all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality.
RESULTS: In total, 330 consecutive patients presented with 345 treated lesions; 70% were male, age was 66 Â± 11 years, 55% were diabetic patients, 62% underwent previous bypass surgery, and 89% were placed with at least 2 stent layers at the treated site. The rate of TLF was 18% at 1 year and 46% at 3 years. All-cause mortality and cardiac mortality rates were 19.8% and 12.3% at 3 years. The number of stent layers was associated with 3-year TLF (1 layer, 33.3%; 2 layers, 47.0%, &gt;3 layers, 60.2%; P = .045). Diabetes, repeat ICBT, final percent stenosis, lesion length, and intravascular imaging use were not correlated with the primary outcome. Lower ICBT dose (P = .035) and restenosis &lt;1 year from previous percutaneous coronary intervention (P = .044) were correlated with early (1-year) TLF.
CONCLUSION: ICBT for recurrent DES ISR provided low recurrence rates at 1 year, which increased substantially by 3 years. Outcomes were most closely correlated with the number of stent layers, but early restenosis and lower ICBT dose adversely affected early TLF.
