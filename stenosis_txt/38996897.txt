Title: Next-Day Discharge After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With the ACURATE neo/neo2 Self-Expanding Aortic Bioprosthesis.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown the safety of early discharge pathways in selected patients and using selected transcatheter heart valves. Hence, we sought to evaluate the safety of next-day discharge (NDD) in patients who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) with the ACURATE neo/neo2 (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) self-expanding aortic bioprosthesis. Patients who underwent TF-TAVI between January 2018 and April 2023 were prospectively included. Patients were stratified into 3 groups according to discharge times within 24 hours (NDD), between 24 and 48 hours, and those discharged >48 hours after TAVI. The primary outcome was the first unplanned readmission at 30 days after TAVI. Log-rank test was used to assess the differences in the outcome of interest between the groups. A total of 368 all-comers were included in this study. According to discharge times, 204 patients followed NDD, 69 patients 24 to 48 hours discharge, and 95 patients >48 hours discharge after TAVI. The mean age was 84 ± 6.3 years and 61% were women, without differences between the groups. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was lower in those with NDD versus 24 to 48 hours and >48 hours (2.9 ± 1.0, 3.2 ± 1.2, and 3.4 ± 1.4, respectively, p = 0.014). There were no differences between the groups in terms of preprocedural right bundle branch block or pacemaker. The need for new permanent pacemaker implantation was the leading postprocedural complication; it occurred more frequently in the >48 hours group than the 24 to 48 hours, and <24 hours groups (24% vs 8.6% and 2.2%, p <0.001). There were 5 strokes (1.4%) and all of them occurred in the >48 hours group (p = 0.005). At 30 days after discharge, there were no deaths and no differences in all-cause readmissions (9.3% in <24 hours, 8.6% in 24 to 48 hours, and 19% in >48 hours, log-rank p = 0.087). The readmission rates for new permanent pacemaker implantation requirement were 3.3% (n = 6) in NDD, 0% in 24 to 48 hours, and 1.6% (n = 5) in the >48 hours groups (p = 0.27). In conclusion, in unselected patients who underwent TF-TAVI with the ACURATE neo/neo2 self-expanding bioprosthesis, the NDD pathway is feasible and appears to be safe, without an increased risk of death or all-cause rehospitalization through 30 days after hospital discharge.
