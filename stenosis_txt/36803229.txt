Title: In-stent restenosis and stented-territory infarction after carotid and vertebrobasilar artery stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prognosis after vertebrobasilar stenting (VBS) may differ from that after carotid artery stenting (CAS). Here, we directly compared the incidence and predictors of in-stent restenosis and stented-territory infarction after VBS and compared them with those of CAS.
METHODS: We enrolled patients who underwent VBS or CAS. Clinical variables and procedure-related factors were obtained. During the 3 years of follow-up, in-stent restenosis and infarction were investigated in each group. In-stent restenosis was defined as reduction in the lumen diameter > 50% compared with that after stenting. Factors associated with the occurrence of in-stent restenosis and stented-territory infarction in VBS and CAS were compared.
RESULTS: Among 417 stent insertions (93 VBS and 324 CAS), there was no statistical difference in in-stent restenosis between VBS and CAS (12.9% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.092). However, stented-territory infarction was more frequently observed in VBS than in CAS (22.6% vs. 10.8%; P = 0.006), especially a month after stent insertion. HbA1c level, clopidogrel resistance, and multiple stents in VBS and young age in CAS increased the risk of in-stent restenosis. Diabetes (3.82 [1.24-11.7]) and multiple stents (22.4 [2.4-206.4]) were associated with stented-territory infarction in VBS. However, in-stent restenosis (odds ratio: 15.1, 95% confidence interval: 3.17-72.2) was associated with stented-territory infarction in CAS.
CONCLUSIONS: Stented-territory infarction occurred more frequently in VBS, especially after the periprocedural period. In-stent restenosis was associated with stented-territory infarction after CAS, but not in VBS. The mechanism of stented-territory infarction after VBS may be different from that after CAS.
