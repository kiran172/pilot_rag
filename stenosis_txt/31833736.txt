Title: Fenestrated endografting is the preferred option for juxta-renal aortic aneurysm reconstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to report early/mid-term-up outcomes of fenestrated endografting (FEVAR) for juxta-renal aneurysms (j-AAAs).
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2019, all consecutive j-AAAs treated by FEVAR were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Early endpoints were technical success, renal function worsening and 30-day mortality. Follow-up endpoints were survival, freedom from re-interventions (FFRs) and target visceral vessels (TVVs) patency.
RESULTS: Among 240 cases of FB-EVAR, 98(41%) were j-AAAs. Endografts with 1,2,3,4 and 5 fenestrations were planned in 3(3%), 25(26%), 35(36%), 33(34%) and 2(1%) cases, respectively. Overall, 360 TVVs were treated by fenestrations and scallops. Technical success was achieved in 97(99%) cases. The only failure was 1 type III endoleak requiring renal artery relining. No TVVs were lost. Renal function worsening was reported in 22(22%) and 12(12%) cases at 24-hour and 30-day, respectively. One patient required hemodialysis and died within 30-day (1%). This was the only case of 30-day mortality. The mean follow-up was 36Â±32months. Aneurysm sac shrinkage or stability was observed in 55(56%) and 41(42%) cases, respectively. Two (2%) patients with persistent type II endoleak had sac enlargement and required re-interventions. Freedom from reinterventions at 5-year was 86%. An asymptomatic celiac trunk occlusion (accommodated by a scallop) occurred at 24-month in a case with a severe preoperative stenosis. No late renal arteries occlusions or type I-III endoleaks occurred. TVVs-patency was 96% at 5-year. Renal function worsening was reported in 10(10%) patients during follow-up. Survival at 5-year was 73%, with no j-AAA related mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P=0.007; OR:4.8; 95% CI: 1.5-15.3) and postoperative renal function worsening (P=0.028; OR:1,1; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2) were independent predictor for mortality at the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: FEVAR for j-AAAs is safe and effective at early and long-term follow-up. According with these results, it could be proposed as the first line treatment in high risk patients if anatomically fit. Long term survival is reduced in the presence of preoperative COPD and postoperative renal function worsening.
