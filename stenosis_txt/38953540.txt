Title: Retrospective study in 1020 cases on the rate of surgical site infections after lacrimal surgery without prophylactic systemic antibiotics.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Data regarding the effectiveness of prophylactic systemic antibiotics (PSA) in lacrimal surgery is scarce. Therefore, we determined the postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) rate in lacrimal surgery without PSA.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed files of patients who underwent external (extDCR) or endoscopic endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (endoDCR). We excluded patients with incomplete data (n = 68), acute a priori infection with the need for antibiotics (n = 15) and PSA post-operatively for other reasons (n = 28). Indications for surgery were canalicular stenosis (n = 51, 18.6% endoDCR vs n = 131, 19.5% extDCR), nasolacrimal duct obstruction (n = 118, 43.2% endoDCR vs n = 480, 64.3% extDCR) and mucocele/chronic dacryocystitis (n = 52, 19.0% endoDCR vs n = 187, 25.0% extDCR).
RESULTS: In this study, 1020 DCR surgeries were performed in 899 patients. Postoperative SSI was diagnosed in eight patients (0.8%); exclusively after extDCR (1.1% of all extDCR). No SSIs were found in endoDCR cases. The prevalence between SSI in extDCR versus endoDCR did not prove significant (n = 8/747 0.8% vs n = 0/273 0%, p = 0.13). All patients diagnosed with SSI were successfully treated with systemic oral antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SSI after DCR is low and was effectively treated with oral antibiotics. In our study, SSI occurred rarely after extDCR and was not observed after endoDCR. We conclude that lacrimal surgery is safe without the routine administration of PSA.
