Title: Clinical Outcomes of Revascularization with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Prior to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prior studies on revascularization prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), in patients with significant coronary artery disease (CAD), have reported mixed results.
AIM: We sought to perform a meta-analysis combining current evidence by investigating outcomes of revascularization in patients who undergo TAVR with coexisting CAD.
METHODS: We searched literature for studies reporting on outcomes following TAVR performed with versus without pre-TAVR PCI, for coexisting CAD. Random-effect model was used to pool estimates of odds ratios (ORs).
RESULTS: Twenty-four reports with 12,182 TAVR patients were included: 22 observational and 2 clinical trials. 4,110 (33.7%) were in the pre-TAVR PCI group, 51.4% were females, and mean age was 81.9 years. The 30-day mortality was 5.2% versus 5.0% in patients with versus without pre-TAVR PCI, respectively [OR= 1.19 (95% CI: 0.91-1.55, P= 0.20)]. Pooled 1-year mortality was 18.1% versus 19.1% in patients with versus without pre-TAVR PCI (OR= 1.12, 95% CI: 0.95-1.31, P= 0.61). There was no significant difference between the groups for myocardial infarction, stroke, acute kidney injury, pacemaker implantation, or re-hospitalization. Pre-TAVR PCI was associated with an increased risk of life-threatening bleeding at 30 days.
CONCLUSION: Pre-TAVR revascularization with PCI was not associated with improved 30-day or 1-year mortality; however, it was associated with an increased risk of life-threatening bleeding at 30-day post-TAVR. Our results do not support routine revascularization with PCI prior to TAVR with coexisting CAD. Future trials addressing anatomical complexity and symptom burden may help better risk stratify patients who may benefit from pre-TAVR revascularization.
