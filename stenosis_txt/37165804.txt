Title: Complications following transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair: Personal experience and review of the literature.

Abstract: Mitral valve dysfunction affects around 2% of the population and its incidence is still increasing, making it the second most common valvular heart disease, after aortic stenosis. Depending on the etiology of the disease, it can be classified into primary or secondary mitral regurgitation. The first line of treatment is optimal medical therapy. If ineffective, mitral valve intervention can be considered. For patients disqualified from surgical treatment, transcatheter edge-to-edge repair with the use of MitraClip may be considered. Over 100,000 MitraClip procedures have been performed which makes this the most established transcatheter technique for the treatment of severe mitral regurgitation. The aim of this review is to discuss the technical details of the MitraClip procedure, clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of MitraClip, complications related to the clip implantation alongside with acute complications based on the currently available evidence and clinical experience.
