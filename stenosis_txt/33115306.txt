Title: Healing effects of a protein scaffold loaded with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells on radiation-induced vaginal injury in rats.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Cervical cancer, the most common female cancer after breast cancer, is typically treated using radiotherapy. However, pelvic radiotherapy can cause irreversible damage to the vagina, seriously affecting patients' quality of life. In this study, protein scaffolds loaded with rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) were implanted into irradiated tissue to assess their healing potential.
METHODS: We established a rat model of radiation-induced vaginal injury. Complexes (consisting of protein scaffolds loaded with ADSCs) were implanted into injury sites. Histological analysis were used to assess regeneration of the vaginal epithelium. RNA sequencing was used to study the therapeutic mechanism of the complexes.
RESULTS: The complexes promoted vaginal epithelial cell regeneration, vaginal tissue repair and improved vaginal stenosis and contracture. Compared with rats transplanted with ADSCs, rats transplanted with complexes achieved better therapeutic effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Protein scaffold-ADSC complexes had a beneficial therapeutic effect on radiation-induced vaginal injury in rats and may serve as the basis of a novel therapeutic approach for radiation dermatitis.
