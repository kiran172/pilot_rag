Title: Successful surgical repair for common arterial trunk with anterior crisscross pulmonary arteries and right aortic arch causing right bronchial compression.

Abstract: A 1-month-old girl with common arterial trunk, anteriorly originated crisscross pulmonary arteries, unusual running right aortic arch and severe pulmonary hypertension was initially palliated by bilateral pulmonary artery banding. She developed sudden respiratory failure at 80Â days old; and computed tomography revealed that the right main bronchus was severely compressed by the proximal aortic arch. When common arterial trunk repair was performed, the dominant aortic component of the common trunk incorporating both branch pulmonary arteries was cylindrically resected. End-to-end anastomosis of truncal root and distal ascending aorta was therefore performed to anteriorly retract the proximal arch, thereby relieving bronchial stenosis. The patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course, and postoperative computed tomography showed widely patent right main bronchus.
