Title: An Unusual Cause of Female Urinary Incontinence Following Obstetric Trauma.

Abstract: Urethral coitus is a rarely reported cause of female urinary incontinence and has been most commonly described in women with vaginal and hymenal anomalies. Herein, we report a 41-year-old woman with a complex obstetric history, who presented with continuous urinary incontinence. On evaluation, she was found to have an abnormally dilated urethral orifice and vaginal stenosis suggestive of chronic urethral coitus. She underwent a reduction urethroplasty with autologous sling insertion and a vaginoplasty using vaginal flaps. This case highlights the fact that urethral coitus, though rare, should be considered as a cause of urinary incontinence in women with history of obstetric vaginal trauma.
