Title: Carotid Artery Stenting in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: Direct Oral Anticoagulants, Brief Double Antiplatelets, and Testing Strategy.

Abstract: Carotid endarterectomy is usually preferred over carotid artery stenting (CAS) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We present our experience with short-course periprocedural triple antithrombotic therapy in 32 patients aged >18 years with nonvalvular AF undergoing CAS. There were no deaths, cardiac events, embolic strokes, hyperperfusion syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, or stent thrombosis within 30 days. Transient intraprocedural hemodynamic instability in 15/32 (47%) and prolonged instability in 4/32 (13%) was managed conservatively. At a mean 16-month follow-up, there were no new neurological events or deterioration. Mean stenosis was reduced from 78.0% ± 9.7% to 17.3% ± 12.2%. This retrospective study included patients AF who were symptomatic (minor stroke (NIHSS ≤ 5)/TIA) with ICA stenosis >50%, or asymptomatic under DOAC therapy with carotid stenosis >80%, who underwent CAS from 6/2014-10/2020. Patients received double antiplatelets and statins. Antiplatelet therapy effectiveness was monitored. Stenting was performed when P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) were <150. DOACs were discontinued 48 h before angioplasty; one 60 mg dose of subcutaneous enoxaparin was administered in lieu. DOAC was restarted 12-24 h after intervention. Patients were discharged under DOAC and one nonaspirin antiplatelet. 32 patients on DOAC were included (26 male, mean age 71). 19 (59.4%) presented with stroke (ICA stenosis-related in 14); 13 (40.6%) were asymptomatic. Stents were deployed under filter protection following pre-angioplasty; post-angioplasty was performed at least once in 12 patients (37.5%). Our experience suggests that CAS can be safely performed in selected patients with CAS and AF requiring DOAC. The role of CAS in AF patients under DOAC warrants study in rigorous trials.
