Title: [Predictive value of nerve root sedimentation sign in diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the predictive value of the nerve root sedimentation sign in the diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: Between January 2019 and July 2021, 201 patients with non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP) who met the selection criteria were retrospectively analyzed. There were 67 males and 134 females, with an age of 50-80 years (mean, 60.7 years). Four intervertebral spaces (L <sub>1, 2</sub>, L <sub>2, 3</sub>, L <sub>3, 4</sub>, L <sub>4, 5</sub>) of each case were studied, with a total of 804. The nerve root sedimentation sign was positive in 126 intervertebral spaces, and central canal stenosis was found in 203 intervertebral spaces. Progression to symptomatic LSS was determined by follow-up for lower extremity symptoms similar to LSS, combined with central spinal stenosis. Univariate analysis was performed for gender, age, visual analogue scale (VAS) score for low back pain at initial diagnosis, treatment, dural sac cross-sectional area at each intervertebral space, number of spinal stenosis segments, lumbar spinal stenosis grade, positive nerve root sedimentation sign, and number of positive segments between patients in the progression group and non-progression group, and logistic regression analysis was further performed to screen the risk factors for progression to symptomatic LSS in patients with NS-LBP.
RESULTS: All patients were followed up 17-48 months, with an average of 32 months. Of 201 patients with NS-LBP, 35 progressed to symptomatic LSS. Among them, 33 cases also had central spinal stenosis, which was defined as NS-LBP progressing to symptomatic LSS (33 cases in progression group, 168 cases in non-progression group). Univariate analysis showed that CSA at each intervertebral space, the number of spinal stenosis segments, lumbar spinal stenosis grade, whether the nerve root sedimentation sign was positive, and the number of nerve root sedimentation sign positive segments were the influencing factors for the progression to symptomatic LSS ( P&lt;0.05); and further logistic regression analysis showed that positive nerve root sedimentation sign increased the risk of progression of NS-LBP to symptomatic LSS ( OR=8.774, P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSION: The nerve root sedimentation sign may be associated with the progression of NS-LBP to symptomatic LSS, and it has certain predictive value for the diagnosis of LSS.
