Title: Current and future transcatheter aortic valve replacement valves.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review analyzes currently available commercial transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) valves as well as valves in investigational status and those in preclinical testing. The design features and clinical outcomes of the Edwards SAPIEN S3 and Medtronic Evolut PRO+ are described and compared with highlight clinical circumstances where one may be favoured over the other.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple randomized and nonrandomized trials have compared commercial and investigational TAVR valves. The results of these are summarized and discussed within this review with a focus on how the SAPIEN S3 and Evolut PRO+ both compare to each other as well as various valves in different investigational stages.
SUMMARY: TAVR is an innovative and ground-breaking technology that will forever have revolutionized the management of aortic stenosis. Though the technology and valves themselves have come a long way, further developments are necessary if we are to continue to expand its indications and achieve a safer perioperative experience with more durable valves.
