Title: [Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation under conscious sedation. Experience in 15 patients].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the standard of treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AE) and intermediate or high surgical risk. The use of conscious sedation (CS) could reduce complications and allow an early discharge of these patients.
AIM: To report our experience with TAVI under conscious sedation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of medical records of 15 patients aged 79 Â± 6 years (53% women) undergoing a transfemoral TAVI implant under conscious sedation.
RESULTS: The indications for the procedure were severe AE in 13 patients and biological prosthetic dysfunction in two. The mean Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality score was 7.3. The valves used were Edwards Sapien 3 in three patients, Medtronic Evolut in five, Boston Acurate Neo in four and Meril Myval in three. A successful implant was achieved in all cases and there were no hospital mortality or pacemaker requirements. One patient had a stroke, and one patient had a vascular access complication. Early discharge (< 72 h) was achieved in 80% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI under conscious sedation was a safe procedure and associated with a complication rate similar to previous reports, allowing for an early hospital discharge in most patients.
