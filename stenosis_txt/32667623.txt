Title: Association of Natriuretic Peptide Levels After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Subsequent Clinical Outcomes.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Among those with aortic stenosis, natriuretic peptide levels can provide risk stratification, predict symptom onset, and aid decisions regarding the timing of valve replacement. Less is known about the prognostic significance and potential clinical utility of natriuretic peptide levels measured after valve replacement.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations of elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and change in BNP levels between follow-up time points with risk of subsequent clinical outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis at intermediate, high, or prohibitive surgical risk for aortic valve replacement who underwent TAVR from the PARTNER IIA cohort, PARTNER IIB cohort, SAPIEN 3 intermediate-risk registry, and SAPIEN 3 high-risk registry were included. B-type natriuretic peptide levels were obtained at baseline and discharge as well as 30 days and 1 year after TAVR. For each measurement, a BNP ratio was calculated using measured BNP level divided by the upper limit of normal for the assay used. Outcomes were evaluated in landmark analyses out to 2 years. Data were collected from April 2011 to January 2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause death, cardiovascular death, rehospitalization, and the combined end point of cardiovascular death or rehospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 3391 included patients, 1969 (58.1%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 82 (7.5) years. Most patients had a BNP ratio greater than 1 at each follow-up time point, including 2820 of 3256 (86.6%) at baseline, 2652 of 2995 (88.5%) at discharge, 1779 of 2209 (80.5%) at 30 days, and 1799 of 2391 (75.2%) at 1 year. After adjustment, every 1-point increase in BNP ratio at 30 days (approximately equivalent to an increase of 100 pg/mL in BNP) was associated with an increased hazard of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.15), cardiovascular death (aHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11-1.21), and rehospitalization (aHR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14) between 30 days and 2 years. Among those with a BNP ratio of 2 or more at discharge, after adjustment, every 1-point decrease in BNP ratio between discharge and 30 days was associated with a decreased hazard of all-cause death (aHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96) between 30 days and 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated BNP levels after TAVR was independently associated with increased subsequent mortality and rehospitalizations. Further studies to determine how best to mitigate this risk are warranted.
