Title: Incidence, risk factors and predictors of cardiovascular mortality for aortic stenosis among patients with diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: AIMS: To find the incidence, risk factors and predictors of cardiovascular (CV) mortality for aortic stenosis (AS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: Between 2014 and 2019, 20,979 patients with T2DM who underwent echocardiography were enrolled for analysis. The mean follow-up period was 34 months. Multiple risk factors and outcomes for patients with and without AS were presented.
RESULTS: AS was present in 776 (3.70%) patients. Age, female, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease statistically increased risk of AS. The CV mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.336 - 2.906, p &lt; 0.001) and risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) (aHR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.442-2.082, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly increased in patients with AS, without significant differences in acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Severity of AS, body mass index (&lt;27 kg/m2), hypertension, hyperuricemia, left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt; 50%), and hematocrit (&lt;38%) were significantly associated with increased CV mortality and HHF.
CONCLUSIONS: AS was associated with an increased risk of CV mortality and HHF in patients with T2DM.
