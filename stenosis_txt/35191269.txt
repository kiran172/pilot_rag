Title: [Treatment of sciatica by lumbar nerve root canal injection under X-ray angiography].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the short-term clinical effect of lumbar nerve root canal injection under X-ray angiography in the treatment of sciatica.
METHODS: The clincal data of 78 patients with sciatica underwent lumbar nerve root canal injection under X-ray angiography from December 2017 to February 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. Including 31 males and 47 females, aged from 22 to 88 years old with a median of 65 years. There were 55 cases of lumbar disc herniation and 23 cases of lumbar spinal stenosis, the course of disease ranged from 1 to 8 weeks with a median of 3 weeks. There were 71 cases of single segment disc herniation or stenosis, including L<sub>3,4</sub> of 5 cases, L<sub>4,5</sub> of 61 cases, L<sub>5</sub>S<sub>1</sub> of 5 cases, and 7 cases of multisegment herniation or stenosis. The pain visual analogue scale (VAS) was recorded and Macnab was used to evaluate the clinical effect.
RESULTS: All patients completed standardized treatment without serious adverse reactions. VAS were (3.21±0.76) scores immediately after treatment, (2.89±0.33) scores 1 hour after treatment, (1.80±0.27) scores 6 hours after treatment, (1.10±0.20) scores 24 hours after treatment, (2.53±0.35) scores 1 week after treatment and (4.27±0.36) scores 1 month after treatment. There were significant differences in VAS between before treatment(7.83±0.56) and each time period after treatment(P&lt;0.05). According to Macnab low back pain evaluation standard, 42 cases were effective, 34 cases were markedly effective and 2 cases were ineffective within 24 hours after treatment, with an effective rate of 97.4%;38 cases were effective, 25 cases were markedly effective, 15 cases were ineffective within one week after treatment, the effective rate was 80.0%;32 cases were effective, 22 cases were markedly effective, 24 cases were ineffective within one month after treatment, the effective rate was 69.2%.
CONCLUSION: The short-term clinical effect of nerve root canal injection under X-ray radiography in the treatment of sciatica is good and it is an effective method to relieve sciatica.
