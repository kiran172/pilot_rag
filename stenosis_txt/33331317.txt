Title: [Association between CMTM5 gene and coronary artery disease and the relative mechanism].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the correlation between CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing member 5 (CMTM5) gene and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), and to detect the effects of CMTM5 gene expression changes on the ability of adhesion and migration of THP-1 cells.
METHODS: Using case-control method, a total of 700 hospitalized patients in Shijitan Hospital were enrolled in this study. CAD were diagnosed by coronary angiography, which was defined as at least one blood vessel diameter stenosis ≥50% according to the result of coronary angiography. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was used to detect CMTM5 gene expression; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method to detect the plasma level of CMTM5; and Logistic regression to analyze CMTM5 genes and the risk of CAD. Human vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and THP-1 cells were cultivated, adhesion and Transwells experiments were used to evaluate the chemotactic capabi-lity of CMTM5 gene on THP-1 cells.
RESULTS: In this study, 350 CAD patients matched with 350 control patients were included. RT-PCR results revealed CMTM5 mRNA expression in CAD group was 3.45 times compared with control group, which was significantly higher than that in control group (P &lt; 0.05). The levels of CMTM5 plasma protein in CAD group was (206.1±26.9) μg/L, which was significantly higher than that in control group (125.3±15.2) μg/L (P &lt; 0.05). After adjusted for the risk factors of age, gender, BMI, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, Logistic regression analysis results indicated that CMTM5 was the susceptibility factors of CAD, which still had significant correlation with CAD (P &lt; 0.05). Adhesion and Transwells experiments results revealed that the numbers of adhesion and migration of THP-1 cells in CMTM5 overexpression ECs group (EO group) were significantly higher than that in lenti-mock infected ECs group (EO-MOCK group), non-infected ECs group (EN group), lenti-mock infected ECs group (ES-MOCK group), and CMTM5 suppression ECs group (ES group). On the contrary, the numbers of adhesion and migration of THP-1 cells in ES group were significantly lower than that in the other four groups (P &lt; 0.01).
CONCLUSION: CMTM5 gene was closely related to the development of CAD. CMTM5 overexpression promoted the adhesion and migration of THP-1, which might play a part in the mechanisms of atherosclerosis and CAD.
