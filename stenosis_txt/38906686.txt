Title: Urgent carotid endarterectomy with distal mechanical thrombectomy.

Abstract: We review the technique for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and direct carotid access for distal thrombectomy after attempted proximal thrombectomy in the setting of tandem occlusions. A patient in their 70s presented with right facial droop and drooling and was found to have critical left carotid stenosis with filling defect in the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery consistent with vessel occlusion, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 0, and left M2 middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. After multiple attempts with different wire shapes guided by microcatheter injections within the carotid bulb, we were unable to cross the occlusion. Conversion to open CEA with distal thrombectomy was elected. Following closure of the arteriotomy, direct carotid access using a 5Fr radial artery sheath was achieved within the open surgical field for distal thrombectomy. A 5Fr aspiration catheter was navigated to the left M2 MCA where a stent retriever was then recaptured and TICI 2B reperfusion was achieved.
