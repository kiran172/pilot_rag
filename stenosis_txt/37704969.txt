Title: Improving assessment and escalation of threatened haemodialysis access: results of a nursing-led program.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Optimal vascular access is critical to successful haemodialysis. Acute thrombosis of haemodialysis access often leads to unplanned hospital admissions and interventions to restore patency. Western Health is a large health service in Victoria, Australia. During the period February 2019 to January 2020, the rate of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous graft (AVG) at Western Health satellite dialysis units was 0.33 episodes per 1000 patient-days, higher than the reported rate in the literature of 0.24 events per 1000 patient-days, and was associated with a cumulative total of 139 days of inpatient stay (2.2 per 1000 patient-days).
METHODS: The above results prompted creation of an education and escalation pathway for threatened haemodialysis access, based upon clinical markers of vascular access stenosis or imminent thrombosis assessed by nursing staff in satellite haemodialysis centres. In the period February 2020 to January 2021, the education and escalation pathway was implemented. We assessed referrals via the pathway, rates of AVF/AVG thrombosis and associated hospital length of stay in the following 12-month period (February 2021 to January 2022).
RESULTS: Following introduction of the pathway, rates of AVF/AVG thrombosis declined to 0.15 per 1000 patient-days (p = 0.02), associated with a decline in attributable cumulative inpatient stay to 55 days (0.69 per 1000 patient-days).
CONCLUSIONS: Our program demonstrates that the majority of thrombosed vascular access can be predicted and potentially averted with vigilant and well-practiced routine clinical assessment by trained nursing staff. Our nursing-led education and escalation program successfully identified vascular access at risk of imminent thrombosis, reduced rates of acute thrombosis and associated healthcare costs. Despite these improvements, there are still disparities in outcomes for patients with thrombosed vascular access, with regards to length of stay and requirement for insertion of a temporary central venous catheter (CVC) for urgent dialysis whilst awaiting intervention, and these are areas for further investigation and improvement.
