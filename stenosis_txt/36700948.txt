Title: [Interventional treatment of heart failure : Stents and valves].

Abstract: The pharmacotherapy of heart failure has evolved in recent years and with the aid of new classes of drugs symptomatic and prognostic improvements can be achieved in patients with heart failure. Heart failure is particularly frequently associated with coronary artery disease or higher grade, often functional valve defects. In the context of the underlying disease, the operative risk is often increased, so that interventional treatment is preferred over surgical treatment options in interdisciplinary heart teams. Promising approaches with very different challenges are emerging for interventional myocardial revascularization and percutaneous correction of high-grade aortic valve stenosis or functional mitral or tricuspid valve regurgitation. It has consistently been shown that an elaborate diagnostic work-up and differentiated patient selection are decisive to achieve a prognostic or symptomatic benefit in these patients using interventional treatment. While awaiting further study data on this topic, the integration of a multidisciplinary heart team is essential to ensure a complementary and balanced therapeutic approach for patient-centered care in this complex patient population.
