Title: "Uncrossed Central Facial Paralysis" Caused by Pontine Infarction: A Case Report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We report a patient with extraordinary pontine infarction-induced contralateral central facial palsy and weakened limb strength.
CASE REPORT: This is a 66-year-old man with left arm movement difficulty for 10 days and worsening over the last 1 day. His left nasolabial fold flattening and left arm strength and sensory were decreased. He could not complete the finger-nose test well with his right hand. Magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance angiography tests confirmed his right pontine acute infarction but without large vessel stenosis or occlusion.
CONCLUSION: "Uncrossed paralysis" patients may present with contralateral face and body weakness with pontine infarcts, if the infarct occurs above the level of the facial nucleus head, and may be simmilar with the higher level pontine lesions or cerebrum semisphere infarction, which need particular attention during clinical practice.
