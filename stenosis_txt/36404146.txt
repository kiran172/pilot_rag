Title: Sutureless aortic valves in isolated and combined procedures: Thirteen years of experience in 784 patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome and experience of the Perceval sutureless valve at our institution (UZ Leuven).
METHODS: Between 2007 and 2019, 784 patients underwent sutureless aortic valve replacement using the Perceval valve (isolated or combined with other procedures). We performed a retrospective analysis of the postoperative and follow-up data.
RESULTS: Mean age was 78 years with a median European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score of 4.2% (interquartile range, 2.6%-7.2%). Isolated aortic valve replacement accounted for 45% of cases; 30% of cases were aortic valve replacement in combination with coronary artery bypass grafting and the remaining 25% were other combined procedures. The median crossclamp times were 38 minutes in single aortic valve replacement, 70 minutes in cases with coronary artery bypass grafting, and 89 minutes in multiple valve cases. Device success was 99.1% and in-hospital mortality was 3.3%. Postoperative stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred in 1.9% of patients and 1% of patients had a new need for dialysis after surgery and median survival time was 7.0 years with a cumulative follow-up of 2797.8 patient-years. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year freedom from reintervention were 99%, 97%, and 94%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the longest follow-up available, to our knowledge, for the Perceval sutureless valve. We observed favorable early outcomes, and low rates of early mortality, stroke, and other major complications. Valve durability is promising with low rates of valve degeneration and a limited need for reintervention.
