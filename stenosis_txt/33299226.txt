Title: Outcomes of balloon dilation for paediatric laryngeal stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Balloon dilation (BD) is a minimally invasive endoscopic treatment for paediatric laryngeal stenosis (LS) with reduced morbidity compared to open surgery. We retrospectively describe our experience in a cohort of children with chronic LS.
METHODS: Fourteen children (median age: 28.5; range: 2-81 months) with chronic LS (multilevel in 8) were treated with tubeless total intravenous anaesthesia under spontaneous ventilation.
RESULTS: Grade III LS was preoperatively detected in 12 children; the remaining 2 had grade IV stenosis. Six had prior tracheotomy, and one received it during the first intervention. Dilation laryngoplasty was the primary treatment in 11 children and was used as an adjuvant treatment in 3 after open reconstructive surgery. The median number of dilations was 2 (range: 1-6). There were no postoperative complications. At the end of the follow-up (median: 20.5; range: 2-46 months), detectable laryngeal lumen widening and/or respiratory improvement occurred in 12 children. Two of 7 patients with tracheostomy were decannulated.
CONCLUSIONS: Balloon laryngoplasty is a valuable therapeutic option to improve laryngeal patency in children with chronic multilevel LS, both as a primary and secondary adjuvant treatment after reconstructive surgery.
