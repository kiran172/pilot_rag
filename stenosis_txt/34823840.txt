Title: Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Chronic and End-Stage Kidney Disease.

Abstract: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at higher risk of aortic stenosis. Data regarding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in these patients are limited. Herein, we aim to investigate TAVI outcomes in patients with ESKD and CKD. We analyzed clinical data of patients with ESKD and CKD who underwent TAVI from 2008 to 2018 in a large urban healthcare system. Patients' demographics were compared, and significant morbidity and mortality outcomes were noted. Multivariable analyses were used to adjust for potential baseline variables. A total of 643 patients with CKD underwent TAVI with an overall in-hospital mortality of 5.1%, whereas 84 patients with ESKD underwent TAVI with an overall mortality rate of 11.9%. The most frequently observed comorbidities in patients with CKD were heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), mitral stenosis (MS), pulmonary hypertension, and chronic lung disease. After multivariable analysis, MS (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 11.1, p <0.05) and AF (adjusted OR 2.42; 95% CI 1.3 to 4.4 p <0.05) were independently associated with mortality in patients with CKD. The most common comorbidities observed in patients with ESKD undergoing TAVI were heart failure, chronic lung disease, AF, MS, and pulmonary hypertension. An association between MS and increased mortality was observed (adjusted OR 2.01; 95 CI 0.93 to 2.02, p = 0.09) in patients with ESKD, but was not statistically significant. In conclusion, in patients with CKD undergoing TAVI, AF and MS were independently associated with increased mortality.
