Title: Long-Term Prognostic Impact of Restenosis of the Unprotected Left Main Coronary Artery Requiring Repeat Revascularization.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of target lesion revascularization (TLR) of the unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) after stent failure.
BACKGROUND: Although drug-eluting stents are safe and effective for treatment of the ULMCA, increased rates of repeat revascularization have been observed.
METHODS: This is a patient-level pooled analysis of the randomized ISAR-LEFT-MAIN (Drug-Eluting-Stents for Unprotected Left Main Stem Disease) and ISAR-LEFT-MAIN-2 (Drug-Eluting Stents to Treat Unprotected Coronary Left Main Disease) trials, in which patients underwent stenting of the ULMCA. The present analysis includes patients who underwent angiography during follow-up. Patients with TLR were compared with those without. Additional long-term clinical follow-up after TLR was conducted, and its influence on mortality was evaluated. Mortality was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of mortality were assessed in a multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1,001 patients were eligible, of whom 166 experienced TLR. The 5-year mortality rate was 30.2% in patients with TLR compared with 17.3% in those without TLR (p &lt; 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, glomerular filtration rate (-30 ml/min; hazard ratio [HR]: 2.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.54 to 3.27; p &lt; 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR: 4.95; 95% CI: 1.33 to 18.42; p = 0.02), and body mass index (+5 kg/m2; HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.32; p = 0.01) were independent predictors of mortality after TLR due to left main stent failure. The type of repeat revascularization and the underlying stent did not influence the mortality after TLR of the ULMCA.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality after TLR for left main stent failure is high. Patient-related factors seem to have a greater impact on mortality after TLR than other variables.
