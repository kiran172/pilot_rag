Title: Transcarotid arterial revascularization for symptomatic carotid web.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Symptomatic carotid web is an increasingly recognized cause of acute ischemic stroke with a high risk of recurrent ischemic events despite aggressive medical interventions. Surgical interventions including transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TFCAS) and carotid endarterectomy have been described to reduce this risk, but transcarotid arterial revascularization (TCAR) has not been evaluated for this purpose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with cerebral ischemia from carotid web underwent TCAR with flow reversal. Patients were monitored for periprocedural complications and assessed at follow-up for clinical evidence of recurrent ischemia.
RESULTS: Six cases over the course of 21 months were identified, 2 males and 4 females with a median age of 59.5 (interquartile range of 39). All underwent technically successful TCAR without periprocedural complications no post-procedural cerebral ischemia over a median follow-up time of 21 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small series of patients, TCAR provided a safe and effective treatment of carotid webs that had previously caused cerebral ischemia.
