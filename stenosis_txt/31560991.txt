Title: Coronary angiographic findings after cardiac arrest in relation to ECG and comorbidity.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The relations between specific ECG patterns and coronary angiographic findings in cardiac arrest patients with different comorbidities are not properly assessed. More evidence is needed to identify patients with the highest risk for acute coronary artery disease as a cause of the cardiac arrest. This study aims to describe the coronary artery findings after cardiac arrest in relation to ECG and comorbidity.
METHOD: A retrospective study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, with coronary angiography performed within 28 days. ECG on admission, comorbidity, PCI attempts and angiographic findings are described. Data were retrieved from national registries in Sweden.
RESULTS: Among 1133 patients with available ECG and angiography information the mean age was 64 years. The rate of shockable rhythm was 79%. The total incidence of any significant stenosis in cardiac arrest patients without ST-elevation who underwent coronary angiography within 28 days was 71%. The incidence of any stenosis in patients with normal ECG was 62.1% and in patients with LBBB, 59.3%. In patients with ST-depression or RBBB, PCI attempts were made in 47.1% and 42.4% respectively, compared with 33.3% in patients with normal ECG. Among patients without ST-elevation, those with diabetes mellitus and those with initial shockable rhythm respectively, 84.8% and 71.5 had at least one significant stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests, that evaluation of ECG patterns and comorbidities in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients without ST-segment elevation may be important to identify those with a high risk of coronary artery lesions that could benefit from early revascularization.
