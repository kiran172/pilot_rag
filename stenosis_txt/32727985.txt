Title: Stent Placement for Malignant Inferior Vena Cava Syndrome in a Patient with Recurrent Colon Cancer.

Abstract: A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with gait disturbance due to marked edema of the lower limbs for more than 6 months. He had been receiving systemic chemotherapy over two years for multiple recurrence after sigmoid colon cancer resection. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated severe inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis due to compression by lymph node metastases, i.e. IVC syndrome. As increased doses of diuretic agents failed to improve the edema, IVC stent placement was performed. This led to significant improvement of the edema and complete gait normalization. This case demonstrates the efficacy of IVC stent placement for IVC syndrome.
