Title: Giant cell arteritis in a patient with aortic dissection: a case report.

Abstract: Aortic lesions, such as an aortic aneurysm, are known as a late complication that usually occurs several years after the onset of giant cell arteritis. Here, we report a rare case of large-vessel giant cell arteritis in a patient with aortic dissection. A 71-year-old man presented with acute back pain and was diagnosed with aortic dissection, Stanford type A, and he underwent elective ascending aortic replacement. Further studies showed that the resected ascending aorta had aortic dissection and multinucleated giant cell granulomas; the granulomas were located in the media near the intima with partial destruction of the internal elastic lamina; there was no stenosis of the feeding blood vessel or fibrosis of the adventitia as observed in Takayasu arteritis; other types of vasculitis were considered unlikely based on the symptoms and laboratory data. The patient was further diagnosed with giant cell arteritis, which was classified as a large vessel vasculitis along with Takayasu arteritis at the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference in 2012. This is a rare case of giant cell arteritis diagnosed in a patient with aortic dissection. The differences in histopathological findings between Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis are discussed.
