Title: Pneumopericardium- An Unusual Complication Following Transseptal Puncture: A Series of 3 Cases.

Abstract: Transseptal puncture (TSP) is performed to access the left side of the heart from the venous circulation. Performed under fluoroscopy with echocardiographic guidance, it is a procedure associated with complications. Pneumopericardium leading to cardiac tamponade is rare following TSP. We present 3 cases of pneumopericardium during TSP and its identification, probable mechanism, and management. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
