Title: [Clinical features and CT findings of Takayasu's arteritis associated pulmonary hypertension].

Abstract: Objective: Takayasu's arteritis involving the pulmonary artery (PTA) is uncommon, and those with pulmonary hypertension (PH) are even rarer. This study investigated the clinical features and CT findings in PTA patients with PH. Methods: A total of 40 PTA patients were retrospective selected in the First Hospital of Air Force Medical University from January 2008 to January 2018. There were 14 PTA patients with PH, including 3 male and 11 female cases, aged from 18 to 53 (29.7±9.4) years, as the study group (PTA+PH group). There were 26 PTA patients without PH, including 4 males and 22 females, aged 15-52 (28.9±8.5) years, as the control group (PTA group). The Chi-square or Fisher's test, T test of two independent samples and Mann-Whitney U rank sum test were used to compare the general information, symptoms, signs, laboratory examination data, right ventricular and pulmonary artery measurement data, and pulmonary artery CT findings between the two groups. Results: Compared with the PTA group, the patients in the PTA+PH group had longer disease duration, fewer active cases, more shortness of breath, chest distress and lower limb edema, lower blood oxygen partial pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>) and lower ESR (all P&lt;0.05). The width of right atrium and right ventricle in PTA+PH group was greater than that in PTA group (all P&lt;0.05). The main CT findings of the involved pulmonary artery included lumen stenosis (39 cases, 97.5%), lumen occlusion (16 cases, 40%), wall thickening (9 cases, 22.5%), and lumen dilation (2 cases, 5.0%). Patients in the PTA+PH group had less wall thickening and mild lumen stenosis (&lt;50%), more severe lumen stenosis (≥50%) and occlusion than those in the PTA group (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: PTA patients with PH showed certain characteristics in clinical, laboratory and CT findings, which may be correlated to the stage of the disease duration, the severity, and the prognosis.
