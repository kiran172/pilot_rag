Title: Factors associated with the symptomatic status of carotid artery stenosis: identification in a cross-sectional study and development of a scoring system.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The identification of asymptomatic patients at high risk of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis destabilization and symptom occurrence is crucial for prognosis estimation.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine differences between patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic ICA stenosis and to develop a predictive model for the risk of symptomatic stenosis based on data collected in routine clinical practice.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 163 patients with asymptomatic and 182 patients with symptomatic ICA stenosis greater than 70%. The study groups were compared in terms of stroke risk factors and comorbidities, coexisting ICA stenosis on the contralateral side, atherosclerosis in other arterial territories, and the morphology of atherosclerotic plaque assessed by transcervical ultrasound.
RESULTS: Independent risk factors for symptomatic ICA stenosis included: male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% CI, 1.87-4.32; P <0.001), diabetes (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.62-5.12; P <0.001), body mass index >25 kg/m2 (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.72-1.86; P <0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.34-8.87; P = 0.007), increased‑risk features of ultrasound plaque morphology (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.29-3.72; P = 0.009), and coexisting atherosclerosis in 3 or 4 vascular areas (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.77-7.23; P <0.001).The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring model designed to estimate the risk of symptomatic ICA stenosis reached 77.6% and 76.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This cross‑sectional study indicated that the analysis of selected imaging and clinical parameters may enable clinicians to estimate the risk of symptomatic ICA stenosis. The proposed scoring system requires further prospective validation.
