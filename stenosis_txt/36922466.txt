Title: Hand-Sewn Gastrojejunostomy In Situ to Solve Acute Anastomotic Stricture Due to Submucosal Tunneling in Gastric Bypass.

Abstract: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the second most widely used bariatric surgical procedure for morbid obesity and its related comorbidities. Anastomotic stricture is one of the major complications after RYGB. Submucosal tunneling is a rare cause of anastomotic stricture or occlusion, and clinical symptoms will appear soon after surgery. We present our technical suggestions to perform a hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy in situ when the gastric pouch is too small and the tissue is not enough to be resected to solve acute anastomotic stricture due to submucosal tunneling in gastric bypass.
