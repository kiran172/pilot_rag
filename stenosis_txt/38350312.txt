Title: The impact of ischemic vascular stenosis on LIPU hyperthermia efficacy investigated Based on in vivo rabbit limb ischemia model.

Abstract: Ischemic diseases due to arterial stenosis or occlusion are common and can have serious consequences if untreated. Therapeutic ultrasound like high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablates tissues while low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPU) promotes healing at relatively low temperatures. However, blood vessel cooling effect and reduced flow in ischemia impact temperature distribution and ultrasonic treatment efficacy. This work established a rabbit limb ischemia model by ligating the femoral artery, measuring vascular changes and temperature rise during LIPU exposures. Results showed the artery diameter was narrowed by 46.2% and the downstream velocity was reduced by 51.3% after ligation. Finite element simulations verified that the reduced flow velocity impaired heat dissipation, enhancing LIPU-induced heating. Simulation results also suggested the temperature rise was almost related linearly to vessel diameter but decayed exponentially with the increasing flow velocity. Findings indicate that the proposed model could be used as an effectively tool to model the heating effects in ischemic tissues during LIPU treatment. This research on relating varied ischemic flow to LIPU-induced thermal effects is significant for developing safe and efficacious clinical ultrasound hyperthermia treatment protocols for the patients with ischemic diseases.
