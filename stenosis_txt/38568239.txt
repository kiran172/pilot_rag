Title: Feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a new percutaneous interspinous device: a retrospective multicenter study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of the novel percutaneous interspinous device (PID) for the treatment of symptomatic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) in 3 different centers.
METHODS: From November 2016 to March 2020, 255 patients (male 125, mean age 71.2 years old range 49-91 years old) with neurogenic claudication, confirmed by electromyography, related to mono or bi-segmental lumbar central canal and/or foraminal stenosis were enrolled in the study. Magnetic resonance (MR) and/or computer tomography (CT), physical exam, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) were performed before and 6 months after the procedure. All treatments were performed under fluoroscopic guidance with local anesthesia and mild sedation. Technical success was defined as correct placement of the Lobster® (Demetrios Medical, Firenze, Italy) PID as demonstrated by computer tomography (CT) performed immediately after treatment; spinoplasty was performed in selected patients.
RESULTS: PID placement was accomplished with a 99.6% success rate (257/258). The one device that was not implanted was due to a spinous process fracture. In 28 patients, more than 1 device was implanted in the same session (max 3 PIDs); 6 patients required a second implant in different session. A total of 172 prophylactic spinoplasties were performed (59.3%). No major complications occurred; 3 device misplacements were successfully treated with percutaneous retrieval and new device deployment. 99.6% of patients experienced clinical improvement.
CONCLUSION: Lobster PID is an effective and safe minimally invasive decompression method for central canal and neural foraminal stenosis when patients are correctly selected.
