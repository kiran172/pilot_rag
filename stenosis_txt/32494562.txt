Title: Successful early diagnosis and treatment of non-convulsive status epilepticus-induced Takotsubo syndrome.

Abstract: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is often preceded by emotional or physical stress. Epileptic seizures have been described in more than 100 TTS cases. Due to the lack of typical symptoms, seizure-induced TTS can be overlooked. Here, we describe a rare case where TTS induced by non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) was diagnosed early and successfully treated. An 82-year-old man presented to our hospital with confusion, anorexia, aphagia, and abnormal behavior beginning a few days earlier. Head computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not show any structural abnormalities. Upon hospitalization, blood sampling revealed elevated levels of myocardial escape enzymes; however, cardiac ultrasonography showed apical asystole, and emergency coronary angiography did not show any significant stenosis or occlusion. The patient's symptoms improved after the administration of antiepileptic drugs consisting of diazepam, fosphenytoin, and levetiracetam. On day 2 of hospitalization, an electroencephalogram showed high amplitude slow waves in the left cerebral hemisphere and NCSE-induced TTS was diagnosed. The patient was discharged after 2 weeks with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 and continuing oral administration of levetiracetam. Delay in the diagnosis of NCSE-induced TTS can lead to a poor prognosis. Early diagnosis and treatment for NCSE and NCSE-induced TTS may result in favorable outcomes for the patient.
