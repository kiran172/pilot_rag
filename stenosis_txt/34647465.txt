Title: The JenaValve pericardial transcatheter aortic valve replacement system to treat aortic valve disease.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a valuable alternative technique to surgery and the spectrum of therapy continues to evolve. The JenaValve Pericaridal transcatheter aortic valve replacement System allows prosthesis fixation in a native, noncalcified aortic annulus with a unique paper clip-like anchorage mechanism. The low rate of paravalvular leakage and permanent pacemaker implantation emphasizes the further widespread use of the JenaValve - despite the limited data available. In May 2021, a CE mark for the transfemoral implantation in both aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis was granted. However, no data have been published so far. The ongoing ALIGN trials are expected to provide the pending long-term data.
