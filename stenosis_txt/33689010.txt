Title: Appropriate duration of endoscopic dilation for postoperative benign esophageal strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Benign esophageal strictures are a frequent complication after esophageal surgery or extensive endoscopic submucosal dissection. Endoscopic dilation is the preferred treatment in clinical practice. However, the allocation of time for each dilation is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriate duration of endoscopic dilation for benign esophageal strictures after esophageal surgery or endoscopic submucosal dissection.
METHODS: Patients with benign esophageal strictures after esophageal surgery or endoscopic submucosal dissection between July 2010 and July 2018 were retrospectively included in this study. According to the dilation time (1, 3, 5 min), patients were divided into three groups. The clinical effects and adverse events were compared among the three groups.
RESULTS: Altogether, 57 patients, including 21 in the 1-min group, 18 in the 3-min group and 18 in the 5-min group, were included. All patients underwent endoscopic treatment successfully. The stricture recurrence rate was 76.19% in the 1-min group, 55.56% in the 3-min group and 61.11% in the 5-min group. The median overall dysphagia-free period was 2.60 (range, 0.80-12.00) months in the 1-min group, 6.60 (range, 1.80-12.00) months in the 3-min group and 6.25 (range, 2.40-12.00) months in the 5-min group (P < 0.05). For patients who developed stricture recurrence, the mean dysphagia-free periods were 2.26  ±  1.27 months, 4.00  ±  1.76 months and 4.23  ±  1.63 months, respectively (P < 0.05). The dysphagia-free periods were comparable between the 3- and 5-min groups and were longer than those in the 1-min group. Muscle layer damage occurred in two patients (11.11%) in the 5-min group and in no patients in the other two groups.
CONCLUSION: Three minutes was considered a safe and effective dilation duration for benign esophageal strictures after esophageal surgery or endoscopic submucosal dissection.
