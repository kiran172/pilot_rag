Title: Proximal balloon-guided catheter with flow inversion vs. distal filter protection during the carotid stent placement, a seven years experience in a Colombian reference center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The carotid stent placement as a therapeutic option for carotid stenosis has been increasing among years; therefore, studies are required to evaluate the security and efficacy of its materials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distal filter and the proximal balloon-guided catheter with flow inversion as protection devices during carotid angioplasty and stenting.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study of patients diagnosed with carotid stenosis treated with angioplasty between January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2020; we analyzed a radiology service database to compare the distal filter and the proximal balloon-guided catheter as protection devices during angioplasty.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five angioplasties were performed, the distal filter was the most prevalent embolic protection device used (66%), patients baseline characteristics did not differ between groups with different embolic protection devices, except for history of dyslipidemia (p &lt; 0.000). As well, we did not find any significant differences between the groups in the device related complications, intervention time (p = 0.140), unrelated complications (p = 0.693) and functional independence at 90 days (p = 0.096).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study the proximal balloon-guided catheter and the distal filter protection device as protection devices during the carotid stenting didn't show significant differences regarding complications related to the system.
