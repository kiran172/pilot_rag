Title: [Diagnostics and Treatment of indeterminate Biliary Stenoses].

Abstract: Biliary stenoses represent a differential diagnostic challenge. Diagnostic methods to clarify the underlying dignity are often invasive, and provide high specificity beside insufficient sensitivity. In many cases, an accurate diagnosis is only possible over time, and therefore limits curative treatment options. This article provides an overview of the diagnostic challenges and treatment options for unclear biliary stenosis.
