Title: Histopathological findings in hysterectomy for cervical stenosis in postmenopausal women: A retrospective case series.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the histopathological findings in postmenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy for postsurgical cervical stenosis, evaluating the incidental findings of preinvasive or invasive uterine and cervical disease.
METHODS: Retrospective case series of postmenopausal women who underwent hysterectomy for postsurgical cervical stenosis at Gynecological Oncology Unit of Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Centro di Riferimento Oncologico Aviano-National Cancer Institute from January 2014 to January 2021.
RESULTS: During the study period, 36 women underwent hysterectomy for postsurgical cervical stenosis at our institution. Cervical stenosis occurred 10.2 ± 5.6 years from the onset of menopause. In particular, 26 (72.2%) patients underwent a single loop electrosurgical excision procedure or carbon dioxide (CO2)-laser conization before the onset of stenosis. The remaining 10 (27.8%) women had multiple surgical excision before the onset of stenosis. At the final histopathological analysis, 17 (47.2%) patients had a preinvasive or invasive gynecological disease. In particular, 9 cases of cervical disease (including 1 case of endocervical squamous cell carcinoma pT1a) and 6 cases of endometrial hyperplasia emerged. Also, 2 cases of tubo-ovarian diseases were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Postsurgical cervical stenosis is a challenging clinical condition, especially in women treated for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or microinvasive cervical cancer. As shown, cervical stenosis can prevent an adequate gynecological follow-up and a prompt diagnosis of malignancies. Therefore, postmenopausal women with cervical stenosis should be carefully counseled, and hysterectomy could be a reasonable option, especially in those cases in which a conservative approach is not feasible, failed, or is not accepted by the patient.
