Title: Incidence, Predictive Factors, and Prognostic Impact of Right Ventricular Dysfunction Before Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) is considered to be a late marker of aortic stenosis. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the incidence, prognostic impact, and evolution of RVD in patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). All patients treated with TAVI for severe aortic stenosis were included in a prospective single-center database. Patients who had a quantitative assessment of right ventricular (RV) function including tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and/or Doppler tissue imaging-derived tricuspid lateral annular systolic velocity (S' wave) measurements were eligible for this study. RVD was defined as TAPSE <17 mm or S' <9.5 cm/s if TAPSE was not available. Between 2014 and 2019, 503 patients with RV function assessment were included. The incidence of RVD before TAVI was 18.7%. Predictors of RVD were diabetes (p = 0.03), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001), impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (p <0.0001), left ventricular dilatation (p = 0.007), and previous cardiac surgery (p = 0.002). Long-term survival was worse in patients with RVD before TAVI compared with those without RVD (hazard ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 3.4, p = 0.01). One year after TAVI, 58.7% of patients with baseline RVD had normal RV function and had similar outcomes as compared with those without RVD at baseline. In contrast, patients with persistent RVD had the worst prognosis. In conclusion, RVD is not rare and has a deleterious prognostic impact in patients treated with TAVI. Recovery of normal RV function is frequent after TAVI, whereas persistence of RVD is associated with poor outcomes.
