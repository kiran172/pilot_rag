Title: Transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy in Greece: Clinical insights from the National Referral Center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) vary by region, necessitating the acquisition of country-specific evidence for proper management.
METHODS: This is an observational study including sequential patients presenting in the Amyloidosis Reference Center of Greece, from 01/2014 to 12/2022. ATTR-CM was diagnosed by positive scintigraphy and exclusion of light-chain amyloidosis or positive biopsy typing. Genetic testing was performed in all cases.
RESULTS: In total, 109 ATTR-CM patients were included (median age, 81 years) of which 15 carried TTR mutations (27% Val30Met). Most patients (82%) presented with heart failure and 59% with atrial fibrillation, while 10% had aortic stenosis. Importantly, 78 (71.6%) had clinically significant extracardiac manifestations (45% musculoskeletal disorder, 40% peripheral neuropathy, and 33% gastrointestinal symptoms). Sixty-five (60%) received disease-specific treatment with tafamidis. Estimated median survival was 48 months; advanced NYHA class, National Amyloidosis Center stage, eGFR&lt;45 ml/kg/1.73 m2, NT-pro-BNP&gt;5000 pg/mL were associated with worse survival, while tafamidis treatment was associated with improved survival in patients with IVS≥ 12 mm.
DISCUSSION: These are the first data describing the characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with ATTR-CM in Greece, which could influence local guidelines.
