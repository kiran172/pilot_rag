Title: The effect of treatment strategy on long-term follow-up results in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in Turkey: AFTER-2 subgroup analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We performed a subanalysis of the data from the AFTER-2 registry. In our study, we aimed to compare the long-term follow-up results of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients in Turkey according to their treatment strategies.
METHODS: All consecutive patients older than 18 years of age who presented to cardiology outpatient clinics, had at least one AF attack and did not have rheumatic mitral valve stenosis or prosthetic heart valve disease were included in our prospective study. The patients were divided into two groups as rhythm control and rate control. Stroke, hospitalization and death rates were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: A total of 2592 patients from 35 centers were included in the study. Of these patients, 628 (24.2%) were in the rhythm control group and 1964 (75.8%) in the rate control group. New-onset ischemic cerebrovascular disease or transient ischemic attack (CVD/TIA) was detected at a lower rate in the rhythm control group (3.2% vs. 6.2% p = 0.004). However, there was no significant difference in one-year and five-year mortality rates (9.6% versus 9.0%, p = 0.682 and 31.8% versus 28.6%, p = 0.116, respectively). Hospitalization were found to be significantly higher in patients with rhythm control group (18% vs. 13%, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: It was found that rhythm control strategy is preferred in AF patients in Turkey. We found a lower rate of ischemic CVD/TIA in patients in the rhythm control group. Although no difference was observed in mortality rates, we found a higher rate of hospitalization in the rhythm control group.
