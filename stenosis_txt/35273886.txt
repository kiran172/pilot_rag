Title: Chronic Steroid Use Causing Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis.

Abstract: Chronic steroid use causes aberrant fat deposition in the epidural space, which may in rare cases result in spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL). We discuss the case of a 79-year-old female who had been on steroids for a long time, initially for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), then for adrenal insufficiency. Her dose was raised with a few steroid stress doses to control the flare of adrenal insufficiency. The patient presented with complaints of intractable lumbosacral pain and was subsequently diagnosed with SEL and foraminal and spinal canal stenosis based on magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine. She successfully underwent laminectomy.
