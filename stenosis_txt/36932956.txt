Title: SUPERA stent placement for salvaging early recurrent arteriovenous graft thrombosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: A single-center study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the patency of the helical interwoven SUPERA stent for salvaging prosthetic arteriovenous (AV) grafts with rapidly recurrent thrombotic occlusion developed within a short time period after successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
METHODS: From December 2019 to September 2021, the data of 20 patients with AV graft who had the SUPERA stent inserted satisfying the following conditions were consecutively collected. (1) More than 1 year has passed since the AV access operation; (2) Thrombotic re-occlusion of AV graft occurred within 3 months after previous successful endovascular treatment; (3) Residual stenosis is greater than 30% after full effacement of balloon angioplasty in the primary lesion. Post-interventional target lesion primary patency (TLPP), access circuit primary patency (ACPP), and secondary patency (SP) were calculated.
RESULTS: Primary lesions of early recurrent arteriovenous graft thrombosis were found in 13 patients with graft-vein anastomosis, six patients with intra-graft stenosis, and one patient with outflow vein complications. The lesions showed residual stenosis in 47.4% (interquartile range: 44.1%-55.3%) of patients despite full-effacement balloon angioplasty. Clinical success was achieved in all patients with full-expansion of the stents at the 1-month follow-up. The TLPP was 70.7% and 32% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, and ACPP was 47.5% and 6.8% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The SP was 76.1% and 57.1% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. No cannulation complications occurred in the six patients with installation inside the graft. No hemodialysis or stent fracture occurred in any patient during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: The SUPERA stent may have a role in salvaging AV grafts with early recurrent thrombosis due to its greater radial force and its conformability and can be useful in treating stenosis involving the elbow or axilla, with fair patency and low complication rates.
