Title: Technical Considerations in Endoscopic Lumbar Decompression.

Abstract: With technical development and evolution of endoscopic instruments, endoscopic spinal surgery has become one of the standard treatments for various lumbar spinal diseases ranging from a simple contained disc to complicated cases such as highly migrated disc herniation and other pathology combined with bony degeneration to produce foraminal and canal stenosis. Favorable clinical results of endoscopic decompression for lumbar stenotic disease were reported by several authors. However, studies have also reported limitations, such as steep learning curves and a relatively high complication rate compared with conventional techniques. The endoscopic lumbar decompression technique consists of many essential skills to manage different endoscopic anatomic structures of the spine. From the perspective of surgical completion and safety, this article discusses issues related to technical considerations in endoscopic lumbar decompression.
