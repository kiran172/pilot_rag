Title: BALLOON AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY WITH VALVER BALLOON CATHETER IN ADULTS WITH SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS AS A BRIDGE OR PALLIATIVE TREATMENT.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim: We aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of performing balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) with Valver balloon catheter (Balton, Poland) in adults with severe aortic stenosis as a bridge or palliative treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: We identified consecutive patients who underwent BAV procedures between May 2019 and March 2020 using Valver balloon catheters. Demographic data, medical history, and clinical characteristics were retrospectively collected in all study patients together with periprocedural data as well as 12-month follow-up data.
RESULTS: Results: We included 18 patients. The mean population age was 78.1±8.9 years, and women were 61.1%. The most common co-morbidities were arterial hypertension (88.9%), dyslipidemia (83.3%), and coronary artery disease (72.2%). The baseline mean aortic valve pressure gradient was 49.94±27.02 mmHg and the mean aortic valve area (AVA) was 0.65±0.20 cm2. In all cases, the procedure was performed from the femoral access via the 8F sheath. Two Valver balloon catheter sizes were used 18x40mm (33.3%) and 20x40mm (66.7%). Three periprocedural complications were observed, and none was associated with the Valver balloon catheter per se. The transthoracic echocardiography after the procedure revealed a decrease in the mean pressure gradient of 11.1±8.85 mmHg, and an increase in AVA of 0.21±0.19 cm2. At 12-month follow-up, the mortality rate was 38.9%.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: BAV is a procedure increasingly performed in catheterization laboratories worldwide. This paper confirmed the relative safety of BAV with Valver balloon catheters in the modern era, showing a low incidence of valve and vascular complications.
