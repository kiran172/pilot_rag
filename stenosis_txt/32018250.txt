Title: Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis: Long-Term Follow-Up of Adult Patients with Nonsevere Initial Disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is no consensus regarding the natural history of rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) among adults presenting with nonsevere disease. This study aims to describe the progression of stenosis among adult rheumatic MS patients, to identify predictive factors for progression, and to assess the incidence of complications.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed among patients with rheumatic MS treated at a single center. Eighty-five patients were included with mild to moderate MS, ≥30 years old on initial echocardiography. Demographics, medical history, echocardiographic reports over at least 10 years, and related complications were obtained from a computerized database.
RESULTS: Over a period of 13.1 ± 2.38 years, 75 patients (88%) had no significant progression in stenosis severity. The final echocardiographic assessment demonstrated 2 groups with a significant difference between them regarding the mitral valve area (1.58 ± 0.44 vs. 1.1 ± 0.26 cm2, p = 0.001) and mean valvular pressure gradient (6.27 ± 2.52 vs. 8.5 ± 2.69 mm Hg, p = 0.01). Patients with indolent MS (group A) were compared to patients with progressive disease (group B), and a higher percent of Bedouin patients were found in group B (OR 8.036, p = 0.015). No significant differences were found in other parameters. Complications including atrial fibrillation, cerebral ischemic events, and impaired right ventricle function, although frequent, were not statistically different between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: An indolent natural progression of rheumatic MS was observed in our study. Despite this finding, it still has potentially deleterious effects. Bedouin patients have a higher risk for progressive disease.
