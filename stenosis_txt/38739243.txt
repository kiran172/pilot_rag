Title: Contemporary Therapy of Femoropopliteal In-Stent Restenosis / Occlusion, 36-month Follow up Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting devices improved outcomes of endovascular therapy (EVT) for femoropopliteal lesions, but mainly for de novo lesions. Endovascular therapy for in-stent restenosis/occlusion (ISR/O) is challenging, and large trials and long-term data are not well reported.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a physician initiated, multicenter, and retrospective design. From 7 Japanese institutes, 3635 femoropopliteal cases were enrolled in the study. Among these, 346 cases of first ISR/O were studied. We defined drug-coated-balloon, drug-eluting stent, and covered stent as New devices. Balloon angioplasty and bare nitinol stent were included in the control group.
RESULTS: The propensity score matching extracted 112 pairs. At 12 months, the primary patency rate was 80.3% in the new device group and 52.7% in the control group, and there was a significant intergroup difference (P = .004). However, at 36 months, the rate was 43.3% vs 39.2%, with no significant difference (P = .090). No baseline characteristics had any significant interaction effect (all P &gt; .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The New devices were more effective than the control group for ISR/O at 1 year, but caught up at 3 years.
