Title: Role of Interventional Radiology in the Management of Early Vascular Complications After Liver Transplant.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: A hepatic vascular complication after liver transplant is a critical situation, often resulting in graft failure and potentially leading to patient death. Early diagnosis and treatment of vascular complications can provide prolonged graft survival and prohibit further complications. This study presents our experiences with endovascular treatment during the first week after liver transplant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2012 and February 2021, 240 liver transplants were performed, with 43 patients having early endovascular treatment (37 men; mean age 27 ± 2.9 years) at a single center. Early endovascular interventions were carried out 1 to 7 days (mean ± SD of 2.7 ± 0.24 days) after transplant. Patients with vascular complications were grouped by arterial, venous, and portal complications. In addition, arterial complications were subgrouped by occlusive (hepatic artery thrombosis) and nonocclusive (hepatic artery stenosis/splenic artery steal syndrome) complications. Patients had median follow-up of 47 ± 4 months.
RESULTS: In the first week after liver transplant, vascular complications included splenic artery steal syndrome in 27 patients (62.7%), hepatic complications in 10 patients (23.2%) (7 with hepatic artery thrombosis, 3 with hepatic artery stenosis), hepatic venous outflow complications in 4 patients (9.3%), and portal vein complications in 2 patients (4.6%). Only 1 patient required revision surgery because of excessive arterial kinking; the remaining patients with arterial complications were successfully managed with multiple endovascular treatment attempts. Patients with splenic artery steal syndrome were treated by selective arterial embolization with coil devices. Resistivity index, peak systolic velocity of hepatic arteries, and portal vein maximal velocity significantly improved (P < .001). Patients with hepatic venous outflow and portal vein complications who had endovascular treatments and vascular structures maintained good results over follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Early endovascular intervention is feasible and safe for hepatic vascular complications following liver transplant, with high success treatment rates with advances in interventional radiology.
