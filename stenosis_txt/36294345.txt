Title: Quantitative Flow Ratio Is Related to Anatomic Left Main Stem Lesion Parameters as Assessed by Intravascular Imaging.

Abstract: Introduction: Previously, an association between anatomic left main stem (LMS) lesion parameters, as described by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and fractional flow reserve (FFR), was shown. Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a novel, promising technique which can assess functional stenosis relevance based only on angiography. However, as little is known about the relationship between anatomic LMS parameters and QFR, it was thus investigated in this study. Methods: In 53 patients with LMS disease, we tested the association between anatomic assessment using OCT (n = 28) or IVUS (n = 25) on the one hand and functional assessment as determined by QFR on the other hand. LMS-QFR was measured using a dedicated approach, averaging QFR over left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (LCX) and manually limiting segment of interest to LMS. Results: The minimal luminal area of the LMS (LMS-MLA) as measured by intravascular imaging showed a consistent correlation with QFR (R = 0.61, p < 0.001). QFR could predict a LMS-MLA < 6 mm2 with very good diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.919) and a LMS-MLA < 4.5 mm2 with good accuracy (AUC 0.798). Similar results were obtained for other stenosis parameters. Conclusions: QFR might be a valuable tool to assess LMS disease. Further studies focusing on patient outcomes are needed to further validate the effectiveness of this approach.
