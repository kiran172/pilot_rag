Title: Impact of osteoporotic risk in men undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a report from the LAPLACE-TAVI registry.

Abstract: Low body weight and advanced age are among the best predictors of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST) values are calculated by a simple formula [(body weight in kilograms - age in years) × 0.2] to identify patients at increased risk of osteoporosis. In our recent single-center study, we demonstrated an association between OST and poor outcomes in postmenopausal women after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We aimed to investigate the impact of osteoporotic risk in men with aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR in a large cohort. In this multi-center study, 1,339 men who underwent TAVR between April 2010 and July 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Women were excluded from the present study. All patients were deemed appropriate for TAVR after a review by a multidisciplinary team. Baseline characteristics of patients were compared by dividing patients into three tertiles, based on the OST value: ≤ - 6.16, - 6.16 to - 4.14, and - 4.14 < for tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality after TAVR. Tertile 1 (patients with the lowest OST values) included older patients with smaller body mass index, lower hemoglobin and albumin levels. In addition, they had greater clinical frailty scale, slower 5-meter walk test, weaker hand grip strength, and more cognitive impairment, indicating increased frailty. They were more severely symptomatic, with lower ejection fractions, smaller aortic valve areas, and more tricuspid regurgitation than were patients in the other two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that OST tertiles 3 was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.90), compared with OST tertile 1 as a reference. For OST tertiles 1, 2, and 3, the estimated 1-year survival rates of all-cause mortality post-TAVR were 83.6% ± 1.9%, 91.1% ± 1.4%, and 93.1% ± 1.3%, respectively, (log-rank, p < 0.001).　In conclusions, in men as same as women, osteoporotic risk assessed by OST values was overlapped with increased frailty. The simple OST formula was useful for predicting all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVR in large registry datasets.
