Title: Thoracic endovascular repair for blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury: Long-term results.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the endoprosthesis complications in patients undergoing TEVAR for blunt traumatic thoracic aortic injury, through long-term clinical and diagnostic follow-up.
METHODS: During the study interval (November 2000-October 2020), a total of 38 patients (63% male; average age 37.5 years) with thoracic aortic injury underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Patients underwent routine follow-up with clinical examination and radiological evaluation (CT-angiography or MRI-angiography plus chest radiograph), scheduled at 1 month, at 6 months (only in the cases of thoracic aortic dissection), at 1 year after the procedure and every 1 year thereafter.
RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 38 procedures (100%). The TEVAR-related mortality rate was 0%. No immediate major complications related to the endovascular procedure were observed. The median duration of diagnostic follow-up was 80 months. A total of four procedure-related complications (10.5%) were identified at the follow-up. Three (7.9%) distal infoldings and collapses of the thoracic endoprosthesis and one (2.6%) type Ia endoleak were observed. No thrombosis of the prosthesis, nor signs of aortic pseudocoarctation were identified. No further complications related to endograft (endoleaks, infections, rupture, partial or complete thrombosis) occurred. No changes in the native aorta, stenosis, or increases in the endograft's diameters were observed. A total of 20 patients (52.6%) underwent MRI-angiography examinations, while a total of 34 patients (89.5%) underwent chest radiographs at the follow-up. In all cases, CT-angiography examinations were performed at the follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Procedure-related complications were observed within one year of TEVAR, limiting concerns related to the durability of the prosthesis. No morphological changes in the aorta were observed despite long-term follow-up. The consequences of lifelong surveillance in terms of radiation exposure deserve special consideration, especially in younger patients treated for TAI.
