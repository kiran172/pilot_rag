Title: Evolution and Prognostic Impact of Right Ventricular-Pulmonary Artery Coupling After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence regarding the association between right ventricular-to-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling and outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the evolution of RV-PA coupling in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR and its prognostic impact.
METHODS: A total of 900 patients who underwent TAVR in 2 tertiary centers and with echocardiographic analysis performed within 3 months before and after the procedure were included. RV-PA coupling was measured as the ratio of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). RV-PA uncoupling was defined by TAPSE/PASP <0.55, whereas a TAPSE/PASP <0.32 identified a severe uncoupling. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 520 patients (58%) showed RV-PA uncoupling before TAVR, whereas post-TAVR RV-PA uncoupling was observed in 407 patients (45%). During a median follow-up of 40 months, 250 deaths (28%) occurred. Post-TAVR RV-PA uncoupling was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality (adjusted HR: 1.474; 95% CI: 1.115-1.948; P = 0.006), whereas pre-TAVR uncoupling did not. Among patients with post-TAVR RV-PA uncoupling, the presence of severe uncoupling identified a subgroup with the worst survival (P = 0.008). Patients with RV-PA coupling recovery after TAVR showed similar outcomes as compared with patients with normal coupling. Conversely, the presence of either persistent or new-onset RV-PA uncoupling following TAVR was associated with an increased mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-TAVR RV-PA uncoupling is an independent predictor of long-term mortality, irrespective of coupling before intervention. Assessment of TAPSE/PASP response after TAVR may be helpful to improve risk stratification.
