Title: Comparison of ultrasonic shear wave elastography, AngioPLUS planewave ultrasensitive imaging, and optimized high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating carotid plaque stability.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficiency of evaluating carotid plaque stability using ultrasonic shear wave elastography (SWE), AngioPLUS planewave ultrasensitive imaging (AP), and optimized high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: A total of 100 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy at our hospital from October 2019 to August 2022 were enrolled. Based on the final clinical diagnosis, these patients were divided into vulnerable (n = 62) and stable (n = 38) plaque groups. All patients were examined using ultrasound SWE, AP, and optimized high-resolution MRI before surgery. The clinical data and ultrasound characteristics of patients of the two groups were compared. Considering the final clinical diagnosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of SWE, AP, high-resolution MRI, and the final clinical diagnosis of vulnerable plaque were calculated. Pearson's correlation test was used to analyze the correlations of AP, SWE, and MRI results with the grading results of carotid artery stenosis.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were noticed in terms of the history of smoking and coronary heart disease, plaque thickness, surface rules, calcified nodules, low echo area, and the degree of carotid artery stenosis between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). Considering the final clinical diagnosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of SWE-based detection of carotid artery vulnerability were 87.10% (54/62), 76.32% (29/38), 85.71% (54/63) and 78.38% (29/37), respectively, showing a general consistency with the final clinical results (Kappa = 0.637, P &lt; 0.05). Considering the final clinical diagnosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of AP-based detection of carotid artery vulnerability were 93.55% (58/62), 84.21% (32/38), 90.63% (58/64), and 88.89% (32/36), respectively, which agreed with the final clinical detection results (Kappa = 0.786, P &lt; 0.05). Considering the final clinical diagnosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of high-resolution MRI-based detection of carotid artery vulnerability were 88.71% (55/62), 78.95% (30/38), 87.30% (55/63), and 81.08% (30/37), respectively, showing consistency with the final clinical results (Kappa = 0.680, P &lt; 0.05). AP, SWE, and MRI results were positively correlated with the results of carotid artery stenosis grading (P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: AP technology is a non-invasive, inexpensive, and highly sensitive method to evaluate the stability of carotid artery plaques. This method can dynamically display the flow of blood in new vessels of plaque in real time and provide a reference for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
