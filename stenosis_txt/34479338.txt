Title: [Long-term survival of patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective and safe option for low, medium and high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (SAS).
AIM: To analyze the clinical results and long-term survival of TAVI in our center.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective analysis of 53 patients aged 73 ± 10 years with a Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score of 7.3 ± 3.9%.
RESULTS: In 96% a transfemoral access was used and, in most patients, ProGlides™ as vascular closure device was used. General anesthesia and conscious sedation were used in 79 and 21% of cases, respectively. Fifty-three valves were implanted, 42 self-expandable (SEV) and 11 balloon-expandable (Edwards Sapiens). The implant was successful in 49 patients (92,4%). The transaortic gradient after TAVI was almost zero mmHg in all patients and one had a severe aortic regurgitation. Permanent pacemakers were needed in 17% of patients. Two patients had a pericardial effusion, and one had a major vascular complication. No strokes were recorded, and 30-day mortality was 3.7%. At long-term follow up (23.4 ± 21.6 months) the global survival was 85% and the rate of cardiovascular mortality was 5.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: In this series of intermediate to high-risk patients, TAVI was associated with an excellent early and long-term survival.
