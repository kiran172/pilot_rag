Title: [A Case of Laparoscopic Surgery for Sigmoid Colon Cancer after Cystectomy and Ileal Conduit Construction].

Abstract: We report a case of laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection for sigmoid colon cancer after cystectomy for bladder cancer and ileal conduit surgery for urinary tract reconstruction. The patient was a male in his 70s. The patient presented to the Department of Gastroenterology with the complaint of nausea and loss of appetite, and findings that were suspicious of intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis was obstructive sigmoid colon cancer. The patient had a history of bladder cancer and had undergone cystectomy and ileal conduit surgery. Intraoperatively, we considered placing a ureteral stent to identify the left ureter through the dorsal mesentery of the sigmoid colon, but we decided that stent placement would be difficult because of a history of conduit stenosis during a previous close examination of a patient with pyelonephritis. On the 21st day, a laparoscopic- assisted sigmoid colon resection was performed. The surgery was completed without any problems such as intraoperative ureteral injury. The patient was discharged home on the 23rd postoperative day. Ten months after the surgery, the patient is alive without recurrence.
