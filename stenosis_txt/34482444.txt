Title: Possibilities of coblation in otorhinolaryngology: analytical review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Review literature data on the coblation method in otorhinolaryngology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All materials from our study are published in peer-reviewed journals. The review is PubMed generated. In our clinic, 20 patients with bilateral paralytic laryngeal stenosis underwent cold-plasma posterior arytenoidcordotomy with Coblator II.
RESULTS: The analysis of the high-energy techniques currently applied in otorhinolaryngology shows the benefits of coblation due to the effect of lower temperatures on tissues. Patients subjectively reported improved breathing on day 10 with a closed coblation tracheostoma; after 3-6 months everyone underwent successful decannulation with plastic surgery of the cutaneous-tracheal fistula. Lately, the operated vocal fold was in the abduction position and the lumen of the glottis in the posterior third was 7-8 mm. Compensation of vocal function in the long-term postoperative period was achieved by patients due to long-term orthophonic training and the development of a vestibuloscapular phonation mechanism.
CONCLUSION: The advantages of coblation are mainly minimal trauma to the surrounding tissues, convenient resection, the ability to perform complete hemostasis at one time, and easier postoperative period for the patient.
