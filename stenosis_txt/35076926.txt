Title: [Prenatal ultrasonographic manifestations and genetic analysis of eight fetuses with 16p11.2 microdeletions].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the intrauterine phenotype and genotype of eight fetuses carrying a 16p11.2 microdeletion.
METHODS: 5100 fetuses undergoing routine prenatal diagnosis were subjected to single nucleotide polymorphism-based microarray (SNP-array) analysis. Fetuses harboring a 16p11.2 microdeletion were analyzed for their ultrasonographic characteristics.
RESULTS: Eight fetuses were found to harbor a microdeletion in the 16p11.2 region. Among these, six had a typical 500-600 kb deletion, while the remaining two had an atypical 220 kb deletion at the distal part of 16p11.2. Four fetuses showed vertebral malformations, two had mild left ventriculomegaly, one had hydrocephalus, and one had pulmonary valve stenosis with regurgitation. The parents of five fetuses have accepted pedigree verification, and the results confirmed that the 16p11.2 microdeletions carried by fetuses all had a de novo origin.
CONCLUSION: The intrauterine phenotypes of fetuses carrying a 16p11.2 microdeletion may be variable, and the deletion can be effectively detected with the SNP-array assay.
