Title: The efficacy of modified jailed balloon technique for true bifurcation lesions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the short-, long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes after treatment of true bifurcation lesions using a modified jailed balloon technique (MJBT).
BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for true bifurcation lesions has high risk for adverse events. Side branch (SB) occlusion is one of the most serious complications. Therefore, novel strategies to avoid SB occlusion during main branch stenting and to keep its patency are important.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between February 2015 and February 2018, 328 patients with 349 true bifurcation lesions underwent PCI using MJBT. True bifurcation lesions were defined as Medina classifications (1.1.1), (1.0.1) or (0.1.1) lesions. We investigated the procedural and long-term clinical outcomes. Furthermore, angiographic outcomes were assessed at follow-up diagnostic angiography. The mean age of patients was 71.6 ± 9.9 years. Procedural success was achieved in all patients; postoperative SB occlusion was noted in only one patient (0.3%). The cumulative incidence of all-cause death was 23 patients (7.0%) in the follow-up period (median 717 days). Target lesion revascularization was performed in 19 patients (5.8%) with 23 lesions (6.6%), and 0.6% of myocardial infarction and 0% of definite stent thrombosis were observed. Angiographic follow-up was performed in 243 patients (74.1%); the percent diameter stenosis in SB was not significantly different between after the index procedure and follow-up angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: This MJBT is safe and effective in preserving SB patency for true bifurcation lesions. Furthermore, long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes after MJBT are feasible.
