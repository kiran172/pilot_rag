Title: Urethroplasty Methods for Stricture Repair After Gender Affirming Phalloplasty: High Failure Rates in a Hostile Surgical Field.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with 71 postphalloplasty urethral strictures in order to discuss the performance characteristics of different urethroplasty techniques in urethral stricture after phalloplasty.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 85 urethroplasties performed for stricture repair in 71 patients with phalloplasty for gender affirmation between August 2017 and May 2020. Stricture location, urethroplasty type, complication rate, and recurrence rate were recorded.
RESULTS: The most common stricture type was distal anastomotic (40/71, 56%). The most common initial repair type was excision and primary anastomosis (EPA) (33/85, 39%), followed by first-stage Johanson urethroplasty (32/85, 38%). The stricture recurrence rate after initial repair of all types was 52% (44/85). The recurrence rate of stricture after EPA was 58% (19/33). The recurrence rate after staged urethroplasty was 25% (2/8) for patients who successfully completed a first and second stage. 30% (3/10) of patients who completed a first stage and opted out of a second stage required a revision to achieve successful lifetime voiding from the surgical urethrostomy.
CONCLUSION: EPA after phalloplasty has a high failure rate. Nontransecting anastomotic urethroplasty has slightly lower failure rate, and staged Johanson-type surgeries have the highest success rates after phalloplasty.
