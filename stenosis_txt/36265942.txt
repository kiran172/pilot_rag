Title: Low-Dose vs High-Dose Paclitaxel-Coated Balloons for Femoropopliteal Lesions: 2-Year Results From the COMPARE Trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: So far only 1-year data have been reported for direct comparisons of paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCBs) using different coating technologies.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to report the 24-month results on the efficacy and safety of low-dose vs high-dose PCBs with nominal paclitaxel densities of 2.0 and 3.5 μg/mm2 and different coating technologies for femoropopliteal interventions from the COMPARE (Compare I Pilot Study for the Treatment of Subjects With Symptomatic Femoropopliteal Artery Disease) trial. Procedural characteristics of clinically driven (CD) target lesion revascularization (TLR) were analyzed.
METHODS: Within a prospective, multicenter, clinical trial, 414 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal lesions (Rutherford categories 2-4, maximum lesion length 30 cm) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to endovascular treatment with either a low-dose (Ranger) or a high-dose (IN.PACT) PCB after stratification for lesion length. Two-year follow-up included assessment of primary patency (defined as absence of CD TLR or binary restenosis with a peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4 by duplex ultrasound), safety, and functional and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: At 2 years, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary patency were 70.6% and 71.4% for the low-dose and high-dose PCBs (log-rank P = 0.96), respectively. One major amputation occurred in the high-dose group, and rates of all-cause mortality (3.6% vs 2.2%; P = 0.55) and CD TLR (17.3% vs 13.0%; P = 0.31) were similar between the groups. Among a total of 57 CD TLRs, 44.6% were performed for reocclusion and 28.1% for in-stent restenosis. Functional and clinical benefits over baseline were sustained in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2-year results of the COMPARE trial demonstrate a sustained treatment benefit of both low-dose and high-dose PCBs for femoropopliteal interventions including a wide range of lesion lengths.
