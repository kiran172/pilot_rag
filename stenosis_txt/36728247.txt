Title: Human Leukocyte Antigen Genotyping of Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Despite recent scientific inquiry, idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) remains an enigmatic disease. The consistent demographics of the affected population suggest genetic factors may contribute to disease susceptibility. Given the inflammation observed in the affected proximal airway mucosa, we interrogated disease association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms. Polymorphisms in the HLA locus have previously been shown to influence individuals' susceptibility to distinct inflammatory diseases.
METHODS: High-resolution HLA typing of 37 iSGS patients was compared with 1,242,890 healthy Caucasian controls of European ancestry from the USA National Marrow Donor Program and 281 patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).
RESULTS: Complete HLA genotyping of an iSGS population showed no significant associations when compared to a North American Caucasian control population. Unlike GPA patients, iSGS was not associated with allele DPB1*04:01 nor did allele homozygosity correlate with disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: There was not a detectable HLA association observed in iSGS. These results support the concept that iSGS possesses a distinct genetic architecture from GPA. If genetic susceptibility exists in iSGS, it likely lies outside the HLA locus.
