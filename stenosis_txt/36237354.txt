Title: [CT Imaging Findings in Non-Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease].

Abstract: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is mainly caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD); however, it can also occur in patients with non-atherosclerotic CAD. Conventional coronary angiography only shows the lumen of arteries, indicating the presence of stenosis or dilatation. Thus, it has limited value in evaluating the coronary artery wall and offers low specificity for diagnosing CAD. Coronary CT angiography provides additional information, including the depiction of the concerned vessel and the aorta, as well as the pulmonary artery, which permits the diagnosis of non-atherosclerotic CAD and the differentiation of various causes of the disease. In this review, we present the pathophysiology and CT imaging features of non-atherosclerotic CAD.
