Title: Non-invasive Angiographic-based Fractional Flow Reserve: Technical Development, Clinical Implications, and Future Perspectives.

Abstract: New non- and less-invasive techniques have been developed to overcome the procedural and operator related burden of the fractional flow reserve (FFR) for the assessment of potentially significant stenosis in the coronary arteries. Virtual FFR-techniques can obviate the need for the additional flow or pressure wires as used for FFR measurements. This review provides an overview of the developments and validation of the virtual FFR-algorithms, states the challenges, discusses the upcoming clinical trials, and postulates the future role of virtual FFR in the clinical practice.
