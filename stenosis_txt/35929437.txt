Title: Prenatal aortic valvuloplasty as a definite treatment in fetuses with critical aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation and giant left atrium: a report of two cases with medium-term follow-up.

Abstract: Fetuses with critical aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement are at risk to develop heart failure and intrauterine death. We present two cases with this physiology who underwent fetal aortic balloon valvuloplasty at 25 + 5 and 28 + 2 weeks as their only intervention without requiring postnatal treatment during short- to medium-term follow-up of 1.4 and 4.9 years.
