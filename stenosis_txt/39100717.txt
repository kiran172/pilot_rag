Title: Lost in transition? Loss of follow-up and quality of life in adults after resection of choledochal malformation in childhood.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Choledochal malformation (CM) is a rare disease that can lead to malignancy and potential long-term sequelae despite surgical resection. There is no long-term follow-up data on patients after CM resection in Germany. We aimed to determine the long-term outcome of our patients with a duration of follow-up >10 years and focused on long-term sequelae and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
METHODS: All patients who had undergone CM-resection in our department from 01/1978 to 06/2009 were contacted. Patients were interviewed about postoperative complications and their present medical attendance. HRQOL was determined using Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL), version for adults. The PedsQL scales the HRQOL from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better HRQOL. Scores were compared to those published for a healthy population.
RESULTS: Out of 56 patients who were contacted, 23 (41 %) participated. The median age at time of surgery was 3.1 years (6 days-16.1 years) and at time of the survey 24.3 years (11.1-53.8 years). Eighteen patients (78 %) had ceased their gastroenterologic follow-up at a median time of 4.3 years after surgery. Five (22 %) were still in gastroenterologic follow-up, two of these had an uneventful clinical course, and three (13 %) had ongoing complications attributed to the CM. One of these had undergone hemihepatectomy 34 years postoperatively due to bile duct stenosis, one had undergone removal of bile duct stones 14 years postoperatively, and one suffered from portal vein thrombosis with esophageal and jejunal varices. There was no mortality in our series. Median total HRQOL score was 89. There was no significant difference in the median total health, physical health, and psychosocial health scores of our patients in comparison to the healthy population.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that the majority of patients after CM resection are lost to follow-up. Those who answered our questionnaire showed a good HRQOL. Given the high rate of severe long-term complications and the life-long risk of malignancy, we recommend a transition program for all patients.
