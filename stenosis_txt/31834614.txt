Title: "Hidden" takotsubo cardiomyopathy in cardiac care unit.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is characterized as a transient segmental cardiac dysfunction mimicking acute coronary syndrome triggered by emotional or physical stress. Although neurological disorders, infection, malignant diseases, trauma and surgery are known triggers for the development of TC, role of cardiac diseases as underlying conditions for the development of TC is uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate incidence and clinical characteristics of TC among critically ill cardiac disease patients and to verify that TC may coexist with other cardiac diseases.
METHODS: Between November, 2015 and September, 2017, 862 echocardiographic examinations were recorded from 413 patients who were admitted to the CCU. All echo images, electrocardiograms as well as medical records were reviewed. TC was diagnosed according to the modified Mayo criteria.
RESULTS: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 29 of 413 patients (7%). TC was a primary diagnosis in 18 patients (group P) and the other 11 patients (group S) were not diagnosed as TC during the CCU stay. Primary diagnosis of these patients was acute myocardial infarction (n = 5), acute decompensated heart failure (two aortic stenosis, one cardiac amyloidosis, and two tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy), and ventricular tachycardia (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may develop in critically ill cardiac diseases but are often underdiagnosed. Careful echocardiographic examination is needed to unveil these "hidden" TC.
