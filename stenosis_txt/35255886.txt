Title: Efficacy and safety of a modified lateral lumbar interbody fusion in L4-5 lumbar degenerative diseases compared with traditional XLIF and OLIF: a retrospective cohort study of 156 cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The authors designed a modified lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) procedure named as XOLIF and compared the efficacy and safety with traditional LLIF procedures.
METHODS: Patients were divided into XLIF, OLIF, and XOLIF group according to the surgical approach. Cases of psoas major and vascular space stenosis, psoas major muscle elevation, psoas major muscle hypertrophy, and high iliac crest were recorded. Basic information, composition ratio of specific cases, Visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), interbody fusion rate and complications were compared between the 3 groups.
RESULTS: The study included 156 cases of L4-5 LLIF. There was no statistical difference in age, gender, BMI among the three groups. Cases with stenosis between psoas muscle and artery accounted for 11.8 and 18.4% of the XLIF and XOLIF group, respectively, while no case of this type had undergone OLIF surgery, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The proportions of high iliac crest cases in the OLIF and XOLIF group were 12.5 and 18.4%, respectively, while the XLIF group with vertical approach is not suitable for cases with high iliac crest. The postoperative VAS and ODI of the three groups were significantly improved compared with those before operation. There were 51 cases (32.7%) of complications including 21cases in XLIF group, 20 cases in OLIF Group and 10 cases in XOLIF group. XOLIF group has more advantages in reducing lumbar plexus injury and the risk of vascular injury.
CONCLUSIONS: XOLIF showed good clinical efficacy and technical advantages with a low incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications, especially in the specific cases.
