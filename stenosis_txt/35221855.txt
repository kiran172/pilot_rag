Title: Internal Carotid Artery Dissection Treated with C-Guard Stent.

Abstract: Internal carotid dissection is the most common cause of stroke in the young population. Stroke, the presence of a pseudoaneurysm, and decreased artery lumen with cerebral flow impairment are indications for treatment. Medical therapy with antithrombotic drugs and endovascular therapy with stenting are the main available options. The C-Guard stent is an open cell mesh-covered dual layer stent that has been mainly used in cases of internal carotid artery stenosis with a post-operative reduction in stroke incidence. Thus, we present two cases of internal carotid artery dissections of the cervical segment treated with the open cell dual-layer C-Guard stent without complications.
