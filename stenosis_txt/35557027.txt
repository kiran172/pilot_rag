Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation with the novel-generation Navitor device: Procedural and early outcomes.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has proved beneficial in patients with severe aortic stenosis, especially when second-generation devices are used. We aimed at reporting our experience with Navitor, a third-generation device characterized by intrannular, large cell, and cuffed design, as well as high deliverability and minimization of paravalvular leak. Between June and December 2021, a total of 39 patients underwent TAVI with Navitor, representing 20% of all TAVI cases. Mean age was 80.0 ± 6.7 years, and 14 (36.8%) women were included. Severe aortic stenosis was the most common indication to TAVI (37 [97.4%] cases), whereas 2 (5.3%) individuals were at low surgical risk. Device and procedural success was obtained in all patients, with a total hospital stay of 6.6 ± 4.5 days. One (2.9%) patient required permanent pacemaker implantation, but no other hospital events occurred. At 1-month follow-up, a cardiac death was adjudicated in an 87-year-old man who had been at high surgical risk. Echocardiographic follow-up showed no case of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, with mild regurgitation in 18 (47%), and none or trace regurgitation in 20 (53%). The Navitor device, thanks to its unique features, is a very promising technology suitable to further expand indications and risk-benefit profile of TAVI.
