Title: miR-2467-3p/ABLIM1 Axis Mediates the Formation and Progression of Deep Vein Thrombosis by Regulating Inflammation and Oxidative Stress.

Abstract: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common postoperative complication of orthopaedic surgery with a complex pathogenesis mechanism. The effect of the miR-2467-3p/acting-binding LIM protein 1 (ABLIM1) axis on thrombus formation and human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) progression was evaluated aiming to identify a novel potential biomarker of DVT. DVT rat models were established by inferior vena cava stenosis. The expression of the miR-2467-3p/ABLIM1 axis was analyzed by PCR. HUVECs were induced with oxidative low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Cell growth and motility were assessed by cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) and Transwell assay. The inflammation and oxidative stress were estimated by proinflammatory cytokines and generation of MDA and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ABLIM1 was downregulated in DVT rats. Overexpressing ABLIM1 could suppress the formation of thrombosis and alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress. In HUVECs, ox-LDL induced significantly increased miR-2467-3p and decreased ABLIM1, and miR-2467-3p could negatively regulate ABLIM1. The knockdown of miR-2467-3p could alleviate the inhibited cell growth and motility by ox-LDL, and the inflammation and oxidative stress were also attenuated. While silencing could reverse the effect of miR-2467-3p on ox-LDL-induced HUVECs. The miR-2467-3p/ABLIM1 axis regulates the occurrence and development of DVT through modulating HUVECs inflammation and oxidative stress.
