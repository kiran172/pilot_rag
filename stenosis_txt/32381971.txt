Title: [A Case of Long-Term Survival after Chemotherapy and Ablation Therapy Using Various Approaches for Multiple Colon Cancer Liver Metastases].

Abstract: A 58-year-old man with unresectable sigmoid colon cancer and multiple liver metastases(H2, more than 30)received chemotherapy for 2 years. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with stenosis of the primary lesion and 5 bilobar, metastatic tumors. Simultaneous resection was unsuitable because of the performance status and comorbidities of the patient. The first surgery consisted of laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy, laparoscopic microwave coagulation therapy(MCT), and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation(RFA). Percutaneous RFA was additionally performed after 2 months. Since 2 liver metastases(S3 and S8)were inadequately treated, 3 courses of P-mab plus FOLFIRI were administered. Finally, laparoscopic- assisted RFA was performed. Subsequently, serum CEA reduced from 288.3 ng/mL to the normal level. We used fusion imaging US, sonazoid US, laparoscopic convex probe, and ICG fluorescence imaging for ablation therapy. Chemotherapy and ablation therapy using various approaches can control unresectable multiple liver metastases and prolong survival by more than 3 years.
