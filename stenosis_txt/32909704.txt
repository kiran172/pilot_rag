Title: Partial upper sternotomy for concomitant left atrial ablation and aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive access via partial sternotomy has been established for aortic valve surgery in the past years. But concomitant procedures like atrial ablation and aortic valve replacement via partial upper sternotomy have not been investigated so far. We therefore present our operative technique and results in terms of safety and efficacy, including follow-up and quality of life.
METHODS: Between February 2007 and March 2014 a total of 67 patients undergoing isolated minimally invasive aortic valve replacement received concomitant left atrial ablation at our centre. Operative technique and short- and midterm results are described, including quality of life assessment using the SF-36 questionnaire.
RESULTS: Operative techniqual success rate was 98.5%. We observed only one (1.5%) ablation-related conversion to full sternotomy. Operative times, reexploration and stroke rates as well as 30-day mortality are comparable to open procedures. Efficacy: The proportions of patients in sinus rhythm at discharge was 54.5% for paroxysmal AF patients and 27.7% overall. After a mean follow-up time of 38.0±22.6 months the cardiac related mortality rate was 4.5%, the rate of sinus rhythm was 72.7% for paroxysmal AF patients and 36.8% overall. Of survivors, overall mean quality of life was 7.3±2.1 as measured by SF-36.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant left atrial ablation and aortic valve replacement can safely be performed via partial sternotomy and results are non-inferior to open surgery.
