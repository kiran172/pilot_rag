Title: Surgical treatment of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis of cervical spine with dysphagia - Case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis of cervical spine can lead to dysphagia.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 73-year-old male weighing 110 kg and diagnosed with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis in cervical spine with dysphagia. Patient manifested local pain of neck, a gradual limitation of spinal mobility. The surgery decision was based on swallowing problems, not pain in the spine. Before surgery radiographs, magnetic resonance images, computed tomography of the cervical spine and gastroscopy were obtained. Osteophytes were removed from the anterior approach with present otolaryngologist by surgery.
DISCUSSION: In this case used gastroscopy, CT and MRI for diagnostics. During the procedure we had support otolaryngologist. The patient has not been found a stenosis spinal canal and neurological symptoms. We were removed the ostheophytes. Interbody implants have not been applied.
CONCLUSION: Disc degeneration disease itself can be asymptomatic or not a dominant problem for the DISH patients. Clinical signs may pharyngoesophageal and tracheal compression, causing dysphagia, shortness of breath and stridor. In this case, the cervical spine was stability and not demonstrated a stenosis in the spinal canal. Isolate removing of the osteophytes without implants in DISH of cervical spine can be enough solution.
