Title: Prognostic Impact of Cardiac Diastolic Function and Coronary Microvascular Function on Cardiovascular Death.

Abstract: Background Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) has been considered as a possible cause of cardiac diastolic dysfunction. The current study evaluated the association between cardiac diastolic dysfunction and CMD, and their prognostic implications in patients without significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction and epicardial coronary stenosis. Methods and Results A total of 330 patients without left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≥50%) and significant epicardial coronary stenosis (fractional flow reserve &gt;0.80) were analyzed. Cardiac diastolic dysfunction was defined by echocardiographic parameters (early diastolic transmitral flow velocity/early diastolic mitral annular velocity, e' velocity, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, and left atrial volume index). Overt CMD was defined as coronary flow reserve &lt;2.0 and index of microcirculatory resistance ≥25 U. The primary end point was cardiovascular death or admission for heart failure during 5 years of follow-up. In patients without left ventricular systolic dysfunction and significant epicardial coronary stenosis, prevalence of cardiac diastolic dysfunction and overt CMD was 25.5% and 11.2%, respectively. Overt CMD was independently associated with cardiac diastolic dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio, 3.440 [95% CI, 1.599-7.401]; P=0.002). Patients with cardiac diastolic dysfunction showed significantly higher risk of the primary outcome than those without (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.996 [95% CI, 1.888-4.755]; P&lt;0.001). Patients with overt CMD also showed significantly higher risk of the primary outcome than those without (adjusted HR, 2.939 [95% CI, 1.642-5.261]; P&lt;0.001). Presence of overt CMD was associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular death among the patients with cardiac diastolic dysfunction (43.8% versus 14.5%; P=0.006) but not in patients without cardiac diastolic dysfunction (interaction P&lt;0.001). Inclusion of overt CMD into the model with cardiac diastolic dysfunction significantly improved predictive ability for cardiovascular death or heart failure admission (conconrdance index, 0.719 versus 0.737; P for comparison=0.034). Conclusions There was significant association between the presence of cardiac diastolic dysfunction and overt CMD. Both cardiac diastolic dysfunction and overt CMD were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death or admission for heart failure. Integration of overt CMD into cardiac diastolic dysfunction showed improvement of the risk stratification in patients without significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction and epicardial coronary stenosis.
