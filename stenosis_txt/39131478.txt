Title: Management of Pediatric Pulmonary Vein Stenosis.

Abstract: Pediatric intraluminal pulmonary vein stenosis has evolved into a chronic illness, with improving survival. Although significant knowledge gaps remain, medical providers have found success in the management of patients with pulmonary vein stenosis using a comprehensive multimodality treatment strategy. This review discusses the core principles employed by 4 centers dedicated to improving pulmonary vein stenosis outcomes, including how to make the diagnosis, educating the family, treatment strategy, the importance of surveillance, and the management of symptoms and comorbidities.
