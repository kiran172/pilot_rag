Title: Intravascular Ultrasound-Based Fractional Flow Reserve for Predicting Prognosis after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: AccuFFRivus is an alternative to fractional flow reserve (FFR) based on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images for functional assessment of coronary stenosis. However, its prognostic impact in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is still unclear. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the capability of AccuFFRivus in predicting prognosis. AccuFFRivus was calculated based on postoperative angiographic and IVUS images. Vessel-oriented clinical events (VOCE) at 2 years were recorded and analyzed. A total of 131 participants with 131 vessels were included in the study. VOCE occurred in 15 patients during 2-year follow-up. AccuFFRivus after PCI (post-AccuFFRivus) was significantly higher in the non-VOCE group than in the VOCE group (0.95 ± 0.03 vs. 0.91 ± 0.02, p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression showed that AccuFFRivus ≤ 0.94 was a strong independent predictor of VOCE during 2-year follow-up (hazard ratio 23.76, 95% confidence interval: 3.04-185.81, p < 0.001). The left panel displays the Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of postoperative parameters (post-AccuFFRivus and post-MLA) versus vessel-oriented clinical events (VOCE) occurrence within 2-year follow-up. The right panel demonstrates Kaplan-Meier curves of VOCE stratified by the optimal cut-off of post-AccuFFRivus.
