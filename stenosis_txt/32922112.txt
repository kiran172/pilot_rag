Title: Coexisting Coronary and Carotid Artery Disease - Which Technique and in Which Order? Case Report and Review of Literature.

Abstract: Coexisting carotid artery stenosis and coronary artery disease is common and there is currently no consensus in treatment guidelines on the timing, sequence and methods of revascularization. We report a case of a patient with symptomatic triple vessel coronary artery disease as well as asymptomatic severe right internal carotid artery stenosis. Our patient underwent myocardial revascularization first, because she presented with unstable angina and was asymptomatic neurologically. This article summarizes current literature about the approach to carotid and coronary artery revascularization and addresses the decision-making process regarding the timing and sequence of revascularization.
