Title: Transplant renal artery stenosis in a child with BK nephropathy.

Abstract: TRAS and BK nephropathy are known complications of RT, but the association between both has not been reported. A 2-year-old girl underwent a deceased donor renal transplant from a 20-year-old donor, along with bilateral native nephrectomies. She had a DGF due to a renal artery thrombus and required thrombectomy with re-anastomosis. Heparin and aspirin were used. Immunosuppressive agents included thymoglobulin, steroid, tacrolimus, and MMF. CMV and EBV DNA PCRs were negative, but she developed BK viremia at 2Â months with stable allograft function. Immunosuppression was reduced, and leflunomide was initiated. Blood pressures were well controlled on low-dose amlodipine. Five months after RT, she presented with hypertensive emergency, following a respiratory infection, and required dialysis for oliguric acute kidney injury. Allograft biopsy showed evidence of BK nephropathy. Immunosuppression was further minimized. Doppler renal US and renal artery duplex studies were both suggestive of TRAS. Angiogram showed severe proximal anastomotic TRAS (>95% occlusion). PTA with stenting was done with immediate improvement in the blood flow and reduction in the pressure gradient. BPs and renal function normalized. Ten months post-RT, she remains normotensive with stable renal function and resolution of BK viremia. Although ureteral stenosis and nephropathy are known to occur with BK infection, TRAS is an interesting association and possibly suggest the tropism of BK virus to the vascular endothelial cells. Timely recognition and management of both is important to prevent uncontrolled hypertension and allograft dysfunction.
