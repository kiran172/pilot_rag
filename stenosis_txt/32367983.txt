Title: Computerized Tomography-Based Morphometric Analysis of Cervical Spinal Canal in Central Indian Population.

Abstract: Objective  Normal cervical spine canal morphometry is critical for understanding the pathology of certain diseases and for proper preoperative planning. Computerized tomography (CT) scan can replace older conventional radiography techniques by providing more accurate morphometric measurements. This study was aimed to find out various dimensions of the cervical spinal canal of central Indian population. Materials and Methods  A prospective study was conducted including 100 consecutive cervical spine CT scan of asymptomatic adult subjects. The anteroposterior sagittal canal diameter (SCD), transverse canal diameter (TCD), canal surface area (CSA), and Pavlov-Torg Ratio (PTR) from C2 to C7 were calculated. Statistical Analysis  Data were entered in Microsoft Excel Sheet 2007 and statistical analysis was performed by IBM SPSS statistics 2.0 version. p -Value &lt; 0.05 was considered as significant. Results  Age ranged from 18 years to 77 years with mean age 39.5 years. There was no significant difference in all the dimensions (SCD, TCD, CSA) in male and female except at C2 level, where SCD, TCD, and CSA were significant larger in male. The mean SCD, TCD, and CSA is largest at C2 level (14.4 ± 1.63 mm, 21.57 ± 1.59 mm, and 156.20 ± 24.98 mm﻿﻿ 2 , respectively) and smallest at C4 level (12.77 ± 1.48 mm, 20.37 ± 1.72 mm, and 130.42 ± 21.20 mm﻿﻿ 2 ). PTR showed very little variation. Conclusion  Normal values of cervical spinal canal could serve as a future reference. CT scan provides more accurate measurement. More studies are needed as there could be variations in dimensions in different regions in India.
