Title: Subclavian steal syndrome secondary to atherosclerosis: A case report and review of literature.

Abstract: Subclavian Steal Syndrome (SSS) is a rare vascular syndrome caused due to proximal occlusion or stenosis of subclavian or innominate artery. It is usually asymptomatic but occasionally may present with vertebro-basilar insufficiency and/or upper limb ischemia. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause.
