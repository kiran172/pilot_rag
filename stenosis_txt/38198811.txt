Title: [Surgical and Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomy - Technique and Pitfalls].

Abstract: A tracheostomy is usually necessary for long-term mechanical ventilation or complicated weaning. Other indications include swallowing disorders with recurrent aspiration in neuromuscular disease and high-grade subglottic stenosis. The tracheostomy can be performed as a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy or as a surgical tracheostomy. The complication rate is low, and intraoperative complications are differentiated from early and late postoperative complications. This article aims to present the indications, the techniques and complications of percutaneous dilatational and surgical tracheostomy, and highlights the long-term complications of tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia.
