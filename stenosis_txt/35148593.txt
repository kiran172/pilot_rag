Title: Outcome of Post-intubation Tracheal Stenosis (PITS) with Primary Resection and Anastomosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the outcome of primary resection anastomosis in patients of post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS) and the associated morbidity.
STUDY DESIGN: A case series.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Thoracic Surgery, Combined Military Hospital, (CMH) Rawalpindi, Lahore and Multan from January 2010 to August 2018.
METHODOLOGY: Patients with tracheal stenosis due to prolonged intubation with functional were included. Exclusion criteria were patients having stenosis due to malignant cause, trauma and glottic stenosis involving vocal cords. Clinical examination, computerised tomography (CT) of neck plus chest and fiberoptic bronchoscopy were done in all the patients, while virtual bronchoscopy were done in 35 cases. Sharp dissection, aided by loupes, was the preferred technique. Thyroid tissue and strap muscle were used as flap for high cricoid lesion. Guardian stitch was applied to all cases. Postoperative elective bronchoscopy was performed after a fortnight.
RESULTS: Among 43 patients, [26 (60.5%) men and 17 (39.5) women] 18 patients were intubated for days >10 ,18 for <10 and 7 for <3 days. Thirty-four (79.1%) patients were under 40 years of age, while 23 patients had tracheostomy incorporated in surgery. Bronchoscopy evaluation of distance from vocal cords showed involvement of the first ring in six patients, 1st ring normal in 1, 2 rings normal in 17, while 3 or more rings spared in 19 patients. Length of stenotic segment was <2 cm in 17, between 2-3 cm in 21, and between 3-5 cm in five patients. All patients were successfully extubated. Two patients had twin lesions. Seven patients required hyoid bone excision and release. There was one recurrent stenosis managed successfully with dilatation and granulation removal.
CONCLUSION: Post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS) is curable disease. Primary resection and anastomosis remain the gold standard with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Key Words: Tracheal stenosis, Intubation, Resection, Primary anastomosis.
