Title: Carotid Ultrasound.

Abstract: Carotid ultrasound is the primary noninvasive method for detecting, grading, and monitoring internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. Major components of carotid Doppler ultrasound include assessment of ICA stenosis using Doppler velocity criteria, spectral waveform analysis, and assessment of ICA stenosis. Recently, the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission Vascular Testing put forth new modified Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound criteria with a higher peak systolic velocity threshold of 180Â cm/s for 50% to 69% ICA stenosis. Additional emerging techniques, including 3D imaging, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and superb microvascular imaging, may help identify vulnerable plaque and thus help further risk-stratify patients in the future.
