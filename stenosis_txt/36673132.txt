Title: Could Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis Be the Hallmark of Metabolic Syndrome on the Spine? A Literature Review with Emphasis on Etiology.

Abstract: Spinal epidural lipomatosis is defined by an excessive amount of epidural fat in the spinal canal, usually in the lumbosacral tract: a well-known cause of lumbar pain and spinal stenosis with a possible wide range of neurological symptoms. Recent research data reveal that, nowadays, obesity has become the main cause of spinal epidural lipomatosis. Moreover, this condition was recently recognized as a previously unknown manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Radiological studies (CT and MRI) are the only tools that are able to diagnose the disease non-invasively. Indeed, radiologists play a key role in disease recognition, with subsequent possible implications on patients' systemic health assessments. Despite its clinical importance, the condition is still underreported and neglected. The current literature review summarizes all the main etiologies of spinal epidural lipomatosis, particularly regarding its linkage with metabolic syndrome. An overview of disease characteristics from diagnosis to treatment strategies is also provided.
