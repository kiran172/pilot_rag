Title: Physician-Modified Endografts for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Pathologies Involving the Aortic Arch.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of physician-modified endografts (PMEGs) for the treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies involving the aortic arch.
METHODS: A retrospective single-center study was performed on consecutive patients with thoracic aortic pathologies treated by PMEGs between February 2018 and May 2022. Data on baseline characteristics, operative procedure, and follow-up information were collected. The endpoints included technical success, complications, mortality, overall survival, re-intervention, and target vessel instability.
RESULTS: This study comprised 173 patients (mean age=58Â±13, range=28-83, 148 men) with thoracic aortic pathologies, including 44 thoracic aortic aneurysms, 113 aortic dissections (9 type A, 4 residual type A, 75 type B, 32 non-A non-B), 3 aortic intramural hematomas, and 13 penetrating aortic ulcers. Thirty-five of the patients had PMEGs with 3 fenestrations, 32 had 2 fenestrations, and 106 had 1 single fenestration. Technical success was 98% (170/173), and the 30-day mortality was 2% (3/173). Perioperative complications included stroke (n=3, 2%), retrograde type A dissection (RTAD; n=3, 2%) and renal injury (n=3, 2%). Seven deaths (4%) were noted during a median follow-up of 11 (range=1-52) months. Eleven cases of re-intervention were stent-related. There were 5 type Ia endoleaks (3%), 2 type III endoleaks (1%) from the innominate artery (IA), and 3 type Ic endoleaks (2%) from the left subclavian arteries. One case of IA stent-graft (SG) stenosis was noted because of mural thrombus. Estimate rates of overall survival, freedom from secondary intervention, and freedom from target vessel instability at 2 years were 93.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]=88.7%-98.1%), 80.7% (95% CI=73.3%-88.1%), and 89.0% (95% CI=80.4%-97.6%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Physician-modified endografts showed promising immediate therapeutic results in the treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies involving the aortic arch. Our study demonstrates that the technique is feasible and produces acceptable results. Long-term outcomes are required for further refinement of this technical approach to confirm technical success and durability over time as a valuable option for endovascular aortic arch repair in specialized centers.
CLINICAL IMPACT: Our short- and mid-term outcomes of physician-modified endografts in 173 patients showed promising results compared to other branched/fenestrated techniques and backed up the endovascular repair of the aortic arch. Meanwhile, the technical expertise pointed out in our manuscript, including preloaded guidewire, diameter-reducing wire and inner mini-cuffs, provided reference and technical guidance for our peers. Most importantly, it demonstrated that the PMEG, as a device whose components were all commercially available, might be a better option for emergency surgery and for centers who had no access to custom-made devices.
