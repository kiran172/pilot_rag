Title: Cardiac Cachexia Associated With Valvular Heart Failure.

Abstract: Cardiac cachexia (CC) represents a serious complication of heart failure (HF). This condition could be directly related to mortality. The weight or muscle mass loss has to be monitored in our patients with HF to avoid potential complications. We report a case of an elderly patient with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) who presented with progressive shortness of breath limiting his daily activities associated with weight loss. Signs of heart failure were evident on physical examination, and valvulopathy was also evident. His echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction (EF) with structural changes and severe aortic stenosis. He was not a candidate for cardiothoracic surgery, and a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was performed. After the procedure, his symptoms improved, and during the outpatient follow-up, his cardiac function and dry weight improved. Cardiac cachexia could be caused by reversible cardiomyopathy. Early assessment and approach are critical for the outcome of our patients, impacting their quality of life and outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality consequences.
