Title: Fully Endoscopic 360° Decompression for Central Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Combined with Disc Herniation: Technical Note and Preliminary Outcomes of 39 Cases.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes, feasibility, and safety of endoscopic unilateral laminectomy, bilateral decompression and discectomy (Endo-ULBDD) for central lumbar spinal stenosis (CLSS) combined with disc herniation (DH).
METHODS: This study includes 39 patients diagnosed with CLSS combined with DH who met the inclusion criteria and underwent surgery for Endo-ULBDD from April 2020 to March 2021. The mean age of the patients, operation time, hospitalization time, time in bed, and complications were recorded. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for low-back and lower-limb pain and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were evaluated preoperatively, before discharge, and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. To evaluate clinical effectiveness 12 months postoperatively, the modified MacNab criteria were used.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 59.9 years, the mean operation time was 82.1 minutes, the mean hospitalization time was 3.7 days, and the mean time in bed was 20.9 hours. The mean VAS scores of low-back and lower-limb pain improved from 5.9 and 7.2 to 2.0 and 1.6, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). The ODI score improved from 56.0 to 16.7 (P &lt; 0.05). The overall excellent-good rate of the modified MacNab criteria was 89.7%. Two kinds of complications occurred in 4 patients (10.3%), including 1 patient whose inferior articular process was excessively removed and 3 patients who suffered from postoperative dysesthesia. No other severe complications were noted.
CONCLUSION: Endo-ULBDD is a safe, feasible, efficient, and minimally invasive approach to treating CLSS combined with DH.
