Title: Acute Laryngeal Injury in Patients Undergoing Airway Screening at a Long-Term Acute Care Hospital.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Acute laryngeal injury (ALgI) is an identified complication of prolonged intubation. Its evolution into mature stenosis and factors affecting decannulation are unclear. This retrospective review aims to characterize the incidence and characteristics of ALgI development and decannulation.
METHODS: Retrospective study of post-intubated patients with a tracheostomy seen for screening evaluation at a single long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) from 2019 to 2022.
RESULTS: Patients were followed for an average of 115 days after extubation. Forty-nine of 119 adult patients had ALgI. Those with ALgI were more likely female (61% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.006) with higher body mass index (BMI; 32.9 vs. 28.1, p = 0.03) and lower height (166 vs. 171.1 cm, p = 0.01). Decannulation rates in patients with ALgI were 69.4% compared to 84.3% in patients without ALgI (p = 0.053). Patients with ALgI were scoped more quickly post-extubation (28.8 vs. 36.6 days, p = 0.04), but time to decannulation did not differ (66.6 vs. 81.2 days, p = 0.74). Lower CCI (4.03 vs 6.93) and lack of tobacco use (41.2% vs 73.3%) were associated with successful decannulation (p = 0.038, p = 0.0008). Patients with ALgI treated conservatively (observation or medical management) were decannulated up to 71 days post-extubation. Further decannulations only occurred with surgical intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Female gender, higher BMI, and shorter height are associated with ALgI among patients undergoing a LTACH screening evaluation. CCI and tobacco have a negative association with decannulation success. Among the ALgI cohort, no patient treated conservatively was decannulated after 71 days.
