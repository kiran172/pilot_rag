Title: Cardiac Computed Tomographic Angiography Evaluation of Right Ventricle-Pulmonary Artery Conduits with Surgical Correlation.

Abstract: Right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduits are used in the treatment of certain congenital heart disease (CHD). RV-PA conduit complications might develop over time and require intervention. To evaluate how well cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) performs compared to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in evaluating RV-PA conduit complications by using surgical findings as the reference standard. A retrospective chart review of all patients over a 5-year period who underwent CCTA for RV-PA conduit evaluation was performed. Patient demographics and clinical data were recorded. Preoperative CCTA and TTE findings were compared to the operative findings for concordance or discordance. Forty-one patients were included, 51% females. The complications were conduit stenosis (28.68%), infection (7.17%) and aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm (6.15%). TTE and CCTA were consistently able to visualize focal conduit stenosis (96%). The greatest discrepancy between TTE and CCTA was in evaluating for aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, where TTE detected only 2/6 (33%) compared to CCTA which detected 6/6 (100%) of the cases. However, TTE was slightly better at detecting conduit infection (3/7, 43%) compared to CCTA (2/7, 29%). Note that 5 out of 7 patients with endocarditis had bovine jugular graft. CCTA and TTE provide similar diagnostic accuracy evaluating certain types of RV-PA conduit complications. However, certain complications were only visualized on CCTA or TTE making both modalities complementary to each other during diagnostic evaluation.
