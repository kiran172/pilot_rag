Title: Acquired Benign Tracheoesophageal Fistula: An Alternative Tracheoplastic Technique.

Abstract: We present a case of surgical management of a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) following prolonged intubation. After transverse tracheal division and retraction of the distal stump, direct closure of the esophageal defect and repair of the membranous tracheal defect using a synthetic bioabsorbable patch were performed, followed by interposition of muscle flap between the suture lines and tracheal reconstruction. Large TEFs, without tracheal stenosis or circumferential airway defect, associated with marked peritracheal inflammation, may be treated with this alternative tracheoplastic technique in patients deemed not suitable for tracheal resection and anastomosis.
