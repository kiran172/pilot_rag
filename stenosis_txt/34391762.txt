Title: Trends and Outcomes of Ischemic Stroke after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation, A US National Propensity Matched Analysis.

Abstract: Contemporary data on stroke predictors and outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains limited. We analyzed National Inpatient Sample data from the year 2011 to 2018. A total of 215,938 patients underwent TAVI. Of the patients who underwent TAVI, 4579 (2.2%) suffered from stroke and 211359 (97.8%) did not have a stroke. Adjusted mortality was higher in patients who had a stroke (10.9%) as compared to patients who did not have a stroke (3.1%). Lower percentage of patients were discharged home who developed a stroke compared to patients without a stroke (10.2% vs 52.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that at baseline, age, female sex, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and peripheral vascular disease were significant predictors of stroke. Median Cost of care ($63367 vs $48070) and length of stay (8 vs 4 days) were considerably higher for patients with stroke when compared to the comparison group (P < 0.01 for all). In conclusion we report that stroke is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and resource utilization in patients undergoing TAVI. Baseline characteristics like age, gender, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and peripheral vascular disease are significant predictors of this adverse event.
