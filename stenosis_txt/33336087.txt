Title: Treatment challenges in idiopathic extracranial ICA vasospasm case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: Idiopathic extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) vasospasm is a rare pathological phenomenon that may lead to stroke in young patients. We report a case of an 18Â year-old female with recurrent extracranial ICA vasospasm since age thirteen. We summarize published data related to this condition including all twenty-three reported cases of extracranial ICA vasospasm. We describe the various proposed pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disorder. Various treatment modalities have been attempted but there is no known long-term effective treatment.
