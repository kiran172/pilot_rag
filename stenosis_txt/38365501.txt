Title: Robotic Assisted Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: Initial Australian Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIM: Robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (R-PCI) has been increasingly performed overseas. Initial observations have demonstrated its clinical efficacy and safety with additional potential benefits of more accurate lesion assessment and stent deployment, with reduced radiation exposure to operators and patients. However, data from randomised controlled trials or clinical experience from Australia are lacking.
METHODS: This was a single-centre experience of all patients undergoing R-PCI as part of the run-in phase for an upcoming randomised clinical trial (ACTRN12623000480684). All R-PCI procedures were performed using the CorPath GRX robot (Corindus Vascular Robotics, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Key inclusion criteria included patients with obstructive coronary disease requiring percutaneous coronary intervention. Major exclusion criteria included ST-elevation myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock or lesions deemed unsuitable for R-PCI by the operator. Clinical success was defined as residual stenosis <30% without in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Technical success was defined as the completion of the R-PCI procedure without unplanned manual conversion. Procedural characteristics were compared between early (cases 1-3) and later (cases 4-21) cases.
RESULTS: Twenty-one (21) patients with a total of 24 lesions were analysed. The mean age of patients was 66.5 years, and 66% of cases were male. Radial access was used in 18 cases (86%). Most lesions were American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology class B2/C (66%). Clinical success was achieved in 100% with manual conversion required in four cases (19%). No procedural complications or in-hospital MACE occurred. Compared to the early cases, later cases had a statistically significantly shorter fluoroscopy time (44.0mins vs 25.2mins, p&lt;0.007), dose area product (967.3 dGy.cm2 vs 361.0dGy.cm2, p=0.01) and air kerma (2484.3mGy vs 797.4mGy, p=0.009) with no difference in contrast usage (136.7mL vs 131.4mL, p=0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first clinical experience of R-PCI in Australia using the Corindus CorPath GRX robot. We achieved clinical success in all patients and technical success in the majority of cases with no procedural complications or in-hospital MACE. With increasing operator and staff experience, cases required shorter fluoroscopy time and less radiation exposure but similar contrast usage.
