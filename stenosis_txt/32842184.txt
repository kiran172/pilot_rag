Title: [Diagnosis and treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis induced by relapsing polychondritis].

Abstract: Objective:To investigate the clinical characteristics, management and prognosis of laryngotracheal stenosis induced by relapsing polychondritis. Method:A retrospective analysis was performed of 11 patients with laryngotracheal stenosis induced by relapsing polychondritis. Stenosis was classified as Myer and Cotton grade Ⅱ in 4 patients, grade Ⅲ in 3 and grade Ⅳin 4. Result:Long-term T-tube implantation of thoracic tracheal stenosis was performed in 1 patient, and one patient who had underwent 2 dilations was decannulated, and the tube was successfully extubated in 9 cases who had underwent laryngotracheal reconstruction with sternohyoid myocutaneous flap or costal cartilage. Conclusion:Treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis induced by relapsing polychondritis is challenging. If the surgical intervention was selected properly on an individual basis, favorable clinical outcome can be obtained.
