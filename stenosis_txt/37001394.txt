Title: A case report of uremic tumoral calcinosis in the head and neck and literature review of calcified lesions of the head and neck.

Abstract: Soft-tissue calcifications in the head and neck are relatively common and are the result of a wide variety of benign and malignant pathologies. They can present a diagnostic challenge given the broad range of underlying etiologies. Uremic tumoral calcinosis (UTC) is a rare complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) resulting from metastatic soft tissue calcification. Common sites include periarticular soft tissues of the shoulders, elbows, and hands (Pan and Chen, 2016). UTC can also affect the cervical spine and mimic osteosarcomas (Zhou et al., 2018). We present the case of a 71-year-old female with hypertension, left carotid artery stenosis, mitral valve prolapse, and ESRD secondary to diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) on peritoneal dialysis who was found to have large, heterogeneous, bilateral calcified neck masses. Given her clinical history, laboratory results, and imaging findings, she was diagnosed with UTC. In addition to this case, we provide an overview of tumoral calcinosis (TC) and a differential diagnosis for calcified lesions of the head and neck.
