Title: Posterior Facetectomy with Fusion Using a Pedicle Screw for Parallel-shaped Cervical Foraminal Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of posterior facetectomy with fusion using pedicle screw (PF using FPS) for severe cervical foraminal stenosis of parallel shape.
METHODS: Patients (n=8) with 1- or 2-level parallel-shaped cervical foraminal stenosis who underwent posterior facetectomy with fusion using cervical pedicle screw between March 2012 and August 2016 were enrolled. Patients were followed up immediately postoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. We assessed arm and neck pains and clinical outcomes using a numeric rating scale (NRS) and neck disability index (NDI). We determined cervical Cobb's and segmental angles by radiological evaluations. We identified screw breech as a neurovascular complication.
RESULTS: Neck and arm pains were significantly reduced postoperatively (neck visual analog scale [VAS]: 4.9±3.7 [preoperative] to 0.4±1.1 [final follow-up]; arm VAS: 9.0±0.8 to 0.4±1.1). Cobb's angle for cervical sagittal alignment improved from 11.1±8.4 to 17.0±5.9. Segmental angle of index surgery was maintained (3.4±7.0-4.9±5.6). NDI was also remained from 36.1±26.3 to 13.8±8.4. There are no injuries to the vertebral arteries and neural tissues because of screw insertion.
CONCLUSION: PF using FPS is a practical treatment option for parallel-shaped cervical foraminal stenosis.
