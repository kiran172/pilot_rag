Title: Impact of rs599839 Polymorphism on Coronary Artery Disease Risk in Saudi Diabetic Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery diseases may be affected by several genetic and nongenetic factors. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs599839 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can affect the occurrence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: Our aim was to investigate how T2DM and the rs599839 variant affected serum lipid levels and the degree of CAD patients' coronary artery stenosis. rs599839 polymorphism genotyping was done on Saudi patients with coronary angiography performed previously. Patients enrolled were divided into group A (360 DM patients), group B (225 DM patients with CAD), and group C (190 healthy volunteers as control).
RESULTS: Individuals with diabetes and CAD who possessed the GG genotype in rs599839 exhibited markedly reduced means of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG; 224.5, 116.2, and 221.4 versus 251.6, 131.3, and 261.7 mg/dl, p=0.003, 0.007, and 0.025, respectively) than AA genotype. The odds ratio and the confidence interval of 95% for G allele carriers of rs599839 were OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.41-0.82, and p=0.003, among diabetic patients with CAD.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetic CAD, the locus 1p13.3 polymorphism rs599839 was found to be substantially correlated with serum lipid levels. Furthermore, among Saudi patients with diabetes, the G allele of rs599839 variant lowers the CAD risk.
