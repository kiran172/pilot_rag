Title: Multimodality Imaging of the Mitral Valve: Morphology, Function, and Disease.

Abstract: The mitral valve apparatus is one of the key structures of the heart with complex anatomy and function. The prevalence of mitral valve disease is associated with age: elderly people are affected more frequently. There are multiple inherited and acquired conditions; tumors may also involve the mitral valve. Stenosis and regurgitation are the main manifestations of valvular disease. Echocardiography, computed tomography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging are widely applied techniques for anatomical and functional evaluation of the mitral valve. Each of the modalities has unique applications and limitations, therefore assessment of mitral valve disease requires a multimodality imaging approach. In this pictorial essay, we review normal anatomy and physiology of the mitral valve as well as multimodality imaging manifestations of mitral valve disease.
