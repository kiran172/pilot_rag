Title: Is dynamic spino-pelvic alignment during gait associated with lumbar function in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Static spine and pelvic posture has been reported to be associated with symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), but it is unknown whether dynamic alignment of the spine and pelvis is associated with lumbar function in daily life. This study aims to investigate the relationship between dynamic alignment of the spine and pelvis during gait and lumbar function in daily life in patients with LSS.
METHODS: We evaluated lumbar function in daily life using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), trunk and hip muscle strength as physical function, static spinal alignment, and dynamic spinal/pelvic alignment during gait. The relationship between the ODI score and physical function or static and dynamic alignment was examined.
RESULTS: A total of 35 preoperative patients with LSS participated in this study. ODI score significantly correlated with trunk extension strength (r = -0.578, p = 0.000), hip extension strength (r = -0.472, p = 0.004), maximum spinal flexion angle during gait (r = -0.473, p = 0.004) and maximum pelvic anterior tilt angle (r = 0.510, p = 0.002). Multiple regression analysis showed that trunk extension strength (standardized β; - 0.309), hip extension strength (standardized β; -0.287), maximum spinal flexion angle (standardized β; - 0.306) and maximum pelvic anterior tilt angle (standardized β; 0.271) significantly affected the ODI score, with adjusted coefficient of determination of 0.529.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the patients with LSS with weak hip or trunk extensor muscles, a greater angle of pelvic tilt or a less spinal flexion during gait had a lower lumbar function in daily life.
