Title: Relationship between carotid artery stenosis percentage and complications in patients treated with carotid stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a relationship between carotid artery stenosis percentage and complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 109 patients treated with carotid artery stenting in our center. The indication for stenting was accepted as carotid artery stenosis above 50% in symptomatic patients and over 70% in asymptomatic patients. Complications were compared between groups with <90% and ≥90% stenosis.
RESULTS: There was no procedure-related mortality in any of the patients. Minor complications developed in 22 patients (20.2%). Prolonged hypotension/bradycardia occurred in 17 patients (77.3%), and a transient ischemic attack in five (22.7%). Inguinal access complications were detected in three patients (2.7%). Major complications developed in 11 patients (10%), of whom five (45.4%) had hyperperfusion syndrome, five (45.4%) had microinfarcts, and one (9%) had acute stent thrombosis. No significant difference was observed in age, gender, major and minor complications, or inguinal access site complications between the patients with <90% and ≥90% stenosis. There was also no statistically significant difference in complications according to the open or closed cell morphology of the selected stent.
CONCLUSIONS: The most important result of our study is that there was no significant difference in complications between the patients who underwent carotid stenting due to <90% and ≥90% stenosis.
