Title: Using the coronary lithotripsy system for coronary artery disease.

Abstract: Severe coronary artery calcification increases percutaneous treatment complexity and the risk of intraprocedural complications, affecting acute and long-term outcomes. Current use of specialty balloons and atherectomy technologies is limited due to the higher risk of complications, degree of technical difficulty and operator experience.Â Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel technology for severe calcified coronary artery disease that facilitates vessel preparation, enhancing vessel compliance. IVL system emits sonic waves that penetrate through vascular layers and disrupt both superficial and deep calcium, leaving the soft tissue unharmed. The purpose of the present review is to provide a summary of the evidence currently available on this therapy, including a practical description of the components and function of the shockwave coronary IVL system.
