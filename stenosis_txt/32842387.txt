Title: [Efficacy of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty for pediatric renovascular hypertension: a meta-analysis].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and the related factors of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) for pediatric renovascular hypertension (RVH) by a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search was performed on international and domestic databases (Pubmed, Excerpt Medical Database (EMBASE), Cochrane library, Clinical trial.gov, Medline, China Biology Medicine (CBM), China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), VIP database and Wanfang) which included studies on PTRA for pediatric RVH from the establishment of the databases to March 2019. Key words of "pediatric" "children" "renal artery stenosis" "renovascular hypertension" "angioplasty" and "intervention" were used. Meta-analysis was made on the rate of technical success, clinical blood pressure improvement, complication and restenosis of PTRA as well as the predictors of its efficacy. The data consolidation, analysis of heterogeneity and sensitivity, and publication bias were performed using Comprehensive meta analyst and Open meta analyst software. Results: Seventeen observational non-controlled studies comprising 384 patients with RVH who underwent PTRA were identified. The technical success rate of PTRA was 93.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 89.3%-97.5%). The improvement rate of blood pressure was 68.4% (95%CI 57.2%-78.7%), and the cure rate was 40.0% (95%CI 25.0%-55.8%). The subsequent subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the improvement rate of blood pressure after PTRA among the patients with RVH caused by fibromuscular dysplasia, Takayasu arteritis and neurofibromatosis type 1, respectively (P&gt;0.05). The improvement rate of blood pressure in patients with combined lesions in renal artery branches was significantly lower than that in patients with lesions only in main renal artery (RR=1.659, 95%CI 1.023-2.689, P=0.040). It was found that 25.5% (95% CI 19.3%-32.2%) of patients required repeat procedure because of restenosis of lesions. Procedural complication of PTRA occurred in 8.3% (95%CI 3.5%-14.4%) of patients. In terms of clinical blood pressure improvement rate after PTRA, there was heterogeneity among the enrolled studies, but the results of meta-analysis were robust with low risk of publication bias (t=1.690, 95%CI -0.363-3.124, P=0.110). Conclusion: The result of the Meta-analysis suggests that PTRA may provide a safe and effective treatment for pediatric RVH, and patients with stenosis of renal arterial branches are associated with relatively poor clinical outcomes.
