Title: In vitro Assessment of Aortic Regurgitation Using Four-Dimensional Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Abstract: Aortic regurgitation (AR) refers to backward blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle (LV) during ventricular diastole. The regurgitant jet arising from the complex shape is characterized by the three-dimensional flow and high-velocity gradient, sometimes limiting an accurate measurement of the regurgitant volume using 2D echocardiography. Recently developed four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow MRI) enables three-dimensional volumetric flow measurements, which can be used to accurately quantify the amount of the regurgitation. This study focuses on (i) magnetic resonance compatible AR model fabrication (dilatation, perforation, and prolapse) and (ii) systematic analysis of the performance of 4D flow MRI in AR quantification. The results indicated that the formation of the forward and backward jets over time was highly dependent on the types of AR origin. The amount of regurgitation volume bias for the model types were -7.04%, -33.21%, 6.75%, and 37.04% compared to the ground truth (48 mL) volume measured from the pump stroke volume. The largest error of the regurgitation fraction was around 12%. These results indicate that careful selection of imaging parameters is required when absolute regurgitation volume is important. The suggested in vitro flow phantom can easily be modified to simulate other valvular diseases such as aortic stenosis or bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and can be used as a standard platform to test different MRI sequences in the future.
