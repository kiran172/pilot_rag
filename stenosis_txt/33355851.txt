Title: Study of Patients with Bilateral Knee Osteoarthritis Undergoing Total Knee Replacement Procedure with Coexisting Lumbar Spondylosis Symptoms.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study involving patients who were followed for 2 years after total knee replacement (TKR) to determine changes in lumbar spine and knee symptoms.
PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to determine the percentage of patients undergoing bilateral TKR who present with coexisting lumbar spine problems and determine if TKR relieves lumbar spine symptoms.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: No studies quantify the percentage of TKR patients who experience relief of lumbar spine symptoms after TKR surgery.
METHODS: The study included 200 patients (164 females, 36 males) undergoing primary TKR. Follow-up was performed at 4 weeks, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Lumbar spine and knee symptom improvements were assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Oxford Knee Score, respectively.
RESULTS: All 200 patients undergoing bilateral TKR presented with radiographic lumbar spine degenerative pathology; 60% (n=120) of the patients presented with moderate to severe clinical symptoms of lumbar spondylosis, including 54% (n=108) with degenerative lumbar spondylosis and lumbar canal stenosis and 6% (n=12) with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Of the 120 patients who presented with lumbar spine problems, 90% (n=108) reported improvement in their symptoms; the ODI score improved from 42.5%±4.1% preoperative score to 15.6%±2.3% postoperative score (p-value<0.001). Of the 12 patients with no improvement, 10 patients underwent percutaneous procedures for their lumbar spine pathology with good results, one patient underwent surgery, and one declined any intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients (60%) undergoing bilateral TKR also present with symptomatic lumbar spine problems. Patients with mild to moderate lumbar spine degenerative symptoms and no associated severe radiating pain on activity are more likely to experience relief of their symptoms post-TKR.
