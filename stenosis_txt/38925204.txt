Title: Surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with reduced ejection fraction. Prevalence and follow-up.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Limited information exists on the prevalence and outcomes of patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for aortic stenosis (AS) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This study aims to describe the number of AS patients undergoing SAVR with LVEF less than 55 % and quantify LVEF improvement at follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed patients undergoing SAVR with LVEF less than 55 % and the number of patients that improved the LVEF at 6 months. We defined 'improved LVEF' as a 10 % increase of LVEF compared to baseline.
RESULTS: Out of 685 patients, 11.4 % (n = 78) had SAVR with LVEF <55 %. The median pre-surgery LVEF was 45 % [IQR 37-51]. In-hospital mortality was 5.1 % (n = 4). Follow-up data for 69 patients showed 50.7 % (n = 35) had improved LVEF.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, 10 % of severe AS patients underwent SAVR with LVEF <55 %, with half showing LVEF improvement at follow-up.
