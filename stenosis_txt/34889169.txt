Title: A customised laryngeal stent for glottic airway reconstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Laryngotracheal reconstructive surgery very often requires placement of laryngeal stents, but most of the available stents either do not conform to the shape of the glottis or are open at the upper end, causing significant tissue reaction and aspiration. LT-Mold is an ideal stent in this respect, but it is not readily available.
CASE REPORT: The authors of this study fashioned a laryngeal stent out of a readily available Montgomery T-tube in such a way that it had a closed upper end and was well-conformed to the architecture of the larynx. This stent was used in a case of posterior expansion laryngoplasty, and post-operatively the patient had a patent airway with good voice and no aspiration.
CONCLUSION: A customised laryngeal stent is well tolerated and helps to solve complicated cases of posterior glottic stenosis.
