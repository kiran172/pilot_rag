Title: Portal vein reconstruction in pediatric liver transplantation using end-to-side jump graft: A case report.

Abstract: Attenuated portal vein (PV) flow is challenging in pediatric liver transplantation (LT) because it is unsuitable for classic end-to-end jump graft reconstruction from a small superior mesenteric vein (SMV). We thus introduce a novel technique of an end-to-side jump graft from SMV during pediatric LT using an adult partial liver graft. We successfully performed two cases of end-to-side retropancreatic jump graft using an iliac vein graft for PV reconstruction. One patient was a 2-year-old boy with hepatoblastoma and a Yerdel grade 3 PV thrombosis who underwent split LT. Another patient was an 8-month-old girl who had biliary atresia and PV hypoplasia with stenosis on the confluence level of the SMV; she underwent retransplantation because of graft failure related to PV thrombosis. After native PV was resected at the SMV confluence level, an end-to-side reconstruction was done from the proximal SMV to an interposition iliac vein. The interposition vein graft through posterior to the pancreas was obliquely anastomosed to the graft PV. There was no PV related complication during the follow-up period. Using a jump vascular graft in an end-to-side manner to connect the small native SMV and the large graft PV is a feasible treatment option in pediatric recipients with inadequate portal flow due to thrombosis or hypoplasia of the PV.
