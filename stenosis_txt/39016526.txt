Title: Quantitative flow ratio for the functional assessment of extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In asymptomatic patients presenting with significant internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses undergoing endovascular revascularization, a selective angiography before stenting (CAS) is required. Sometimes, angiographic findings could be discordant from non-invasive assessment and a tool able to evaluate functional relevance of the stenosis could be of value. We sought to evaluate the usefulness of quantitative flow ratio (QFR) as angiography-based tool for functional assessment of ICA stenoses.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 50 asymptomatic patients undergoing CAS. Peak systolic velocity (PSV, cm/s) assessed at color Doppler echocardiography was used to identify significant stenoses (PSV &gt;125 cm/s). At angiography, assessment of ICA stenosis was obtained visually (%DS&lt;inf&gt;VISUAL&lt;/inf&gt;) and according NASCET criteria (%DS&lt;inf&gt;NASCET&lt;/inf&gt;). Stenoses were considered significant if &gt;60%. After exclusion of 20 vessels, QFR, area stenosis (AS, %) and minimal lumen area (MLA, mm2) were obtained in the remaining 80 vessels.
RESULTS: At linear regression analysis, QFR significantly correlated with PSV (r2=0.52, P&lt;0.001) as well as with %DS&lt;inf&gt;NASCET&lt;/inf&gt; (r2=0.68, P&lt;0.001) and %DS&lt;inf&gt;VISUAL&lt;/inf&gt; (r2=0.71, P&lt;0.001). Using PSV as reference, QFR showed good accuracy to predict functionally significant stenosis (AUC=0.98, P&lt;0.001) with a cut-off value of 0.93. As compared with %DS&lt;inf&gt;NASCET&lt;/inf&gt; and %DS&lt;inf&gt;VISUAL&lt;/inf&gt;, QFR showed a significantly higher accuracy (61% vs. 73% vs. 94%, respectively; P&lt;0.05), sensitivity (43% vs. 61% vs. 93%, respectively; P&lt;0.05) and negative predictive value (46% vs. 51% vs. 85%, respectively; P&lt;0.05) for detecting hemodynamically significant ICA stenoses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest the potential benefit of adopting QFR for functional assessment of extracranial ICA stenoses. These data should be validated in larger studies.
