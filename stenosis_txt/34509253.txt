Title: An association between vertebral artery dominance and steno-occlusion of the vertebral artery segments: A retrospective angiographic study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether there was a relationship between steno-occlusion of the vertebral artery (VA) segments and the dominant VA side.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Angiography results of 215 patients (146 men; 69 women) were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The patients were divided into three groups: dominant, non-dominant and co-dominant. These groups were compared according to the presence of steno-occlusion in the vertebral artery segments. The results were evaluatedusing X2, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. For correlation analysis, Spearman's Rho test was used.
RESULTS: The findings showed that 55 of 215 patients (25.6%) had a right dominant VA, and 103 (47.9%) had left dominant VA. There was no significant relationship between dominance and age or gender (p > 0.05). More vertebral artery stenosis (VAS) was found on the dominant side. However, a significant relationship only in the right dominant V1 segment (p = 0.044) was noticed. Hypoplastic VA was detected in 13 patients (6%). Most of the VAs (98.4%, n = 423) arose from the subclavian artery.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found more vertebral artery stenosis on the dominant side than the co-dominant side, especially on the origin of the vertebral arteries. However, it was only significant on the right dominant V1 segment, regardless of age and gender of the patients (p > 0.05).
