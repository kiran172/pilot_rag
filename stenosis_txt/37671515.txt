Title: A Rare Case of Vasospasm Presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome and Leading to Total Occlusion.

Abstract: Coronary vasospasm is characterized by transient and reversible vasoconstriction that can cause myocardial ischemia. Patients with acute coronary syndrome may present to the emergency department with various clinical features, including mortal arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Coronary angiography was performed in a 61-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome due to recurrent angina attacks and dynamic changes in electrocardiography. In the patient whose critical stenosis was not detected in the ﬁrst imaging, angina attack developed before the procedure was terminated. On control imaging, we detected total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery due to coronary vasospasm. After the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin, the total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery due to vasospasm completely resolved and the angina attack relieved. It is uncommon for total stenosis to develop immediately after the coronary angiography observes open coronary arteries. However, if total stenosis is detected in patients with recurrent angina attacks without risk factors, intracoronary nitroglycerin can be administered to appropriate patients before intervention.
