Title: From Tracheal Stenosis to Tracheostomy Displacement: A Case Report on a Seemingly Never-Ending Difficult Airway.

Abstract: We report a case of undiagnosed tracheal stenosis that culminated in acute respiratory failure in an inpatient unit. After failed intubation attempts, the placement of a supraglottic airway resulted in successful ventilation and was followed by a tracheostomy in the operating room. Postoperatively, the tracheostomy tube became accidentally dislodged necessitating emergency measures with eventual reinsertion of a longer tracheostomy tube. We present this case to highlight life-saving airway strategies that may be considered in such emergency situations and propose 2 simple algorithms to guide anesthesiologists in managing similar airway emergencies.
