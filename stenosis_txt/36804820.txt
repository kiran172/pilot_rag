Title: Add-on Effect and Safety of Pharmacopuncture Therapy in the Treatment of Patients with Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recently, Korean Medicine treatment with pharmacopuncture therapy (PPT) has been increasingly used in clinical practice to improve symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PPT in addition to conventional Korean Medicine treatment (CKMT) for the treatment of patients with LSS, compared with CKMT alone.
METHODS: This study is designed as a pragmatic, randomized, two-armed, parallel, stratified (by sex), controlled pilot trial. Forty patients diagnosed with LSS will be randomly allocated to the PPT + CKMT group or the CKMT group. Patients in the two groups will receive treatment two times weekly for 5 weeks. The primary outcome will be the mean change in the 100-mm visual analog scale score from the baseline to the end of treatment (week 5). The secondary outcomes will include the clinically important difference, Zurich Claudication Questionnaire score, self-reported walking capacity, Modified-Modified Schober test, EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level questionnaire, and Patients' Global Impression of Change. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide meaningful data to evaluate the add-on effect and safety of PPT in the medical care of patients with LSS.
