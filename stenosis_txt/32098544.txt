Title: Unique variant of idiopathic intracranial hypertension dural sinus stenting.

Abstract: PURPOSE/AIM OF THE STUDY: To report on the successful treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in a patient with venous sinus stenosis secondary to a persistent occipital-marginal sinus (POMS) utilizing venous sinus stenting.
MATERIALS/METHODS: A 55-year-old female presented with headaches and blurry vision. Ophthalmologic examination demonstrated papilledema. Two lumbar punctures demonstrated opening pressures of 31 and 38 cmH2O and provided temporary symptom relief. Cerebral venography demonstrated hypoplastic bilateral transverse-sigmoid sinuses with dominant drainage through a persistent occipital-marginal sinus (POMS). Multiple enlarged arachnoid granulations resulted in stenosis in the marginal sinus with an 18 mmHg mean pressure gradient across the stenosis.
RESULTS: The decision was made for venous sinus stenting of the POMS. Immediate post-stenting venography demonstrated resolution of the POMS stenosis with flow only into the POMS and a mean pressure gradient across the stenosis normalized to 2 mmHg. Six-month follow-up venography demonstrated continued stent patency and clinical symptoms remained resolved. She has remained symptom free at 18 months.
CONCLUSION: This writing summarizes the utility of endovascular dural sinus stenting and the importance of recognizing the dominant dural sinus drainage route in the treatment of IIH.
