Title: Refractory Hemoptysis Caused by Severe Pulmonary Vein Stenosis after Multiple Catheter Ablations.

Abstract: We herein report a 48-year-old man with a history of chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and repeated hemoptysis after radiofrequency ablation. Contrast tomography showed soft tissue thickening of the left hilar region and left pulmonary vein stenosis. We performed bronchial artery embolization, but the hemoptysis did not disappear, and AF was not controlled. We performed left lung lobectomy and maze procedures since we considered surgical removal necessary as radical treatment. After the surgery, hemoptysis and atrial fibrillation did not recur. Refractory hemoptysis after catheter ablation is rare, but occasionally occurs in patients with severe pulmonary vein stenosis.
