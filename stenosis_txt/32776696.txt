Title: Management of calcified coronary artery bifurcation lesions.

Abstract: Calcified coronary artery bifurcation lesions (CBL) remain a challenge for the interventional cardiologist. Evidence regarding treatment of CBL is minimal. Optimal plaque modification is the most important step prior to stent deployment. Provisional stenting is the preferred strategy for most bifurcation lesions. However, two-stent strategy should be considered for BL with compromised large SB (>2.5 mm) supplying a large territory, >70% SB stenosis and lesions more than 5 mm long. In this contemporary review article, we present a simplified approach to treating CBL and demonstrate the approach to specific case examples using our newly developed mobile application, BifurcAID.
