Title: Neurotropin alleviates cognitive impairment by inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB inflammation signaling pathway in mice with vascular dementia.

Abstract: Vascular dementia (VD) is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Neuroinflammation contributes to pathogenesis of VD. Neurotropin (NTP) is an analgesic that has been shown to suppress inflammation and neural repair. But its effects on VD are still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of NTP in the VD model mice established by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis method. In VD mice, we found that NTP treatment increased cerebral blood flow by Laser speckle imaging, reduced neuron loss by Nissl, HE and immunochemistry staining, attenuated white matter damage by magnetic resonance imaging and ultrastructural damage by transmission electron microscope, improved cognitive functions by new object recognition test and three-chamber test, Y maze test and Morris water maze test, inhibited significantly glial activation by immunofluorescence methods, reduced the expression of TLR4, down-regulated expression of MyD88 and phosphorylation of NF-κB P65, decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα. Further, we showed that administration of a TLR4 inhibitor TAK242 had a similar effect to NTP, while the TLR4 agonist CRX-527 attenuated the effect of NTP in the VD mice. Collectively, our study suggested that NTP alleviates cognitive impairment by inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB inflammation signaling pathway in the VD mice. Thus, NTP may be a promising therapeutic approach and a potential TLR4 inhibitor for VD.
