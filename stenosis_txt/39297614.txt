Title: A Modified Epiglottis-Tongue Root Flap for Postoperative Laryngeal Stenosis in a Cancer Patient with a History of Radiotherapy.

Abstract: Introduction: Cricohyoidoepiglottopexy (CHEP) has emerged as a promising surgical technique for treating laryngeal stenosis, offering a low rate of restenosis and a high rate of successful decannulation. However, postoperative radiation therapy can complicate open surgery for some patients due to radiation-induced cellular and tissue damage. This damage can make adequate exposure or mobilization of the larynx challenging. Case Summary: A 71-year-old male, who had undergone a partial laryngectomy 3 years prior, developed laryngeal stenosis and difficulty plugging after 35 rounds of radiotherapy. Initially, CHEP was planned, but intraoperatively, it was found that traditional CHEP would result in excessive anastomotic tension. To prevent complications, we designed an epiglottis-tongue root flap for laryngeal function reconstruction. The patient experienced no restenosis and was successfully extubated. Discussion: By separating the preepiglottal space and mobilizing the base of the tongue to construct the epiglottis-tongue root flap, modified CHEP can achieve laryngeal function reconstruction in patients postradiotherapy. It is essential to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's overall condition, degree of stenosis, tongue-to-tongue root status, and cervical tissue adhesion before surgery.
