Title: Congenital Left Main Coronary Atresia: Rare Cause of Sudden Cardiac Arrest.

Abstract: A 13-month-old male sustained cardiac arrest under general anesthesia and was found to have left main coronary artery atresia with collateralization from the right coronary artery. After protracted recovery, the patient underwent coronary ostioplasty. Postoperative imaging confirmed patency of the newly established artery without stenosis. At 12 months, no changes in the vessel were noted. Ventricular function remains mildly decreased and stable.
