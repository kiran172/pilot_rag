Title: Carotid Endarterectomy Should Not Be Recommended to End-Stage Kidney Disease Patients with Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic carotid artery disease is advised for patients with low perioperative stroke risk and life expectancy of 3-5 years. We sought to explore the role of risk stratification and postoperative medical management in identifying appropriate asymptomatic candidates for CEA in the end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) population.
METHODS: We identified ESKD patients on dialysis from the United States Renal Data System that underwent CEA (2008-2014) for asymptomatic carotid artery disease. We used the Liu comorbidity index as well as a novel risk prediction model based on Cox proportional hazards model to stratify patients. The primary outcome evaluated was 3-year survival, and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to generate survival estimates. We further conducted a subanalysis of patients with Medicare part D data to determine postoperative usage of the following medications: statins, antiplatelets, and antihypertensives. We evaluated the association of medication utilization and 3-year survival using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards modeling.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1,813 patients meeting inclusion criteria. The population was predominantly older (mean age 70.2 ± 9.1), White (84.8%), and had a high prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension (90.7%), diabetes (62.5%), and congestive heart failure (35.4%). Among the entire cohort, 23.0% had a Liu comorbidity index ≤8, 35.0% had index 9-12, and 42.0% had index >12. Increasing Liu comorbidity index was associated with worse survival (P < 0.01); however, even the group with Liu index ≤8 had poor 3-year survival of 58.8% (53.9-63.4). The Cox proportional hazards model identified variables for inclusion in the risk model such as age >80 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.87-3.33], P < 0.001), congestive heart failure (aHR = 1.31, 95% CI [1.14-1.51], P < 0.001), and Liu comorbidity index >12(aHR = 1.89, 95% CI [1.56-2.28], P < 0.001). The risk score generated ranged from 0 to 6.5, and patients were divided into 3 groups: score ≤2 (43.4%), 2-4 (41.2%), and >4 (15.4%). Increasing risk score was associated with worse survival (P < 0.01) but even the "low-risk" group had 3-year survival of 58.5% (54.9-61.9). Subanalysis of the 1,249 (68.8% of total) patients with part D data found that statins and calcium channel blocker use was associated with improved survival, although observed rates for patients on drug were still low.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall long-term survival of ESKD patients undergoing CEA for asymptomatic carotid artery disease is low. Risk stratification and analysis of postoperative medical management did not identify a subgroup of patients with adequate 3-year survival. Hence, the preventive benefits of CEA are not realized in these patients.
