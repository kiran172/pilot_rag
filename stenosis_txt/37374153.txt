Title: Acute Myocardial Infarction in Patients with Hereditary Thrombophilia-A Focus on Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin G20210A.

Abstract: Factor V (FV) Leiden and prothrombin G20210A are the most common hereditary thrombophilias. While their role in venous thromboembolism is well known, there are still uncertainties regarding their relationship with arterial thrombotic events, especially coronary ones. Our research, based on an in-depth analysis of the available literature, provides up-to-date information on the relationship between FV Leiden and prothrombin G20210A and acute myocardial infarction. FV Leiden and prothrombin G20210A screening should be implemented only in select cases, such as acute coronary syndrome in young individuals and/or in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and/or in the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis at angiography. Their identification should be followed by the implementation of optimal control of modifiable traditional cardiovascular risk factors to reduce the risk of recurrent events and genotyping and genetic counseling of all family members of affected cases for proper prophylaxis. An extended dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) may be considered, given the lower risk of bleeding under DAPT conferred by FV Leiden.
