Title: Endoscopic magnetic compression stricturoplasty for congenital esophageal stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Congenital esophageal stenosis (CES) is a rare malformation of the digestive tract. Endoscopic dilation and thoracotomy have been the main treatments for CES. However, there is no well-defined management protocol. Magnetic compression stricturoplasty (MCS) has been used in refractory esophageal stricture in children after esophageal atresia.
CASE SUMMARY: We describe the first case of MCS for CES in one female child patient. The child (aged 3 years and 1 mo) was admitted due to frequent vomiting and choking after eating complementary food since 7 mo old. Esophagography and gastroendoscopy showed that there was stenosis in the lower esophagus, suggesting a diagnosis of CES. The patient did not receive any treatment for esophageal stricture including surgery or endoscopic dilation procedures before MCS. MCS procedure was smoothly conducted without complications. At 24 mo after MCS, durable esophageal patency without dysphagia was achieved.
CONCLUSION: MCS may serve as an alternative and efficient method for patients with CES.
