Title: Transjugular approach in aspiration thrombectomy and angioplasty of a thrombosed straight arteriovenous graft compared to the direct hemodialysis access approach.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and outcome of the transjugular approach in endovascular recanalization of a thrombosed straight arteriovenous graft (AVG) compared to those of the direct hemodialysis access approach (conventional approach).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed patients who underwent aspiration thrombectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for thrombosed straight AVG performed at a single institution between October 2006 and October 2021. A total of 138 thrombosed AVGs in 83 patients (39 male and 44 females) were divided into the transjugular approach group (Group A) and the conventional approach group (Group B). Technical and clinical success, postintervention primary patency, cumulative patency, and periprocedural complications were compared.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in demographic data between groups A and B. The technical success rate of group A and B was 96.4% (80/83) and 98.2% 54/55, respectively (p > 0.05). The mean procedure time was 61.4 min (Group A) and 70.5 min (Group B) (p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in postintervention primary patency. The cumulative patency of Groups A and B was 911.9 days (range 122-6277) and 1062.3 days (range 72-2302 days), respectively (p > 0.05). One patient in Group B experienced a major graft rupture. Pseudoaneurysm formation at the sheath insertion site occurred in two patients in Group B. No cases of stenosis or thrombosis of the IJV or hematoma at the puncture site were observed in Group A.
CONCLUSION: The transjugular approach is as safe and effective as the conventional approach for aspiration thrombectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of thrombosed straight AVGs.
