Title: Repeat Mitral Valve Interventions After Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair: The COAPT Trial.

Abstract: The frequency and effectiveness of repeat mitral valve interventions (RMVI) after transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) are unknown. We aimed to examine the rate of and outcomes after RMVI after TEER in the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) trial. Only 3.9% of COAPT trial patients required a repeat mitral valve intervention during 4-year follow-up which was successful in 90% of cases but was associated with an increased rate of heart failure (HF) hospitalizations (HFH). The COAPT trial randomized HF patients with severe secondary MR to TEER with the MitraClip device plus guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) versus GDMT alone. We evaluated the characteristics and outcomes of patients who had an RMVI during 4-year follow-up. A MitraClip implant was attempted in 293 patients randomized to TEER+GDMT, 10 of whom underwent an RMVI procedure (9 repeat TEER and 1 surgical mitral valve replacement) after 4 years of follow-up (cumulative incidence 3.90%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08 to 7.08; median 182 days after the initial procedure). Patients with RMVI had larger mitral annular diameters, fewer clips implanted, and were more likely to have â‰¥3+MR at discharge compared with those without RMVI. Reasons for RMVI included failed index procedure because of difficult transseptal puncture (n = 2) or tamponade (n = 1); residual or recurrent severe MR after an initially successful procedure (n = 5); partial clip detachment (n = 1); and site-assessed mitral stenosis (n = 1). RMVI was successful in 8/10 (80%) patients. Patients who underwent RMVI had higher 4-year rates of HFH but similar mortality compared with those without RMVI. The annualized incidence rates of all HFH in patients who underwent RMVI were 234 events per 100 person-years (95% CI 139 to 395) pre-RMVI and 46 per 100 person-years (95% CI 25 to 86) post-RMVI as compared with 32 events per 100 patient-years (95% CI 28 to 36) in patients without RMVI. The rate ratio of HFH was reduced after RMVI in patients who underwent RMVI (0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.45). In conclusion, the cumulative incidence of RMVI after 4 years was 3.9% in patients who underwent TEER for severe secondary MR in the COAPT trial. Patients who underwent RMVI were at increased risk of HFH which was reduced after the RMVI procedure.
