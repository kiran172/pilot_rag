Title: How Much Debulking with Atherectomy is Enough When Treating Infrainguinal Arterial Interventions? The Balance Between Residual Stenosis and Adventitial Injury.

Abstract: Atherectomy is an effective vessel prepping device but not all atherectomy devices are equal. The depth of vessel injury and residual narrowing vary considerably among atherectomy devices with significant implications on outcome. Precision imaging is critical to optimize outcome using atherectomy as a vessel prepping technique. Prospective trials need to test the hypothesis that precision imaging has a significant impact on how operators approach the treatment of infrainguinal arterial disease.
