Title: Endovascular Therapy for Intracranial Giant Cell Arteritis : Systematic Review, Technical Considerations and the Effect of Intra-arterial Calcium Channel Blockers.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis that may cause ischemic stroke. Rarely, GCA can present with aggressive intracranial stenoses, which are refractory to medical therapy. Endovascular treatment (EVT) is a possible rescue strategy to prevent ischemic complications in intracranial GCA but the safety and efficacy of EVT in this setting are not well-described.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify case reports and series with individual patient-level data describing EVT for intracranial GCA. The clinical course, therapeutic considerations, and technique of seven endovascular treatments in a single patient from the authors' experience are presented.
RESULTS: The literature review identified 9 reports of 19 treatments, including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or without stenting, in 14 patients (mean age 69.6 ± 6.3 years). Out of 12 patients 8 (66.7%) with sufficient data had > 1 pre-existing cardiovascular risk factor. All patients had infarction on MRI while on glucocorticoids and 7/14 (50%) progressed despite adjuvant immunosuppressive agents. Treatment was PTA alone in 15/19 (78.9%) cases and PTA + stent in 4/19 (21.1%). Repeat treatments were performed in 4/14 (28.6%) of patients (PTA-only). Non-flow limiting dissection was reported in 2/19 (10.5%) of treatments. The indications, technical details, and results of PTA are discussed in a single illustrative case. We report the novel use of intra-arterial calcium channel blocker infusion (verapamil) as adjuvant to PTA and as monotherapy, resulting in immediate improvement in cerebral blood flow.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment, including PTA with or without stenting or calcium channel blocker infusion, may be effective therapies in medically refractory GCA with intracranial stenosis.
