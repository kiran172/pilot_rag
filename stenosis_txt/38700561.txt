Title: Contributions of endoscopic ultrasonography-guided tissue acquisition (EUS-TA) to the diagnostics of biliary stricture and gallbladder lesions.

Abstract: Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) provides high spatial resolution and more detailed images than other diagnostic modalities. Furthermore, EUS-guided tissue acquisition (EUS-TA), such as EUS-guided fine needle aspiration or biopsy (EUS-FNA/FNB), is an indispensable tool in pancreaticobiliary disease diagnostics, supporting a conclusive pathological diagnosis. In this review, we evaluate the current status and the usefulness of EUS-TA for the diagnostics of the following biliary tract diseases: (A) biliary stricture diagnostics, (B) biliary tract cancer (BTC) itself, and (C) staging of advanced BTC. Previous reports have shown that EUS-FNA for biliary lesions is a safe procedure that is useful in differentiating biliary cancer from benign lesions and in the staging of BTC. On the other hand, the diagnostic performance of EUS-TA for bile duct lesions is reported to be similar to that of transpapillary biopsy. Overall, EUS-TA for biliary lesions may be a safe and effective method, but it should be performed with an understanding of the risk of serious adverse events such as bile leakage and peritoneal dissemination of cancer. It is recommended for distal biliary stricture lesions for which endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography cannot confirm the diagnosis or gallbladder lesions if they do not require the needle to pass through the biliary lumen.
