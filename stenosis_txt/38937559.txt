Title: Evaluation of the outcomes of biliary-enteric reconstruction in robotic radical resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma: a single-center propensity score matching analysis.

Abstract: Although robotic radical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) has been reported in some large hepatobiliary centers, biliary-enteric reconstruction (BER) remains a critical step that hampers the operation's success. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and quality of BER in robotic radical resection of HCCA and propose technical recommendations. A retrospective study was conducted on patients with HCCA who underwent minimally invasive radical resection at Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital between January 2016 and July 2023. A 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM), widely used to reduce selection bias, was performed to evaluate the outcomes, especially BER-related data, between the robotic and laparoscopic surgery. Forty-six patients with HCCA were enrolled; ten underwent robotic-assisted resection, while the others underwent laparoscopic surgery. After PSM at a ratio of 1:2, 10 and 20 patients were assigned to the robot-assisted and laparoscopic groups, respectively. The baseline characteristics of both groups were generally well-balanced. The average liver resection time was longer in the robotic group than in the laparoscopic group (139.5 ± 38.8 vs 108.1 ± 35.8 min, P = 0.036). However, the former had less intraoperative blood loss [200 (50-500) vs 310 (100-850) ml], despite no statistical difference (P = 0.109). The number of residual bile ducts was 2.6 ± 1.3 and 2.7 ± 1.2 (P = 0.795), and anastomoses were both 1.6 ± 0.7 in the two groups (P = 0.965). The time of BER was 38.4 ± 13.6 and 59.1 ± 25.5 min (P = 0.024), accounting for 9.9 ± 2.8% and 15.4 ± 4.8% of the total operation time (P = 0.001). Although postoperative bile leakage incidence in laparoscopic group (40%) was higher than that in robotic group (10%), there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.204); 6.7 ± 4.4 and 12.1 ± 11.7 days were observed for tube drawing (P = 0.019); anastomosis stenosis and calculus rate was 10% and 30% (P = 0.372), 0% and 15% (P = 0.532), respectively. Neither group had hemorrhage- or bile leakage-related deaths. Robotic radical resection for HCCA may offer perioperative outcomes comparable to conventional laparoscopic procedures and tends to be advantageous in terms of anastomosis time and quality. We are optimistic about its wide application in the future with the improvement of surgical techniques and experience.
