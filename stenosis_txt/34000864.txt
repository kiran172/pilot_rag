Title: Staged angioplasty: A sensible approach to prevent hyperperfusion syndrome after carotid artery stenting? A meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether staged angioplasty (SAP) is a safe and effective treatment to prevent hyperperfusion syndrome after carotid artery stenting (CAS).
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed according to established criteria to identify eligible articles published before October 2020. Pooled dichotomous data were presented as odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect models. The efficacy endpoints were hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS), hyperperfusion phenomenon (HPP), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The safety endpoint was post-procedural thromboembolic events. The feasibility of the procedure was assessed by device-related adverse events (vessel dissection and failed angioplasty) in SAP.
RESULTS: Ten studies (1030 participants) were eligible. SAP was superior to regular CAS in preventing HPS (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.14-0.86, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in the rate of thromboembolic events between the SAP group and the regular CAS group. The rates of vessel dissection and failed angioplasty with the use of a 3.0-mm-diameter balloon were 5.4% and 0.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: SAP may reduce the incidence of post-CAS HPS without increasing procedure-related complications. A 3.0-mm-diameter balloon used in SAP may be appropriate for Asian populations. However, the confounded study design and confused definitions of reporting items hinder the current recommendation of SAP in clinical use.
