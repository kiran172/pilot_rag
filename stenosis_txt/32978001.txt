Title: Fetal bladder outflow obstruction: Interventions, outcomes and management uncertainties.

Abstract: Fetal lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) is classically based on prenatal ultrasound identification of a dilated/ thick-walled bladder, bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated ureters and a dilated posterior urethra (also known as the "keyhole sign") in a male fetus. Although the most common underlying diagnosis is posterior urethral valves, the prenatal appearance may be similar with urethral atresia or stenosis, the Prune-Belly Syndrome, or even a cloacal anomaly in a female. These conditions form part of the Congenital Anomalies of Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT) spectrum, which is the commonest cause of end-stage renal disease in children. Although it is difficult to predict postnatal renal function from the prenatal appearance, studies have recently identified predictive features (based on ultrasound findings and fetal biochemistry), and established staging systems to assist with counselling, and, where indicated, patient selection for in-utero intervention. Current in-utero therapy includes amnio-infusion, vesico-amniotic shunting, and fetal cystoscopy with valve ablation or urethral stenting. Postnatal survival and renal functional outcomes, complications and management uncertainties are described, highlighting areas of future development.
