Title: Two cases of bronchial anthracofibrosis combined with tuberculosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bronchial anthracofibrosis is a common disease that has been reported in the past. We aim to summarize the clinical characteristics of bronchial anthracofibrosis combined with tuberculosis infection to reduce missed diagnosis.
METHODS: The clinical features of two cases of bronchial anthracofibrosis combined with tuberculosis were analyzed retrospectively, and relevant studies were reviewed.
RESULTS: The two patients were both elderly individuals who presented with chronic cough and expectoration. Pigmentation in the bronchus mucosa and stenosis of lumen were observed during bronchoscopy. Tuberculosis infection was confirmed by biopsy. The symptoms were remarkably relieved and no recurrence was found after anti-tuberculosis treatment.
CONCLUSION: Bronchial anthracofibrosis may be combined with tuberculosis. To avoid misdiagnosis, we should be aware of possible tuberculosis infection when patients are diagnosed with bronchial anthracofibrosis.
