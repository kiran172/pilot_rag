Title: Foundations of the Diagnosis and Management of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension and Pulsatile Tinnitus.

Abstract: Venous sinus stenosis has garnered increasing academic attention as a potential etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The complex anatomy of the cerebral venous sinuses and veins plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of these conditions. Venous sinus stenosis, often found in the superior sagittal or transverse sinus, can lead to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and characteristic IIH symptoms. Stenosis, variations in dural venous anatomy, and flow dominance patterns contribute to aberrant flow and subsequent PT. Accurate imaging plays a vital role in diagnosis, and magnetic resonance (MR) venography is particularly useful for detecting stenosis. Management strategies for IIH and PT focus on treating the underlying disease, weight management, medical interventions, and, in severe cases, surgical or endovascular procedures. Recently, venous sinus stenting has gained interest as a minimally invasive treatment option for IIH and PT. Stenting addresses venous sinus stenosis, breaking the feedback loop between elevated ICP and stenosis, thus reducing ICP and promoting cerebrospinal fluid outflow. The correction and resolution of flow aberrances can also mitigate or resolve PT symptoms. While venous sinus stenting remains an emerging field, initial results are promising. Further research is needed to refine patient selection criteria and evaluate the long-term efficacy of stenting as compared to traditional treatments.
