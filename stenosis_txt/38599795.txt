Title: Percutaneous biliary stent removal for benign biliary stricture post hepaticojejunostomy.

Abstract: This case report presents the percutaneous extraction of a biliary stent in a patient with a history of liver transplant and Whipple procedure, suffering from benign biliary stricture post hepaticojejunostomy. After failed management with conventional benign biliary protocol, a fully covered WallFlex biliary stent was percutaneously placed and later removed using a balloon catheter technique. The procedure demonstrated anastomosis patency without complications, providing a drain-free option for complex anatomy where endoscopic management was not feasible. This case contributes valuable insights to the limited literature on percutaneous stent removal for benign biliary strictures, emphasising the importance of considering alternative approaches in challenging clinical scenarios.
