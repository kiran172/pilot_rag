Title: Bilateral Axillo-Brachial Artery Stenosis Following Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) Vaccination Against Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19).

Abstract: The following case report is an overview of an unusual presentation of bilateral axillo-brachial artery occlusion following messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccination against severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (COVID-19). A 64-year-old female presented with symptoms initially consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica five weeks following the first booster of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. She was successfully treated with prednisone therapy; however, despite the normalization of inflammatory markers, she later presented with bilaterally occluded axillo-brachial arteries. She successfully underwent endovascular management for the treatment of her symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of chronically occluded bilateral axillo-brachial artery disease following mRNA vaccination for COVID-19 successfully treated with endovascular therapy. The unusual pathogenesis of upper extremity arterial disease is reviewed and a review of endovascular treatment options is presented. A literature review of the types of vasculitis seen following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination is also presented.
