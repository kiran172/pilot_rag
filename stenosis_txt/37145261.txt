Title: Late outflow graft stenosis of left ventricular assist device and endovascular treatment.

Abstract: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) systems are preferred as a bridging to transplantation or as a destination therapy in the treatment of end-stage heart failure. LVAD-related complications are seen in different clinical variations with the widespread use of LVADs. Some of these complications are seen as related to outflow graft, such as graft stenosis, graft kinking and graft thrombosis. Outflow graft complications have a direct impact on LVAD flow rate and acutely impair the clinical condition of patients. Treatment modalities include surgical approach, endovascular approach, and medical approach. In this case report, we aim to share a 57-year-old male patient, who had outflow graft stenosis near the anastomosis line between ascending aorta and the left ventricular assist device outflow graft, and the endovascular treatment.
