Title: [MINOCA and Coronary Ectasia: a rare combination of causes of infarction].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: to describe a patient with myocardial ischemia with multiple causes.
CLINICAL CASE: This clinical case describes a 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, COPD and previous myocardial infarction (AMI). He went to the emergency room with chest pain and dyspnea. Findings included bibasal crackles, electrocardiogram with old anterior fibrosis, elevated NT-ProBNP, and echocardiogram with septoapical akinesia. During hospitalization, he experienced tachyarrhythmia and hemodynamic deterioration, undergoing electrical cardioversion (CVE). Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) complicated with ventricular arrhythmia and acute pulmonary edema was diagnosed. Coronary angiography revealed coronary ectasias without obstructive lesions, but with mild stenosis in three vessels. The patient was successfully treated with non-invasive ventilation, diuretics, vasodilators and anticoagulation. The discharge was granted with the plan to further studies to optimize and guide treatment and finally the diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Arteries (MINOCA) and the presence of coronary ectasias was addressed.
CONCLUSION: it is important to highlight the non-ischemic causes in MINOCA and the association between coronary ectasia and cardiovascular events, which is why we emphasize the need for more studies to better understand the relationship between these phenomena.
