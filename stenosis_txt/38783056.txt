Title: Evaluation of short and mid-term clinical outcomes in patients with aortic coarctation treated with self-expandable stents.

Abstract: The present study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of percutaneous treatment of aortic coarctation using self-expandable uncovered Nitinol stents. We conducted a retrospective clinical data review of all patients with aortic coarctation and treated with self-expandable uncovered Nitinol stents at our institution between 2009 and 2019. The gradient pressure across the coarctation site was measured using aortography. Follow-up echocardiography and computed tomography angiography were performed to assess possible stent complications. A total of 127 stents were successfully implanted in 125 patients (64.8% males) with a mean age of 35.36 ± 11.9 years. The gradient across the coarctation site decreased significantly from 67.48 ± 14.79 to 5.04 ± 3.01 mmHg (P < 0.001) after self-expandable stent implantation. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased significantly from 175.53 ± 15.99 to 147.22 ± 12.83 mmHg (P < 0.001) after self-expandable stenting. There were no major technical or clinical complications, including balloon rupture, aneurysmal formation, infection, secondary stent migration, thrombosis, death during the procedure, and in-hospital mortality. On a mean follow-up of 48 ± 23.6 months (12-120 months), the gradient [from 59.43 ± 15.42 to 3.72 ± 1.38 mmHg (P < 0.001)] and SBP [from 175.53 ± 15.99 to 127.99 ± 7.82 mmHg (P < 0.001)] decreased significantly. There was no mortality, aneurysmal formation in the stent site, dislocation, or aortic re-stenosis requiring intervention during mid-term follow-up. Treatment of aortic coarctation using a self-expandable uncovered nitinol stent is safe and effective with promising mid-term outcomes.
