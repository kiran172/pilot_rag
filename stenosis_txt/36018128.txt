Title: Clinical profile and ophthalmological manifestations of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults at a tertiary care center in India: A cross-sectional study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Our aim was to describe the clinical profile of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), assess ophthalmological manifestations, and correlate grade of papilledema with optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure.
METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study. Patients between 18 and 60 years, diagnosed with IIH using modified Dandy criteria were included. Demographic details, ocular symptoms and signs were noted and papilledema graded. Ocular investigations such as B-scan ONSD and perimetry findings were noted for analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 32 patients of mean age 35.25(±9.57) years with a predominantly female population (96.9%). Mean BMI was 28.12(±5.32) kg/m2. Common presenting complaint was headache (87.5%). The most common gynecological disorder was dysmenorrhea (15.6%). Vitamin D deficiency (46.9%) was a biochemical abnormality seen. Most patients had BCVA 6/6 (62.5%). Lateral rectus palsy was present in 12.5%. Papilledema was present in 81.3% eyes with 31.3% Grade I. There was visual field loss in 53.1%, with 20.3% Grade I. Mean CSF opening pressure was 376.3(±191.51) mmH<sub>2</sub>O. MRI showed empty sella (34.4%) and tortuous optic nerve (18.8%). MRV showed transverse sinus stenosis (52.4%) as common abnormality. There was significant correlation between grade of papilledema and B-scan ONSD. No correlation was seen between CSF opening pressure and ONSD, grade of papilledema and grade of visual field defect and CSF opening pressure with BMI.
CONCLUSION: Clinical profile of patients with IIH was an overweight female of child-bearing age with headache. Visual field examinations are essential in management and follow-up. B-scan ONSD is useful to quantify raised ICP.
