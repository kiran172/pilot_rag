Title: A new intravascular ultrasound-guided stenting strategy compared with angiography on stent expansion and procedural outcomes in patients with positive lesion remodeling.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We investigated the role of a new intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided stenting strategy versus angiography on optimal stent expansion (OSE) and procedural outcomes in patients with positive lesion remodeling.
BACKGROUND: There are no IVUS criteria on how to achieve OSE.
METHODS: A total of 100 patients were assigned to a new IVUS-guided stenting strategy (IVUS group) versus angiography-guided stenting (Angio group). In the IVUS group, among patients with positive lesion remodeling, defined as a remodeling ratio (RR; lesion external elastic membrane (EEM) area/distal reference EEM area) >1.05, the stent was expanded with a balloon sized to the distal reference EEM diameter. In the Angio group, the stent was expanded by visual estimation. In both groups, IVUS was performed after postdilation.
RESULTS: Minimum stent area (MSA) and stent volume index were significantly larger in the IVUS versus Angio group (7.1 ± 1.9 vs. 5.9 ± 1.5 mm2 , and 8.7 ± 2.1 vs. 7.5 ± 1.8 mm3 /mm, respectively; p &lt; .01). The percentages of OSE, defined as an MSA ≥5.4 mm2 , MSA ≥90% of distal reference lumen area (DRLA), or MSA &gt; DRLA, were significantly higher in the IVUS versus Angio group (80 vs. 56%, 78 vs. 54%, and 71 vs. 38%, respectively; p &lt; .01). Stent underexpansion, malapposition, and residual reference segment stenosis were significantly higher in the Angio versus IVUS group (44 vs. 12%, 16 vs. 4%, and 12 vs. 0%, respectively; p &lt; .05). In the IVUS group, owing to positive remodeling, there was no incidence of dissection or perforation.
CONCLUSIONS: This new strategy of IVUS-guided stenting in patients with positive lesion remodeling, compared with angiography, significantly increased stent expansion and decreased stent underexpansion, malapposition, and residual reference segment stenosis with no complications.
