Title: Challenges and Opportunities in Developing Tracheal Substitutes for the Recovery of Long-Segment Defects.

Abstract: Tracheal resection and reconstruction procedures are necessary when stenosis, tracheomalacia, tumors, vascular lesions, or tracheal injury cause a tracheal blockage. Replacement with a tracheal substitute is often recommended when the trauma exceeds 50% of the total length of the trachea in adults and 30% in children. Recently, tissue engineering and other advanced techniques have shown promise in fabricating biocompatible tracheal substitutes with physical, morphological, biomechanical, and biological characteristics similar to native trachea. Different polymers and biometals are explored. Even with limited success with tissue-engineered grafts in clinical settings, complete healing of tracheal defects remains a substantial challenge due to low mechanical strength and durability of the graft materials, inadequate re-epithelialization and vascularization, and restenosis. This review has covered a range of reconstructive and regenerative techniques, design criteria, the use of bioprostheses and synthetic grafts for the recovery of tracheal defects, as well as the traditional and cutting-edge methods of their fabrication, surface modification for increased immuno- or biocompatibility, and associated challenges.
