Title: Evaluation of the right atrial phasic functions in patients with anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that changes in left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions may affect right atrial (RA) phasic functions. We aimed to evaluate RA phasic functions in the presence of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (ASTEMI) as an acute event and to compare the findings with those in a control group.
METHODS: We recruited 92 consecutive ASTEMI patients without accompanying significant stenosis in the proximal and middle parts of the right coronary artery and 31 control subjects, matched for age, sex, diabetes, and hypertension. RA phasic functions were evaluated concerning their longitudinal 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography-derived markers. The ASTEMI group was followed up for all-cause mortality or reinfarction.
RESULTS: In the ASTEMI group, RA strain was reduced during the reservoir (33.2% ± 4.3% vs 30.5% ± 8.1%; P = 0.021) and conduit (16% [12-18%] vs 14% [9-17%]; P = 0.048) phases. The other longitudinal 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography-derived markers of RA phasic functions were not different between the 2 groups. RA strain and strain rate during the contraction phase were predictive of all-cause mortality or reinfarction (hazard ratio = 0.80; P = 0.024 and hazard ratio = 0.39; P = 0.026, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography, in the ASTEMI group, compared with the control group, RA reservoir and conduit functions were reduced, while RA contraction function was preserved. RA contraction function was predictive of all-cause mortality or reinfarction during the follow-up period.
