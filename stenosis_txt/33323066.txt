Title: A new treatment paradigm for phlegmasia cerulea dolen: Single stage endovascular pharmacomechanical thrombectomy with venoplasty and stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Phlegmasia Cerulae Dolen (PCD) is potentially a lethal disease but there is currently no established treatment algorithm for it. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of single stage endovascular pharmacomechanical thrombectomy with venoplasty and stenting in the treatment of PCD.
METHOD: This was a retrospective single centre observational study of consecutive patients who underwent endovascular intervention for the treatment of PCD between June 2016 and March 2020. Clinical and procedural details were recorded. Procedural and clinical success rate, procedural complications, and 30 days mortality were reported.
RESULT: 11 patients were treated during the study period. 2 (18.2%) had active malignancy. 63.6% were uncomplicated PCD on presentation. Common iliac vein compression or stenosis were demonstrated in all patients. Venous stents were implanted in all cases and procedures were successful in all cases. All patients had symptoms improvement at 72 hours post procedure. Other than 2 major bleeding complications, there was no other adverse event. The 30 days mortality was 18.2%. Active malignancy and the presence of anaemia were significantly associated with major complications.
CONCLUSION: Single stage endovascular thrombectomy and stenting was effective and safe in the treatment of patients with PCD. Common Iliac vein compression was a common underlying cause of PCD.
