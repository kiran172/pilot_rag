Title: Predictors of multiple dilations and functional outcomes after total laryngectomy and laryngopharyngectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Following total laryngectomy (TL) or laryngopharyngectomy (TLP), patients may develop strictures that require multiple dilations to treat. However, the risk factors associated with dysphagia refractory to a single dilation are unknown.
METHODS: Single-institution retrospective review of patients who underwent at least one stricture dilation after TL/TLP between March 2013 and March 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 49 patients underwent stricture dilation after TL/TLP. Thirty-five (71%) underwent multiple dilations. Pharyngocutaneous fistula, primary chemoradiation therapy, and a shorter time interval from TL/TLP to first dilation were independently associated with dysphagia requiring multiple dilations. Patients in the multiple dilations group had a higher rate of limited diet and G-tube dependence compared to patients in the single dilation group.
CONCLUSIONS: Shorter time interval to stricture formation is a prognostic indicator of the need for multiple dilations following TL/TLP. Patients requiring multiple dilations are at increased risk of persistent dysphagia long-term.
