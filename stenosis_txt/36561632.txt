Title: Acquired benign tracheo‑oesophageal fistula secondary to oesophageal stenting for post lye ingestion stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Acquired benign trachea-oesophageal fistula is a rare benign pathological entity with varying aetiologies that most often occurs post-intubation. This case report presents the case of a female patient, 31 years old, admitted to the emergency room with sepsis syndrome following bilateral aspiration pneumonia caused by a large trachea-oesophageal fistula. The fistula was the result of intra-tracheal migration of an oesophageal stent placed for post lye ingestion stenosis. Esophageal diversion and partial resection with oesophageal patch to repair the tracheal defect, under general anaesthesia with ventilation using rigid bronchoscopy and high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV), followed at a later date by esophageal replacement with colic graft were the procedures performed with a view to curing the patient. In conclusion, complex cases always require a tailored approach. It is important to note that HFJV may be applied for a longer period of time and the oesophagus can be used as patch for the posterior tracheal wall in selected cases. Staged surgery is also an option when the patients' poor health status does not permit major surgery.
