Title: Risk Factors and Outcome of Portal Vein Thrombosis After Laparoscopic and Open Hepatectomy for Primary Liver Cancer: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Post-hepatectomy portal vein thrombosis (PH-PVT) is a severe complication. The risk factors of PH-PVT after laparoscopic and open hepatectomy have not been clarified yet. We aimed to retrospectively investigate the risk factors and outcome of PH-PVT in patients with primary liver cancer.
METHODS: We enrolled 622 consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy in our hospital between January 2006 and August 2016.
RESULTS: Of 21 patients (3.4%) with PH-PVT, 7 had grade I; 13, grade II; and 1, grade III. The patients with PH-PVT were significantly older than those without PH-PVT. Of the 413 patients who underwent open hepatectomy, those who underwent a major right hepatectomy (4.1%) had a slightly higher incidence of PH-PVT. Of the 209 patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy, those who underwent a left lateral sectionectomy (21.2%) and major right hepatectomy (16.7%) had high incidence rates of PH-PVT. The treatment was only observation in five patients, medication with an antithrombotic drug in 15 patients, and reoperation in one patient. PH-PVT diminished in 17 patients. Cavernous transformation and/or stenosis of the portal vein developed in three patients. The patient with grade III PH-PVT after open right hemihepatectomy underwent reoperation but died of hepatic failure.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that patient age, left lateral sectionectomy were risk factors of PH-PVT. Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy and major right hepatectomy might bring about relatively higher risk of PH-PVT. Major right hepatectomy tends to lead to severe PH-PVT. Careful handling of the PV during hepatectomy and early treatment of PH-PVT are necessary.
