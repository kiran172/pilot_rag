Title: [Tianma Gouteng Decoction regulates MFN2 expression to delay vascular aging in spontaneously hypertensive rats].

Abstract: We studied the effect of Tianma Gouteng Decoction on vascular aging in spontaneously hypertensive rats(SHRs) to explore the molecular mechanism of the decoction in improving arterial vascular aging by regulating the expression of mitofusin 2(MFN2).Twenty 64-weeks-old SHRs were randomly assigned into the aging group and the treatment group(Tianma Gouteng Decoction 5.48 mg·kg~(-1)).Wistar-Kyoto(WKY) rats of 64 weeks old were taken as the normal group and SHR rats of 14 weeks old as the young group.The intervention with Tianma Gouteng Decoction lasted for 12 weeks.We then employed HE staining and Masson staining to observe the morphology of thoracic aorta under an electron microscope and measured the malondialdehyde(MDA) content, superoxide dismutase(SOD) activity, respiratory chain complex Ⅲ level, and thioredoxin peroxidase(TPX) activity.The vascular aging was detected via the biomarker senescence-associated beta-galactosidase(SA-β-Gal).The expression levels of MFN2 and aging marker proteins silent information regulator 1(SIRT1), Klotho, p21, and p53 in thoracic aorta were detected by immunohistochemistry/fluorescence, qRT-PCR, and Western blot.Compared with the young group and the normal group, the aging group had risen blood pressure, lumen stenosis caused by thickened intima of blood vessels, decreased SOD and TPX activities, increased MDA and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex Ⅲ levels, down-regulated expression of MFN2, SIRT1, and Klotho, and up-regulated expression of p21 and p53(P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05).The treatment with Tianma Gouteng Decoction significantly lowered blood pressure, mitigated vascular intimal thickening, increased SOD and TPX activities, and decreased MDA and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex Ⅲ levels, thus alleviating vascular aging.At the same time, the decoction up-regulated the expression of MFN2, SIRT1, and Klotho, while down-regulated that of p21 and p53(P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.05).In summary, Tianma Gouteng Decoction can significantly delay the vascular aging in hypertension.Specifically, it may up-regulate the expression of MFN2 and regulate the expression of aging-related proteins to alleviate oxidative stress.
