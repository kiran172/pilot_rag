Title: The Sky Is Not Falling: Surgical Perspectives on a New Transcatheter Paradigm.

Abstract: The role of cardiac surgeons in the treatment of aortic valve disease is changing with the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Recent trials in patients at low surgical risk will further this paradigm shift, and the future cardiac surgeons in this space remain uncertain. In this Viewpoint article, we discuss the role that surgeons can play in the future of structural heart medicine. We examine the potential effects of the low-risk transcatheter aortic valve replacement trials on overall operative volumes and how these effects may be limited through structured training programs and strong collaboration within the heart team. Finally, future considerations and cautions for the cardiac surgical community are discussed. The coming era presents an opportunity for growth, leadership, and strong interdisciplinary collaboration for the cardiac surgery community.
