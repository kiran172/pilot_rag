Title: Stent-grafts are the best way to treat complex in-stent restenosis lesions in the superficial femoral artery: 24-month results from a multicenter randomized trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This clinical trial aims to evaluate the outcome (up to 24-months) of the treatment of in-stent restenotic or reoccluded lesions in the femoropopliteal arteries, by comparing the treatment of the GORE® VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis with PROPATEN Bioactive Surface (W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) with a standard PTA treatment. The primary effectiveness endpoint of the study is the primary patency at 12 months, defined as no evidence of restenosis or occlusion within the originally treated lesion based on color-flow duplex ultrasound (PSVR≤2.5) and without target lesion revascularization (TLR) within 12 months. The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects who experience serious device-related adverse events within 30 days postprocedure.
METHODS: A total of 83 patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria have been enrolled in this prospective, randomized, multicenter, controlled study in 7 sites between June 2010 and February 2012. Patients with an in-stent restenosis lesion in the femoropopliteal region and a Rutherford classification from 2 to 5 could be enrolled. After screening, the patient was randomized to either treatment with the GORE® VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis with PROPATEN Bioactive Surface or treatment with a standard PTA balloon. After the index procedure, follow-up visits at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months were required. A color flow Doppler ultrasound was performed on all follow-up visits and a quantitative vascular angiography at the 12-month follow-up visit.
RESULTS: In the VIABAHN® group, 39 patients (74.4% male; mean age 67.69±9.77 years) were enrolled and in the PTA group, 44 patients (72.7% male; mean age 68.98±9.71 years) were enrolled, which is comparable for both treatment groups. In the VIABAHN® group, 34 (87.2%) patients presented with claudication (Rutherford 2 and 3) and 5 (12.8%) patients had critical limb ischemia (Rutherford 4 and 5). In the PTA group, 36 (81.8%) patients were claudicants (Rutherford 2 and 3) and 8 (18.2%) presented with critical limb ischemia (Rutherford 4 and 5). The 12-month primary patency rates were 74.8% for the VIABAHN® group and 28.0% for the PTA group (P&lt;0.001). No patients were reported to have device-related serious adverse events within 30 days postprocedure. The primary patency rate for the 24-month follow-up was 58.40% in the Viabahn group and 11.60% in the PTA group (P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis with a VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis shows significantly better results than the treatment with a standard PTA balloon. This demonstrates that the use of the VIABAHN® Endoprosthesis is a very promising tool for the treatment of complex in-stent restenosis.
