Title: Risk factors for hypotension in patients with hemodialysis-associated superior vena cava syndrome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the risk factors for hypotension in patients with hemodialysis-associated superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) and effectiveness of endovascular intervention in hypotension related to SVCS.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 194 maintenance hemodialysis patients diagnosed with SVCS who were admitted to the Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 2019 to December 2021 were selected and divided into a hypotension group and a nonhypotension group. Demographic and clinical data were compared. Hypotension simply refers to blood pressure levels of <90/60 mm Hg on a nondialysis day. All patients received endovascular intervention.
RESULTS: Hypotension was found in 85 of the 194 patients. The following factors were significantly different between the hypotension and nonhypotension groups: body mass index, history of hypertension, tunneled-cuffed catheter as the means of dialysis access, azygos ectasis, SVC stenosis of >70% or occlusion, occlusion at the cavitary junction, serum calcium, diastolic left ventricular (LV) posterior wall thickness, LV end-diastolic volume, stroke output, and LV ejection fraction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension history (OR, 0.314; P = .027), tunneled-cuffed catheter as vascular access (OR, 3.997; P < .001), SVC stenosis of >70% or occlusion (OR, 5.243; P < .001), LV posterior wall thickness (OR, 0.772; P = .044), and serum calcium (OR, 0.146; P = .005) were independent risk factors for hypotension. The mean values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure after intravascular treatment were significantly elevated from those before intervention (P < .001). The primary patency rates of SVC were 66.8%, 58.7%, and 50.0% at 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of hypotension in patients with hemodialysis-associated SVCS is high. The identification of risk factors of hemodialysis-related hypotension provides insight into potential treatment strategies. Endovascular treatment is expected to improve hypotension related to SVCS in hemodialysis patients.
