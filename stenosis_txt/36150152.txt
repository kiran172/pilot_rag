Title: Understanding aortic valve repair through Ozaki procedure: A review of literature evidence.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve neocuspidization (AV Neo) using glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium was first reported by Ozaki et al. in 2007. This technique has become an alternative to tissue and mechanical valve in selected patients as long-term anticoagulation is not required and shows promising midterm results and durability.
METHOD: A comprehensive search was performed on the major database using the search terms "Ozaki technique" AND "Aortic Valve Neocuspidization" AND "AV Neocuspidization" AND "Autologous pericardium" AND "glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium." Articles up to August 1st, 2021 were included in this study.
RESULTS: A total of nine studies with a total of 1342 patients were included. The mean age was 67.36 and 54.23% were male. 66.32% and 23.92% of patients had aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, respectively. 66% of patients had a native tricuspid aortic valve (AV) and 31.37% of patients' native AV was bicuspid. Three studies reported their experience performing AV Neo via ministernotomy.
CONCLUSION: AV Neo can be a suitable alternative to surgical AV replacement in selected patients. The short- and midterm outcomes are comparable without the need for long-term oral anticoagulation. Long-term follow-up data are required for this novel approach to be widely adopted.
