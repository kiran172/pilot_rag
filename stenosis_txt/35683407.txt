Title: Cognitive Functions after Carotid Artery Stenting-1-Year Follow-Up Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The revascularization of carotid arteries minimizes the risk of future cerebral stroke and usually improves cognitive functions. The aim of this study was to assess changes in cognitive function and verify the hypothesis assuming an improvement of selected cognitive functions-psychomotor speed, visuospatial episodic memory, executive function and verbal fluency-in patients after carotid artery stenting during a 12-month follow-up.
METHODS: 47 persons subject to CAS, including 13 symptomatic persons, were examined before and 12 months after a procedure with a psychological test battery (digit symbol test-DS, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test-ROCF, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test-WCST, letter verbal fluency-LVF). Sociodemographic data and clinical parameters were acquired from an author questionnaire.
RESULTS: The one-year follow-up, after the performed CAS procedure, demonstrated a significant improvement of psychomotor speed, visuospatial episodic memory, and executive function. No changes in the area of verbal fluency or decline in any of cognitive functions under analysis were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery stenting improves cognitive functioning, both in the area of basic and more complex cognitive functions in persons with carotid atherosclerosis.
