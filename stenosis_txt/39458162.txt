Title: CT-Derived Patient-Specific Computer Simulation of the Novel Self-Expanding Evolut FX Implantation: A Case Series.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Paravalvular leak and permanent pacemaker implantation remain relevant issues after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Novel device development as well as adequate preprocedural device selection can contribute to optimal outcomes. Methods: Computed tomography-based patient-specific computer anatomical analysis and simulation were used in addition to standard preprocedural preparation in three of the first Evolut FX cases in our center. Procedural and follow-up echocardiographic outcomes are presented. Results: Computed tomography-based computer simulation of Evolut FX resulted in implantation of a different size in one of three cases. In three cases of severe aortic valve stenosis, procedural as well as follow-up outcomes were satisfactory and in line with the simulated results of the chosen strategy. Conclusions: Preprocedural patient-specific computer simulation predicts and guides decision-making in TAVI with the Evolut FX platform. The combination of advanced preprocedural technology and novel technologies continues to contribute to the optimization of TAVI outcomes.
