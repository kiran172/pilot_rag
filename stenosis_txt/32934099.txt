Title: Demographic and Clinical Variables Associated With 30-day Re-Intubation Following Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A retrospective study was performed to evaluate factors associated with 30-d re-intubation following surgical aortic valve repair. We hypothesized a significant increase in the odds of re-intubation among patients with preoperative comorbidities.
METHODS: The American College of Surgery National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2007 to 2016 was used to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with 30-d re-intubation following surgical aortic valve repair. Multivariable logistic regression was used to report factors associated with 30-d re-intubation while controlling for various patient characteristics.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 5,766 adult subjects who underwent surgical aortic valve repair, of whom 258 (4.47%) were re-intubated within 30 d of surgery. The mean ± SD age was 69 ± 12.98 y, and 3,668 (63.6%) were male. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, shortness of breath, poor functional status, COPD, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and bleeding disorder was higher among subjects who were re-intubated compared to those who were not (P &lt; .05). Age, severe COPD, congestive heart failure, and bleeding disorder were associated with this outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Age, COPD, congestive heart failure, and bleeding disorder were associated with 30-d re-intubation in this surgical cohort. If surgical aortic valve repair is deemed non-emergent, patients should be optimized preoperatively and receive careful postoperative planning to reduce the risk of postoperative complications.
