Title: Staged Treatment for an Unusual Case of Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome Caused by Compression of the Celiac and Superior Mesenteric Arteries.

Abstract: We report the unusual presentation of a patient with median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) and compression of both the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). He underwent a staged treatment. First, a laparoscopic release of the median arcuate ligament was performed. In the second stage, due to persistent postprandial pain, the SMA was stented, resulting in complete symptom relief. Recognizing this rare anatomical presentation is very important to avoiding MALS misdiagnosis and providing the appropriate staged treatment.
