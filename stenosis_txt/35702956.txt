Title: Chronic remote ischemic conditioning for symptomatic internal carotid or middle cerebral artery occlusion: A prospective cohort study.

Abstract: AIMS: Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has been demonstrated to reduce recurrent stroke in patients with intracranial artery stenosis. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of RIC in patients with the symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.
METHODS: This study is based on a high-volume single-center prospective cohort study in China, which included patients with symptomatic ICA or MCA occlusion with impaired hemodynamics and receiving chronic RIC. Clinical follow-up visits were performed regularly, and cardio-cerebrovascular events were assessed.
RESULTS: In total, 131 patients (68 with ICA occlusion and 63 with MCA occlusion; mean age, 52.6 ± 13.7 years; stroke, 73.5%; transient ischemic attack TIA, 26.5%) qualified for the analysis; the mean follow-up period was 8.8 years (range, 3-14 years). The compliance of RIC was 95.6 ± 3.7%, and no associated severe adverse events happened. The annual risk of ischemic stroke and ischemic cerebrovascular events was 2.4% and 3.3%, respectively. The cumulative probabilities of ischemic cerebrovascular events and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were 32.8% and 44.8% at 14 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In patients with symptomatic ICA or MCA occlusion with impaired hemodynamics, chronic RIC is well-tolerated, and it appears to be associated with a low annual risk of ischemic stroke and cardio-cerebrovascular events.
