Title: Clinical effects of permanent pacemaker implantation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Insights from the nationwide FRANCE-TAVI registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The influence of permanent pacemaker implantation upon outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains controversial.
AIMS: To evaluate the impact of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI on short- and long-term mortality, and on the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.
METHODS: Data from the large FRANCE-TAVI registry, linked to the French national health single-payer claims database, were analysed to compare 30-day and long-term mortality rates and hospitalization for heart failure rates among patients with versus without permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI. Multivariable regressions were performed to adjust for confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 36,549 patients (mean age 82.6years; 51.6% female) who underwent TAVI from 2013 to 2019 were included in the present analysis. Among them, 6999 (19.1%) received permanent pacemaker implantation during the index hospitalization, whereas 232 (0.6%) underwent permanent pacemaker implantation between hospital discharge and 30days after TAVI, at a median of 11 (interquartile range: 7-18) days. In-hospital permanent pacemaker implantation was not associated with an increased risk of death between discharge and 30days (adjusted odds ratio: 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.64-1.29). At 5years, the incidence of all-cause death was higher among patients with versus without permanent pacemaker implantation within 30days of the procedure (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.19). Permanent pacemaker implantation within 30days of TAVI was also associated with a higher 5-year rate of hospitalization for heart failure (adjusted subhazard ratio: 1.17, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.23).
CONCLUSIONS: Permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI is associated with an increased risk of long-term hospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality. Further research to mitigate the risk of postprocedural permanent pacemaker implantation is needed as TAVI indications expand to lower-risk patients.
