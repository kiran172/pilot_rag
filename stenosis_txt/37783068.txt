Title: Is the type and/or co-existence of degenerative spinal pathology associated with the occurrence of degenerative cervical myelopathy? A single centre retrospective analysis of individuals with MRI defined cervical cord compression.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) arises from spinal degenerative changes injuring the cervical spinal cord. Most cord compression is incidental, referred to as asymptomatic spinal cord compression (ASCC). How and why ASCC differs from DCM is poorly understood. In this paper, we study a local cohort to identify specific types and groups of degenerative pathology more likely associated with DCM than ASCC.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis (IRB Approval ID: PRN10455). The frequency of degenerative findings between those with ASCC and DCM patients were compared using network analysis, hierarchical clustering, and comparison to existing literature to identify potential subgroups in a local cohort (N = 155) with MRI-defined cervical spinal cord compression. Quantitative measures of spinal cord compression (MSCC and MCC) were used to confirm their relevance.
RESULTS: ELF (8.7 %, 95 % CI 3.8-13.6 % vs 35.7 %, 95 % CI 27.4-44.0 %) Congenital Stenosis (3.9 %, 95 % CI 0.6-7.3 % vs 25.0 %, 95 % CI 17.5-32.5 %), and OPLL (0.0 %, 95 % CI 0.0-0.0 % vs 3.6 %, 95 % CI 0.3-6.8 %) were more likely in patients with DCM. Comparative network analysis indicated loss of lordosis was associated with ASCC, whilst ELF with DCM. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis indicated four sub-groups: multi-level disc disease with ELF, single-level disc disease without loss of lordosis and OPLL with DCM, and single-level disc disease with loss of lordosis with ASCC. Quantitative measures of cord compression were higher in groups associated with DCM, but similar in patients with single-level disc disease and loss of lordosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified four subgroups based on degenerative pathology requiring further investigation.
