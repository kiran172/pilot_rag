Title: Norwood Operation of a Neonate With Pentalogy of Cantrell.

Abstract: Surgical correction of Cantrell syndrome is often associated with an extremely high mortality rate due to the possibility of wound infection or the severity of cardiac anomalies. We report a case of Norwood operation and repositioning of the heart successfully performed 1 day after the birth of a neonate with pentalogy of Cantrell. The patient had double-outlet right ventricle, subaortic stenosis, aortic valve stenosis, hypoplastic aortic arch, and coarctation of the aorta. The patient underwent the Glenn operation at the age of 1 year and is now waiting for the Fontan operation.
