Title: [Lichen sclerosus in children].

Abstract: Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. It mainly affects the anogenital area. More knowledge of the disease is needed to avoid delay in diagnosis as early treatment may cure the disease in some and reduce or prevent scarring. Initial treatment for girls and boys comprises the daily application of a potent cortisone ointment for 3 months. After remission the treatment should be continued long-term intermittently. If there is no complete remission in boys complete circumcision is recommended. LS usually cannot be healed but only well suppressed, and also after circumcision recurrences may occur years later. Therefore, patients have to be well informed and should be followed up long-term.
