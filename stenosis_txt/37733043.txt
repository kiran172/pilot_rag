Title: The importance of baseline fractional flow reserve to detect significant coronary artery stenosis in different patient populations.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) assessment compares the blood flow on either side of a blockage in the coronary artery and indicates how severe the stenosis is in the artery. Intravenous adenosine is widely used to achieve conditions of stable hyperaemia for the measurement of FR. However, intravenous adenosine affects both systemic and coronary vascular beds differentially. Therefore, FFR has some limitations, such as the side effects of adenosine and the long procedure time. In addition, there are not enough studies on the evaluation of the baseline ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure (Pd/Pa) according to standard cut-off values in coronary stenosis under special clinical conditions. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic power of the baseline FFR value for critical coronary stenosis and to determine its predictive value in special patient groups.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 158 patients, who were stratified as Q1 (< 0.89), Q2 (0.89-0.92), Q3 (0.93-0.95) and Q4 (> 0.95) based on baseline FFR values. The baseline Pd/Pa value, the change in adenosine FFR and the raw FFR change were recorded. Its predictive value was also calculated for specific patient groups.
RESULTS: The threshold value of baseline FFR level for predicting critical stenosis was ≤ 0.92 with a sensitivity of 92.8% and a specificity of 82% (upper limit of Q2 cartilage). Patients with a baseline FFR value ≤ 0.92 had a 58.4-fold greater likelihood of a critical outcome compared with patients with a baseline FFR value > 0.92 (OR: 58.4; 95% CI: 20.3-124.6). In patients with a baseline FFR ≤ 0.92, the Q1 group had a 10.23-fold higher odds of critical stenosis compared with the Q2 group (OR: 10.23; 95% CI: 2.14-48.84). The same values had similar diagnostic power for all specific patient groups.
CONCLUSION: The baseline FFR value could be used to predict critical coronary stenosis in our patients and had similar value for predicting lesion severity in all the subgroups.
