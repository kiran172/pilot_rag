Title: The dragonfly technique for trachea closure in temporary tracheostomies. Surgical steps and clinical results.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of a new suturing technique called Dragonfly for the closure of temporary tracheotomies. This technique involves placing two sutures during the tracheotomy procedure and leaving them loose and unknotted until the day of skin closure.
METHODS: Retrospective case control study. Monocentric study at a department of Otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at a tertiary centre in Italy. A total of 50 patients who underwent temporary tracheotomy between January 2017 and December 2021. Patients were divided into two groups based on the trachea closure method: traditional closure with sutures placed during the skin closure procedure (Group A) and the Dragonfly technique (Group B). The incidence of tracheal stenosis by Computed Tomography (CT), granulation tissue formation, bleeding, procedure duration, patient discomfort were evaluated.
RESULTS: The incidence of tracheal complications and tracheal stenosis was reduced in Group B (6%) compared to Group A (24%). Procedure times (3 min vs. 6 min) durations was significantly shorter. No patients had symptoms of tracheal stenosis at the end of the procedures.
CONCLUSION: The Dragonfly suturing technique is effective and safe for tracheotomy closure, reducing the incidence of tracheal stenosis and shortening hospitalization duration compared to the traditional method.
