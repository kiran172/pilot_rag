Title: Robotic-assisted sigmoidectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis and endoscopic management of deep infiltrating intestinal endometriosis.

Abstract: Deep endometriosis, defined as external adenomyosis, is a late stage of endometriosis. Associated with very severe pain, in addition to probably being a cofactor of infertility, with a low prevalence, the diagnosis is integrated by high clinical suspicion and confirmed with imaging studies. Deep infiltration can reach sigmoid colon, which would have surgical indication as resolving treatment. We report the case of deep infiltrating endometriosis affecting sigmoid colon of a 42-year-old woman, who was diagnosed with colicky pain in the left lower quadrant and chronic constipation. Colonoscopy revealed a 90% stenosis in the proximal portion of sigmoid colon, as well as mural thickening proximal to the site of stenosis, reported by computed tomography with oral contrast, for which it was decided to perform robot-assisted sigmoidectomy, with a 6-month follow-up and with imaging control, patient continues asymptomatic and without the presence of lesions suggestive of recurrence, and there is no functional impairment.
