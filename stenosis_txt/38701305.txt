Title: Deep learning-based spinal canal segmentation of computed tomography image for disease diagnosis: A proposed system for spinal stenosis diagnosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation was regarded as an age-related degenerative disease. Nevertheless, emerging reports highlight a discernible shift, illustrating the prevalence of these conditions among younger individuals.
METHODS: This study introduces a novel deep learning methodology tailored for spinal canal segmentation and disease diagnosis, emphasizing image processing techniques that delve into essential image attributes such as gray levels, texture, and statistical structures to refine segmentation accuracy.
RESULTS: Analysis reveals a progressive increase in the size of vertebrae and intervertebral discs from the cervical to lumbar regions. Vertebrae, bearing weight and safeguarding the spinal cord and nerves, are interconnected by intervertebral discs, resilient structures that counteract spinal pressure. Experimental findings demonstrate a lack of pronounced anteroposterior bending during flexion and extension, maintaining displacement and rotation angles consistently approximating zero. This consistency maintains uniform anterior and posterior vertebrae heights, coupled with parallel intervertebral disc heights, aligning with theoretical expectations.
CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy assessment employs 2 methods: IoU and Dice, and the average accuracy of IoU is 88% and that of Dice is 96.4%. The proposed deep learning-based system showcases promising results in spinal canal segmentation, laying a foundation for precise stenosis diagnosis in computed tomography images. This contributes significantly to advancements in spinal pathology understanding and treatment.
