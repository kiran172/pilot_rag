Title: Influence of cardiac biomarkers on predicting significant coronary artery disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In this study, our aim was to investigate the role of cardiac biomarkers in predicting the presence of significant coronary artery disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients.
METHODS: The study population was composed of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients who underwent coronary angiography at a single center between June 2021 and March 2023, and whose cardiac biomarkers were evaluated before the procedure. HCM patients were screened retrospectively. Significant CAD was defined as > 50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery or > 70% stenosis in a major coronary vessel. Demographic, echocardiographic and cardiac biomarker values were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 123 patients were evaluated. Significant CAD was detected in 39 (31.7%) patients. Patients with significant CAD had higher CK-MB values than those without CAD [2.8 (2.1-4.0) vs. 3.4 (2.8-4.6), p = 0.036], and a higher level of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) than those without CAD (24 vs. 17.8, p = 0.022). the NT-proBNP/hs-TnT ratio was found to be significantly lower in patients with CAD than in those with CAD (31.4 vs. 21.4, p = 0.019). In multivariate anaylsis, NT-proBNP/hs-TnT was determined as an independent predictor for significant CAD. In ROC analysis, NT-proBNP/hs-TnT ratio lower than the cut-off value of 30.7 could detect the presence of significant CAD with 76.9% sensitivity and 53.6% specificity (AUC: 0.632, 95% CI: 0.528-0.736, p = 0.019).
CONCLUSION: To sum up, we suggest that cardiac biomarkers were valuable and simple parameters in terms of significant CAD in HCM patients.
