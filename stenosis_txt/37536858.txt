Title: Does Carotid Intervention Improve Cognitive Function?

Abstract: Carotid artery disease has been linked to baseline cognitive impairment, even in asymptomatic patients. Therefore, there has been a persistent interest in investigating the impact of carotid revascularization on cognitive functions, but the results have been heterogeneous. Our recent prospective evaluation showed improved cognitive scores across multiple cognitive measures following carotid intervention. Herein, we summarize the studies published to date, identify the potential contributors to the inconsistency of post-interventional cognitive outcomes, and explore further opportunities in cognitive evaluations.
