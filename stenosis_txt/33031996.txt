Title: A novel hybrid stent technique to treat canine pulmonic stenosis.

Abstract: Balloon valvuloplasty is routinely performed in dogs with severe pulmonic stenosis using a transvenous approach. We report a novel transventricular approach to stent the right ventricular outflow tract. An 18-month old Havanese with frequent syncope was referred with a diagnosis of severe valvular pulmonic stenosis. Transvenous approaches were unsuccessful; therefore, two Palmaz XL 29 mm by 12 mm transhepatic biliary stents were deployed across the valve using a direct right ventricular approach. The echocardiographically derived systolic pressure gradient decreased from 133 mmHg to 39 mmHg with resolution of clinical signs. The patient continues to do well after 3 years with occasional syncope when extremely excited despite pressure gradient increases to 130 mmHg at 12 months and 174 mmHg at 22 months.
