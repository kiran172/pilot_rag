Title: Development of antifibrotic therapy for stricturing Crohn's disease: lessons from randomized trials in other fibrotic diseases.

Abstract: Intestinal fibrosis is considered an inevitable complication of Crohn's disease (CD) that results in symptoms of obstruction and stricture formation. Endoscopic or surgical treatment is required to treat the majority of patients. Progress in the management of stricturing CD is hampered by the lack of effective antifibrotic therapy; however, this situation is likely to change because of recent advances in other fibrotic diseases of the lung, liver, and skin. In this review, we summarize data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antifibrotic therapies in these conditions. Multiple compounds have been tested for antifibrotic effects in other organs. According to their mechanisms, they were categorized into growth factor modulators, inflammation modulators, 5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, intracellular enzymes and kinases, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) modulators, and others. From our review of the results from the clinical trials and discussion of their implications in the gastrointestinal tract, we have identified several molecular candidates that could serve as potential therapies for intestinal fibrosis in CD.
