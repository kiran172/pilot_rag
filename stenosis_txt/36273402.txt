Title: Congenital heart defects in monochorionic twin pregnancy complicated by selective fetal growth restriction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence, subtypes and postnatal outcomes of congenital heart defects (CHD) in a cohort of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies complicated by selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR), and to compare this population with a cohort of uncomplicated MCDA pregnancies evaluated during the same period.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all consecutive MCDA pregnancies referred between 2009 and 2018, including those complicated by sFGR (Group A) and those without complications (Group B). All neonates delivered in our center were screened for CHD before discharge. Discharge letters for all those delivered elsewhere were retrieved. Pregnancies with complications other than sFGR and those without perinatal follow-up were excluded. Pregnancies in Group A were divided into three types according to the Gratacós system of sFGR classification.
RESULTS: A total of 870 MCDA twin pregnancies were included: 296 in Group A and 574 in Group B. In Group A, the prevalence of CHD was 3.7% (22/592 twins), with no significant difference in CHD frequency between the three types of sFGR (Type I, 3.7%; Type II, 3.2%; Type III, 4.2%; P = 0.55). Of four Type-III sFGR pregnancies with CHD, one had pulmonary stenosis (PS) in the larger twin and isolated coarctation of the aorta in the smaller cotwin, and three had PS in the larger twin only. No Type-III sFGR pregnancies in which only the smaller twin was affected by CHD were observed. Of 11 CHD cases in the larger twin, 10 (91%) were right ventricular outflow tract abnormalities (RVOTA), and one (9%) was a ventricular septal defect. In the smaller twins, 11 cases of CHD were observed, covering a broad spectrum of cardiac abnormalities. In Group B, the CHD prevalence was 1.1% (13/1148 twins), which was similar to that in the general population, according to the EUROCAT registry for the same period and geographical area of the study (0.96%; P = 0.579). The CHD prevalence was significantly higher in Group A compared with Group B (3.7% vs 1.1%; P = 0.0002; odds ratio, 3.57 (95% CI, 1.78-7.22)). In all pregnancies with CHD in the study population, the anomaly was discordant.
CONCLUSIONS: In MCDA twin pregnancy, sFGR was associated with a three-fold higher prevalence of CHD. Women with such pregnancies should be referred to a tertiary care hospital for pre- and postnatal cardiac evaluation, treatment and long-term follow-up. In larger twins, the only major CHD observed was RVOTA, while a broad spectrum of CHD was noted in smaller twins. The higher risk of CHD in MCDA pregnancies appears to be due to the typical complications of the monochorionic pregnancy, rather than to the monochorionic nature of the pregnancy itself. © 2022 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.
