Title: High-resolution non-contrast free-breathing coronary cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiography for detection of coronary artery disease: validation against invasive coronary angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the single most common cause of death worldwide. Recent technological developments with coronary cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiography (CCMRA) allow high-resolution free-breathing imaging of the coronary arteries at submillimeter resolution without contrast in a predictable scan time of ~ 10 min. The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution CCMRA for CAD detection against the gold standard of invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
METHODS: Forty-five patients (15 female, 62 ± 10 years) with suspected CAD underwent sub-millimeter-resolution (0.6 mm3) non-contrast CCMRA at 1.5T in this prospective clinical study from 2019-2020. Prior to CCMR, patients were given an intravenous beta blockers to optimize heart rate control and sublingual glyceryl trinitrate to promote coronary vasodilation. Obstructive CAD was defined by lesions with ≥ 50% stenosis by quantitative coronary angiography on ICA.
RESULTS: The mean duration of image acquisition was 10.4 ± 2.1 min. On a per patient analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value (95% confidence intervals) were 95% (75-100), 54% (36-71), 60% (42-75) and 93% (70-100), respectively. On a per vessel analysis the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value (95% confidence intervals) were 80% (63-91), 83% (77-88), 49% (36-63) and 95% (90-98), respectively.
CONCLUSION: As an important step towards clinical translation, we demonstrated a good diagnostic accuracy for CAD detection using high-resolution CCMRA, with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The positive predictive value is moderate, and combination with CMR stress perfusion may improve the diagnostic accuracy. Future multicenter evaluation is now required.
