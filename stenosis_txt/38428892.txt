Title: Impact of a clinical care pathway developed through the action research method on the psychological well-being and quality of life in male patients with urethral stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to examine the development of a clinical care pathway utilizing an action research methodology for male patients with urethral stricture, and to assess the psychological and quality of life outcomes following the implementation of this pathway.
METHODS: Ninety patients diagnosed with urethral stricture, admitted to our hospital between May 2021 and May 2022, were selected as the study cohort. Employing a random number method, these patients were allocated into an observation group and a control group, each comprising 45 individuals. The control cohort employs standard care protocols for individuals with urethral stenosis, while the experimental group employs an action research methodology to develop a clinical care pathway specific to the management of patients with urethral stenosis, with an intervention cycle of 3 months. The investigation evaluated the impact of the intervention by scrutinizing pre- and post-intervention data through the utilization of the WHO Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF), in addition to the Anxiety Rating Scale and the Depression Rating Scale.
RESULTS: Prior to the intervention, no significant differences were observed in WHOQOL-BREF scores across dimensions, as well as anxiety and depression scores between the 2 groups (P > .05). Subsequent to the intervention, the patients in the observation group exhibited significantly higher scores across all WHOQOL-BREF dimensions and total scores compared to the control group, with statistical significance (P < .05). Moreover, anxiety and depression scores in the observation group were markedly lower than those in the control group, demonstrating statistical significance (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The implementation of a clinical nursing pathway rooted in action research methodology proves to be an effective strategy for enhancing clinical nursing practices, elevating patient quality of life, and diminishing the prevalence of anxiety and depression.
