Title: Perioperative and Anesthetic Considerations in Shone's Complex.

Abstract: Shone's complex is a congenital cardiac disease consisting of the following four lesions: parachute mitral valve, supravalvar mitral ring, subaortic stenosis, and aortic coarctation. Though not all components are required for a diagnosis, the end result is both left ventricular inflow and outflow obstruction, which typically present in patients as congestive heart failure. The complex pathology requires careful management and surgical decision-making to ensure an optimal outcome. This review will focus on the anatomy, physiology, and perioperative anesthetic management of patients with Shone's complex.
