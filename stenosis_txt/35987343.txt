Title: Edge-to-Edge Technique Used as a Bailout for Suboptimal Mitral Repair: Long-term Results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For cases of initial suboptimal mitral valve repair, the edge-to-edge (EE) technique has been used as a bailout procedure. However the long-term durability of those rescued mitral valves is currently unknown. With this study we aim to evaluate the long-term clinical and echocardiographic results of the EE technique used to rescue patients with initial suboptimal conventional mitral valve repair.
METHODS: A retrospective review of our institutional database was done to query for patients who had undergone mitral valve repair with the EE technique used as a bailout procedure. The cumulative incidence function using death as a competing event was used to estimate cardiac death and redo for mitral valve replacement. To describe the time course of mitral regurgitation, we performed a longitudinal analysis using generalized estimating equations with random intercept for correlated data.
RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were selected. The median follow-up was 9.1 years (interquartile range, 6.7-12.1; maximum, 22.6 years). At 15 years the estimated Kaplan-Meier overall survival was 63.2% Â± 8.69% (95% confidence interval, 43.76-77.46) and the predicted rate of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation recurrence was 16.67%. At 15 years the cumulative incidence function for redo for mitral valve replacement with death as a competing event was 2.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.48-7.84). No case of more than mild mitral stenosis was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: The EE technique can be effectively used as a bailout procedure in patients with suboptimal conventional mitral valve repair with satisfactory long-term results.
