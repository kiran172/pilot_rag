Title: Safety of Contemporary Carotid Artery Stenting and Associated Risk Factors for Treatment of Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prevalence of carotid artery atherosclerosis and stroke is increasing. Carotid artery stenting (CAS), which treats carotid artery stenosis and prevents strokes, has benefited from advances in techniques and technology. In this study, we aimed to identify significant risk factors for major complications following contemporary CAS.
METHODS: Utilizing the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry, we investigated individuals who underwent CAS between the years 2015-2018. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death within 30 days of CAS.
RESULTS: Of the 770 patients within the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry who met study criteria, 3.2% experienced strokes, 1.6% experienced MIs, and 2.2% died within 30 days of CAS. A total of 6.1% of patients experienced any of these major complications. Of the 395 asymptomatic patients, 3.5% suffered a stroke, 1.5% experienced an MI, and 1.0% died for a total of 5.6% patients suffering from any event. Of the 375 symptomatic patients, there were 2.9% strokes, 1.6% MIs, and 3.5% deaths with 6.7% suffering any event. Age, race, and hyponatremia were significantly associated with stroke, and hyponatremia was associated with MI. Age, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, international normalized ratio, and emergency case were associated with death.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that preoperative risk stratification of CAS patients may not be straightforward as each adverse event has its own risk factors, precluding a generalized CAS risk stratification scoring system from being created. This paper can aid in patient selection for CAS by highlighting risk factors in modern CAS.
