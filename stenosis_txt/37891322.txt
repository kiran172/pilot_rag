Title: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells expression of miR-200c, miR-125b, miR-27b, miR-203, and miR-155 in patients with significant or insignificant coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the principal causes of death worldwide. Among several predisposing factors, inflammation and inflammatory genes play a significant role in disease pathogenesis. Inflammatory microRNAs, small noncoding RNAs involved in regulating inflammation, are promising candidates for understanding pathogenesis of CAD and developing diagnostic biomarkers. The aim of the study was to evaluate the alteration of miR-200c, miR-125b, miR-27b, miR-203 and, miR-155 in patients suffering from coronary artery stenosis and insignificant coronary artery stenosis compared to healthy subjects. In this study we compared expressions of five inflammatory miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 72 patients suffering significant coronary artery stenosis (CAD), 74 individuals without coronary artery disease and 30 individuals with insignificant coronary artery stenosis (ICAD). After blood collection, PBMCs were isolated and RNA was extracted. Gene expression levels were assessed by SYBR green based real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using R program. Expression levels of miR-200c, miR-203, and miR-155 were lower in subjects with ICAD than that in CAD patients and subjects of the control group. MiR-125b was downregulated in CAD and ICAD groups compared to the control group. PBMC miR-27b was upregulated in the CAD group as compared to the ICAD and control groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis verified potential of three miRNAs in separating subjects with ICAD from CAD patients and healthy individuals. In conclusion, this original investigation suggested that altered expression of these five miRNAs may serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker discriminating clinical presentations of coronary artery diseases.
