Title: Congenital web of the common bile duct combined with multiple intrahepatic duct stricture: a case report of successful radiological intervention.

Abstract: Congenital web formations are extremely rare anomalies of the extrahepatic biliary tree. We herein report a case of common bile duct septum combined with multiple intrahepatic bile duct strictures in a 74-year-old female patient who was successfully treated with radiological intervention. The patient initially visited the hospital because of upper abdominal pain. Imaging studies revealed multifocal strictures with dilatation in both intra- and extrahepatic ducts; the final clinical diagnosis was congenital common bile duct web combined with multiple intrahepatic duct strictures. Surgical treatment was not indicated because multiple biliary strictures were untreatable, and the disease was clinically diagnosed as benign. The multiple strictures were extensively dilated twice through bilateral percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) for 2 months. After 1 month of observation, PTBD catheters were successfully removed. The patient is doing well at 6 months after completion of the radiological intervention, with the maintenance of normal liver function. Congenital web of the bile duct is very rare, and its treatment may vary depending on the patterns of biliary stenosis. In cases where surgical intervention is not indicated for congenital web and its associated disease, radiological intervention with balloon dilatation can be a viable therapeutic option.
