Title: [Study on the relationship between the morphology of the isthmus of the vestibular aqueduct and Meniere's disease based on 10 μm otology CT].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the morphology of isthmus of the vestibular aqueduct (VA) and its relationship with the occurrence, course of Meniere's disease (MD) and the degree of hearing loss based on 10 μm otology CT. Methods: A total of 13 patients with MD in Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2020 to July 2021, including 4 males and 9 females, age from 16 to 77 (56±16) years, were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent 10 μm otology CT examination. The included lesion side was the MD affected group (14 sides), and the non-lesion side was the MD healthy group (12 sides). According to the 1∶2 side, 16 sex-and side matched cases (28 sides) without external and middle ear disease were included in the control group, including 4 males and 12 females, age from 16 to 77 (56±14) years. The horizontal semicircular canal showed on the largest plane was considered as the standard cross-section, and continuous observation was made on this image. According to the display type of isthmus of the VA, it was divided into Ⅰ to Ⅳ grades. Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare the morphological differences of VA isthmus among the affected group, the healthy group and the control group. The degree of hearing impairment was assessed by pure tone audiometry (PTA) results, which were divided into normal/mild/moderate/moderately severe/severe/extremely severe hearing impairment. Spearman correlation analysis was used to compare the correlation between the morphological rating of VA isthmus on the affected side and age, course of disease and the results of pure tone audiometry (PTA). Results: The proportions of VA isthmic morphology GRADE Ⅰ,Ⅱ,Ⅲ,Ⅳ in the MD affected group were 28.6% (4/14), 42.9% (6/14), 21.4% (3/14), 7.1% (1/14), those in the MD healthy group were 0 (0/12), 33.3% (4/12), 33.3% (4/12), 33.3% (4/12), and those in the control group were 0 (0/28), 7.1% (2/28), 64.2% (18/28), 28.6% (8/28). The VA isthmus scores [M (Q1, Q3)] of MD affected group was lower than that of MD healthy group [2 (1, 3) vs 3 (2, 4)] and control group [2 (1, 3) vs 3 (3, 4)] (all P&lt;0.05, respectively). The morphology of the VA isthmus on the affected side of MD was negatively correlated with age (r=-0.81, P=0.002), and there was no correlation with the course of disease and degree of hearing impairment (r=-0.40, r=-0.26; all P&gt;0.05, respectively). Conclusion: The stenosis of the VA isthmus in MD was a possible anatomical factor for the occurrence of MD.
