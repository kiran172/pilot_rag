Title: State-of-the-art CT and MR imaging and assessment of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease: the reporting-a consensus document by the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR).

Abstract: The European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) is the European specialist society of cardiac and vascular imaging. This society's highest priority is the continuous improvement, development, and standardization of education, training, and best medical practice, based on experience and evidence. The present intra-society consensus is based on the existing scientific evidence and on the individual experience of the members of the ESCR writing group on carotid diseases, the members of the ESCR guidelines committee, and the members of the executive committee of the ESCR. The recommendations published herein reflect the evidence-based society opinion of ESCR. The purpose of this second document is to discuss suggestions for standardized reporting based on the accompanying consensus document part I. KEY POINTS: • CT and MR imaging-based evaluation of carotid artery disease provides essential information for risk stratification and prediction of stroke. • The information in the report must cover vessel morphology, description of stenosis, and plaque imaging features. • A structured approach to reporting ensures that all essential information is delivered in a standardized and consistent way to the referring clinician.
