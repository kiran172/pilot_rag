Title: A Comparison of the Efficacy of Plastic Stent Placement Above and Across the Sphincter of Oddi for Benign Biliary Hilar Stricture.

Abstract: We investigated the efficacy and safety of endoscopic plastic stent (PS) placement for hilar benign biliary strictures (BBSs) and compared cases with PS placement above (inside stent, IS) and across (usual stent, US) the sphincter of Oddi. Patients who underwent initial endoscopic PS placement for hilar BBSs between August 2012 and December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Hilar BBSs in 88 patients were investigated. Clinical success was achieved in 81 of these cases (92.0%), including 38 patients in the IS group and 43 patients in the US group. Unexpected stent exchange (uSE) before the first scheduled PS exchange occurred in 18 cases (22.2%). The median time from first stent placement to uSE was 35 days. There was no significant difference in the rate and median time to uSE between the two groups. The rates of adverse events such as pancreatitis or cholangitis in the two groups did not significantly differ. However, the rate of difficult stent removal in the IS group (15.8%) was significantly higher than that in the US group (0%) (p=0.0019). US placement is preferable to IS placement for scheduled stent exchange, as it offers the same effectiveness and risk of adverse events with easier stent removal.
