Title: Comprehensive clinical outcomes of drug-coated balloon treatment for coronary artery disease. Insights from a single-center experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Some clinical trials have verified the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel drug-coated balloon (DCB) for small vessel coronary artery disease. However, nonsmall vessel and calcified lesions received less attention.
AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of DCB treatment for various types of coronary artery lesions, including not only small vessel disease but also nonsmall vessel disease and calcified lesions. In this real-world clinical practice study, in-stent restenosis was excluded.
METHODS: This study consecutively included 934 patients with 1751 nonstented lesions who received DCB at a cardiovascular center in Kyoto Katsura Hospital in Japan between 2009 and 2012 and 2014 to 2019. This study enrolled and retrospectively analyzed all of the patients. Eligible patients routinely underwent follow-up angiography at 6-8 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary endpoint includes target lesion revascularization (TLR) during follow-up. Further, this study calculated the predictor of TLR using multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: This study included the lesions involving 46.4% of type B2/C, 26.9% with severe calcification, and 6.0% with DCB restenosis. Mean DCB diameter and length were 2.75 ± 0.51 mm and 24.2 ± 9.6 mm, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 18 months. Follow-up angiography revealed a TLR rate of 9% and a restenosis rate of 9%. This study identified hemodialysis and current smoking as independent TLR predictors.
CONCLUSION: In routine clinical practice, the effectiveness of DCB was observed consistently across various types of coronary artery disease.
