Title: Hematometra Due to Cervical Stenosis in a Postmenopausal Woman with Incidental Ovarian Steroid Cell Tumor: A Case Report.

Abstract: Vaginal bleeding is reported among 4%-11% of postmenopausal women. Hematometra is commonly associated with cervical stenosis due to senile atrophy, radiotherapy, or a uterine neoplastic lesion in women of postmenopausal age. Ovarian steroid cell tumor is a rare hormone-secreting tumor subtype accounting for approximately 0.1% of all ovarian tumors. Here we report a case of hematometra in a postmenopausal woman with high estrogen levels who was later diagnosed with a steroid cell tumor.
