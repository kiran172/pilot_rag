Title: Subaortic Membrane Co-existing With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Clinically Challenging Diagnosis.

Abstract: Subaortic Membrane is the most common type of subaortic stenosis. That, coexisting with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is an extremely rare combination and clinically underappreciated. In this report, we will discuss an 18-year-old male patient who presented with chest pain and dyspnea due to fixed (sub-aortic membrane), as well as dynamic (HOCM), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOT) obstruction.
