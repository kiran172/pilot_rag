Title: Cardiac Rehabilitation After TAVI -A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Despite the increasing popularity of Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with high surgical risk, there is no current guideline for the management of patients following the intervention. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize and analyse all clinical data and evidence regarding the effectiveness and outcomes of CR following TAVI. The first meta-analysis measured the walked distance in the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and the second meta-analysis included studies that showed the Barthel Index (BI) before and after CR. The mean distance walked prior to CR was 235.88 ± 69.36 m increased to 292.12 ± 54.92 m after rehabilitation, signifying a moderate clinically relevant effect size (0.593 (0.42, 0.76); P=0.00). The mean BI score before CR was 76.6 ± 11.5 which increased to 89.8 ± 5.5 after the programme and similarly demonstrated a significant standardized mean improvement (0.75 (0.57, 0.93); I= 0.00). Exercise-based CR in patients with aortic stenosis treated with TAVI demonstrated a significant improvement in exercise tolerance and functional independence shown by the 6MWT and BI.
