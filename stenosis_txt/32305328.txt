Title: Outcomes of the First 300 Cases of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation at a High-Volume Australian Private Hospital.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was first performed in Australia in 2008 with a steady increase in the number of implanting centres from seven in 2008 to 42 in 2018 (24 private and 18 public hospitals). There is limited published data on outcomes from Australian centres and no published data from Australian private hospitals. We describe outcomes of the first 300 cases at Queensland's first TAVI implanting private hospital.
METHODS: From July 2015 to August 2018, 300 patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis underwent TAVI at our centre. A heart team assessed all patients as suitable. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) assessment of valve sizing and peripheral access.
RESULTS: Median age was 85 years, 58% male, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons' score 4.0%, 49% had New York Heart Association Class III/IV, 28% previous coronary artery bypass grafts, 14% peripheral vascular disease and 3.7% renal impairment (creatinine >177 μmol/L). At 30 days mortality was 1%, stroke 1.3%, myocardial infarction (MI) 0.3%, major vascular complication 3.0%, no life-threatening or disabling bleeding and new permanent pacemaker (PPM) requirement was 9.0%. Paravalvular leak was none, trace and mild in 27%, 53% and 20% respectively with 0.3%≥moderate paravalvular leak. At 1 year, mortality was 4.2%, stroke 2.1%, MI 0.3%, no life-threatening bleeding and PPM 11.4%. Lower rates of mortality, stroke, and major vascular complications were observed compared to the well-established TAVI centres in USA and Germany.
CONCLUSION: Excellent TAVI clinical outcomes can be achieved in the Australian private hospital setting. Expert heart team assessment and CT guided procedural planning are key to these outcomes.
