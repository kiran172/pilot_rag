Title: Minimally Invasive Biochimney Technique for Postrepair Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: Postrepair mitral stenosis is an important complication but associated with less-than-optimal surgical management. Reoperative mitral valve replacement is challenging due to the narrowness of the mitral annulus. We here present a minimally invasive biochimney technique performed in an elderly patient with postrepair mitral stenosis, in whom a composite of bioprosthetic valve and vascular graft was sutured on the extremely narrow mitral annulus.
