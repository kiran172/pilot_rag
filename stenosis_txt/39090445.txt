Title: Upper Gastrointestinal Involvement in Crohn's Disease as an Independent Predictor of New-Onset Strictures: Insights from an Extensive Retrospective Cohort Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Crohn's Disease (CD) can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, including the upper sections (UGI), which is often overlooked, especially in Asian populations. There's a notable gap in research regarding the impact of UGI involvement on the intricate landscape of ensuing complications. This study aims to address this gap.
METHODS: Conducting a retrospective study at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January 2001 to September 2023, we compared CD patients with UGI (Montreal L4) involvement against non-L4 counterparts, focusing on baseline characteristics, post-diagnosis complications, and overall outcomes. Routine UGI endoscopy was performed around the time of diagnosis in all patients followed in our inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) center, and all CD patients with adequate follow-up were included in this study.
RESULTS: The study included 212 CD patients, 111 in the L4 group and 101 in the non-L4 group, with an average follow-up of 40.8 ± 15.1 months. At baseline, individuals in the L4 category demonstrated elevated smoking rates, increased Crohn's Disease Activity Index scores, a higher prevalence of strictures, and a more prevalent usage of biologics and proton pump inhibitors. Moreover, this group was characterized by reduced albumin levels. Upon concluding the follow-up, those with L4 involvement continued to show escalated CDAI scores and hospitalization frequencies, alongside heightened C-reactive protein levels and diminished albumin concentrations. Additionally, the occurrence of UGI involvement, stricturing disease at the time of diagnosis, and a younger age at the onset of CD were pinpointed as independent predictors for the development of new-onset strictures.
CONCLUSIONS: CD patients with UGI involvement exhibit elevated disease activity and serve as independent predictors for the development of intestinal strictures. Thorough UGI evaluations at the time of diagnosis, coupled with assertive treatment strategies, are essential for managing these patients effectively.
