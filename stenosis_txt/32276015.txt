Title: One-year results from the DETOUR I trial of the PQ Bypass DETOUR System for percutaneous femoropopliteal bypass.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the 1-year safety and effectiveness outcomes associated with the PQ Bypass DETOUR System (PQ Bypass, Milpitas, Calif) for the percutaneous bypass of long-segment femoropopliteal occlusive disease.
METHODS: This prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial enrolled patients with long-segment femoropopliteal arterial disease. The DETOUR System percutaneously deploys modular stent grafts to bypass femoropopliteal lesions through a transvenous route. Eligible patients included those with TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus C and D lesions >100 mm in length. The primary safety end point was the major adverse event (MAE) rate through 1 month, defined as the composite of death, clinically driven target vessel revascularization (CD-TVR), or major amputation. The primary effectiveness end point was stent graft patency through 6 months, defined as freedom from stenosis ≥50%, occlusion, or CD-TVR.
RESULTS: During a 24-month period, 78 patients (82 limbs) were enrolled. The average core laboratory-measured lesion length was 371 ± 55 mm; 79 of 82 lesions (96%) were chronic total occlusions, and 55 of 82 lesions (67%) had severe calcification. The rates of technical and procedural success measured during the index procedure were both 96%, with satisfactory delivery and deployment of the device without MAEs in 79 of 82 limbs. Through 1 month, there were no deaths or amputations; CD-TVRs occurred in 2 of 81 limbs (3%), and freedom from MAEs was 98% (79/81). The 1-year Kaplan-Meier primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates were 81% ± 4%, 82% ± 4%, and 90% ± 3%, respectively. The ankle-brachial index increased an average of 0.25 ± 0.27 between baseline and 1 year (P < .001). Through 1 year, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from stent graft thrombosis, CD-TVR, and MAE were 84% ± 4%, 85% ± 4%, and 84% ± 4%, respectively. At 1 year, the Rutherford class improved in 77 of 80 limbs (96%), and 65 of 80 (81%) were asymptomatic. Deep venous thrombosis developed in 2 of 79 target limbs (3%) through 1 year, both at the femoropopliteal vein level. There were no instances of pulmonary embolism.
CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year results from the DETOUR I trial show that the PQ Bypass DETOUR System is a safe and effective percutaneous treatment option for patients with longer, severely calcified, above-knee femoropopliteal lesions.
