Title: [Liver Graft Failure after Plastic Stent Removal of an Anastomotic Biliary Stricture].

Abstract: A biliary anastomotic stricture developed 13 months after living donor liver transplantation in a 19-year-old male with congenital hepatic fibrosis. Endoscopic management with balloon dilation followed by the placement of a 7F plastic stent was performed for the anastomotic stricture. After 6 months of indwelling of the stent, the plastic stent was removed because the stenosis and cholestasis were improved. One month after stent removal, he was admitted for acute liver graft failure owing to cholestatic hepatitis, and required retransplantation secondary to graft loss.
