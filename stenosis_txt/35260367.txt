Title: Simplified urethral score system for predicting complex anterior urethroplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess U-score individual values as urethral complex surgery predictors.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study including patients who received anterior urethroplasty from 2011 to 2019. U-score (etiology (1-2 points), number of strictures (1-2 points), anatomic location (1-2 points) and length (1-3 points)) was measured individually and globally. Surgical complexity was defined as low (anastomotic, buccal mucosal graft, and augmented anterior urethroplasty), and high complexity (double buccal mucosal graft, flap, and graft/flap combination). U-score components were included as complex surgery predictor and as main variable with individual probability values estimations and comparisons. Risk complex surgery probability groups were established.
RESULTS: 654 patients were included. Mean age was 57.2 years. Low complexity surgery was performed in 464 patients (259 anastomotic, 144 graft, 61 augmented anterior urethroplasty) and high complexity was done in 190 (53 double buccal mucosa graft, 27 flap, 110 graft/flap comb.). In multivariate analysis length, number of strictures and location were predictors of complexity. Introducing U-Score as only variable in univariate model predicted an OR 8.52 (95%CI 6.1-11). Simplified U-score grouping set obtained by complex probability was: low risk (4-5 points), medium risk (6 points) and high risk of complexity (7-9 points) Predicted risk of complex surgery probability (95%CI) for low, median and high risk group were 1.6 (0-2.9), 19.1 (13.8-25.9) and 77.9 (61.6-88.7), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: U-score can be used as a tool to predict complex urethral surgery. We present a simplified U-score risk tool to assess individual complex anterior urethroplasty probability.
