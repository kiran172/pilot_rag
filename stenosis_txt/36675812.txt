Title: Plasma Interleukin-6 Level Predicts the Risk of Arteriovenous Fistula Dysfunction in Patients Undergoing Maintenance Hemodialysis.

Abstract: Systemic inflammation has been proposed as a relevant factor of vascular remodeling and dysfunction. We aimed to identify circulating inflammatory biomarkers that could predict future arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction in patients undergoing hemodialysis. A total of 282 hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this prospective multicenter cohort study. Plasma cytokine levels were measured at the time of data collection. The primary outcome was the occurrence of AVF stenosis and/or thrombosis requiring percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgery within the first year of enrollment. AVF dysfunction occurred in 38 (13.5%) patients during the study period. Plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were significantly higher in patients with AVF dysfunction than those without. Diabetes mellitus, low systolic blood pressure, and statin use were also associated with AVF dysfunction. The cumulative event rate of AVF dysfunction was the highest in IL-6 tertile 3 (p = 0.05), and patients in tertile 3 were independently associated with an increased risk of AVF dysfunction after multivariable adjustments (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.06, p = 0.015). In conclusion, circulating IL-6 levels are positively associated with the occurrence of incident AVF dysfunction in hemodialysis patients. Our data suggest that IL-6 may help clinicians identify those at high risk of impending AVF failure.
