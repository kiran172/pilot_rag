Title: A rescue transcatheter solution for early sutureless basal ring infolding.

Abstract: We report the case of an 83-year-old woman treated with a "rescue" valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation because of an early basal ring partial collapse of a sutureless valve, probably due to septal hypertrophy.
