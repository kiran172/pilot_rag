Title: Carotid Stenosis and Stroke: Historical Perspectives Leading to Current Challenges.

Abstract: The carotid artery is unique; it is the only vessel to bifurcate into a bulb larger than itself. The history of its anatomic description, understanding of its pathophysiology and evolution of its imaging are relevant to current controversies regarding measurement of stenosis, surgical/endovascular therapies and medical management of carotid stenosis in stroke prevention. Treatment decisions on millions of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are routinely based on information from clinical trials from over 30 years ago. This article briefly summarizes the highlights of past research in key areas and discuss how they led to current challenges of diagnosis and treatment.
