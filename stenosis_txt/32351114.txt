Title: Serum-Targeted HILIC-MS Metabolomics-Based Analysis in Infants with Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction.

Abstract: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) constitutes the predominant cause of obstructive nephropathy in both neonates and infants. Fundamental questions regarding UPJO's mechanism, assessment, and treatment still remain unanswered. The aim of the present study was to elucidate potential differences through serum metabolic profiling of surgical cases of infants with UPJO compared to both nonsurgical cases and healthy age-matched controls. Early diagnosis of renal dysfunction in this cohort based on highlighted biomarkers was the ultimate goal. Thus, serum samples were collected from 20 patients preoperatively, 19 patients with mild stenosis treated conservatively, and 17 healthy controls. All samples were subjected to targeted metabolomics analysis by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HILIC LC-MS/MS). Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plots showed that the studied groups differed significantly, with a panel of metabolites, including creatinine, tryptophan, choline, and aspartate, distinguishing patients who required surgery from those followed by systematical monitoring as well as from healthy controls, showing high performance as indicators of UPJO disease.
