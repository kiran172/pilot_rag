Title: [Effect of the degree of stenosis of the right coronary artery on remote results of bypass grafting].

Abstract: AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term results of right coronary artery bypass grafting and identify predictors of coronary artery bypass graft occlusion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective single-centre study included a total of 245 patients subjected to isolated coronary artery bypass graft operations during the follow up period from 2010 to 2015. All patients endured bypass grafting of the right coronary artery (RCA) with either autovenous or autoarterial conduits. Control coronary bypass angiography was performed in all patients in connection with a relapse of angina pectoris. The duration of the follow up period amounted to 43.7Â±20.2 months. The patients were divided into two groups depending on the type of the conduit used to bypass the RCA. Group One patients (n=106) endured bypass grafting of the RCA and its branches using the internal thoracic artery. Group Two patients (n=139) underwent autovenous coronary artery bypass grafting of the RCA basin. By the main clinical, demographic and intraoperative parameters the groups were statistically homogeneous (p>0.05). The effect of the degree of proximal stenosis, the diameter of the grafted artery on the viability of bypass grafts was assessed.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period up to 84 months, 19 (17.9%) occluded arterial and 29 (20.9%) venous conduits were revealed. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the probability of the absence of venous graft occlusion during the follow-up period up to 84 months was significantly lower than that of arterial grafts (log rank=0.012). The Cox regression analysis results revealed that shunt occlusion was influenced by the degree of proximal stenosis and the diameter of the shunted artery.
CONCLUSION: When shunting a moderate stenosis of the RCA (up to 70%), an advantage of autovenous conduits was revealed. When shunting the RCA with a critical stenosis and occlusion, advantages were revealed for the internal thoracic artery.
