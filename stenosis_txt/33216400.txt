Title: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement to treat multijet paravalvular regurgitation: A case series and review.

Abstract: Treatment advances for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis including transcatheter and open surgical valve replacement have improved patient survival, length of stay, and speed to recovery. However, paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) is occasionally seen and when moderate or greater in severity is associated with an at least 2-fold increase in 1â€‰year mortality. While several treatment approaches focused on single-jet PVR have been described in the literature, few reports describe multijet PVR. Multijet PVR can successfully be treated with a variety of catheter-based options including valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We present two patients with at least moderate PVR following aortic valve replacement who were successfully treated with ViV TAVR along with a review of literature highlighting our rationale for utilizing each management approach. Multijet PVR can be treated successfully with ViV TAVR, but additional options such as self-expanding occluder devices and bioprosthetic valve fracture have a role as adjunctive treatments to achieve optimal results. The etiology of multijet PVR can differ between patients, this heterogeneity underscores the paucity of data to guide treatment strategies. Therefore, successful treatment of multijet PVR requires familiarity with available therapeutic options to achieve optimal results and, by extension, decrease patient mortality.
