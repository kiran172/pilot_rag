Title: Longitudinal Evaluation of Coronary Arteries and Myocardium in Breast Cancer Using Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The association of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) and left ventricular (LV) myocardium measurements with cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is limited.
OBJECTIVES: In this study, the authors sought to evaluate the changes in coronary arteries and LV myocardium in patients with left breast cancer (BC) receiving anthracycline with or without radiotherapy, with the use of coronary CTA.
METHODS: Participants with left BC receiving anthracycline with or without radiotherapy were prospectively included. All participants underwent coronary CTA before and after treatment, including nonenhanced calcium-scoring scan, computed tomography angiography, and dual-energy late enhancement scan. Computed tomographic fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR), pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) CT attenuation, and LV segments' extracellular volume (ECV) before and after treatment were compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between baseline coronary CTA parameters and CTRCD.
RESULTS: Eighty participants receiving anthracycline and 59 participants receiving anthracycline with radiotherapy were included. CT-FFR decreased and PCAT CT attenuation and LV global and segments' ECV increased after treatment (all P < 0.05). After chemoradiotherapy, CT-FFR was lower and PCAT CT attenuation and LV myocardial ECV were higher than after chemotherapy. Twenty-four participants developed CTRCD. After adjustment by Heart Failure Association-International Cardio-Oncology Society risk in multivariable logistic regression analysis, baseline stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) (OR: 1.987 [95% CI: 1.322-2.768]; P = 0.021), left circumflex artery (LCX) (OR: 1.895 [95% CI: 1.281-2.802]; P = 0.031), and right coronary artery (RCA) (OR: 1.920 [95% CI: 1.405-2.811]; P = 0.028), and baseline CT-FFR of the LAD (OR: 3.425 [95% CI: 1.621-9.434]; P < 0.001), LCX (OR: 2.058 [95% CI: 1.030-5.076]; P = 0.006), and RCA (OR: 2.469 [95% CI: 1.232-6.944]; P = 0.004) were associated with CTRCD.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiparameter coronary CTA contributes to comprehensive assessment of the coronary arteries and myocardium in patients with left BC receiving anthracycline with or without radiotherapy. Baseline coronary artery stenosis and CT-FFR might be imaging markers for predicting CTRCD in these patients.
