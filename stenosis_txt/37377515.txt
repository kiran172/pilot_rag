Title: Bedside Physical Examination for the Diagnosis of Aortic Stenosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with obstruction to the left ventricular outflow tract from degenerative aortic stenosis (AS) usually do not become symptomatic until their disease becomes graded as severe. We sought to assess the accuracy of the physical examination for the diagnosis of AS of at least moderate severity.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of case series and cohorts of patients who received a cardiovascular physical examination prior to receiving a left heart catheterization or an echocardiogram. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Embase were searched with a date range from inception through December 10, 2021, without language restrictions.
RESULTS: Our systematic review yielded 7 observational studies with adequate data to perform a meta-analysis on 3 physical examination assessments. Auscultating a diminished second heart sound (likelihood ratio [LR] = 10.87, 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.94-30.12, P &lt; 0.05) and palpating a delayed carotid upstroke (LR = 9.04, 95% CI, 3.12-25.44, P &lt; 0.05) are useful for detecting AS of at least moderate severity. The absence of a systolic murmur radiating to the neck (LR = 0.11, 95% CI, 0.06-0.23, P &lt; 0.05) rules against AS of at least moderate severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-quality evidence from observational studies supports a diminished second heart sound and a delayed carotid upstroke as having moderate accuracy in diagnosing the presence of AS of at least moderate severity, whereas the absence of a murmur radiating to the neck is equally accurate in excluding this diagnosis.
