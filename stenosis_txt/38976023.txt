Title: [Cervical stenosis-Diagnostics and treatment of symptomatic spinal canal stenosis and neuroforaminal stenosis].

Abstract: Cervical stenosis is a clinical picture that is regularly encountered by both hospital physicians and orthopedic surgeons in the daily clinical practice. While advanced cervical spinal canal stenosis may lead to myelopathic symptoms in cases of sufficient manifestation and spinal cord injury, neuroforaminal stenosis leads to radicular symptoms due to compression of the nerve roots. The clinical examination can provide initial clues as to the suspected cause of the patient's symptoms; however, reliable diagnostics are based only on sectional imaging of the cervical spine. Depending on the extent of the symptoms, the treatment options vary between nonsurgical treatment for moderate symptoms without neurological deficits and surgical decompression of the spinal cord or nerve roots. The surgical treatment can be performed from anterior or posterior depending on the findings. Surgery can lead to an improvement of the neurological symptoms; however, the primary aim of surgical treatment is to avoid deterioration of the neurological deficits.
