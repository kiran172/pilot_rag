Title: Antitumour necrosis factor alpha treatment in Crohn's disease: long-term efficacy, side effects and need for surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To examine the long-term efficacy and side effects of antitumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), the need for surgery and the clinical outcome after discontinuing anti-TNF therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-TNF register at Østfold Hospital Trust. Clinical and sociodemographic data were recorded for patients initiating anti-TNF therapy from January 2000 until December 2011. Follow-up was conducted until December 2017.
RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 40/154 (26%) patients at the last follow-up (median follow-up time 10 years). A total of 40 (26%) patients had to discontinue treatment due to serious side effects, and malignancy was recorded in 10 (6.5%) patients. Surgical resection was performed in 55 (36%) patients during follow-up. Patients with Montreal phenotype B2 before anti-TNF therapy were estimated to have a 2.54-fold greater risk of surgery than patients with phenotype B1 (p = .001). Of those with phenotype B1 before anti-TNF therapy, 19 (24%) of them developed stenosis in need of surgical resection ('phenotype migration'). In patients followed up after discontinuing anti-TNF therapy (n = 89, median observational time six years), CR was achieved in most patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term complete remission was achieved in only one in four patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, and one in four patients had to discontinue therapy due to side effects. Despite anti-TNF therapy, one in four patients with a baseline luminal disease phenotype needed subsequent surgical resection.
