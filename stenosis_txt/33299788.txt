Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Bahrain Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive procedure that is considered a good alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR) in selected patients. Our aim is to determine the baseline, procedural characteristics and one-year clinical outcomes of our TAVI registry.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective observational analysis of a prospectively designed cohort comprising 81 consecutive patients treated at Mohammed bin Khalifa Cardiac Centre (MKCC) who were enrolled in Bahrain TAVI registry from February 2014 to February 2019. The clinical endpoints were defined according to the updated Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) consensus document.
RESULTS: Out of the 81 patients included in our study, there were 37 (45.7%) males. The mean age was 76.4 ± 8.9 years with a mean Logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE II) of 4.1 ± 2.5 and a mean Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) Risk Score of 4.2 ± 3.5. Evolute-R valve was used for 36 (44.4%) patients, Edward Sapien for 26 patients (32.1%), and Core valve for 19 patients (23.5%). At one year follow up, all-cause death was reported in three (3.7%) patients; none of them was cardiovascular mortality. As per VARC-II criteria, no cases fulfilled the criteria of valve dysfunction but TAVI-related complications (i.e., TAV-in-TAV deployment) were reported in four (4.9%) cases. One (1.2%) case of major bleeding was encountered but no patient experienced life-threatening bleeding. Major vascular complications were documented in two patients (2.5%) only. Significant Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) occurred in two (2.5%) patients, both classified as stage-2 but no one deteriorated to stage-3 or hemodialysis. Seven (8.6%) patients required permanent pacemakers, and all were implanted during the index admission for TAVI. One patient (1.2%) had stroke and all survivors completed one-year follow up.
CONCLUSION: The TAVI program in Bahrain is encouraging and corresponds to the finest international centers outcomes in terms of procedural success and complications rate.
