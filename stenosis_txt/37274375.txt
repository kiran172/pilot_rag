Title: Importance of concomitant functional mitral regurgitation on survival in severe aortic stenosis patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is commonly seen in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). But the long-term implications of MR in AS are unknown.
AIM: To investigate MR's impact on survival of patients undergoing surgical AVR for severe AS.
METHODS: Of the 740 consecutive patients with severe AS evaluated between 1993 and 2003, 287 underwent AVR forming the study cohort. They were followed up to death or till the end of 2019. Chart reviews were performed for clinical, echocardiographic, and therapeutic data. MR was graded on a 1-4 scale. Mortality data was obtained from chart review and the Social Security Death Index. Survival was analyzed as a function of degree of MR.
RESULTS: The mean age of the severe AS patients who had AVR (n = 287) was 72 ± 13 years, 46% women. Over up to 26 years of follow up, there were 201 (70%) deaths, giving deep insights into the determinants of survival of severe AS who had AVR. The 5, 10 and 20 years survival rates were 75%, 45% and 25% respectively. Presence of MR was associated with higher mortality in a graded fashion (P = 0.0003). MR was significantly associated with lower left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and larger LV size. Impact of MR on mortality was partially mediated through lower LV ejection fraction and larger LV size. By Cox regression, MR, lower ejection fraction (EF) and larger LV end-systolic dimension were independent predictors of higher mortality (χ2 = 33.2).
CONCLUSION: Presence of greater than 2+ MR in patients with severe AS is independently associated with reduced survival in surgically managed patients, an effect incremental to reduced EF and larger LV size. We suggest that aortic valve intervention should be considered in severe AS patients when > 2+ MR occurs irrespective of EF or symptoms.
