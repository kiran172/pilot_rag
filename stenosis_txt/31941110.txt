Title: Usefulness of the Inferior Articular Process's Cross-Sectional Area as a Morphological Parameter for Predicting Central Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: Hypertrophy of facet joints is associated with a high risk of central lumbar spinal stenosis (CLSS). However, no research has reported the effect of inferior articular process hypertrophy in CLSS. We hypothesize that the inferior articular process's cross-sectional area (IAPCSA) is larger in patients with CLSS compared to those without CLSS. Data on IAPCSA were obtained from 116 patients with CLSS. A total of 102 control subjects underwent lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (LS-MRI) as part of a routine medical examination. Axial T1-weighted images were obtained from the two groups. Using an imaging analysis system, we investigated the cross-sectional area of the inferior articular process. The average IAPCSA was 70.97 ± 13.02 mm2 in control subjects and 88.77 ± 18.52 mm2 in patients with CLSS. CLSS subjects had significantly greater levels of IAPCSA (p &lt; 0.001) than controls. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to determine the validity of IAPCSA as a predictor of CLSS. The most suitable cut-off point of IAPCSA for predicting CLSS was 75.88 mm2, with a sensitivity of 71.6%, a specificity of 68.6%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.84). Greater IAPCSA levels were associated with a higher incidence of CLSS. These results demonstrate that IAPCSA is a useful morphological predictor in the evaluation of CLSS.
