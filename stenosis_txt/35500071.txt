Title: CRP Albumin Ratio May Predict No Reflow in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Saphenous Vein Graft Stenosis.

Abstract: Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain no-reflow (NR). Some of these hypotheses, state that NR may be caused by damage to the vascular endothelium and an inflammatory process. In a recent study that did not include patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), the ratio of C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin (CAR) was found to be associated with NR. Our study aims to evaluate the relationship between CAR and NR in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for saphenous vein graft (SVG). In this retrospective study, among the patients with CABG who underwent primary or elective coronary angiography, 242 patients who underwent PCI to the SVG were selected. The incidence of NR was 19.8% (n = 48). Diabetes mellitus, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), stent length, and CAR were found as independent predictors of NR in multivariate logistic regression analysis (P < .05). Using a cut-off level of .930, the CAR predicted NR with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 73% (AUC: .814, 95% CI: .749-.879, P < .001). The CAR was a better predictor than both stent length and LVEF. CAR was found to be the strongest predictor of NR in our study.
