Title: Review of safety reports of cardiac MR-imaging in patients with recently implanted coronary artery stents at various field strengths.

Abstract: Background: Aim of this study was to review current literature and data regarding the effects of MRI-examination post stent implantation on re-occlusion rates.Methods: We focused on representative studies in the database MEDLINE. Inclusion criteria were: clinical studies with the main focus on the safety of coronary artery stents after MRI-examination in the time interval of 8 weeks post stent implantation. During a follow up period the incidence of cardiac events was recorded. In addition, the time interval between stent implantation and MRI-examination should be defined.Results: Our search resulted in a total of relevant 17 studies. There were in-vivo as well as in-vitro studies and in addition three further publications f.e. guidelines. Concerning the patients, we differentiated between MRI performed shortly after acute cardiac event and in stable CAD. MRI-examinations were performed at different field strengths and reported different stent types. Considered were the incidences of cardiac events.Conclusion: Independent of MRI field strength (1.5 Tesla or 3.0 Tesla) or used stent type (BMS or DES), there was no increased rate for cardiac events in patients, who underwent MRI &lt; 8 weeks after stent placement. MRI &lt; 8 weeks after stent placement seems to be safe.
