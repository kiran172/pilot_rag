Title: Drug-coated balloon angioplasty for coronary stenotic lesions in a paediatric patient after Kawasaki disease.

Abstract: Percutaneous coronary intervention for stenosis of coronary artery after Kawasaki disease presents various challenges. The diameters of reference vessels and femoral artery in children are smaller, and the morphological changes are different from adults. Herein, we describe our successful experience with a severe coronary artery stenosis at the proximal portion of left anterior descending treated with drug-coated balloon dilation.
