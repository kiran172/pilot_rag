Title: Serial In-Office Steroid Injections for Airway Stenosis: Long-Term Benefit and Cost Analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term benefit of serial in-office steroid injections (SISI) in the treatment of subglottic and proximal tracheal stenosis (SG/PTS). Evaluate cost of SISI compared to endoscopic dilation (ED).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study and cost analysis.
METHODS: All patients with SGS/PTS with at least two consecutive in-office steroid injections between 2013 and 2021 were evaluated. Patients with less than 2 years of follow-up data after the initial SISI series were excluded. Demographics, etiology of stenosis, total injections performed, time between steroid series, surgery-free interval (SFI) and adverse events were collected. For patients with known surgical history before SISI, pre-SISI SFI was compared. Institutional billing records and the national CMS average reimbursement were evaluated. Total charges for three treatment strategies (ED alone, ED with post-operative SISI and primary intervention with SISI) were also compared.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included; 29 (59%) idiopathic, 11 (22%) traumatic and 9 (18%) rheumatologic. Mean (SD) follow-up time after the first SISI was 3.41 years (1.5), range (2.08-7.25 years). 79% (39/49) did not require additional surgery during the entire follow-up period. The SFI improved from a mean 13.5 months (SD 12.6; range 2-42 months) pre-SISI to a mean (SD) of 42 months (SD 20.2; range 10-87 months) (p < 0.0001) after SISI. Annual average charges for ED alone in our cohort was $15,383.28, compared to $7,070.04 for SISI.
CONCLUSIONS: SISI are an effective treatment for patients with SG/PTS. In-office steroid injections could offer cost savings for the patient.
