Title: Feasibility of Quantitative Flow Ratio Virtual Stenting for Guidance of Serial Coronary Lesions Intervention.

Abstract: Background Coronary physiology measurement in serial coronary lesions with multiple stenoses is challenging. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of Murray fractal law-based quantitative flow ratio (μQFR) virtual stenting for guidance of serial coronary lesions intervention. Methods and Results Patients who underwent elective coronary angiography and had 2 serial de novo coronary lesions of 30% to 90% diameter stenosis by visual estimation were prospectively enrolled. μQFR and fractional flow reserve (FFR) were assessed after coronary angiography. In vessels with an FFR ≤0.80, the lesion with the larger pressure gradient was considered to be the primary lesion and treated firstly, followed by FFR measurement. The second lesion was stented when FFR ≤0.80. All μQFR and predicted μQFR after stenting were calculated from diagnostic coronary angiography before interventions, with the analysts masked to the FFR data. A total of 54 patients with 61 target vessels were interrogated. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 44 vessels with FFR ≤0.80. After stenting the primary lesions, 14 nonprimary lesions had FFR ≤0.80 and a second drug-eluting stent was implanted. There was excellent correlation (r=0.97, P&lt;0.001) and good agreement (mean difference: 0.00±0.03) between baseline μQFR and FFR in identifying flow-limiting lesions. Per-vessel diagnostic accuracy of μQFR on de novo lesions was 96.7% (95% CI, 88.7%-99.6%). μQFR and FFR are highly consistent (93.2%) in identifying the primary lesion requiring revascularization. After stenting the primary lesions, per-vessel diagnostic accuracy of predicted μQFR for identifying the significance of the nonprimary lesion was 90.9%. Predicted residual μQFR with virtual stenting was higher than final FFR (mean difference: 0.05±0.06). Conclusions In vessels with serial coronary lesions, virtual stenting by μQFR can identify the primary flow-limiting lesion for revascularization.
