Title: Vascular Response on a Novel Fibrin-Based Coated Flow Diverter.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Due to thromboembolic complications and in-stent-stenosis after flow diverter (FD) treatment, the long-term use of dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) is mandatory. The tested nano-coating has been shown to reduce material thrombogenicity and promote endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. We compared the biocompatibility of coated (Derivo Heal) and non-coated (Derivo bare) FDs with DAPT in an animal model.
METHODS: Derivo® bare (n = 10) and Derivo® Heal (n = 10) FD were implanted in the common carotid arteries (CCAs) of New Zealand white rabbits. One additional FD, alternately a Derivo bare (n = 5) or Derivo Heal (n = 5), was implanted in the abdominal aorta (AA) for assessment of the patency of branch arteries. Histopathological examinations were performed after 28 days. Angiography was performed before and after FD implantation and at follow-up.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the included specimens showed complete endothelialization of all FDs with no significant differences in neointima thickness between Derivo® bare and Derivo® Heal (CCA: p = 0.91; AA: p = 0.59). A significantly reduced number of macrophages in the vessel wall of the Derivo Heal was observed for the CCA (p = 0.02), and significantly reduced fibrin and platelet deposition on the surface of the Derivo Heal was observed for the AA. All branch arteries of the stented aorta remained patent.
CONCLUSION: In this animal model, the novel fibrin-based coated FD showed a similar blood and tissue compatibility as the non-coated FD.
