Title: Recurrent Subglottic Stenosis in a 16-Month-Old Male in the Setting of Influenza A, Intubation, and Honey Consumption.

Abstract: Recurrent episodes of subglottic stenosis are rare in the literature, and the etiologic causes are misunderstood but can be congenital, idiopathic, or iatrogenic in nature. Complications of intubation can result in subsequent inflammation and reactive processes. This case involves a 16-month-old male who suffered from a recurrent episode of subglottic stenosis in the setting of croup, influenza, and honey consumption. He had presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress after ingesting a home remedy of onion juice and honey. He had been discharged one day prior from the pediatric intensive care unit after four days of intubation and a seven-day hospital course with evidence of croup on imaging. He was readmitted, and subglottic edema and narrowing were confirmed via endoscopy, which prompted antibiotic treatment and close monitoring. After three days of monitoring and re-evaluation by bronchoscopy, the patient's condition began to improve, and no intubation was necessary. It is unclear what the cause of recurrent subglottic stenosis is due to the patient's clinical picture being clouded by a potential allergic reaction to honey versus an inflammatory reactive process post-intubation from the previous admission days prior. This case emphasizes the need for further research on the prevalence and etiology of recurrent subglottic stenosis and a deeper understanding of how to optimize diagnosis and treatment.
