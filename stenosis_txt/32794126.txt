Title: Diagnostic performance of quantitative, semi-quantitative, and visual analysis of dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging: a validation study with invasive fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diagnostic performance of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF), MBF<sub>ratio</sub>, and visual analysis of dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) for the detection of hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with chest pain and intermediate-to-high pre-test probability of obstructive coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled. All patients were referred for dynamic CT-MPI and fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements within 4 weeks. Absolute MBF, MBF<sub>ratio</sub> (mean MBF of stenosis-subtended territories versus that of reference territories), and visually identified perfusion defect were tested for the diagnostic performance with reference to FFR.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients with 95 target vessels were included for final analysis. The mean radiation dose for dynamic CT-MPI was 3.0 (2.2-4.0) mSv. The mean lesion-based absolute MBF value was significantly lower in ischemic segments than that in non-ischemic segments (78.0 (65.0-86.0) mL/min/100 mL vs. 133.0 (117.5-163.8) mL/min/100 mL, p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the lesion-based MBF<sub>ratio</sub> was also markedly lower in territories with positive FFR results (0.52 (0.44-0.64) vs. 0.93 (0.91-0.97), p &lt; 0.001). According to per-lesion ROC curve analysis, MBF and MBF<sub>ratio</sub> had a similar area under the curve (AUC) for detecting hemodynamically significant lesions (AUC = 0.942 vs. 0.956, p = 0.413), which were larger than that of visual analysis (AUC = 0.802, both p &lt; 0.01). The vessel-based sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 84.3%, 97.7%, and 90.5% for MBF and 96.1%, 93.2%, and 94.7% for MBF<sub>ratio</sub>.
CONCLUSIONS: Absolute MBF and MBF<sub>ratio</sub> had similarly excellent diagnostic performance with reference to FFR. In addition, these two parameters outperformed visual analysis for the detection of myocardial ischemia.
KEY POINTS: • The mean MBF and MBF<sub>ratio</sub> were significantly lower in ischemic segments than those in non-ischemic segments. • Absolute MBF and MBF<sub>ratio</sub> had similar AUCs for the detection of hemodynamically significant lesions (AUC = 0.942 vs. 0.956, p = 0.413), which were larger than that of visual analysis (AUC = 0.802, both p &lt; 0.01). • The vessel-based sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 84.3%, 97.7%, and 90.5% for absolute MBF and 96.1%, 93.2%, and 94.7% for MBF<sub>ratio</sub>.
