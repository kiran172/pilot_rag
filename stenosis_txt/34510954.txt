Title: Clinical Safety and Efficacy of Rotational Atherectomy in Japanese Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease Presenting Femoropopliteal Lesions: The J-SUPREME and J-SUPREME II Trials.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of the J-SUPREME (J-S) and J-SUPREME II (J-SII) trials was to evaluate the performance of the Jetstream Atherectomy System for the treatment of Japanese patients with symptomatic occlusive atherosclerotic lesions in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The J-S and J-SII trials were both prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Patients in J-S underwent Jetstream atherectomy followed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), whereas those in J-SII had adjunctive drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment following atherectomy. Patients were adults with Rutherford category 2, 3, or 4 and had stenotic, restenotic, or occlusive lesion(s) with a degree of stenosis ≥70 in the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery. In J-S, lesions were required to be calcified, and in J-SII lesions were required to be severely calcified.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were enrolled in J-S (mean age 72.3±8.7 years, lesion length 82.0±41.5 mm, 36% calcification PACSS Grade 3, 22% Grade 4) and 31 patients in J-SII (mean age 72.5±7.7 years, lesion length 122.6±55.6 mm, 19.4% calcification PACSS Grade 3, 77.4% Grade 4). No bailout stenting or bypass conversions were required. No major adverse events (MAEs) were reported for either trial through 1 month. The 6-month primary patency for J-S, with PTA alone following atherectomy, was 40.4% (19/47). The 6-month primary patency for J-SII, with DCB treatment following atherectomy, was 96.7% (29/30). At 6-month post-procedure, 79.2% (38/48) of patients in J-S, and 100% (30/30) of patients in J-SII had improved by at least 1 Rutherford category.
CONCLUSION: J-SUPREME trial results demonstrate procedural safety and efficacy of the Jetstream Atherectomy System and J-SII showed sustained patency through 6 months following combination treatment with Jetstream atherectomy and DCB.
