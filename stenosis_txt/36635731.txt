Title: Triglyceride glucose index is associated with obstructive coronary artery disease in hypertensive patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a leading risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Triglyceride glucose index (TyG) is a surrogate of insulin resistance (IR). Few studies explore the association between TyG and the incidence of obstructive CAD (OCAD) in hypertensive patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively screened 1841 hypertensive subjects who were free of a history of CAD and underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) because of chest pain. TyG index was calculated as ln (fasting TG [mg/dL] * fasting glucose [mg/dL]/2). The outcome of this research was OCAD, which was defined as the presence of diameter stenosis ≥ 50% in any of the four major epicardial coronary arteries detected on CCTA.
RESULTS: A total of 310 (16.8%) patients developed obstructive CAD. The restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis showed a J-shaped relationship between TyG and OCAD and the OR for OCAD increased as the TyG rose over 8.61 (OR perSD) 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.54, p = 0.008). After full adjustments for confounding covariates, patients with TyG index in tertile 3 (T3) had 2.12 times (95% CI 1.80 to 3.81) and in T2 had 2.01 times (95% CI 1.40 to 2.88) as high as the risk of OCAD compared with patients in T1 (p for trend = 0.001). When regarding TyG as a continuous variable, 1-SD increase elevated 49% (OR (95%CI), 1.49 (1.30-1.74)) risk of obstructive CAD (p = 0.007). This positive effect was still consistent across the subgroups (p for interaction > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: TyG index was associated with the incidence of obstructive CAD in hypertensive patients.
