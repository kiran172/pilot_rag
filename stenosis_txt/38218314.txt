Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation using coplanar and cuspal overlap techniques in Indian patients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) techniques gradually evolved since 2002 and have undergone various refinements. Achieving optimal implantation depth has become crucial for good long term outcome. High implantation decreases the likelihood of conduction disturbances. Conventionally TAVI valve is positioned in a tricusp coplanar (CON) fluoroscopic projection however it does not ensure a optimal implantation. In an attempt to attain higher implantation(3 mm) and decrease rate of permanent pacemaker, cuspal overlap technique (COT) view has been developed. There is scarcity of Indian literature comparing TAVI deployment using coplanar and cuspal overlap techniques.
METHODS: We included 111 patients who underwent TAVR with a self-expanding Core Valve Evolut R (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota), between January 2017 to September 2022 at our centre.Transcatheter Heart Valves (THV) were implanted using the traditional coplanar in 55 patients, while in 56 patients valves were implanted using the COT.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics including electrocardiographic findings were comparable in both groups. In all patients Evolut R or Evolut PRO valves were used. Procedure was done in conscious sedation in 90.9 % of patients in CON and 96.4 % in COT group. Predilatation and postdilatation was used in 38.8 % vs 33.9 % and 27 % vs 32 % in CON and COT groups respectively. 90 day PPI rate was less in COT group (7.3 % CON vs 3.5 % COP). Majority of patients who received permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) had baseline ECG abnormality (RBBB in 50 %, LBBB in 16 %, Grade 1 AV block 16 %). Mean time of post procedure PPI was 5.6 days in COT group and 7.3 days in CON group. New onset LBBB was also less in COT group (21 % CON vs 12.5 % COT).There were 3.6 % intraprocedural deaths in CON group and 1.8 % in COT group. Depth of deployed valve was 4.8 ± 2.34 mm in COT and 6.6 ± 2.11 mm in CON group. Valve deployment time was more in COT group(10.40 CON vs 14.34 min COT). Average valve recapture rate was 2.58 in COP and 2.11 in CON. Stroke rate was more in COT group(3.6 % CON vs 7.14 % COT). Pericardial effusions were also more in COT group. All cause mortality at 3 months was 10.9 % in CON group and 5.3 % in COT.
CONCLUSION: In this study we achieved lower rates of PPI and new onset LBBB using COT technique in Indian patients using self-expandable prostheses. However valve deployment time, stroke rate and pericardial effusion were seen more in COT group. All cause mortality was low in cuspal overlap technique.
