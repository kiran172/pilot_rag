Title: Systemic sclerosis with cerebral infarction and severe stenosis of internal carotid artery and coronary artery: A case report.

Abstract: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by microangiopathy, extensive fibrosis and autoantibody production. It is generally believed that microvascular disease is the hallmark of SSc. Macrovascular involvement is not initially considered as a feature of SSc, but its mortality is high, which should not be ignored. Up to the present, SSc patients with cerebral involvement and multiple macrovascular stenosis have been rarely described. We herein report a case of cerebral infarction and severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery and coronary artery associated with SSc.
