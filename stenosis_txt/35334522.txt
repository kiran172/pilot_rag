Title: Trans-Apical Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a Dialysis Patient with Systolic Heart Failure.

Abstract: Mortality and morbidity remain high following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in dialysis patients or those with low left ventricular ejection fraction. Therapeutic strategy for those with these comorbidities remains unestablished. We had a dialysis patient with peripheral artery disease and low left ventricular ejection fraction, who received successfully scheduled trans-apical TAVR following sufficient reverse remodeling by 3-month optimal medical therapy. Our strategy should be validated in a larger robust cohort.
