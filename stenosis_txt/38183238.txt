Title: Propofol Infusion Syndrome Following Endoscopic Tracheoplasty and Jet Ventilation: Case Report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We present a case of propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) following jet ventilation.
METHOD: Case report and review of literature.
RESULTS: A 70-year-old man required CO2 laser endoscopic tracheoplasty for tracheal and subglottic stenosis due to A-frame deformity. Postoperatively, the patient was reintubated for respiratory distress and propofol was resumed. Over the next two days the patient developed acute kidney injury, leukocytosis, acute primary respiratory acidosis with high anion gap metabolic acidosis, multiple end organ damage, elevated cardiac markers, and worsening lactic acidosis. The patient was recognized as having propofol infusion syndrome and propofol was immediately discontinued and replaced with dexmedetomidine. Unfortunately the patient progressed to multi-organ failure complicated by rhabdomyolysis and distributive intravascular coagulopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Propofol is often used as an anesthetic for jet ventilation during otolaryngologic airway surgery. Propofol related infusion syndrome is an uncommon but life-threatening peri-operative complication that should be considered in any patient with an unusual post-operative recovery characterized by metabolic acidosis, ECG changes, end organ damage, and elevated lactate.
