Title: Thioredoxin-1 and Correlations of the Plasma Cytokines Regarding Aortic Valve Stenosis Severity.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) develops not only with a pronounced local inflammatory response, but also oxidative stress is involved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma levels of thioredoxin-1 (TRX1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), chemerin, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), and metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3, and -9 in acquired AS patients as well as to clarify the correlations of TXR1 and the plasma inflammatory biomarkers regarding AS severity. AS patients were classified into three groups: 16 patients with mild AS stenosis, 19 with moderate and 11 with severe AS, and 30 subjects without AS were selected as a control group. AS patients had significantly higher plasma levels of TRX1 compared to controls, but the highest difference was found in mild AS patients compared to the controls. We conclude that AS is associated with significantly increased plasma TRX1 levels, and TRX1 might serve as a specific and sensitive biomarker of AS. TRX1 and also chemerin, GDF-15, VEGF-A, FGF-2 and FGF-21 significantly correlate with AS severity degrees. TRX1 also showed positive association with FGF-2, VEGF-A, and MMP-3 in all AS patients.
