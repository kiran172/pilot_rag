Title: Lung transplant and severe coronary artery disease: results from a single-centre experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The management of severe coronary artery disease at the time of a lung transplant remains a challenge. We analysed the short- and long-term outcomes of lung transplant recipients with severe coronary artery disease.
METHODS: Records of adult patients who received transplants at our institution between April 2010 and February 2021 were reviewed retrospectively. Severe coronary artery disease was defined as coronary stenosis ≥70% (main stem ≥50%) seen on the coronary angiographic scans performed before or at the time of listing. Patient characteristics, perioperative and long-term outcomes were compared between patients with and without severe coronary artery disease.
RESULTS: Among 896 patients who received lung transplants who had undergone coronary angiography before the transplant, 77 (8.5%) had severe coronary artery disease; the remaining 819 (91.5%) did not. Patients with severe coronary artery disease were older (p &lt; 0.0001), more often male (p &lt; 0.0001) and received transplants more often for pulmonary fibrosis (p = 0.0007). The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 46 (20-76) months. At the Cox multivariable analysis, severe coronary artery disease was not associated with death. Patients with pretransplant percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and patients with coronary artery bypass graft surgery concomitant to a transplant had survival equivalent to that of patients without severe coronary artery disease (p = 0.513; p = 0.556).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe coronary artery disease was not associated with decreased survival after a lung transplant. Concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery and pretransplant percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can be used for revascularization.
