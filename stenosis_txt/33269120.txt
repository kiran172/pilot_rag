Title: A Complicated Peptic Ulcer With Bleeding, Gastric Outlet Obstruction, and Choledochoduodenal Fistula.

Abstract: Although peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a common entity, the rate of its complication has decreased with the advent of proton pump inhibitors. We present a case of complicated PUD in a 49-year-old male patient having a rare combination of bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, and a large choledochoduodenal fistula (CDF) who presented with shock. After resuscitation and investigations, ligation of bleeder via duodenotomy, Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy was done for ulcer bleeding, CDF, and pyloric stenosis respectively. The patient improved after surgery. As with other emergency surgery, minimizing morbidity and mortality remains the principle of management. The best treatment in this situation irrespective of hemodynamic stability is surgery, which is a one-time and best treatment for bleeding, obstruction, and CDF.
