Title: [Genetic Analysis of Cerebrovascular Diseases].

Abstract: With advances in genetic analysis technology, the genetic and molecular backgrounds of cerebrovascular diseases have become clearer. In moyamoya disease and intracranial artery stenosis, RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys has been identified as a disease susceptibility gene variant(germline variant), and various analyses have been conducted. PDGFRB mutations have been identified as characteristic somatic variants in cerebral aneurysms and are attracting attention. In addition, PIK3CA and MAP3K3 mutaions have been identified in cerebral cavernous malformations as somatic variants. Moreover, KRAS and BRAF mutations have been identified in arteriovenous malformations as somatic variants, respectively. Further studies are in progress. We reviewed the results of recent genetic analyses of cerebrovascular diseases, focusing particularly on genetic mutations.
