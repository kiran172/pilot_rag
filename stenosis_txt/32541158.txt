Title: [Superior Vena Cava Syndrome].

Abstract: Superior vena cava(SVC)syndrome is a syndrome caused by impaired venous return due to stenosis of the SVC. Most of such cases are due to tumors(non-small cell lungcancer, small cell lungcancer, malignant lymphoma, etc), and the most common cause of SVC syndrome is lungcancer. Symptoms of SVC syndrome are caused by external compression of the SVC, direct invasion, internal thrombus or embolization. Increased venous pressure results in objective findings including edema of the face and neck, edema of the upper limbs, superficial precordial vein distension due to collateral circulation, and hoarseness and subjective symptoms includingcoug h, dyspnea, syncope, headache, and dizziness. SVC syndrome impair the patient's quality of life(QOL). Although there are cases of spontaneous remission, SVC syndrome is recognized as one of the oncologic emergencies because brain and laryngeal edema can be fatal and urgent care should be provided. Therapeutic modalities include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, stent placement and surgery. Treatment should be determined comprehensively based on the severity, histological type, standard therapy for the histological type and its sensitivity. It is necessary to make a definitive histopathological diagnosis as soon as possible and to cooperate with other departments to promptly select the most appropriate treatment.
