Title: Vascular reconstruction of segmental intestinal grafts using autologous internal iliac vessels.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess whether the autologous internal iliac artery and vein could be used as an interpositional graft for vascular reconstruction in segmental intestinal allografts and autografts.
METHODS: Thirty-four intestinal transplants (19 living-related allografts and 15 autografts) were conducted in our programs between January 2011 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, type of vascular reconstruction, and post-operative complications were reviewed.
RESULTS: There were 20 males and 14 females with a median age of 35 years. Of 34 grafts, 22 (64.7%) (11 allografts and 11 autografts) were revascularized using the autologous internal iliac artery and vein for reconstruction. Vascular reconstruction on the back table took 21 ± 6 min to complete. Both total operative time and cold ischemia time tended to be longer in the vascular-reconstruction group than in the direct-anastomosis group (530 ± 226 vs 440 ± 116 and 159 ± 49 vs 125 ± 66 min, respectively), but these differences were not significant. The incidence of vascular thrombosis tended to be higher in the direct-anastomosis group than in the vascular-reconstruction group (16.7% vs 0%, P = 0.118). At a median follow-up of 36.9 months, no stenosis or pseudoaneurysms developed. In 19 allografts, acute rejection occurred in 4 (21.1%) and chronic rejection occurred in 1 (5.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the use of an autologous internal iliac interposition graft greatly facilitates intestinal graft implantation and minimizes the risk of vascular complications.
