Title: Sex Differences in Coronary Artery Disease Characteristics Among Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) results from coronary supply and demand imbalance and has a poor prognosis. It is crucial to identify potential sex-based differences in the prevalence and nature of coronary artery disease (CAD) within this population.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex-based disease differences in type 2 MI among patients evaluated with coronary computed tomography angiography and fractional flow reserve.
METHODS: In a single-center, prospective study, patients with strictly adjudicated type 2 MI underwent coronary computed tomography angiography with fractional flow reserve.
RESULTS: Among 50 study participants enrolled, 50% were women. A similar mix of MI precipitants was present in both sexes. ST-segment depression was more common in women (64% vs 32%), while men were more likely to have T wave inversion (68% vs 36%). Women and men had comparable coronary artery calcium scores (median: 152 [Q1, Q3: 45, 762] vs 234 [Q1, Q3: 56, 422]). Prevalence of any CAD (84% vs 100%), obstructive CAD (24% vs 28%), and hemodynamically significant focal stenosis (20% vs 32%) were similar between sexes. Total plaque volume was similar between sexes, but women had significantly lower levels of low-attenuation plaque (median: 3 [Q1, Q3: 1, 7] vs 9 [Q1, Q3: 3, 14]).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 MI, prevalence of any CAD and obstructive CAD did not differ according to sex. Total plaque volume was similar between sexes, but women had a lower volume of low-attenuation plaque (DEFINing the PrEvalence and Characteristics of Coronary Artery Disease Among Patients With TYPE 2 Myocardial Infarction Using CT-FFR [DEFINE TYPE2MI]; NCT04864119).
