Title: Intra-Arterial Hemodynamics to Guide the Percutaneous Treatment of a Difficult-to-Engage Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is the most frequent vascular complication after renal transplantation. TRAS is associated with resistant hypertension and allograft dysfunction, early diagnosis and either endovascular or surgical treatment is crucial to preserve graft function. Noninvasive imaging can usually detect the underlying stenosis. In this report we present a novel technique for successful angioplasty and stent deployment in a difficult-to-engage transplant-renal artery.
