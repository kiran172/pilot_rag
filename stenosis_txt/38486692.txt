Title: Echocardiography in Simple Congenital Heart Diseases: Guiding Adult Patient Management.

Abstract: This article provides comprehensive insights into the evaluation of simple congenital heart diseases (CHDs) in adults, emphasizing the pivotal role of echocardiography. By focusing on conditions such as congenital aortic stenosis, aortic coarctation, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defects (ASDs), and ventricular septal defects (VSDs), the review underscores echocardiography's intricate contributions to precise clinical decision-making. Echocardiography serves as the primary imaging modality, offering high-resolution visualization of anatomical anomalies and quantification of hemodynamic parameters. It enables tailored therapeutic strategies through its capacity to discern the dimensions, spatial orientation, and dynamic shunt dynamics of defects such as ASDs and VSDs. Moreover, echocardiography's advanced techniques, such as tissue Doppler imaging and speckle tracking, provide detailed insights into atrial mechanics, diastolic function, and ventricular filling kinetics. Integration of echocardiographic findings into clinical practice empowers clinicians to create personalized interventions based on quantified ventricular function, which spans systolic and diastolic aspects. This approach facilitates risk stratification and therapeutic planning, particularly pertinent in heart failure management within the CHD patient population. In summary, echocardiography transcends its role as an imaging tool, emerging as a precision-guided instrument adept at navigating the complexities of simple CHD in adults. Its ability to expedite diagnosis, quantify hemodynamic impacts, and unravel multifaceted functional dynamics culminates in a comprehensive depiction of these conditions. The fusion of these insights with clinical expertise empowers clinicians to navigate the intricate pathways of CHD, crafting tailored therapeutic strategies characterized by precision and efficacy.
