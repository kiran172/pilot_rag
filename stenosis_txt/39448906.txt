Title: Effectiveness of endoscopic papillectomy with stent placement in pancreatic and bile ducts for treating duodenal papillary adenoma: a retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Duodenal papillary adenoma, a potentially malignant benign tumor is primarily treated with endoscopic papillectomy. Despite its efficacy, endoscopic papillectomy has a high complication rate. This study investigates whether pancreatic duct and common bile duct stent placement can mitigate these complications.
METHODS: In a retrospective observational analysis, 79 patients with duodenal papillary adenoma, treated with endoscopic papillectomy at our center, were studied. The cohort included patients who underwent endoscopic papillectomy with no stents placement, common bile duct stent placement alone, pancreatic duct stent placement alone, or stents placement in both ducts. We assessed the outcomes of endoscopic papillectomy, including complete resection rate and recurrence rate as the primary and secondary outcomes respectively. In the meantime, the incidence of complications were also analysed as the safety outcomes.
RESULTS: Complete resection rates did not significantly differ between patients with or without stent placement (85.7% P group vs. 89.2% N-P group, P = 0.64). Early complication rates were similar across groups. However, significant reduction in common bile duct stenosis was observed in the stenting group (0% B group vs. 10.5% N-B group, P = 0.03). Furthermore, stent placement correlated with lower adenoma recurrence rates during follow-up (2.4% P group vs. 16.2% N-P group, P = 0.03; 2.4% B group vs. 15.8% N-B group, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic duct and common bile duct stent placement in endoscopic papillectomy may decrease late complications, particularly common bile duct stenosis, and reduce the recurrence of duodenal papillary adenoma.
