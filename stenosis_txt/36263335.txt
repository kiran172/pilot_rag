Title: The current status and surgical outcome of the minimally invasive techniques for lumbar interbody fusion in India: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The global shift of trends to minimally invasive spine (MIS) surgery for lumbar degenerative diseases has become prominent in India for few decades. We aimed to assess the current status of MIS techniques for lumbar interbody fusion and their surgical outcomes in the Indian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review (following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines) was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar till November 2020. The primary (visual analog scale [VAS] and oswestry disability index [ODI] scores; intraoperative blood loss; duration of surgery; duration of hospital stay, and fusion rate) and secondary (wound-associated complications and dural tear/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak) outcomes were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4 software.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies comprising a total of 1318 patients were included for analysis. The pooled mean of follow-up duration was 26.64 ± 8.43 months (range 5.7-36.5 months). Degenerative spondylolisthesis of Myerding grade I/II was the most common indication, followed by lytic listhesis, herniated prolapsed disc, and lumbar canal stenosis. The calculated pooled standard mean difference (SMD) suggested a significant decrease in postoperative ODI scores (SMD = 5.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.77-7.29; P &lt; 0.01) and VAS scores (SMD = 6.50, 95% CI = 4.6-8.4; P &lt; 0.01). The pooled mean blood loss, duration of postoperative hospital stay, duration of surgery, and fusion rate were 127.75 ± 52.79 mL, 4.78 ± 3.88 days, 178.59 ± 38.69 min, and 97.53% ± 2.69%, respectively. A total of 334 adverse events were recorded in 1318 patients, giving a complication rate of 25.34%.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) is the most common minimally invasive technique employed for lumbar interbody fusion in India, while oblique lumbar interbody fusion is in the initial stages. The surgical and outcome-related factors improved significantly after MIS LIF in the Indian population.
