Title: Surgical tips and tricks for laparoscopic intragastric surgery for submucosal tumors relative to the esophagogastric junction.

Abstract: Recent reports have described the practicality of laparoscopic intragastric surgery (l-IGS) as an alternative for resecting submucosal tumors (SMTs) near the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), where excision using an exogastric approach would be difficult. However, even using IGS to perform a full-thickness resection of SMTs that are in or extremely close to the EGJ is very difficult to do safely and avoid disrupting or causing stenosis of the EGJ, without advanced experience. This study retrospectively examined the usefulness of l-IGS for gastric SMTs located in or extremely close to the EGJ. Fourteen patients with gastric SMTs < 2 cm of the EGJ and underwent l-IGS were eligible for this study. We examined the tumor location, operative time, intraoperative hemorrhage, degree of deformation, gastroesophageal reflux disease, perioperative complications, and recurrence. Furthermore, we compared patients with tumors in the EGJ with those with tumors near the EGJ and patients in whom three-port l-IGS was performed with those who underwent single-incision laparoscopic surgery. The average tumor size, operative time, intraoperative hemorrhage, and postoperative hospitalization of the 14 patients were 30.9 ± 21.3 mm, 125.2 ± 31.1 min, 30.7 ± 103.3 mL, and 9.2 ± 3.1 d, respectively. No differences in these parameters according to the type of l-IGS or tumor location were observed. All patients underwent l-IGS without complications and were free from EGJ deformation or esophagitis. We believe that l-IGS is useful for gastric SMTs located < 2 cm of the EGJ as it can be safely performed for difficult tumor locations and does not cause deformation of the EGJ.
