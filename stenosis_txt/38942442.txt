Title: Technical Note on the Role of Kambin's Triangle in the Evolution of Total Joint Replacement of the Lumbar Spine.

Abstract: We provide a historical and technical perspective on the evolution of Kambin's triangle as a safe working corridor for percutaneous access to the intervertebral disc to an anatomically expanded space to accommodate and facilitate open lumbar total joint replacement. The nearly 6-decade progression from intradiscal access in the intact lumbar spine to an enlarged working space following facetectomy to accommodate a transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, and eventual further expansion via pedicle vertebral body osteotomy to support motion preservation with total joint replacement, represents a unique evolutionary pathway in surgical technique development. For each of these steps in evolution, we detail and provide the historical context of the corresponding surgical modifications required to expand the original anatomical boundaries of Kambin's triangle. It is postulated that the introduction of machine learning technologies coupled with innovations in robotics, materials science, and advanced imaging will further accelerate and refine the adaptation of more complex, precise, and efficacious surgical procedures to treat spinal degeneration via this working corridor.
