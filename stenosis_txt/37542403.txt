Title: Ectopic Opening of Common Bile Duct into Duodenal Bulb and Gastric Antrum and Its Importance.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ectopic opening of the common bile duct (CBD) is extremely rare, and its importance has not been adequately defined. The aim of our study is to present the characteristics of patients with this abnormality.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in a tertiary center in Dicle University Hospital, Diyarbakır, Turkey, between October 2008 and December 2020. We present clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and cholangiographic features as well as the success rate of therapeutic interventions of consecutive patients with this abnormality undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
RESULTS: Ectopic opening of the CBD was identified in 29 (21 men; mean age 62) out of 3872 (0.74%) patients. There was a history of cholecystectomy in 14 (48%) and recurrent acute cholangitis in 20 (69%) patients. We found peptic ulcer in 13 (45%) and duodenal deformity associated with apical stenosis in 21 (72%) patients. Opening site was seen as abnormal in all patients, and it opened into the antrum in 2 (6.8%) and into the first part of the duodenum in 27 (93%) patients. Copious amount of bile and/ or bile sediment in the stomach were seen in all patients. We observed dilatation in both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts together with tapered narrowing and a hook-shaped distal end of CBD in all patients. There was bile stone in 26 (89%) and sludge in 3 (10%) patients. Sphincterotomy was not performed in any patients because there was not enough incision distance. Balloon dilatation was performed for extraction of stone and sludge in all patients. Complete stone extraction was achieved in only 7 out of 26 (27%) patients.
CONCLUSION: Ectopic opening of CBD is usually associated with gastroduodenal and bile ducts disease. Endoscopic treatment is unsatisfactory in most patients with this abnormality.
