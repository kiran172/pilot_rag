Title: Risk factors for decannulation failure after single-stage reconstruction of adult post-intubation tracheal stenosis: 10-year experience at a tertiary center.

Abstract: Background: Although the risk factors for decannulation failure have been discussed in the literature, there are many unclear points on this issue.Aims and objectives: To identify risk factors for developing decannulation failure after single-stage surgical reconstruction of post-intubation tracheal stenosis (TS).Material and methods: A total of 45 adult patients with post-intubation TS admitted to our institution and underwent single-stage surgical reconstruction between April 2008 and May 2018. Nine patients developed decannulation failure by postoperative 6 months (Failed Decannulation Group), and 36 patients were decannulated successfully (Successful Decannulation Group). Causal factors of intubation were noted. Patient-related risk factors of decannulation failure were compared between two groups.Results: Failed Decannulation Group had a significantly higher body mass index (p = .034) and were more likely to have diabetes (p = .025). Patients who were previously intubated for more than 48 h (p = .043) were significantly more likely to have decannulation failure. The presence of comorbid diseases did not place a patient under statistically significant risk of decannulation failure.Conclusion: Patients with high body mass index, the ones with diabetes, and patients who were previously intubated for more than 48 h were more likely to develop decannulation failure.
