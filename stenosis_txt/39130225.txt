Title: Closing the Gap: Exploring the Role of Cap Grafts in Tracheocutaneous Fistula Closure.

Abstract: Exploring the Role of Cap Grafts in tracheocutaneous fistula Closure. A tracheocutaneous fistula (TCF) is an abnormal connection that forms between the trachea (windpipe) and the skin of the neck. If spontaneous closure does not occur, fibrosis of the surrounding tissue may result in a persistent TCF and in some cases, iatrogenic laryngotracheal stenosis at the level of tracheostoma, the so-called A-frame deformity. In all 5 patients, Conchal cartilage was harvested. The new de-epithelialized stoma is measured, and the previously harvested graft is cut to match the defect. Passing through the centre of the tracheal cartilage and into the centre of the auricular cartilage graft, 3-0 PDS, horizontal mattress sutures are placed sequentially around the periphery of the graft, stabilised with Right SCM flap and skin was closed in layers. In each of the five cases, we achieved a resounding success by skilfully closing the fistulas and meticulously restoring the structural integrity. Equally noteworthy, all patients expressed contentment with the cosmetic outcomes at both the donor site and the neck region, deeming it as an acceptable aesthetic result.
