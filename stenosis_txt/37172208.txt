Title: Mild aortic insufficiency following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Post-procedural aortic insufficiency (AI) continues to be prevalent following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). While several studies have assessed the outcomes of moderate-severe AI following TAVR, the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of mild AI remain unclear.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies reporting on mild AI following TAVR. The primary outcome was pooled incidence of post-TAVR mild AI. Secondary outcomes included pooled incidence of mild AI at 30 days and long term. The pooled incidence of midterm mortality in patients with post-TAVR mild AI was also evaluated. The random effect generalized linear mixed-effects model with logit-transformed proportions and Hartung-Knapp adjustment was used to calculate pooled incidence rates. Meta-regression was performed to identify predictors of mild AI.
RESULTS: The pooled analysis included 19,241 patients undergoing TAVR across 50 studies. The mean age of patients ranged from 73 to 85 years, and female patients ranged from 20.0% to 83.3%. The overall pooled incidence of post-TAVR mild AI was 56.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.64). The pooled incidence of mild AI at 30 days was 33.7% (95% CI 0.12-0.37). At mean follow-up of 1.15 years, the pooled incidence of mild AI was 37.0% (95% CI 0.16-0.45). The overall pooled incidence of Midterm mortality (mean follow-up 1.22 years) in patients with mild AI was 14.8% (95% CI 0.10-0.25). At meta-regression, none of the explored variables correlated with a difference in mild AI incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: In published studies to date, 50% of patients undergoing TAVR develop mild AI postoperatively. In 37% of patients, this persists in long term. Though the incidence of AI is likely improving with newer generation TAVR valves, the prevalence and outcomes of mild AI should be closely monitored as TAVR volume and indications expand to younger patients with long life expectancy. The long-term outcomes of mild AI remain unclear. Further dedicated studies on post-TAVR mild AI are needed.
