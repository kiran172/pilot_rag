Title: Metabolomic Signature of Human Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: This study outlines the first step toward creating the metabolite atlas of human calcified aortic valves by identifying the expression of metabolites and metabolic pathways involved at various stages of calcific aortic valve stenosis progression. Untargeted analysis identified 72 metabolites and lipids that were significantly altered (p < 0.01) across different stages of disease progression. Of these metabolites and lipids, the levels of lysophosphatidic acid were shown to correlate with faster hemodynamic progression and could select patients at risk for faster progression rate.
