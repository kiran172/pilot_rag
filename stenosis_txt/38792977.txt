Title: High Prevalence of Myocardial Bridging Detected in an Indonesian Population Using Multi-Detector Computed Tomography.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Myocardial bridging (MB) is still not yet considered a significant finding in Indonesia both radiographically and clinically. Hence, this article aims to assess the prevalence of MB using multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and look at factors contributing to stenosis amongst patients with MB. Materials and Methods: This study is cross-sectional in a single centre, with consecutive sampling, looking at all patients who underwent a multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scan from February 2021 until February 2023. GraphPad Prism version 9.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA, USA) was used to analyse the results. Results: There are 1029 patients with an MB, yielding a prevalence of 44.3% (95%CI 42.3-46.4). The left anterior descending vessel is the most commonly implicated, with 99.6%. Among those with stenosis, the middle portion of the bridging vessel is the most common site of stenosis (n = 269), followed by the proximal portion (n = 237). The severity of stenosis is more often moderate, with 30-50% (n = 238). Females (odds ratio [OR] of 1.8, 95%CI 1.4-2.3; p-value &lt; 0.0001), older age (t-value 5.6, p-value &lt; 0.0001), symptomatic patients (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9; p-value = 0.013), and higher mean coronary artery calcium score (t-value 11.3, p-value &lt; 0.0001) are more likely to have stenosis. The degree of stenosis is significantly higher in the proximal stenosis group than in the middle stenosis group (t-value 27, p-value &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Our research demonstrates that MB may prevent atheromatosis of the coronary segment distal to the MB and predispose the development of atherosclerosis in the section proximal to the bridge.
