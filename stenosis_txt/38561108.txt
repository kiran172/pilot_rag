Title: Aortopathy and aortic valve surgery in patients with bicuspid aortic valve with and without raphe.

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the association between raphe in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients and valve dysfunction, aortopathy and aortic valve surgery in the REBECCA registry [REgistro della valvola aortica Bicuspide della Società Italiana di ECocardiografia e CArdiovascular Imaging (SIECVI)].
METHODS: Prevalence of aortic valve dysfunction and aortopathy was investigated in BAV patients with and without raphe. Aortic valve dysfunction (regurgitation or stenosis) was categorized as mild, moderate and severe. Aortopathy was defined as annulus ≥14 mm/m2; root ≥20 mm/m2; sinotubular junction ≥16 mm/m2; ascending aorta ≥17 mm/m2, and classified in Type A, isolated ascending aorta dilatation; Type B, aortic root and ascending aorta dilatation; and Type C, isolated aortic root dilatation.
RESULTS: Overall, 695 patients with BAV were enrolled; 520 (74.8%) with raphe and 175 (25.2%) without raphe. BAV patients with raphe presented more frequently with moderate or severe aortic stenosis than BAV patients without raphe (183 [35.2%] vs 34 [19.4%], p < 0.001). A higher prevalence of aortopathy, particularly Type B, was observed in patients with vs without raphe. At multivariable analysis, raphe was a predictor of aortic valve surgery at three-year follow-up (odds ratio 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.08-4.44, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BAV and raphe have a higher prevalence of significant aortic stenosis, aortopathy, especially Type B, and a higher risk of undergoing aortic valve surgery at three-year follow-up.
