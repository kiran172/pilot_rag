Title: Use of intracranial stent as rescue therapy after mechanical thrombectomy failure-9-year experience in a comprehensive stroke centre.

Abstract: PURPOSE: There is no established rescue treatment in patients with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) failure. Our aim is to analyse whether the use of an intracranial stent improves prognosis in these patients.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of patients with ischemic stroke due to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCA) or distal intracranial carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, from September 2009 to April 2019 in our comprehensive stroke care centre. Patients with MT failure were identified and dichotomized into two groups according to whether or not an intracranial stent was implanted. We analysed clinical outcomes in both groups.
RESULTS: There was MT failure in 60 patients (14%) of the 433 with large vessel occlusion in distal ICA and proximal MCA. A stent was placed in 20 of them (33.3%). Compared to patients without rescue stenting, they showed better rates of independence at 3 months (mRS ≤ 2) 45% vs 2.5% (p < 0.001) and lower mortality 15% vs 50% (p = 0.009), maintaining statistical significance after multivariate analysis, without a significant increase of the rate of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (p = 0.209).
CONCLUSION: Placement of an intracranial stent as rescue therapy after MT failure was associated with better clinical outcome without significant increase in haemorrhagic complications. We believe that this procedure should be appraised in these patients.
