Title: Severe mitral valve insufficiency caused by standard surgical aortic valve implantation and its reparation using suture-less prosthesis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis is the most frequent cardiac valve pathology in the western world. Surgical aortic valve replacement is the gold standard for the treatment of significant degenerative aortic valve diseases.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case report highlights an unexpected abnormal iatrogenic shortening of the aorto-mitral continuity and its deformity, during traditional AVR using sutured stented aortic prosthesis as the first choice, which caused significant mitral valve regurgitation. The suture-less prosthesis was a rescue choice to restore the geometry and eliminate the deformation of the aorto-mitral continuity.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve replacement using suture-less prosthesis could be a valuable optional choice for lowering the risk of deformation of the aortic annulus and aorto-mitral continuity. It might provide better outcomes in combined procedures.
