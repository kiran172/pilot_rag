Title: Percutaneous endovascular stenting to treat left ventricular assist device outflow graft stenosis.

Abstract: A 72-year-old woman presented with acute symptoms of congestive heart failure exacerbation and cardiogenic shock secondary to flow alarms in her HeartMate II left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placed in 2013. Her rapid deterioration required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation placement with subsequent cardiac catheterization. A computed tomography scan corroborated 90% stenosis of the LVAD outflow graft with mural thrombus causing cardiogenic shock. A multidisciplinary team proceeded with endovascular treatment of the LVAD outflow obstruction via realignment with percutaneous angioplasty and placement of covered stent grafts. After in-hospital recovery, she was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
