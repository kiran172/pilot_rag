Title: An Updated Comprehensive Review of Existing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Access.

Abstract: For the past 20Â years, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been the treatment of choice for symptomatic aortic stenosis. The transfemoral (TF) access is considered the gold standard approach for TAVR. However, TF-TAVR cannot be performed in some patients; thus, alternative accesses are required. Our review paper generalises the TAVR accesses currently available, including the transapical, transaortic, trans-subclavian/axillary, transcarotid, transcaval, and suprasternal approaches. Their advantages and disadvantages have been analysed. Since there is no standard recommendation for an alternative approach, access selection depends on the expertise of the local cardiac team, patient characteristics, and access properties. Each TAVR centre is recommended to master a minimum of one non-TF access alternative. Of note, more evidence is required to delve into the clinical outcomes of each approach, at both early and long-term (Figure 1).
