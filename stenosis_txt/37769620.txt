Title: Long-term clinical outcomes of excimer laser coronary atherectomy for the management of recurrent in-stent restenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recurrent in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a serious problem. Optimal modification of the underlying mechanism during index percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is key to prevent ISR. Excimer laser coronary atherectomy (ELCA) has its own indications and is among others used in recurrent ISR in case of stent underexpansion and/or diffuse neointimal hyperplasia. We aimed to assess the long-term clinical outcomes of ELCA for the management of recurrent ISR.
METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective observational study was conducted. Patients with recurrent ISR who were additionally treated with ELCA were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, target lesion revascularization at 12 months, and longer term.
RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2022, 51 patients underwent PCI with the additional use ELCA for recurrent ISR. Primary outcome occurred in 6 patients (11.8%) at 12 months and in 12 patients (23.5%) at a median follow-up of 4 (1-6) years. Technical and procedural success were achieved in 92% and 90% of cases, respectively. Coronary perforation occurred in 2 patients as a result of distal wire perforation, but was not ELCA-related. There were no in-hospital MACE.
CONCLUSIONS: ELCA appears to be a safe method with acceptable long-term results for the management of recurrent ISR.
