Title: Effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and associated factors in access hand oxygenation in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Abstract: In hemodialysis (HD) patients with arteriovenous fistula (AVF), changes in systemic or peripheral tissue circulation occur non-physiologically via the presence of AVF; however, associations between blood flow and tissue oxygenation in the brain and access hand are uncertain. In this study, 85 HD patients with AVF were included and evaluated for changes in flow volume (FV) and regional oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) in the brain and hands with AVF before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Furthermore, we evaluated the factors that determine access hand rSO<sub>2</sub> without stenosis after PTA. Brachial arterial FV increased after PTA (p &lt; 0.001), and carotid FV decreased (p = 0.008). Access hand rSO<sub>2</sub> significantly decreased after PTA (p &lt; 0.001), but cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> did not significantly change (p = 0.317). In multivariable linear regression analysis of factors associated with access hand rSO<sub>2</sub>, serum creatinine (standardized coefficient: 0.296) and hemoglobin (standardized coefficient: 0.249) were extracted as independent factors for access hand rSO<sub>2</sub>. In conclusion, a decrease in access hand oxygenation and maintenance of cerebral oxygenation were observed throughout PTA. To maintain access hand oxygenation, it is important to adequately manage Hb level and maintain muscle mass, in addition to having an AVF with appropriate blood flow.
