Title: Treatment via oral midodrine in a patient with prolonged hypotension following carotid artery stenting: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hypotension and bradycardia are common hemodynamic complications following carotid artery stenting in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and inotropes such as dopamine are conventional treatments for post-carotid artery stenting hypotension. However, in case of resistant hypotension, there is no clear treatment method. In this report, while intravenous fluid and inotropes did not resolve the patient's hypotension, oral midodrine treated post-carotid artery stenting hypotension.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present an 82-year-old Caucasian man complaining of a single episode of unilateral visual loss. The patient had left internal carotid artery stenosis and underwent carotid artery stenting. After the procedure, he developed prolonged post-carotid artery stenting hypotension, which was resistant to intravenous fluids and inotropes but immediately showed a promising response to oral midodrine.
CONCLUSION: Oral midodrine can be considered in treatment of post-carotid artery stenting hemodynamic complications.
