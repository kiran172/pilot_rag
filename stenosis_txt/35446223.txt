Title: Surgical Repair of Supravalvar Aortic Stenosis in Association With Transverse and Proximal Descending Aortic Abnormalities.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) may be an isolated defect of the proximal ascending aorta. However, more severe cases have extension of the arteriopathy into the transverse and proximal descending aorta. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with SVAS with and without aortic arch arteriopathy.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 58 patients who underwent surgical repair of SVAS. The median age at repair was 18 months. A total of 37 patients had Williams syndrome. A total of 31 (53%) patients had associated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis and 23 (39%) had coronary artery ostial stenosis (CAOS).
RESULTS: A total of 37 of 58 (64%) patients had surgical repair of SVAS without the need for arch intervention while 21 (36%) patients had repair of the distal aortic arch. There were 3 (5.2%) operative deaths, 2 of whom had aortic arch involvement and one without arch involvement. There were 2 deaths after discharge from the hospital. Patients who needed arch surgery were more likely to have severe arch gradients compared to those without arch involvement (71% vs 30%, P &lt; .05), were more likely to undergo concomitant procedures for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis or CAOS (90% vs 62%, P &lt; .05), and to have Williams syndrome (86% vs 51%, P &lt; .05).
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of patients who had SVAS repair at our institution had procedures directed at the transverse or proximal descending aorta. Patients with arch involvement had more severe arch obstruction, required more concomitant procedures, and were more likely to have Williams syndrome.
