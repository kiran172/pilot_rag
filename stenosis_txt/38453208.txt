Title: Home-based mobile-guided exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (REHAB-TAVR): protocol for a randomised clinical trial.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a standard treatment for aortic stenosis, particularly in older adults. Reduced exercise capacity and frailty significantly impact outcomes in TAVR patients, yet current management lacks strategies to address these issues. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of home-based mobile-guided exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation in TAVR patients, led by a multidisciplinary team with clear progression milestones.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study involves 90 patients aged 60-89 in a single centre who will be randomised to a 3-month novel multidomain exercise intervention or routine care. Outcome assessors will be blinded towards group allocation. The primary outcome is the 6-min walk distance at month 3. The secondary outcomes include the 6-min walk distance at month 6, physical function measured by total Short Physical Performance Battery score and exercise adherence measured by the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale at months 3 and 6. Additional outcome measures, including rehospitalisations, death, handgrip strength, frailty (Fried Criteria and Essential Toolset), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), quality of life (EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level), nutritional status (Mini-Nutritional Assessment), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), functional capacity (Duke Activity Status Index), clinical indices (body mass index, symptoms, signs, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), N-Terminal Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide, etc) and social support (Lubben Social Network Scale-6), along with comprehensive cost analysis, enhance the study's significance. The study's findings hold crucial implications for crafting an effective exercise-focused cardiac rehabilitation strategy for TAVR patients. Community implementation not only deepens understanding but also fosters the potential integration of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation into self-care, promising enhanced patient adherence and overall cardiovascular health management.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University Ethics Committee (B2022-062R). Results will be disseminated to local stakeholders and the research community through publications and conferences.
