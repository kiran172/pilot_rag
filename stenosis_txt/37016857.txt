Title: Biportal Endoscopic Posterior Cervical Foraminotomy for Adjacent 2-Level Foraminal Lesions Using a Single Approach (Sliding Technique).

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) using uniportal or biportal endoscopic approach has been performed for cervical foraminal stenosis or foraminal disc herniation. Two-level PCF is possible using a single biportal endoscopic approach. The purpose of this study was to present a technique of biportal endoscopic PCF for contiguous 2-level foraminal lesions using a single approach and its clinical results.
METHODS: Patients who received 2-level PCF using a single biportal endoscopic approach were enrolled in this study. We analyzed their clinical data including age, sex, complications, and Neck Disability Index (NDI), and visual analogue scale (VAS) of neck and arm. Postoperative magnetic resonance image was taken on the first postoperative day to determine whether there was sufficient decompression.
RESULTS: We successfully performed biportal endoscopic PCF for adjacent 2-level foraminal lesions using a single approach (sliding technique) in all 12 patients. There were cervical foraminal disc herniation with foraminal stenosis (5 cases) and 2-level foraminal stenosis (7 cases). Preoperative mean NDI and VAS of arm and neck significantly decreased at 12 months after surgery. Postoperative clinical outcomes were excellent in 5 patients, good in 6 patients, and fair in 1 patient. There was no major complication.
CONCLUSION: Two-level PCF could be performed using a single approach biportal endoscopic surgery with only 2 skin incisions. Clinical outcomes are favorable. This sliding PCF technique using biportal endoscopic approach might be an alternative surgical treatment for contiguous 2-level cervical foraminal pathologic lesions.
