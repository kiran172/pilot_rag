Title: Analysis of Complications and Recipients' and Graft Survival in Patients 60 Years of Age and Older in the Long-Term Follow-up Period After Kidney Transplant: A Single-Center, Paired Kidney Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term results of kidney transplant (KTx) in older patients may differ from younger recipients owing to increased cardiovascular comorbidities. The study aimed to analyze surgical and nonsurgical complications that develop in the long-term follow-up period after KTx, and factors that influence results of KTx in recipients aged 60 years and older (≥60) compared with younger recipients (<60).
METHODS: One hundred seventy-five patients aged ≥60 years and 175 patients aged <60 years who received a kidney graft from the same deceased donor were enrolled in the study. In the long-term follow-up period (3 months to 5 years after KTx) the incidence of surgical and nonsurgical complications, as well as patient and kidney graft survival, were compared. Additionally, the influence of early complications on patients and kidney graft survival was assessed.
RESULTS: There were no differences between recipients aged ≥60 years compared with recipients aged <60 years in occurrence of surgical complications (graft artery stenosis: 0.6% vs 2.3%; ureter stenosis: 3.4% vs 1.1%; lymphocele: 6.9% vs 3.4%) and nonsurgical complications (urinary tract infection: 19.4% vs 23.4%; pneumonia: 8.6% vs 8.6%; cytomegalovirus infection: 6.3% vs 8%; new-onset diabetes after transplant: 16.6% vs 17.1%; cancer incidence: 5.7% vs 4.6%; acute rejection episode: 13.1% vs 17.1%). Five-year recipient survival was lower in a group of patients aged ≥60 years (death, 15.4% vs 8%; death with functioning graft, 12% vs 5.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of surgical and nonsurgical complications, as well as kidney-graft survival, in recipients aged ≥60 years in a 5-year follow-up period is comparable to younger recipients aged <60 years.
