Title: Clinical efficacy of treatment for primary tracheal tumors by flexible bronchoscopy: Airway stenosis recanalization and quality of life.

Abstract: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventional treatment of primary tracheal tumors through flexible bronchoscopy. The clinical data of 38 patients with primary tracheal tumours who underwent flexible bronchoscopy intervention therapy between January 2011 and January 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The average time interval from onset of symptoms to the appearance of actual clinical manifestations in the 38 patients ranged from 0 to 60 months, with an average of 8.1±11.6 months and a median of 4.2 months. The rate of misdiagnosis at the first visit was 36.8% (14/38). After interventional treatment, the overall efficiency (complete + partial response) of airway stenosis recanalization in the 38 patients was 89.5%. In 3 patients with benign tumors, the anhelation score was reduced following treatment (1.00±0.77 vs. 3.13±1.21 at the pre-treatment stage; P<0.001). The overall survival rates of the 35 patients at 1, 3 and 5 years were 69.3, 48.7 and 20.3%, respectively. Therefore, flexible bronchoscopic intervention may effectively smoothen the airways of patients and relieve the symptoms of anhelation. Combining radiotherapy and chemotherapy may improve patient prognosis and safety.
