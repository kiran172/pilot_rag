Title: Potential of Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 and Serum Apolipoprotein A2-Isoforms in the Diagnosis of Stage 0 and IA Pancreatic Cancer.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein A2-ATQ/AT (apoA2-ATQ/AT) is a new biomarker for diagnosing pancreatic cancer (PC). In this study, the value of blood carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and apoA2-ATQ/AT levels in diagnosing stage 0 and IA PC was evaluated. During 2014-2021, 12 patients with stage 0 PC and 12 patients with IA PC (average age: 73.8 years) underwent resection at JA Onomichi General Hospital. In addition, the data of 200 healthy controls were collected from a community-based cohort study. Levels of two apoA2-isoforms were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with specific antibodies to calculate the apoA2-i Index as a surrogate value for apoA2-ATQ/AT. The cutoff value for the apoA2-i Index was determined to be 62.9 Î¼g/mL. CA19-9 levels were also measured through ELISA. Among all 24 patients with PC, the positivity rates for apoA2-i and CA19-9 were 33.3% and 25.0%, respectively. The positivity rates for apoA2-i and CA19-9 were 16.7% and 8.3% in patients with stage 0 PC and 50.0% and 41.7% in those with stage IA, respectively. For CA19-9-negative patients, the apoA2-i positivity rate was 9.1% in stage 0 and 42.9% in stage IA. The combined positivity rate for both markers was 16.7% in stage 0 and 66.7% in stage IA. Imaging findings in apoA2-i- and CA19-9-positive patients included pancreatic duct dilatation (87.5%/100%), duct stenosis (75.0%/50%), and atrophy (87.5%/66.7%). The imaging findings of this study suggest that apoA2-i may enhance the sensitivity for detecting CA19-9-negative stage 0 and IA PC, and complementary measurements with CA19-9 may be valuable for diagnosing early-stage PC. Therefore, minute PC with pancreatic duct dilation, duct stenosis, and atrophy may exhibit a high positivity rate, aiding differential diagnosis.
