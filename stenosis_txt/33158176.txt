Title: An Index Combining Lost and Remaining Nerve Fibers Correlates with Pain Hypersensitivity in Mice.

Abstract: Multiple peripheral nerves are known to degenerate after nerve compression injury but the correlation between the extent of nerve alteration and pain severity remains unclear. Here, we used intravital two-photon fluorescence microscopy to longitudinally observe changes in cutaneous fibers in the hind paw of Nav1.8-Cre-tdTomato mice after chronic constriction injury (CCI). Results showed that the CCI led to variable loss of the skin nerve plexus and intraepidermal nerve fibers. The timing of Nav1.8 nerve fiber loss correlated with the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. We compared a scoring approach that assessed whole-paw nerve degeneration with an index that quantified changes in the nerve plexus and terminals in multiple small regions of interest (ROI) from intravital images of the third and fifth toe tips. We found that the number of surviving nerve fibers was not linearly correlated with mechanical hypersensitivity. On the contrary, at 14 days after CCI, the moderately injured mice showed greater mechanical hypersensitivity than the mildly or severely injured mice. This indicates that both surviving and injured nerves are required for evoked neuropathic pain. In addition, these two methods may have the estimative effect as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for the assessment of neuropathic pain.
