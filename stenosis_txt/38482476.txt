Title: Full-depth evaluation of the bile duct with a 7F cholangioscope and its possibility for guiding therapeutics.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Digital single-operator cholangioscopy (DSOC) plays a critical role in directly visualizing and treating the bile duct system. Although various cholangioscopes with different external diameters are available for DSOC, certain challenging scenarios persist in which existing scopes fail to complete a thorough evaluation of the bile ducts. To overcome these limitations, we aimed to introduce and highlight the application of a novel 7F cholangioscope.
METHODS: In this review article we describe the novel 7F cholangioscope, provide its assembly and setup, and review cases in which the 7F cholangioscope was used for diagnostic and therapeutic guidance.
RESULTS: Four cases involving challenging biliary assessments were presented, all of which achieved technical and clinical success. No procedure-related adverse events were reported in any of these cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The 7F cholangioscope can provide additional information regarding the biliary tree and guidance for treatment, overcoming the challenging assessment of small pancreatobiliary ducts and its strictures. Its potential use in cases of severe bile duct stenosis is recommended. However, further studies evaluating safety and efficacy are needed.
