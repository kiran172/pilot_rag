Title: Mitral valvuloplasty complicated by catheter perforation of the right atrium and the aortic root.

Abstract: According to latest guidelines, percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) represents the first-line treatment for symptomatic severe mitral valve stenosis with favorable morphology. We report successful surgical treatment of a potential life-threatening complication occurred during PMC. Heart-team discussion and closed collaboration with centers are crucial for decision-making and cardiac surgery onsite should be ensured for high-risk procedures.
