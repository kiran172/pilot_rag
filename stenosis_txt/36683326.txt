Title: Total arch replacement for re-coarctation of the aorta after a Norwood procedure.

Abstract: This is the first report of total arch replacement to repair re-coarctation. A 14-year-old boy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome developed re-coarctation, severe stenosis of neck vessels, and right ventricle dysfunction after a Norwood procedure. We performed total arch replacement; the postoperative course was unremarkable. He was followed up until 18 years of age and did not need re-intervention. Using artificial blood vessels in total arch replacement is rarely indicated but can be safely achieved when required. Mismatch between patient and graft size may be an issue in the future.
