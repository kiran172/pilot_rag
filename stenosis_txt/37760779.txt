Title: The Role of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Pathways in Different Models of Cardiac Hypertrophy in Rats.

Abstract: Cardiac hypertrophy develops following different triggers of pressure or volume overload. In several previous studies, different hypertrophy types were demonstrated following alterations in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway activation. In the current study, we studied two types of cardiac hypertrophy models in rats: eccentric and concentric hypertrophy. For the eccentric hypertrophy model, iron deficiency anemia caused by a low-iron diet was implemented, while surgical aortic constriction was used to induce aortic stenosis (AS) and concentric cardiac hypertrophy. The hearts were evaluated using echocardiography, histological sections, and scanning electron microscopy. The expression of ERK1/2 was analyzed using Western blot. During the study period, anemic rats developed eccentric hypertrophy characterized by an enlarged left ventricle (LV) cavity cross-sectional area (CSA) (59.9 ± 5.1 mm2 vs. 47 ± 8.1 mm2, p = 0.002), thinner septum (2.1 ± 0.3 mm vs. 2.5 ± 0.2 mm, p &lt; 0.05), and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (52.6% + 4.7 vs. 60.3% + 2.8, p &lt; 0.05). Rats with AS developed concentric hypertrophy with a thicker septum (2.8 ± 0.6 vs. 2.4 ± 0.1 p &lt; 0.05), increased LV muscle cross-sectional area (79.5 ± 9.33 mm2 vs. 57.9 ± 5.0 mm2, p &lt; 0.001), and increased LVEF (70.3% + 2.8 vs. 60.0% + 2.1, p &lt; 0.05). ERK1/2 expression decreased in the anemic rats and increased in the rats with AS. Nevertheless, the p-ERK and the p-MEK did not change significantly in all the examined models. We concluded that ERK1/2 expression was altered by the type of hypertrophy and the change in LVEF.
