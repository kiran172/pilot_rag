Title: Percutaneous Intervention of Cabrol Graft-Left Main Anastomosis.

Abstract: The Cabrol technique involves surgical reimplantation of coronary arteries after aortic root replacement. It uses a Dacron graft interposed between the aortic root graft and the native coronary artery. A stenosis of the graft-coronary anastomosis requires either surgical or percutaneous correction. An understanding of the Cabrol and modified Cabrol techniques and the associated anatomy is essential for a successful percutaneous intervention. We report a case of percutaneous intervention of a Cabrol graft-left main coronary artery stenosis in a patient who presented with exertional angina.
