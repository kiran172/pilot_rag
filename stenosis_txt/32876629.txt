Title: [Retrograde cholangiography performed with simple balloon-assisted enteroscopy in patients with altered anatomy by surgery in a private level III clinic].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of retrograde cholangiography performed with simple balloon-assisted enteroscopy for the management of bile duct pathology in patients with altered anatomy by surgery at the Anglo American Clinic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study where all patients with altered anatomy who came for bile duct problems to undergo a retrograde cholangiography assisted by simple balloon enteroscopy at the Anglo American Clinic during the January period from 2014 to January 2020.
RESULTS: We performed 10 studies of retrograde cholangiography assisted by simple balloon enteroscopy. Cannulation of the bile duct was successful in 80% of our cases, in two cases the bile duct could not be located. The findings of the retrograde cholangiography were biliary stones in 7 cases, stenosis of the biliodigestive anastomosis in 5 cases, and an ampuloma. The most frequent therapeutic procedures were CRE progressive balloon dilation of the bilioenteric anastomosis and extraction of stones with a Dormia basket. There were no complications associated with the procedure.
CONCLUSION: Retrograde cholangiography assisted by simple balloon enteroscopy is a safe and effective method to resolve biliary pathology in our patients with altered anatomy.
