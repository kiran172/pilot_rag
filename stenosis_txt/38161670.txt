Title: Catheter-based Interventions in Tetralogy of Fallot Across the Lifespan.

Abstract: Surgical treatment of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) involves surgical relief of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction and closure of ventricular septal defect. However, some patients may require staged palliation before surgical repair. This traditionally was achieved only with surgery but recently evolved to include catheter-based techniques. RVOT dysfunction occurs inevitably after the surgical repair of TOF and, depending on the surgical approach, manifests as either progressive stenosis, regurgitation, or a combination of both. This predisposes the individual to repeated RVOT interventions with the attendant risks of multiple open-heart surgeries. The advent of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement has reduced the operative burden, and the expansion of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement device platforms has widened the type and size of RVOT anatomies that can be treated. This review will discuss the transcatheter therapies available throughout the lifespan of the patient with TOF.
