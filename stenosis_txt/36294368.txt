Title: Telemedicine and Digital Health Applications in Vascular Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare. While the development of digital health technologies for the management of patients with cardiovascular diseases has been increasingly reported, applications in vascular surgery have been far less specifically investigated. The aim of this review is to summarize applications related to telemedicine in vascular surgery, highlighting expected benefits, current limits and future directions.
METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched using a combination of keywords to identify studies related to telehealth/telemedicine in three main pathologies, including aortic, peripheral artery and carotid disease. A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify the type of digital application, intended use, expected benefits, strengths and limitations.
RESULTS: Telemedicine can improve the management of patients through digital platforms allowing teleconsultation, telemonitoring or telecoaching. Intended use involved remote consultation with a vascular surgeon, applications to enhance education, self-management, follow-up or adherence to treatment or lifestyle changes.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine offers innovative perspectives to improve access to care in distant locations and optimize care through patients' empowerment and personalized follow-up, contributing to the development of precision medicine. Huge efforts remain necessary for its implementation in daily clinical practice and involve ethical, legal, technical, economic and cultural considerations.
