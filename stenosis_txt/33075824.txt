Title: Surgery without Scars: Right Lateral Access for Minimally Invasive Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: As part of an institutionally driven holistic concept, named the "360-degree approach," all established surgical access routes -full sternotomy, partial upper sternotomy, and right anterolateral thoracotomy using the second interspace-are supported. The surgical toolbox now is completed by adding a further approach: through a 5- to7-cm skin incision in the right anterior axillary line, the third interspace is used for a minimally invasive aortic valve surgery providing striking exposition of the aortic valve and resulting in superior cosmetics with nearly no visible scars. The choice for the one or other method is institutionally driven and based on risk profiles, as well as anatomical and physiognomic considerations.
