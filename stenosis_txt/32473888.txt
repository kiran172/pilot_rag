Title: Optimal Stenting Technique for Complex Coronary Lesions: Intracoronary Imaging-Guided Pre-Dilation, Stent Sizing, and Post-Dilation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study compared the 3-year outcomes of intracoronary imaging-guided pre-dilation, stent sizing, and post-dilation (iPSP) for patients with complex coronary artery lesions.
BACKGROUND: The long-term effects of the optimal drug-eluting stent implantation technique in complex coronary artery disease have not been evaluated.
METHODS: From the IRIS-DES (Interventional Cardiology Research In-cooperation Society-Drug-Eluting Stents) registry, the study evaluated 9,525 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for left main, bifurcation, long or diffuse (>30 mm), or angiographically severely calcified lesions. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. The inverse probability of treatment weighting method was used to adjust for confounding factors.
RESULTS: At the index procedure, intravascular ultrasound assessment PSP were performed in 8,522 (89.5%) patients, 5,141 (54.0%) patients, and 5,531 (58.1%) patients, respectively; overall, 3,374 (35.4%) patients underwent stent implantation using all 3 parts of the iPSP strategy and were defined as the iPSP group. At 3 years, the adjusted rate of the primary outcome was significantly lower in iPSP group (5.6% vs 7.9%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.71; 95% confidence interval: 0.63 to 0.81; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation in complex coronary artery stenosis, iPSP was associated with a lower risk of cardiac events at 3 years. Therefore, physicians should apply iPSP more actively for the treatment of complex coronary artery stenoses, even in the current era.
