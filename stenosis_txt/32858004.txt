Title: Successful pregnancy following the transfer of re-vitrified twice-warmed embryos due to the forced cancellation of the primary FET: A case report.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Embryo cryopreservation represents a central procedure in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) programs. This report documents a Case of a successful pregnancy following the replacement of embryos that had to be re-vitrified due to the forced cancellation of the frozen embryo-transfer (FET).
PRINCIPLE RESULTS: The 37- year-old patient was referred to our Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) unit for idiopathic infertility and recurrent implantation failures. The collection cycle resulted in 8 grade-A cleavage embryos (8-10 blastomeres), that were all vitrified to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The first frozen embryo transfer (FET) ended in a biochemical pregnancy and the second in an ectopic pregnancy. In the third attempt, three embryos were warmed but the provider could not complete the transfer due to cervical stenosis. The two surviving embryos were therefore re-vitrified. The final FET attempt, 4 months later, was successful and ended with the live birth of a healthy female baby.
CONCLUSIONS: The transfer of re-vitrified twice-warmed embryos may represent a possible option when embryo transfer cannot be performed.
