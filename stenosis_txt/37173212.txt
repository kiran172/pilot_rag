Title: The Ross Procedure in Children: Defining the Optimal Age.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that delaying the Ross procedure to later in childhood, allowing autograft stabilisation and placement of a larger pulmonary conduit, may improve outcomes. However, the effect of age at the time of Ross procedure on outcomes remains unclear.
METHODS: All patients who underwent the Ross procedure between 1995 and 2018 were included in the study. Patients were divided into four groups: infants, age 1 to 5 years, age 5 to 10 years and age 10 to 18 years.
RESULTS: A total of 140 patients underwent the Ross procedure in the study period. Early mortality was 23.3% (7/30) for infants compared to 0% for older children (p<0.001). Survival at 15 years was significantly lower in infants (76.3%±9.9%), compared to children aged 1 to 5 years (90.9%±20.1%), 5 to 10 years (94%±13.3%), and 10 to 18 years (86.7%±10.0%), p=0.01. Freedom from autograft reoperation at 15 years was significantly lower in infants (58.4%±16.2%), compared to children aged 1 to 5 years (77.1%±14.9%), 5 to 10 years (84.2%±6.0%) and 10 to 18 years (87.8%±9.0%), p=0.01. Overall freedom from reoperation at 15 years was 13.0%±6.0% for infants, 24.2%±9.0% for children aged 1 to 5 years, 46.7%±15.8% for children aged 5 to 10 years, and 78.4%±10.4%, p<0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ross procedure performed after 10 years of age appears to be associated with improved freedom from reoperation, primarily due to a reduction in reoperation on the pulmonary conduit.
