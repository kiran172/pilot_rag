Title: Surgical Outcomes of Domino Liver Transplantation Using Grafts From Living Donors With Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy.

Abstract: Domino liver transplantation (DLT) using grafts from donors with familial amyloid polyneuropathy is an acceptable procedure for expanding the donor pool. The vascular and biliary reconstructions in living donor DLT (LDDLT) are technically demanding, and data on the short-term and long-term surgical outcomes of domino donors and recipients in LDDLT are limited. In this study, we identified 25 domino recipients from our liver transplantation program (1999-2018), analyzed the vascular and biliary reconstructions performed, and evaluated the surgical outcomes, including graft survival. Piggyback technique was adopted in all 25 domino donors. The only surgical complication in domino donors was hepatic vein (HV) stenosis with an incidence rate of 4%. In 22 domino recipients, right HV and middle/left HV were reconstructed separately. A total of 10 recipients had 2 arteries anastomosed, and 18 underwent duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis. HV stenosis and biliary stricture had incidence rates of 8% and 24%, respectively, in the recipients, but none of them developed hepatic artery thrombosis. The 1-year and 5-year graft survival rates were 100% each in the domino donors, and 84.0% and 67.3% in the domino recipients, respectively. In conclusion, LDDLT has acceptable outcomes without increasing the operative risk in donors despite the demanding surgical technique involved.
