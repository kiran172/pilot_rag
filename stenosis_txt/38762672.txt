Title: A real-world pharmacovigilance study of FDA adverse event reporting system events for Capmatinib.

Abstract: Capmatinib is a potent selective mesenchymal-epithelial transition inhibitor approved in 2020 for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. As real-world evidence is very limited, this study evaluated capmatinib-induced adverse events through data mining of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. Four disproportionality analysis methods were employed to quantify the signals of capmatinib-related adverse events. The difference in capmatinib-associated adverse event signals was further investigated with respect to sex, age, weight, dose, onset time, continent, and concomitant drug. A total of 1518 reports and 4278 adverse events induced by capmatinib were identified. New significant adverse event signals emerged, such as dysphagia, dehydration, deafness, vocal cord paralysis, muscle disorder, and oesophageal stenosis. Notably, higher risk of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase increases were observed in females, especially when capmatinib was combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Compared with Europeans and Asians, Americans were more likely to experience peripheral swelling, especially in people > 65 years of age. Renal impairment and increased blood creatinine were more likely to occur with single doses above 400 mg and in Asians. This study improves the understanding of safety profile of capmatinib.
