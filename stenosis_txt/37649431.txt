Title: Use of a novel tapered, scoring balloon to treat juxta-anastomotic stenosis in AV fistula.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Juxta-anastomotic stenosis, the most common lesion in arteriovenous fistula, creates a dilemma for optimal balloon size choosing during PTA.
OBJECTIVES: To descript the effect of a novel tapered scoring balloon catheter (DK Medtech, Suzhou, China) which has a conical shape with an increasing diameter from the front part of the balloon to the end, and three non-slip elements attached on the surface of the balloon.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Case series of 10 patients used this balloon catheter was retrospectively analyzed.
SUBJECTS: Patients with juxta-anastomotic stenosis.
MEASURES: A retrospective review of 10 cases using the novel tapered, scoring balloon catheter in our center was performed.
RESULTS: All cases were clinical technique success. The average total procedure time was 16.7 min with 2:14 of fluoroscopy time. No complications such as vascular rupture or dissection occurred. The primary patency rates at 6 and 12 month were 80% and 50% separately.
CONCLUSIONS: This tapered scoring balloon provides an economical, safe, and efficient management for juxta-anastomotic stenosis.
