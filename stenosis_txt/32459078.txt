Title: Handmade trileaflet valved ePTFE right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit - How do we do it?

Abstract: Right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits such as homografts and pre-manufactured synthetic conduits are widely employed in the present era of complex congenital cardiac surgeries for disorders involving right ventricle - pulmonary artery discontinuity and major coronary artery crossing the right ventricular outflow tract. The key drawback of homograft conduits is the need for reoperation to replace them as a result of degeneration over time or in cases where a child has outgrown the conduit and cost is a major drawback to using commercially available conduits. The advantages of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene are its long-term durability in terms of conduit calcification/degeneration and valve stenosis/regurgitation and its cost-effectiveness.Â  In this video presentation, we demonstrate the preparation and intraoperative usage of a handmade, trileaflet, valved polytetrafluoroethylene conduit in a case of double outlet right ventricle with valvular and subvalvular pulmonary stenosis and the left anterior descending artery crossing the right ventricular outflow tract. Our experience with this handmade conduit is close to 120 cases and we have seen excellent postoperative recovery and results. Our medium-term follow-up echocardiographic evidence shows conduit patency and preserved valve function.
