Title: Strategies to mitigate inflammation in management of complex congenital heart disease complicated by "multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children".

Abstract: A 6-month-old boy, a case of Shone's complex, presented in decompensated state was found to have severe mitral stenosis along with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC) warranting urgent surgical intervention. Various modalities including cytokine-adsorbing hemofilter were used to target inflammation. Postoperatively, the child recovered from low cardiac output accompanied by decrease in the levels of inflammatory markers, inopressors, and ventilatory requirements. Open heart surgery in itself is a proinflammatory process and is best avoided during the active inflammatory phase of MISC. In the rare and unavoidable circumstance exemplified by this index case, multipronged strategy targeting inflammation as described can be successfully implemented.
