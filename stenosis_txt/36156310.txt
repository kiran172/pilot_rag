Title: New Distal Balloon Protection System for Transradial Carotid Artery Stenting After Percusurge Guardwire Withdrawal: Jailbreak Technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Embolic protection devices are commonly used to prevent cerebral embolism during carotid artery stenting (CAS). However, the PercuSurge Guardwire device, a distal balloon protection device, was discontinued in April 2021. We present a case of successful CAS using a new distal balloon protection system. The procedure, referred to as the jailbreak technique, was performed via transradial access.
METHODS: A 67-year-old man underwent CAS, using the jailbreak technique, for right carotid stenosis with a vulnerable plaque. 6-French (Fr) and 4-Fr Simmons guiding sheaths were delivered into the right common carotid artery via the right and left transradial access, respectively. Distal balloon protection was provided using a 2.6-Fr dual-lumen balloon microcatheter (Pinnacle Blue 20, Tokai Medical Products, Aichi, Japan) via the 4-Fr Simmons guiding sheath. A 4.2-Fr catheter was coaxially delivered proximal to the balloon and distal to the lesion.
RESULTS: After CAS was successfully performed via the 6-Fr Simmons guiding sheath, the Pinnacle Blue 20 was retrieved through the 4.2-Fr catheter without interfering with the distal stent flare and stent struts. Postprocedural neuroimaging revealed no evidence of ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: The jailbreak technique allows distal balloon protection during transradial CAS. This is a useful treatment option for patients with carotid stenosis.
