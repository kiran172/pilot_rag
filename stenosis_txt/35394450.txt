Title: Reframing Optimal Implantation of the Sapien 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To define the optimal implantation of the Sapien 3 (Edwards Lifesciences) transcatheter heart valve (THV), this study systematically analyzed the predeployment fluoroscopic THV position and correlated this to clinical outcomes.
METHODS: This was an observational study of 279 patients treated with the Sapien 3 THV. Fluoroscopic imaging was used to categorize patients into low (n = 147), intermediate (n = 86), and high (n = 46) implantation zones. These zones were based on the relationship of the balloon marker and radiolucent line of the valve frame (line of lucency) to the annular plane at deployment. The primary outcome was the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) at 30 days. The secondary outcomes were the rates of new left bundle-branch block (LBBB) in-hospital and all-cause mortality at 1 year.
RESULTS: In the high, intermediate, and low groups, 30-day PPI rates were 4.3%, 8.1%, and 8.8% (P=.62); in-hospital LBBB rates were 10.9%, 26.7%, and 32.0% (P=.02); and all-cause mortality rates at 1 year were 3.1%, 7.3%, and 12.5% (P=.14), respectively. No differences were observed with respect to procedural success/complications or THV performance between the groups.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates fewer conduction abnormalities for Sapien 3 valves positioned within a higher zone defined fluoroscopically by the line of lucency and balloon marker.
