Title: Factors affecting suboptimal maturation of autogenous arteriovenous fistula in elderly patients with diabetes:A narrative review.

Abstract: Autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is considered the preferred vascular access choice for individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and is widely utilized in China, as reported by the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study. Despite its popularity, the significant incidence of poor AVF maturation often leads to the need for central venous catheter insertion, increasing the risk of complications like superior vena cava stenosis and catheter-related infections, which in turn raises the overall mortality risk. With the prevalence of diabetes rising globally among the elderly and diabetic kidney disease being a leading cause of end-stage renal disease necessitating renal replacement therapy, our retrospective review aims to explore the various factors affecting AVF maturation in this specific patient population. While there have been numerous studies examining AVF complications in MHD patients, including issues like failure, patency loss, stenosis, thrombosis, poor maturation, and other influencing factors, there remains a gap in large-scale clinical studies focusing on the incidence and risk factors for immature AVF specifically in elderly diabetic patients. This paper delves into the pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, and unique considerations surrounding AVF maturation in elderly diabetic patients, distinguishing them from the general population. Our literature review reveals that elderly diabetic patients exhibit a higher risk of AVF immaturity compared to the general population. Additionally, there exists a continuing discourse regarding several aspects related to this group, including the choice of dialysis access, timing of AVF surgery, and surgical site selection. Furthermore, we delve into the management strategies for vascular access within this specific group with the goal of providing evidence-based guidance for the establishment and maintenance of functional vascular access in elderly diabetic patients.
