Title: Prognostic implications of residual mild coarctation gradient after interventional repair.

Abstract: There is limited data on the prognostic implications of residual mild coarctation (RMC) in patients with repaired native coarctation of the aorta (CoA). To explore the association of RMC with mid-term comorbidities in post-interventional patients, and the predictive value of the residual pressure gradient. The authors retrospectively analyzed 79 native CoA patients who received successful intervention at our hospital between October 2010 and June 2023. The outcomes of the study were late arterial hypertension (either raised blood pressure or commencement of hypotensive medications) only in normotensive patients at early follow-up and the composite mid-term comorbidities including new-onset aortic injury, re-stenosis, and re-intervention. At a median follow-up of 60 months, late hypertension and mid-term comorbidities occurred in 16 (28.1%) and nine (11.4%) patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified invasive peak systolic CoA pressure gradient (PSPG) as the best independent predictor of both outcomes. The maximally selected rank statistics indicated 10 mm Hg as the best PSPG cut-off value for predicting late hypertension. Compared to patients with PSPG < 11 mm Hg, the cumulative event rates of both outcomes were higher in those with PSPG ≥ 11 mm Hg (log-rank test, p < .001 for both endpoints). PSPG ≥ 11 mm Hg was proved to be the independent predictor of late hypertension with a significantly increased risk. In patients with non-surgical CoA repair, the post-interventional RMC and PSPG ≥11 mm Hg are important predictors of clinical comorbidities at mid-term follow-up.
