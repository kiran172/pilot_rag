Title: Staged Norwood operation for patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and cor triatriatum: a report of two cases.

Abstract: Two patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) concomitant with cor triatriatum underwent the staged Norwood procedure following hybrid palliation. Cor triatriatum was diagnosed after birth in both cases. Case 1 with aortic stenosis and mitral atresia underwent bilateral pulmonary artery banding at 2 days of age. Subsequently, balloon atrial septostomy was conducted at 21 days of age due to hypoxia and increased intra-atrial pressure gradient. At 2 months of age, concomitant Norwood operation, cor triatriatum repair, and tricuspid valve repair were successfully performed. She has suffered from branch pulmonary artery hypoplasia since then; thus, Fontan operation was out of indication. Case 2 with aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis underwent bilateral pulmonary artery banding at 6 days of age. After that, the patient's hemodynamic condition remained stable. The Norwood operation concomitant with cor triatriatum repair was performed at 2 months of age. However, during the procedure, massive pulmonary edema and hemorrhage occurred right after the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. She could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.
