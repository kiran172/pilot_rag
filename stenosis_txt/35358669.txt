Title: Transcarotid revascularization outcomes do not differ by patient age or sex.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is a hybrid approach to carotid revascularization. Limited information is available on the differences in periprocedural complications and performance measures of TCAR for men compared with women and for older vs younger adults.
METHODS: The patient, lesion, and physician characteristics were collected for all TCAR procedures performed by each physician worldwide in an international quality assurance database between March 3, 2009 and May 7, 2020. Clinical composite (ie, death, stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction) and technical composite (ie, aborted procedure, conversion to surgery, bleeding, dissection, cranial nerve injury, device failure) adverse events within 24 hours of the procedure were recorded. Four performance measures were recorded: flow-reversal time, fluoroscopy time, contrast volume, and skin-to-skin time. Poisson regressions were used to assess the effects of age and sex on the incidence of clinical and technical composite adverse events. Linear regressions were used to compare the four performance measures.
RESULTS: A total of 18,240 TCARs were performed by 1273 physicians; 34.9% of the patients were women and 37.5% were symptomatic. The overall incidence of clinical and technical composite adverse events was low. The adjusted clinical (1.62% [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17%-2.23%] vs 1.35% [95% CI, 1.01%-1.79%]; P = .22) and technical (7.84% [95% CI, 6.85%-8.97%] vs 7.80% [95% CI, 6.94%-8.77%]; P = .93) composite adverse event rates did not vary for women vs men. The adjusted clinical (P = .65) and technical (P = .55) composite adverse event rates also did not vary by age. The adjusted skin-to-skin time was shorter for the women (76.6 minutes; 95% CI, 74.6-78.6) than for the men (77.7 minutes; 95% CI, 75.7-79.6; P = .002). Significant differences were found by age group for fluoroscopy time, flow-reversal time, and skin-to-skin time, although the magnitude of these differences was small (<1 minute for each).
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and technical outcomes of TCAR are not affected by age or sex. We found clinically minor differences in the procedural performance measures when stratified by age and sex. In addition to being safe for younger individuals, TCAR could also be the preferred method for performing carotid stenting in women and older patients, in particular, older women.
