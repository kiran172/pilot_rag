Title: CircSKA3 is Associated With the Risk of Extracranial Artery Stenosis and Plaque Instability Among Ischemic Stroke Patients.

Abstract: Circular RNA circSKA3 (spindle and kinetochore-related complex subunit 3) has been identified as a prognostic factor in ischemic stroke. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of circSKA3 with the risk of extracranial artery stenosis (ECAS) and plaque instability in patients with ischemic stroke. We constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network regulated by circSKA3 based on differentially expressed circRNAs and mRNAs between five patients and five controls. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed on the 65 mRNAs within the network, revealing their primary involvement in inflammatory biological processes. A total of 284 ischemic stroke patients who underwent various imaging examinations were included for further analyses. Each 1 standard deviation increase in the log-transformed blood circSKA3 level was associated with a 56.3% increased risk of ECAS (P = 0.005) and a 142.1% increased risk of plaque instability (P = 0.005). Patients in the top tertile of circSKA3 had a 2.418-fold (P < 0.05) risk of ECAS compared to the reference group (P for trend = 0.02). CircSKA3 demonstrated a significant but limited ability to discriminate the presence of ECAS (AUC = 0.594, P = 0.015) and unstable carotid plaques (AUC = 0.647, P = 0.034). CircSKA3 improved the reclassification power for ECAS (NRI: 9.86%, P = 0.012; IDI: 2.97%, P = 0.007) and plaque instability (NRI: 36.73%, P = 0.008; IDI: 7.05%, P = 0.04) beyond conventional risk factors. CircSKA3 played an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke by influencing inflammatory biological processes. Increased circSKA3 was positively associated with the risk of ECAS and plaque instability among ischemic stroke patients.
