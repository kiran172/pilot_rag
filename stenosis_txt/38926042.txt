Title: Closure without epiglottoplasty or tracheotomy after reconstructive frontal anterior laryngectomy.

Abstract: Reconstructive frontal anterior laryngectomy (RFAL) is a partial laryngeal surgery technique for resecting early-stage (T1-T2) glottic squamous cell carcinoma. Indications comprise a lesion of the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately exposed by endoscopy, and cases in which radiotherapy is refused or contraindicated. The initial RFAL technique included epiglottoplasty. Here we propose a technique without epiglottoplasty, with the advantage of avoiding need for tracheotomy in most cases. After the first stage of surgical excision, reconstruction consists in placing a vertical brace transepiglottically and below the cricoid. The epiglottis is thus left at its original height and secured in place to prevent flapping in the pharyngolaryngeal lumen. Transverse bracing is then performed through the thyroid wings: one of the key points of this surgery is to control tension to avoid risk of stenosis. The subhyoid muscles are sutured together to achieve satisfactory sealing. This technique offers satisfying functional results and oncological control. The most frequent complications are (1) secondary tracheotomy, which can be avoided by selecting patients who require a primary tracheotomy and optimizing the seal, and (2) stenosis, which can be limited by not bringing the cartilaginous structures too close together during bracing.
