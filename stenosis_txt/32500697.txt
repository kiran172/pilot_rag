Abstract: A rare clinical observation of primary tracheal MALT lymphoma is reported and difficulties of differential diagnosis are discussed. Tracheal neoplasms are rare tumors and characterized by delayed diagnosis after clinical manifestation (tracheal stenosis and associated complications). These tumors often occur an advanced age patients that complicates examination and surgical treatment. High risk is determined by type of surgery, possible postoperative complications and senile age.
