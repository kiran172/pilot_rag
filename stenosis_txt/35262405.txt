Title: Long-Term Outcome of Non-antireflux Robotic-Assisted Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Ureter Reimplantation in Ureteral Obstruction.

Abstract: Purpose: Although robot-assisted laparoscopic ureter reimplantation (RALUR) is a recognized alternative to open and laparoscopic ureter reimplantation in treating distal ureteral obstruction, there are limited data on long-term efficacy and safety outcomes of non-antireflux RALUR. We assessed patients undergoing RALUR, evaluating operative, functional, and safety determinants. Materials and Methods: All consecutive patients undergoing non-antireflux RALUR between April 2015 and January 2020 were included in this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome endpoint was recurrent distal ureteral obstruction. Results: Mean follow-up was 41.3 months (95% confidence interval, 33.3-49.2; range 2-82). Among the 26 included patients, none developed recurrent distal ureteral obstruction. Kidney function in terms of serum creatinine level (72.0 μmol/L vs 71.0 μmol/L, p = 0.988) and glomerular filtration rate (92.0 mL/min vs 91.0 mL/min, p = 0.831) was stable between the preoperative period and the last follow-up. Renal pelvis dilatation decreased significantly postoperatively, from grade 2 to grade 0 (p &lt; 0.001). Most patients (73.1%) remained free from any clinical symptoms of reflux during the follow-up. No recurring urinary tract infections were reported. The rate of postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥II) was 23.1%. All complications resolved without sequelae. Conclusions: Non-antireflux RALUR appears to be safe and effective in the management of distal ureteral obstruction. There was no recurrent ureteral obstruction after RALUR in our cohort during a mean follow-up of more than 3 years. Non-antireflux reimplantation did not seem to have any notable impact on renal function during the follow-up period.
