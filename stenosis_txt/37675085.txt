Title: Ventricular pacing dependency after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a prospective cohort.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atrioventricular conduction disturbance occurs in a significant number of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, not all cases are ventricular pacing-dependent. Thus, we aimed to study the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of new ventricular pacing dependency (VpDep) after TAVR.
METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 130 consecutive transfemoral TAVR cases performed in Ramathibodi Hospital between 2015 and 2020. Three patients with prior ventricular pacing-dependent on cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) were excluded. The endpoints were VpDep at 1 month and all-cause mortality at the follow-up period end in 2021. The effects of variables on VpDep and all-cause mortality were evaluated using multivariate binary logistic regression and Cox regression analyses, respectively. First-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) was considered severe when the PR interval was >300 ms.
RESULTS: Of the 127 patients [mean age, 81.8 years; 62.2% females; 67.7% balloon-expandable (BE) device], 7 patients (5.5%) had CIEDs implanted before TAVR that were not ventricular pacing-dependent. TAVR was successfully performed in 126 (99.2%) patients. Periprocedural stroke, cardiac tamponade, and major bleeding occurred in 2 (1.6%), 4 (3.1%), and 4 (3.1%) patients, respectively. The VpDep incidence at 1 month was 7.9% (n=10) among all patients and 34.5% among those with CIEDs (n=29). VpDep was more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing right bundle branch block (RBBB) [odds ratio (OR), 21.38; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.28-139.33; P=0.001] and severe 1st degree or Mobitz I AVB (OR, 14.79; 95% CI: 1.65-132.74; P=0.016). After a mean follow-up of 25.8 months [standard deviation (SD), 21.2 months], death from any cause occurred in 18 patients (14.2%). However, VpDep was not associated with an increased mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world cohort, pre-existing conduction abnormalities were significantly associated with a higher risk of VpDep. Mortality was similar between patients with and without VpDep.
