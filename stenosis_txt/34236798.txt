Title: Comparison of Postoperative Outcomes of Sutureless versus Stented Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Sutureless aortic valve replacement (Su-AVR) offers an alternative to supra-annular stented biological aortic prostheses. This single-center study aimed to compare early outcomes after aortic valve replacement with sutureless and conventional stented bioprostheses.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 52 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with sutureless and stented bioprostheses between January 2013 and October 2017. Sorin Perceval S sutureless valves were implanted in group 1 and Sorin Mitroflow stented bioprosthetic valves were used in group 2. Postoperative outcomes, including demographics, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times, cross-clamp times, morbidity and mortality, as well as echocardiography in the first month, were compared.
RESULTS: Mortality occurred in 1 (3.6%) patient in group 1, and in 2 (8.3%) patients in group 2 (P=0.186). Group 1 had significantly shorter CPB (61.6±26.1 min vs. 106.3±32.7 min, P=0.001) and crossclamp (30.9±13.6 min vs. 73.3±17.3 min, P=0.001) times. The length of stay in the intensive care unit (1.9±1.3 days vs. 2.4±4.9 days, P=0.598) and hospital stay (7.6±2.7 days vs. 7.3±2.6 days, P=0.66) were similar. Postoperatively, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in echocardiography results, and morbidities. The mean aortic valve gradient was 13.5±5.8 mmHg in group 1 and 14.5±8.0 mmHg in group 2 (P=0.634). Paravalvular regurgitation was diagnosed in 3 (10.7%) patients in group 1 and in 1 (4.2%) patient in group 2 (P=0.220).
CONCLUSIONS: Su-AVR resulted in shorter cross-clamp and CPB times. However, early mortality, postoperative morbidity, and echocardiography results were similar between groups.
