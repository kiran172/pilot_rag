Title: [Bicuspid aortic valve and its complications: from molecules to surgery].

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve is a relevant condition to the epidemiology of degenerative (stenosis, regurgitation) and infective (endocarditis) aortic valve disease. This review will address the topics of treatment of those valvular complications, focusing on the peculiar aspects distinguishing them from tricuspid aortic valve diseases, in particular transcatheter treatment of stenosis, valve repair/sparing surgery for regurgitation, prevention of endocarditis. Bicuspid aortopathy represents a clinical entity with remarkable prognostic, and likely also pathogenetic, heterogeneity. A deeper understanding of the tissue and molecular factors as well as flow-related and biomechanical aspects of its development and progression could help guiding better risk stratification (identification of more severe forms, prevention of acute aortic dissection), allowing for a personalized therapeutic approach. The present review will also summarize the state of the art about bicuspid aortopathy pathogenesis, moreover forwarding new hypotheses for the interpretation of the many sparse pieces of evidence currently available.
