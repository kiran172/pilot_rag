Title: Aortic root parameter analysis for transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the Pakistani population: a retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a growing treatment for aortic stenosis, but anatomical variations exist across populations. Asians tend to have smaller aortic annuli and higher bicuspid valve morphology compared to Westerners, potentially impacting TAVI valve selection and outcomes. This study analyzes aortic root parameters in Pakistani patients undergoing TAVI.
RESULTS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 78 patients who underwent TAVI at the Peshawar Institute of Cardiology from January 2021 to March 2024. Pre-procedural CT scans were analyzed for aortic annulus diameters, area, and other relevant parameters. The mean age was 72.41 years (SD ± 11.99), and 61.5% were male. Aortic annulus diameters (minimum, mean, maximum) were 21.18 mm (SD ± 3.99), 24.21 mm (SD ± 3.93), and 27.49 mm (SD ± 4.43), respectively. Bicuspid aortic valves were present in 34.61% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Pakistani patients undergoing TAVI may have aortic root dimensions comparable to Western populations, with a substantial prevalence of bicuspid valves. However, coronary heights were similar to those reported in Asian populations with smaller annuli. Further studies are needed to assess TAVI outcomes in Pakistani patients and determine if tailored valve sizing strategies are required.
