Title: Dysphagia and stenosis secondary to intramural esophageal pseudodiverticulosis.

Abstract: We present the case of a patient with smoking, alcoholism, cirrhosis and HIV who was endoscopically diagnosed with esophageal candidiasis due to an episode of dysphagia. After treatment with antifungals and PPIs, the patient remained asymptomatic for almost 3 years. He presented an event of food impaction that was resolved by an upper endoscopy in which an esophageal stenosis and multiple esophageal pseudodiverticulosis were visualized. The biopsies only showed chronic nonspecific esophagitis. The stenosis was dilated with a balloon and PPIs were continued, with good response. Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis is rare and can lead to motor disorders and strictures. It has a doubtful association with HIV and a clearer relationship with alcoholism, smoking, diabetes, reflux and candidiasis. The endoscopic diagnosis can be difficult so in order to make an accurate diagnosis is necessary an esophagram or CT. Treatment is based on controlling risk factors and dilating stenosis. The prognosis is usually favorable.
