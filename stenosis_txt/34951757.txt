Title: [Ischemic complications following surgical treatment of moyamoya disease: risk factors and prevention].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: One of the most difficult problems in surgical treatment of moyamoya disease is prevention of ischemic perioperative complications. The risk of these events is significantly higher compared to other cerebrovascular diseases (up to 30%).
OBJECTIVE: To identify unfavorable prognostic factors of perioperative cerebral ischemic complications, to determine the group of high-risk patients and to develop the guidelines for perioperative management of these patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed clinical and diagnostic data and postoperative outcomes in 80 patients with various forms of moyamoya disease. These patients underwent 134 different interventions. Staged revascularization of both hemispheres was performed in 40 patients (80 surgeries). Most patients (n = 55) underwent combined brain revascularization (79 surgeries).
RESULTS: Persistent postoperative complications (ischemic stroke) developed in 7 cases (5.3%). Transient neurological impairment was observed in 36 cases (27%). Statistical analysis revealed the following risk factors of perioperative complications: critical stenosis/occlusion of posterior cerebral artery (OR 9.704), severe perfusion deficit (OR 5.393) and previous TIA or ischemic stroke within 3 months prior to surgery (OR 6.433). If at least two of these signs are present, sensitivity of prognosis for postoperative complications is 80.7% and 88.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Patients with moyamoya disease are at high risk of perioperative complications due to complex rearrangement of collateral cerebral circulation and high sensitivity of brain to local and systemic hemodynamic changes. Patients with risk factors require careful perioperative management to exclude pathogenetic factors provoking ischemia. Early surgical treatment is advisable to reduce the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions following natural course of disease and severe perioperative complications.
