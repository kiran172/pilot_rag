Title: Narrative Review of Uniportal Posterior Endoscopic Cervical Foraminotomy.

Abstract: Cervical radiculopathy is a common and disabling cervical condition characterized by symptoms including axial neck pain, radicular pain, weakness, and numbness in one or both arms. Common causes include herniated discs and foraminal stenosis, often accompanied by varying degrees of degenerative disc disease and uncovertebral joint hypertrophy. In the treatment of cervical radiculopathy, there is an increasing preference for posterior foraminotomy over anterior cervical discectomy and fusion due to the avoidance of fusion-related complications. As endoscopic spine surgery techniques continue to evolve, there is a rising interest in posterior endoscopic cervical foraminotomy and posterior endoscopic cervical discectomy as effective treatments for cervical radiculopathy. Because these procedures can performed through a single subcentimeter incision with minimal soft tissue damage, they can often be carried out as ambulatory procedures. In this narrative review, we examined current literature addressing the indications, surgical techniques, outcomes, and potential complications associated with posterior cervical endoscopic approaches.
