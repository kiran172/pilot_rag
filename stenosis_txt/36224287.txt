Title: The association between inflammatory biomarkers and carotid artery plaque in normal-weight and metabolically healthy Chinese adults: a cross-sectional study.

Abstract: Existing evidence has indicated a role of inflammation in the development of carotid artery plaque (CAP). We thus evaluated the association between inflammation and CAP in a population with normal body weight and metabolically healthy status. A total of 8050 normal-body-weight and metabolically healthy participants (2613 men and 5437 women, aged 40.5 ± 11.3 y) were included in this study. Inflammatory status was evaluated by three parameters: serum hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), WBC (white blood cell) count, and NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio). CAP was detected by ultrasound B-mode imaging. Clinical data were abstracted from medical records. Metabolically healthy status was defined as no history of metabolic diseases and normal blood pressure, fasting blood glucose level, hemoglobin A1c level, lipid profile, and liver ultrasonographic findings. The serum level of hs-CRP, but not WBC or NLR, was associated with the risk of CAP after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The adjusted odds ratio for the risk of CAP was 2.71 (1.64, 4.46) for participants with a high level of hs-CRP (≥3 mg/L), compared with those with a low level (<1 mg/L). Each unit increase in hs-CRP was associated with a 24% higher risk of CAP (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.37). Inflammation was associated with the risk of CAP even in individuals with a normal body weight and metabolically healthy status.
