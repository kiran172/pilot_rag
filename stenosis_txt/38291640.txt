Title: [Surgical strategies and efficacy analysis for aortic dissection complicating intractable mesenteric artery ischemia].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the surgical strategies and clinical efficacy for aortic dissection combined with refractory superior mesenteric artery (SMA) ischemia. Methods: This is a retrospective case series study. Clinical data of 24 patients with aortic dissection and refractory SMA ischemia admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University from August 2010 to August 2020 were retrospectively collected. Of the 24 patients, 21 were males and 3 were females, with an age of (50.3±9.9) years (range: 44 to 72 years).Among them, 9 cases were Stanford type A aortic dissection, and 15 cases were type B. All patients underwent CT angiography upon admission, and based on imaging characteristics, they were classified into three types. Type Ⅰ: severe stenosis/occlusion of the SMA true lumen only; Type Ⅱ: stenosis of the true lumens in the descending aorta and SMA (isolated type); Type Ⅲ: stenosis of the true lumens in the thoracoabdominal aorta and SMA (continuation type). Surgical procedures, complications, mortality, and reintervention rates were recorded. Results: Among the 24 patients, 17 (70.8%) were classified as Type Ⅰ, 4 (16.7%) as Type Ⅱ, and 3 (12.5%) as Type Ⅲ. Fourteen cases of Type Ⅰ underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair combined with SMA stent implantation. Additionally, 3 Type Ⅰ and 1 Type Ⅱ patients underwent only SMA reconstruction (with one case of chronic TAAD treated with iliac artery-SMA bypass surgery). Moreover, 3 Type Ⅱ and 3 Type Ⅲ patients underwent descending aorta combined with SMA stent implantation. There were 5 patients (20.8%) who underwent small bowel resection, either in the same sitting or in a staged procedure. During hospitalization, 4 patients died, resulting in a mortality rate of 16.7%. Among these cases, two patients succumbed to severe intestinal ischemia resulting in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The follow-up duration was (46±9) months (range: 13 to 72 months). During the follow-up, 2 patients died, unrelated to intestinal ischemia. The 5-year freedom from reintervention survival rate was 86.1%, and the 5-year cumulative survival rate was 82.6%. Conclusions: Patients with aortic dissection and refractory SMA ischemia have a high perioperative mortality. However, implementing appropriate surgical strategies according to different clinical scenarios can reduce mortality and alleviate intestinal ischemia.
