Title: The "Bundle Wire" Technique: A Novel Approach to Cannulating Challenging Target Vessels Using Multiple Fine Atraumatic Guidewires That Together Serve as a Stiff Guidewire.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To present a novel technique that enables safe and effective cannulation of target vessels with challenging anatomy during fenestrated/branched endovascular aortic repair (F/B-EVAR).
TECHNIQUE: Following deployment of the F/B-EVAR endograft, the target vessels (TVs) are cannulated. The bundle wire technique provides a solution to challenging TVs and uses multiple fine atraumatic guidewires that together serve as a stiff guidewire. The technique can be executed in 2 ways using: (1) one 0.018 inch and one 0.014 inch guidewire or (2) three 0.014 inch guidewires. We demonstrate the technique in a case of a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm treated using branched EVAR in which the left renal artery with severe ostial stenosis was catheterized using the bundle wire technique.
CONCLUSIONS: The bundle wire technique offers a technically feasible and economically viable solution for facilitating catheter and bridging stent delivery in anatomically challenging TVs during F/B-EVAR. It is a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium available to physicians for accessing demanding TVs.
