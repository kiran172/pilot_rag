Title: Noncontrast cardiac computed tomography-derived mitral annular calcification scores in mitral valve disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) by computed tomography (CT) is reported as an independent predictor of poor outcomes. However, it currently remains unclear if quantitative MAC parameters provide more value for mitral valve disease (MVD) management, therefore, we examined the prognostic value of MAC scores using noncontrast cardiac-CT in MVD patients.
METHODS: Between January 2020 and December 2021, we prospectively enrolled 300 consecutive patients with MVD (MAC-present = 80 and MAC-absent = 220) undergoing preoperative cardiac-CT and mitral valve (MV) surgery. Noncontrast cardiac-CT images were used to qualitatively detect MAC (present or absent) and evaluate MAC scores. For analyses, we also collected baseline clinical data, intraoperative conversion (from MV repair to MV replacement), and follow-up arrhythmia data.
RESULTS: Compared with the MAC-absent group, MAC-present patients were older (62 ± 7 vs. 58 ± 9 years, p < .001), mostly women (55% vs. 39.5%, p = .017), and also had aortic valve calcification (57.5% vs. 23.2%, p < .001), mitral stenosis (82.5% vs. 61.8%, p < .001), atrial fibrillation (30% vs. 11.8%, p < .001), and larger left atrial end-diastolic dimension (LADD, 49 [44-56] versus 46 [41-50], p = .001]. Furthermore, MAC-present patients underwent more MV replacements (61.8% vs. 82.5%, p = .001) and experienced a higher intraoperative conversion prevalence (11.8% vs. 61.3%, p < .001). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the female gender (odds ratio [OR]/95% confidence interval [CI]/p = 2.001/1.042-3.841/0.037) and MAC scores (OR/95% CI/p = 10.153/4.434-23.253/p < .001) were independent predictors of intraoperative conversion. During a follow-up of 263 ± 134 days, MAC-present patients had more arrhythmias (42.5% vs. 9.5%, p < .001). Also, MAC-scores (hazard ratio [HR]/95% CI/p = 6.841/3.322-14.089/p < .001) and LADD (HR/95% CI/p = 1.039/1.018-1.060/p < .001) were independently associated with arrhythmias by Cox regression analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Noncontrast cardiac CT-derived MAC-scores showed a high risk for intraoperative conversion and follow-up arrhythmias in MVD-patients.
