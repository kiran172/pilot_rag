Title: Long-term outcomes of the Ovation Stent Graft System investigational device exemption trial for endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report the 5-year outcomes of the Food and Drug Administration investigational device exemption clinical trial of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the Ovation stent graft (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) for elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
METHODS: The study comprised 161 patients who underwent EVAR as part of the prospective, international, multicenter pivotal Ovation stent graft trial. The main inclusion criteria were AAA diameter ≥5 cm, proximal neck length ≥7 mm, neck angulation ≤60 degrees, and bilateral iliac fixation length ≥10 mm. The primary end point was a composite outcome of primary clinical success at 5 years. Primary clinical success was defined in accordance with the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines as successful aneurysm exclusion without aneurysm-related death, type I or type III endoleak, graft infection or thrombosis, aneurysm expansion, aneurysm rupture, graft migration, or conversion to open repair. Secondary end points included freedom from reintervention, all-cause mortality, and aneurysm-related mortality.
RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (87.6%) and elderly with a mean age of 73 ± 7.7 years; 66 patients (41%) had challenging anatomy and would be considered outside the instructions for use with other stent grafts, 26 (16.2%) had a proximal neck length <10 mm, and 53 (33%) had a minimum access vessel diameter <6 mm. Technical success was 100%. Of 126 surviving patients, 84 (66.7%) completed 5-year follow-up. The 5-year primary clinical success rate was 78%, aneurysm-related mortality was 1% (one patient), and all-cause mortality was 25%. The AAA-related death resulted from AAA post-EVAR rupture at 49 months in a patient who refused treatment for a type IB endoleak. Freedom from type I or type III endoleak was 95.1%. Freedom from secondary interventions was 80.2%. Most of the reinterventions were performed for type II endoleak (24 [63.1%]) or for limb thrombosis or stenosis (7 [18.4%]). There was no graft migration. None of the patients required open conversion.
CONCLUSIONS: Five-year results from the Ovation pivotal and continued access investigational device exemption trials demonstrate excellent long-term durability of this endograft despite that 41% of patients had anatomy unfit for other stent grafts. There were no migrations or conversions to open repair and 99% freedom from aneurysm-related mortality. These results suggest a less invasive on-label endovascular option for patients with challenging anatomy who may otherwise require hybrid or open repair.
