Title: [Characteristics and risk factors of spinal epidural hematoma after unilateral biportal endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the incidence, characteristics and risk factors of spinal epidural hematoma after unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) lumbar spine surgery. Methods: The clinical data of 105 patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery under UBE in Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from February 2020 to March 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Of the patients, 48(45.7%) were male and 57(54.3%) were female, the mean age was (60.1±11.4) years (ranged 26 to 85 years). The MRI images at the third day post-surgery were observed, and the occurrence of hematoma was counted. Patients were assigned to normal group and hematoma group based on the presence of hematoma or not. The related clinical indicators of each patients were collected and used for comparison between two different groups. Logistic stepwise regression model was used to analyze whether each index was a risk factor for hematoma after the UBE lumbar fusion. Results: The total hematoma incidence rate was 28.6%(30/105), the symptomatic hematoma rate was 6.7%(7/105), and the hematoma reoperation rate was 0.9%(1/105). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension (OR=3.368, 95%CI: 1.389-8.171), diabetes (OR=3.589, 95%CI: 1.230-10.476), admission systolic blood pressure&gt;140 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa,OR=3.687, 95%CI: 1.493-9.017), platelets&lt;200×109/L (OR=0.300, 95%CI: 0.119-0.785), preoperative blood calcium&lt;2.25 mmol/L (OR=0.340, 95%CI: 0.142-0.818), spinal stenosis grade D (OR=4.462, 95%CI: 1.810-10.996) were possible risk factors for spinal hematoma after UBE lumbar fusion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that admission blood pressure systolic blood pressure&gt;140 mmHg (OR=3.788, 95%CI:1.055-13.606), preoperative blood calcium&lt;2.25 mmol/L (OR=78.544, 95%CI:3.895-1 584.058) and spinal stenosis grade D (OR=3.698, 95%CI:1.110-12.325) were risk factors for spinal hematoma after UBE lumbar fusion (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The types of spinal canal hematoma after UBE lumbar fusion include localized and extended type. The risk factors for hematoma include high systolic blood pressure on admission, low preoperative blood calcium and severe spinal stenosis.
