Title: Relationship between ophthalmic artery flow direction and visual deterioration after carotid angioplasty and stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Visual deterioration is one of the disabling complications that can occur after carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for newly developed visual symptoms after CAS, focusing on ophthalmic artery (OA) flow pattern and etiology of visual loss.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 127 patients with 138 internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis lesions that were treated with CAS from February 2009 to October 2017 in a single institution was performed. The flow pattern of the OA was evaluated with digital subtraction angiography and classified into 3 types: type I, antegrade OA flow before and after CAS; type II, antegrade OA flow reversal after CAS; and type III, retained nonantegrade OA flow after CAS.
RESULTS: The degree of ipsilateral ICA stenosis was significantly higher in the nonantegrade group than that in the antegrade group (81.73% ± 9.87% vs 75.74% ± 10.27%, p = 0.001). Independent risk factors for newly developed visual symptoms after CAS were visual symptoms before CAS (OR 65.29, 95% CI 5.14-827.2; p = 0.001) and type III OA flow pattern (OR 55.98, 95% CI 2.88-1088.0; p = 0.008). The post-CAS visual symptoms in 10 patients were related to acute elevation of intraocular pressure in 6 patients and retinal artery occlusion in 3 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintained retrograde or undetected OA flow after CAS and initial visual symptoms before CAS were related to post-CAS visual symptoms. Thus, careful attention is needed for these patients during the perioperative period, and immediate evaluation and management are required for patients with post-CAS visual loss.
