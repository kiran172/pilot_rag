Title: Cardiac amyloidosis in patients with spinal stenosis and yellow ligament hypertrophy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spinal stenosis (SS) is a manifestation associated with cardiac amyloidosis (CA). However, there is a lack of studies assessing the prevalence of CA among patients with SS. We aimed to address the prevalence of CA among patients with SS and YLH.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients older than 65 years with SS and yellow ligament hypertrophy (YLH). All the patients were assessed with an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and biohumoral evaluation. Patients with CA red flags was further studied with cardiac magnetic resonance and 99mTc-DPD scintigraphy. A cohort of patients with confirmed CA and SS was used to assess clinical features associated with CA.
RESULTS: 105 patients (75.0 ± 6.6 years old; 45.7% males) with SS and YLH [5.5 [5-7] mm] were screened. Prevalence of red flags of CA was high and 58 patients presented clinical suspicion of CA. One patient (0.95%) was finally diagnosed of CA. Patients with confirmed CA presented a more expressive phenotype than the screened population. Patients with suspected CA had greater YLH than patients without suspicion of CA (6.4 ± 1.3 vs. 5.0 ± 0.8 mm; p < 0.001) and patients with confirmed CA presented greater YLH than the screening population (6.7 ± 1.8 vs. 5.7 ± 1.2 mm; p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: Despite red flags of CA are common among patients with SS, the prevalence of confirmed CA was low in our sample of screened patients.
