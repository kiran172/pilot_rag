Title: Subintimal Tracking and Re-entry Technique for Stent-Jailed Side-Branch Occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and outcomes of treatment with the subintimal tracking and re-entry technique for stent-jailed side branch (SB-STAR). SB occlusion is a serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, conventional strategies may fail to recanalize the stent-jailed SB.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients who underwent elective PCI and were treated with SB-STAR at the Sapporo Cardiovascular Clinic in Japan. SB was treated for severe stenosis, reduced thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade, or ischemic signs after main vessel stenting. Technical success during the procedure and clinical and angiographic follow-up findings at 6 months were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 13,431 PCI procedures performed between January 2016 and June 2021, SB-STAR was performed in 10 patients. The angiographic success rate was 100%. At the 6-month follow-up, no deaths or target-vessel revascularizations had occurred. All patients underwent angiographic follow-up, and 8 of the 10 patients (80%) who underwent SB-STAR had confirmed patency.
CONCLUSIONS: SB-STAR can be a bailout strategy to improve the critical situation of stent-jailed SB occlusion. At 6-month follow-up, the SB-STAR had good patency as well as good clinical outcomes.
