Title: Comparison of Subjective and Objective Assessments on Improvement in Gait Function after Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether objective gait test scores obtained using a tri-axial accelerometer can detect subjective improvement in gait as determined by the patient after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Each patient undergoing CEA for ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis determined whether their gait was subjectively improved at six months after CEA when compared with preoperatively. Gait testing using a tri-axial accelerometer was also performed preoperatively and six months postoperatively. Twelve (15%) of 79 patients reported subjectively improved gait. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for differences between pre- and postoperative test values in stride time, cadence, and ground floor reaction for detecting subjectively improved gait were 0.995 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.945-1.000), 0.958 (95%CI, 0.887-0.990), and 0.851 (95%CI, 0.753-0.921), respectively. Cut-off points for value differences in detecting subjectively improved gait were identical to mean -1.7 standard deviation (SD) for stride time, mean +1.6 SD for cadence, and mean +0.4 SD for ground floor reaction of control values from normal subjects. Objective gait test scores obtained using the tri-axial accelerometer can detect subjective gait improvements after CEA. When determining significant postoperative improvements in gait using a tri-axial accelerometer, optimal cut-off points for each test value can be defined.
