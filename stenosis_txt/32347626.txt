Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as bridge therapy restoring eligibility for liver transplantation in cirrhotic patients.

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis is a widespread valve disease, constituting a contraindication to organ transplantation due to cardiovascular morbidity and projected mortality. Mortality after conventional surgical aortic valve replacement in cirrhotic patients depends upon the Child-Pugh class. In the past few years, transcatheter aortic valve replacement has progressively become the treatment of choice for high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. Here, we report the cases of 3 cirrhotic patients who became eligible for liver transplantation after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement as bridge therapy.
