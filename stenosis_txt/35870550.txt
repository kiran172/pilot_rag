Title: Global Research Trends on Ventricular Remodeling: A Bibliometric Analysis From 2012 to 2022.

Abstract: Ventricular remodeling is the progressive pathologic change of the original substance and morphology of the ventricle caused by various injuries and has attracted increasing attention in the past decade. This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of articles on ventricular remodeling published in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2012 to 2022 to understand the current research state in the field of ventricular remodeling and provide insights for clinicians and researchers. As a result, a total of 1710 articles on ventricular remodeling were included. Annual publications have been gradually increasing and have remained at a high level over the past 10 years. The United States of America contributed the most publications, followed by China. Circulation was the most mainstream and authoritative journal focusing on ventricular remodeling. Research hotspot analysis suggested that myocardial infarction was the primary risk factor for ventricular remodeling, and emerging risk factor studies have focused on pulmonary hypertension, aortic stenosis, and diabetes. The mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ventricular remodeling were mainly closely associated with inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and myocardial fibrosis. Intensive investigation of the interactions between different mechanisms might be a future research direction. In terms of treatment, cardiac resynchronization therapy was a hot topic of research. These findings can help researchers grasp the research status of ventricular remodeling and determine future research directions.
