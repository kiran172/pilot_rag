Title: Endovascular re-canalization for symptomatic non-acute intracranial large artery occlusion: a single-center retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Managing patients with symptomatic non-acute intracranial large artery occlusion (SNA-ILAO) poses a significant challenge due to the high morbidity and risk of recurrent critical ischemic events, even with standard medical therapy. This unique subgroup of patients requires specialized attention. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of endovascular interventional recanalization for SNA-ILAO.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of patients with SNA-ILAO who underwent endovascular interventional therapy at the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from 2018 to 2021. The collected data included clinical demography, imaging data, treatment details, and prognosis. Follow-up imaging assessments were conducted for the patients, and descriptive statistics were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were enrolled, with a majority being male (58.3%) and a mean age of 62.0Â±9.3 years. The pre-treatment median modified Rankin scale (mRS) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at baseline were 3 and 1, respectively. The most common occlusion location was the middle cerebral artery (MCA), including M1 (70.8%), M2 (20.8%), and M3 (4.7%). Successful recanalization was achieved in all 24 patients, with 21 cases (87.5%) achieving thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) 3 reperfusion and the remaining 3 cases (12.5%) achieving TICI 2b reperfusion. Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurred in 2 patients (8.3%). During the first 30-day clinical follow-up, none of these patients experienced any recurrent cerebral ischemic events. During the 29.5-month follow-up period for vessel imaging, only 12.5% (3/24) of patients who had follow-up imaging experienced re-stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular recanalization is a potentially safe and effective procedure for patients with SNA-ILAO. However, it is important to note that there is still a non-negligible rate of complications associated with this treatment. Therefore, exercising caution and implementing strict controls when administering this procedure is crucial.
