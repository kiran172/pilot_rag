Title: The prognostic value of CT-derived fractional flow reserve in coronary artery bypass graft: a retrospective multicenter study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive value of CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) in anastomosis occlusion after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
METHODS: Patients undergoing CABG with both pre- and post-operative coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) were retrospectively included. Preoperative CCTA studies were used to evaluate anatomical and FFR<sub>CT</sub> information of target vessels. A diameter stenosis (DS) ≥ 70% or left main &gt; 50% was considered to be anatomically severe, while FFR<sub>CT</sub> value ≤ 0.80 be functionally significant. The primary endpoint was anastomosis occlusion evaluated on post-operative CCTA during follow-up. Predictors of anastomosis occlusion were assessed by the multivariate binary logistic regression with generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: A total of 270 anastomoses were identified in 88 enrolled patients. Forty-one anastomoses from 30 patients exhibited occlusion during a follow-up of 15.3 months after CABG. The occluded group had significantly increased prevalence of non-severe DS (58.5% vs. 40.2%; p = 0.023) and non-significant FFR<sub>CT</sub> (48.8% vs. 10.0%; p &lt; 0.001). Multivariable analysis indicated FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 (odds ratio [OR]: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03-0.33; p &lt; 0.001) and older age (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.97; p = 0.001) were predictors for bypass patency during follow-up, while myocardial infarction history and anastomosis to a local lesion or bifurcation (all p value &lt; 0.05) were predictors of occlusion. Adding FFR<sub>CT</sub> into the model based on the clinical and anatomical predictors had an improved AUC of 0.848 (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 was associated with a significant risk reduction of anastomosis occlusion after CABG. Preoperative judgment of the hemodynamic significance may improve the CABG surgery strategy and reduce graft failure.
KEY POINTS: • FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 was associated with a significant risk reduction of anastomosis occlusion after CABG. • The addition of FFR<sub>CT</sub> into the integrated model including clinical (age and history of myocardial infarction) and anatomical CCTA indicators (local lesion and bifurcation) significantly improved the model performance with an AUC of 0.848 (p = 0.005). • Preoperative judgment of the hemodynamic significance may help improve the decision-making and surgery planning in patients indicated for CABG and significantly reduce graft failure, without an extra radiation exposure and risk of invasive procedure.
