Title: Relevance of Carotid Reocclusion in Tandem Lesions.

Abstract: AIMS: Carotid reocclusion (CRO) after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to tandem lesion (TL) or isolated internal carotid occlusion (ICO) is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Our aim was to analyze the predictors and clinical impact of CRO.
METHODS: A retrospective single-center analysis of all patients with anterior circulation strokes who underwent MT prospectively included in a registry between 2017 and 2020 was performed. ICO and TL as stroke causes were included. Stent deployment was left to the discretion of the interventionist. All patients received at least intravenous aspirin during MT. CRO was assessed using ultrasound within the first 24 h after MT. Efficacy and safety of stenting were assessed.
RESULTS: Among 1304 AIS cases, 218 (16.7%) were related to TL or ICO. Of them, 5% (n=11) were associated with internal CRO 24 h after the endovascular procedure. After adjusting per confounders, multivariate analysis showed that the independent variables associated with CRO were the TICI recanalization grade [TICI 2b-3; OR 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.89, p=0.040], pial collateral circulation presence (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.45, p=0.03), stent deployment during MT (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.84, p=0.030), and general anesthesia use (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.13-7.90, p=0.034). CRO showed a trend toward worst outcomes (modified Rankin scale 3-6) at 3 months (OR 3.4, 95% CI 0.96-12, p=0.057). After multivariate analysis, variables independently associated with worse outcomes at 90 days were intrastent platelet aggregation phenomena during endovascular therapy, admission National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and age. Conversely, intravenous thrombolysis and TICI 2b-3 recanalization grade were identified as independent predictors of good outcomes at 90 days.
CONCLUSIONS: CRO has a relevant clinical impact in our study, associating lower rates of good functional outcomes at 3 months. Independent factors of CRO were the recanalization degree, presence of pial collateral circulation, use of a stent as a protective factor, and use of general anesthesia during thrombectomy.
