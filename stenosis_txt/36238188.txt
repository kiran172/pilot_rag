Title: Embolization of Inferior Pancreaticoduodenal Artery Aneurysm with Celiac Stenosis or Occlusion: A Report of Three Cases and a Review of Literature.

Abstract: True pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms are relatively rare, approximately 50% of which are associated with stenosis or occlusion of the celiac axis. It is imperative to treat the condition immediately after diagnosis, considering that its rupture has a mortality rate of approximately 50%. The current most commonly used method to treat pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms is transcatheter arterial embolization. Here, we report three cases of embolization of inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm with celiac stenosis or occlusion along with a literature review.
