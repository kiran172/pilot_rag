Title: Novel percutaneous intervention technique for obstructed coronary artery after valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (valve-in-valve TAVR) increases the risk of coronary obstruction. Although the coronary protection strategy is widely used, the use of the bailout technique after coronary obstruction is limited. Hence, we report a simple bailout technique for coronary obstruction after valve-in-valve TAVR. An 82-year-old woman presented with structural valve deterioration. The left anterior descending coronary artery had 90% stenosis. After TAVR, the prosthetic valve shifted close to the ascending aorta wall, consequently impairing coronary flow. The wire crossed with the Judkins right guiding catheter (JR) reference to the en-face and perpendicular views. Using the guide-extension catheter, the JR contacted the contralateral ascending aorta as a backup catheter. After a balloon was dilated between the prosthetic valve and aorta, JR engaged into the coronary artery with excellent backup. This novel "Whisker pole guiding technique" is useful, even after valve-in-valve TAVR.
