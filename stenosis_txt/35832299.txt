Title: Diagnostic Efficacy of CT Radiomic Features in Pulmonary Invasive Mucinous Adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: In order to solve the problem of the effect of CT images on the diagnosis of lungs, the authors proposed a method for the diagnosis of invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lungs based on CT radiomic features, and the modified method is found by reviewing past cases: among the 34 cases of primary pulmonary lymphoma, 12 cases were nodular mass type, 19 cases were nonnodular mass type, and 3 cases were mixed type; 13 cases involved bilateral lung lobes, 7 cases involved right lung, and 4 cases involved left lung example. There were 17 cases of tumor consolidation density shadow, 17 cases of mixed density shadow, the average CT value was about 32HU, 15 cases of cavitation sign, 6 cases of cavity, 9 cases of angiography sign, 30 cases of air bronchus sign, 22 cases of bronchiectasis, bronchial stenosis or amputation in 8 cases, pleural effusion in 12 cases, lymph node enlargement in 15 cases, and pleural metastasis in 2 cases. The final pathological results included 24 cases of membrane-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, 9 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 1 case of T-cell lymphoma. The CT manifestations of primary pulmonary lymphoma (PPL) are diverse and do not have obvious specificity, the imaging manifestations are correlated with pathological types, and air bronchial signs, bronchiectasis, angiography signs, and other signs are used for the diagnosis of PPL. This is of great significance for the diagnosis of PPL.
