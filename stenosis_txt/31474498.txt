Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis can improve long-term survival of nonagenarians as compared to an age- and sex-matched general population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nonagenarians are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) based solely on their age. The aim of our study was to evaluate survival of nonagenarians with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) after TAVR as compared to an age- and sex-matched general population.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2017, 1052 consecutive patients ≥80 years scheduled for TAVR were included. Patients were divided into three groups depending on their age at the time of the procedure: 80-84 (Group 1), 85-89 (Group 2) and ≥90 years (Group 3). Survival of patients treated with TAVR was compared to the life expectancy of an age- and sex-matched cohort in the general population.
RESULTS: Nonagenarians were more likely to experience major access-site complications than their younger counterparts (7.6% Group 1 vs. 10.1% Group 2 vs. 17.6% Group 3, p=0.016). One-year mortality in nonagenarians was higher as compared to the general population (27.8% vs. 20.0%). After two years, the mortality curves between the TAVR patients and the general population converged (39.2% vs. 37.5%) and were lower after five years.
CONCLUSIONS: During the observation period of five years, carefully selected nonagenarians treated with TAVR had at least the same mortality rate as an age- and sex-matched general population after two years despite procedure-associated complications. The negative prognostic impact of the severe AS was completely eliminated by TAVR.
