Title: Anterior Translocation of the Right Pulmonary Artery to Relieve Bronchial Compression in Truncus Arteriosus With Interrupted Aortic Arch.

Abstract: We report an anterior translocation of the right pulmonary artery procedure to relieve severe left bronchial obstruction that was caused by right pulmonary artery stent placement in a 1-year-old patient with truncus arteriosus and interrupted aortic arch. After neonatal repair, the patient re-presented with severe truncal valve regurgitation, right pulmonary artery stenosis, and severe biventricular dysfunction, which was treated with truncal valve repair and right pulmonary artery plasty. The patient suffered from left bronchial compression from right pulmonary artery stent placement, which was successfully treated by the translocation procedure. Bronchial stenosis was successfully relieved by the translocation procedure. Indications, advantages, and disadvantages of this procedure are discussed.
