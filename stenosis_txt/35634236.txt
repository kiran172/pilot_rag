Title: Treatment Results and Postoperative Complications of Single-Stage Tracheal Resection in Adolescent Patients with Post-Intubation Tracheal Stenosis, Compared to Adults.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the treatment outcomes and postoperative complications of tracheal resection in patients under the age of 19 years with post-intubation tracheal stenosis, and to compare the results with those of adults.
METHODS: Data were retrospectively retrieved from the medical records, including demographic characteristics, perioperative features, any postoperative complications and follow-up statuses of the patients. Treatment results and postoperative complications were compared between adolescent and adult groups.
RESULTS: Overall, anastomotic and non-anastomotic complication rates in the adolescent group and the adult group were 40%, 40%, 10% and 63%, 44.4%, 33.3%, respectively. Overall treatment success rates based on tracheostomy tube and tracheal stent free status were 90% and 92.6% in adolescent and adults, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Treatment success rates and incidence of anastomotic complications were found similar in patients under the age of 19 years and adult patients who underwent single-stage tracheal resection and end to end anastomosis for treatment of post-intubation tracheal stenosis.
