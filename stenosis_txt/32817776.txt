Title: Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome during hepatic vein catheterization.

Abstract: This case report describes a 4-year-old male with a history of hepatoblastoma, treated with chemotherapy followed by a right extended hepatectomy. Secondary to this, the patient experienced recurrent hepatic vein stenosis. He was treated initially with conventional angioplasty, followed by paclitaxel-coated balloon dilatations in an attempt to prevent episodes of re-stenosis. During the catheterization of the hepatic vein in one of the treatments, hemodynamic instability due to an acute Budd-Chiari syndrome occurred. The hemodynamic compromise became unresponsive to intravascular resuscitation and inotropic support. The patient was then treated with an emergency conventional angioplasty of the hepatic vein, which resulted in a rapid response and eventually in a full recovery. The etiology of this complication remains unclear; however, it may have been secondary to endothelial damage leading to acute thrombosis and/or venous spasm. Conventional angioplasty was successful in managing this complication. Awareness of iatrogenic acute Budd-Chiari syndrome as a potentially fatal complication during hepatic catheterization/dilatation, especially in the posthepatectomy setting, successful management of this complication, and the importance of a multidisciplinary and rapid response, is emphasized.
