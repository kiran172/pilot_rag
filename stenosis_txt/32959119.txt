Title: Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening and reduced leaflet motion after the implantation of the Perceval S sutureless bioprosthesis.

Abstract: Hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) is gaining attention as a relatively common issue after surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR). However, only a few reports have described HALT in sutureless bioprosthesis, which has emerged as a promising tool with excellent hemodynamics and enhanced implantability. We herein report a 75-year-old woman who underwent quintuple coronary artery bypass grafting and sutureless AVR with a Perceval S bioprosthesis (LivaNova PLC, London, UK). Despite an uneventful perioperative course, her recovery was slow with persistent pleural effusion. Echocardiography revealed an increased transvalvular pressure gradient, and HALT was confirmed by computed tomography. The patient received aggressive anticoagulation therapy with resolution of the HALT and made an uneventful recovery. Current guidelines provide no specific recommendations for peri-procedural antithrombotic therapy for sutureless AVR. However, HALT is not rare after sutureless AVR and can lead to significant clinical consequences. In this case, aggressive anticoagulation therapy with systemic heparinization was effective as HALT treatment following early post-sutureless AVR. Further investigation is required to determine the optimal antithrombotic strategy for sutureless AVR.
