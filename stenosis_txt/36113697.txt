Title: Dupilumab-associated ectropion and punctal stenosis treated with tacrolimus ointment (0.03%) in a 15-year-old girl.

Abstract: A 15-year-old Asian girl with severe atopic dermatitis was referred for dupilumab-associated blepharoconjunctivitis. Medical history was significant for severe atopic dermatitis. She was started on prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic suspension three times daily, and dupilumab injections were withheld after the initial visit. The patient was noted to have right lower eyelid ectropion, cicatricial occlusion, and severe punctal stenosis 6 weeks later. She was started on 0.03% tacrolimus ointment to the eyelid margin. Resolution of ectropion and restoration of punctal patency with residual stenosis were observed 4 weeks later. This is the first reported adolescent case of dupilumab-associated ectropion and punctal stenosis successfully treated with topical tacrolimus ointment.
