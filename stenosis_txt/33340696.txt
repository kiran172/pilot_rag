Title: Perioperative outcomes for carotid revascularization on asymptomatic dialysis-dependent patients meet Society for Vascular Society guidelines.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The current Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines recommend carotid revascularization for asymptomatic disease in patients with at least a 3-year life expectancy and stenosis >60% when the expected perioperative stroke and death rate is <3%. Based on this recommendation, it was previously determined that asymptomatic patients who require dialysis would not meet the perioperative stroke and death thresholds nor the long-term survival benchmarks to justify carotid surgery. To determine whether carotid surgery for patients requiring dialysis is appropriate, the present study compared the perioperative outcomes after carotid revascularization for dialysis-dependent patients relative to nondialysis patients in a contemporary, national cohort.
METHODS: The targeted vascular module from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried to identify patients who undergone carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic carotid disease from 2011 to 2018. The cohort was categorized as requiring or not requiring dialysis. The primary 30-day outcomes included mortality and the composite of stroke/death and stroke/death/myocardial infarction (MI). Univariate analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Multivariable analyses were used to assess the independent associations of the estimated glomerular filtration rate and dialysis dependence with the stroke/death rate.
RESULTS: A total of 17,579 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 226 (1.3%) required dialysis at revascularization. No difference was found in the degree of severe stenosis (80%-99%) demonstrated by 69% of the dialysis cohort and 72% of the nondialysis cohort (P = .9). Of the dialysis and nondialysis cohorts, 5% and 3.6% underwent carotid artery stenting (P = .3). The dialysis-dependent patients were younger (68 vs 71 years; P < .001) and were more likely to have insulin-dependent diabetes (47% vs 12%; P < .001), congestive heart failure (8.4% vs 1.4%; P < .001), and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15% vs 10%; P = .03). In the dialysis and nondialysis cohort, 2 (0.9%) and 88 (0.5%) patients died (P = .3); 4 (1.8%) and 247 (1.4%) experienced strokes (P = .6); and 3 (1.3%) and 185 (1.1%) patients experienced MI (P = .5), respectively. The composite outcomes of stroke/death and stroke/death/MI was 2.2% (n = 5) and 1.8% (n = 319; P = .6) and 3.5% (n = 8) and 2.8% (n = 479; P = .4) in the dialysis and nondialysis cohorts, respectively. After multivariable analysis, neither the estimated glomerular filtration rate (adjusted odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.01; P = .26) nor dialysis dependence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-1.57; P = .13) was independently associated with the composite outcome of stroke/death.
CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day carotid revascularization outcomes for asymptomatic disease in dialysis-dependent patients met the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines in this national cohort and might be better than previously surmised. Hence, vascular surgeons could consider carotid revascularization for select dialysis-dependent patients with the appropriate expected longevity and perioperative risk.
