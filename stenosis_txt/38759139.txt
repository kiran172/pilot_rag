Title: Derivation and Validation of a Scoring System for Predicting Poor Outcome After Posterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke in China.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Guidelines for posterior circulation ischemic stroke (PCIS) treatment are lacking and outcome prediction is crucial for patients and clinicians. We aimed to develop and validate a prognostic score to predict the poor outcome for patients with PCIS.
METHODS: The score was developed from a prospective derivation cohort named the Third China National Stroke Registry (August 2015-March 2018) and validated in a spatiotemporal independent validation cohort (December 2017-March 2023) in China. Patients with PCIS with acute infarctions defined as hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging were included in this study. The poor outcome was measured as modified Rankin scale (mRS) score 3-6 at 3 months after PCIS. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for poor outcome. The prognostic score, namely PCIS Outcome Score (PCISOS), was developed by assigning points to variables based on their relative Î²-coefficients in the logistic model.
RESULTS: The PCISOS was derived from 3,294 patients (median age 62 [interquartile range (IQR) 55-70] years; 2,250 [68.3%] men) and validated in 501 patients (median age 61 [IQR 53-68] years; 404 [80.6%] men). Among them, 384 (11.7%) and 64 (12.8%) had poor outcome 3 months after stroke in respective cohorts. Age, mRS before admission, NIH Stroke Scale on admission, ischemic stroke history, infarction distribution, basilar artery, and posterior cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion were identified as independent predictors for poor outcome and included in PCISOS. This easy-to-use integer scoring system identified a marked risk gradient between 4 risk groups. PCISOS performed better than previous scores, with an excellent discrimination (C statistic) of 0.80 (95% CI 0.77-0.83) in the derivation cohort and 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) in the validation cohort. Calibration test showed high agreement between the predicted and observed outcomes in both cohorts.
DISCUSSION: PCISOS can be applied for patients with PCIS with acute infarctions to predict functional outcome at 3 months post-PCIS. This simple tool helps clinicians to identify patients with PCIS with higher risk of poor outcome and provides reliable outcome expectations for patients. This information might be used for personalized rehabilitation plan and patient selection for future clinical trials to reduce disability and mortality.
