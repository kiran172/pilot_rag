Title: Systemic steroid application for treatment of edematous anastomotic stenosis following delta-shaped anastomosis in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Delta-shaped anastomosis is a common method of intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. One common postoperative complication of this procedure is anastomotic stenosis, and endoscopic balloon dilatation is a major remedy for such complications. Other treatment strategies are necessary to manage unsuccessful endoscopic balloon dilatation.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case where systemic steroid treatment was applied in sustained anastomotic stenosis after endoscopic balloon dilatation. We performed delta-shaped anastomosis in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy to treat early-stage gastric cancer in a patient. The patient experienced abdominal pain post-surgery; subsequent investigation revealed edematous anastomotic stenosis. The stenosis sustained even after endoscopic balloon dilatation and local steroid injection. Consequently, we applied systemic steroid treatment.
CONCLUSION: Systemic steroid treatment improved the stenosis and no recurrence was observed. These results suggest that systemic steroid application could be useful to treat anastomotic stenosis.
