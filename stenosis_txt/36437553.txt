Title: Research Progress of Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.

Abstract: Vascular recanalization is the essential procedure in which severe coronary artery stenosis is diagnosed. However, the blood flow recovery associated with this procedure may cause myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI), which aggravates heart failure. Unfortunately, the mechanism of MIRI has historically been poorly understood. As we now know, calcium overloading, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and ferroptosis take part in the process of MIRI. Modern medicine has shown through clinical studies its own limited effects in the case of MIRI, whereas Chinese traditional medicine demonstrates a strong vitality. Multiple-target effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and cardio-protection effects, are central to this vitality. In our clinic center, Yixin formula is commonly used in patients with MIRI. This formula contains Astragalus, Ligusticum Wallichii, Salvia, Rhodiola Rosea, Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Cyperus Rotundus, and Cassia Twig. Its effects include warming yang energy, activating blood circulation, and eliminating blood stasis. In our previous laboratory studies, we have proved that it can reduce MIRI and oxidative stress injury in rats suffering from ischemia myocardiopathy. It can also inhibit apoptosis and protect myocardium. In this paper, we review the research of Yixin formula and other related herbal medicines in MIRI therapy.
