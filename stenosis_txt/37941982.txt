Title: Severe acute kidney injury in a patient with renal artery stenosis of a single-functioning kidney: A case report of rapid normalisation of the renal function after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent placement.

Abstract: Revascularisation of renal arterial stenosis in acute settings, such as uncontrolled arterial hypertension, flash pulmonary oedema and/or acute renal failure, has shown controversial results in observational and prospective studies. Current guidelines do not recommend revascularisation in the occurrence of renal failure as revascularisation and best medical treatment have shown similar long-term outcomes on renal function. We describe a case of acute degradation of the renal function (with oligo-anuria and a peak creatinine of 462 µmol/L) after the re-introduction of an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (irbesartan) in a 66-year-old Caucasian diabetic male patient with bilateral renal stenosis and a right-sided single-functioning kidney, with a rapid improvement of the renal function which normalized 5 days after percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of the right renal artery.
