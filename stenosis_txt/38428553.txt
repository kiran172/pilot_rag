Title: Kissing shockwave balloon in a case of extensive calcified abdominal aorta during transfemoral TAVI.

Abstract: An 84-year-old man with extensive calcified atherosclerosis of the infrarenal abdominal aorta was diagnosed with severe aortic valve stenosis, presenting with dyspnea. To facilitate transfemoral approach during the TAVI procedure, IVUS-guided intravascular lithotripsy was successfully performed using Kissing Shockwave Balloon Technique.
