Title: "Pure" severe aortic stenosis without concomitant valvular heart diseases: echocardiographic and pathophysiological features.

Abstract: PURPOSE: In echocardiography the severity of aortic stenosis (AS) is defined by effective orifice area (EOA), mean pressure gradient (mPG<sub>AV</sub>) and transvalvular flow velocity (maxV<sub>AV</sub>). The hypothesis of the present study was to confirm the pathophysiological presence of combined left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction (DD) and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in patients with "pure" severe AS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (n = 306) with asymptomatic (n = 133) and symptomatic (n = 173) "pure" severe AS (mean age 78 ± 9.5 years) defined by indexed EOA &lt; 0.6 cm2 were enrolled between 2014 and 2016. AS patients were divided into 4 subgroups according to mPG<sub>AV</sub> and indexed left ventricular stroke volume: low flow (LF) low gradient (LG)-AS (n = 133), normal flow (NF) LG-AS (n = 91), LF high gradient (HG)-AS (n = 21) and NFHG-AS (n = 61). Patients with "pure" severe AS showed mean mPG<sub>AV</sub> of 31.7 ± 9.1 mmHg and mean maxV<sub>AV</sub> of 3.8 ± 0.6 m/s. Only 131 of 306 patients (43%) exhibited mPG<sub>AV</sub> &gt; 40 mmHg and maxV<sub>AV</sub> &gt; 4 m/s documenting incongruencies of the AS severity assessment by Doppler echocardiography. LVH was documented in 81%, DD in 76% and PAH in 80% of AS patients. 54% of "pure" AS patients exhibited all three alterations. Ranges of mPG<sub>AV</sub> and maxV<sub>AV</sub> were higher in patients with all three alterations compared to patients with less than three. 224 (73%) patients presented LG-conditions and 82 (27%) HG-conditions. LVH was predominant in NF-AS (p = 0.014) and PAH in LFHG-AS (p = 0.014). Patients' treatment was retrospectively assessed (surgery: n = 100, TAVI: n = 48, optimal medical treatment: n = 156).
CONCLUSION: In patients with "pure" AS according to current guidelines the presence of combined LVH, DD and PAH as accepted pathophysiological sequelae of severe AS cannot be confirmed. Probably, the detection of these secondary cardiac alterations might improve the diagnostic algorithm to avoid overestimation of AS severity.
