Title: Association of sotalol versus atenolol therapy with survival in dogs with severe subaortic stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Dogs with severe subaortic stenosis (SAS) are at risk of dying suddenly from fatal arrhythmias. Survival is not improved when treated with pure beta-adrenergic receptor (β)-blockers; however, the effect of other antiarrhythmic drugs on survival is unknown. Sotalol is both a β-blocker and a class III antiarrhythmic drug; the combination of these differing mechanisms may provide benefit to dogs with severe SAS. The primary objective of this study was to compare survival in dogs with severe SAS that were treated with either sotalol or atenolol. The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of pressure gradient (PG), age, breed, and aortic regurgitation on survival.
ANIMALS: Forty-three client-owned dogs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Medical records of dogs diagnosed with severe SAS (PG ≥ 80 mmHg) between 2003 and 2020 were reviewed.
RESULTS: No statistical difference was identified in survival time between dogs treated with sotalol (n=14) and those treated with atenolol (n=29) when evaluating all-cause mortality (p=0.172) or cardiac-related mortality (p=0.157). Of the dogs that died suddenly, survival time was significantly shorter in dogs treated with sotalol compared to those treated with atenolol (p=0.046). Multivariable analysis showed that PG (p=0.002) and treatment with sotalol (p=0.050) negatively influenced survival in the dogs that died suddenly.
CONCLUSIONS: Sotalol did not have a significant effect on survival overall but may increase the risk of sudden death in dogs with severe SAS compared to atenolol.
