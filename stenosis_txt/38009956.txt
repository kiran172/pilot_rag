Title: Diagnosis of membranous supravalvular aortic stenosis with severe aortic valve insufficiency.

Abstract: Although the clinical manifestations of membranous supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) are distinctive, its diagnosis remains challenging. Failure to initiate surgical treatment in a timely manner greatly increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. We report a case of membranous SVAS, detailing the clinical presentation and imaging manifestations.
