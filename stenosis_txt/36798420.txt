Title: Characteristics and Long-term Mortality in Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries (STE-MINOCA): A High Risk Cohort.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronaries (STE-MINOCA) is largely unknown.
METHODS: The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence, characteristics, and 5-year mortality of patients with STE-MINOCA compared to STEMI with coronary artery obstruction (STEMI-Obstruction) using a multicenter cohort of consecutive STEMI patients at 3 regional Midwest STEMI programs from 2003 to 2020. STE-MINOCA was defined based on (1) coronary stenosis < 60% by visual estimation, (2) ischemia with elevated troponin, and (3) no alternative diagnosis. STE-MINOCA was further classified based on American Heart Association (AHA) definition as AHA STE-MINOCA and AHA STE-MINOCA Mimicker.
RESULTS: 8,566 STEMI patients, including 420 (4.9%) STE-MINOCA (26.9% AHA STE-MINOCA and 73.1% AHA STE-MINOCA Mimicker) were followed for a median of 7.1 years. Compared to STEMI-Obstruction, STE-MINOCA were younger, more often female, had fewer cardiovascular risk factors, and were less likely to be discharged on cardiac medications. At five years, mortality was higher in STE-MINOCA compared with STEMI-Obstruction (18% vs. 15%, p=0.033). In propensity score-matched analysis, STE-MINOCA had a 1.4-fold (95% CI: 1.04-1.89, p=0.028) higher risk of 5-year all-cause mortality compared with STEMI-Obstruction. Furthermore, 5-year mortality risk was significantly higher in AHA STE-MINOCA Mimicker (19% vs. 15%, p=0.043) but similar in AHA STE-MINOCA (17% vs. 15%, p=0.42) compared with STEMI-Obstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large multicenter STEMI cohort, nearly 5% of patients presented with STE-MINOCA. At five years, mortality approached 20% among patients with STE-MINOCA. Despite the lower risk profile, STE-MINOCA patients were at 40% higher risk of 5-year all-cause mortality compared with STEMI-Obstruction. Additionally, 5-year all-cause mortality risk was higher in AHA STE-MINOCA Mimicker but similar in AHA STE-MINOCA compared to STEMI-Obstruction.
