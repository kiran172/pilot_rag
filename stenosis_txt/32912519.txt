Title: Predictors and Consequences of Silent Brain Infarction in Patients with Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: AIM: Silent brain infarction (SBI) is associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS), and is therefore one of the criteria for performing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Despite an extensive literature, this issue is still a matter of debate. Aim of the present work was to evaluate incidence and predictors of SBI in patients undergoing CEA for ACS, and to investigate its possible impact on CEA outcome.
METHODS: All patients submitted to CEA in a single academic center from 2005 to 2019 were prospectively inserted into a specific database. The presence of SBI was evaluated by preoperative computed tomography (CT), considering exclusively infarctions in the carotid territories from an athero-embolic source. Preoperative characteristics were investigated as possible risk factor for SBI at the uni- and multivariate analysis. The impact of SBI on stroke occurrence after CEA was also evaluated.
RESULTS: In the designated period, over a total of 1288 ACS considered and submitted to CEA, 105 (8.2%) were associated with SBI. Male sex, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, contralateral carotid occlusion and severity of carotid stenosis were associated with SBI at the univariate analysis; preoperative statin therapy showed to be a protective factor. At the multivariate analysis, contralateral carotid occlusion and severity of stenosis were independently associated with SBI (OR: 3.16, 95%CI 1.62-6.18, P=.001; OR: 1.04, 95%CI 1.01-1.07, P=.004, respectively), with statin therapy confirmed as a protective factor (OR: 0.60, 95%CI: 0.40-0.92, P=.002). Overall post-CEA stroke rate was 0.9%, with a higher post-operative risk independently predicted by the presence of SBI (OR:4.23, 95%CI: 1.40-12.73, P=.01).
CONCLUSION: SBI is present in 8% of patients with ACS, and is significantly associated with contralateral carotid occlusion and severity of the carotid stenosis. Statin therapy reduces the occurrence of this phenomenon. The presence of SBI should be carefully considered in indication to CEA since it significantly increases the surgical risk.
