Title: Left atrial volume index predicts adverse events in asymptomatic moderate or severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In aortic stenosis (AS), chronic pressure overload on left ventricle (LV) leads to LV hypertrophy, impaired relaxation, increased chamber stiffness, fibrosis and left atrial (LA) dilatation. An enlarged LA may be a marker of longstanding diastolic dysfunction (DD) and more advanced disease in AS. We aimed to assess the impact of LA volume index (LAVI) on events in patients with moderate or severe AS.
METHODS: A total of 324 patients (mean age 69 ± 13 years, 61% men) were included. LA volume was measured by biplane Simpson's method using apical four- and two-chamber views and indexed to body surface area. An increased LAVI was defined as &gt; 34 ml/m2 .
RESULTS: The mean EF was 64 ± 8%, LAVI 35 ± 14 ml/m2 and flow rate 244 ± 70 ml/s. The number of total events was 275 (85%): 243 (75%) aortic valve replacement and 32 (10%) deaths. Mean follow-up 23.7 ± 23.8 months (median 15.2 months). An increased LAVI (45% [n = 145]) was associated with adverse events (HR 1.86; 95% CI 1.24-2.82, p = 0.003) independent of age, smoking, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, LV ejection fraction, LV mass, aortic valve area, and low flow rate (&lt;200 ml/s). In the same multivariate model, when increased LAVI was replaced by E/e' ratio ≥14 cm, no association was found between E/e' ratio ≥14 cm and adverse events (HR 1.18; 95% CI .78-1.78, p = 0.430).
CONCLUSION: LAVI was an independent predictor of adverse events in patients with moderate or severe AS and preserved ejection fraction. Including LAVI in the risk assessment of AS patients may further improve risk stratification.
