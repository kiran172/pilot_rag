Title: Relation of Plasma Xanthine Oxidoreductase Activity to Coronary Lipid Core Plaques Assessed by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Intravascular Ultrasound in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: Previous studies reported that elevated serum uric acid level was associated with greater coronary lipid plaque. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in purine metabolism and is believed to play important roles in coronary atherosclerosis. However, the relation between XOR and coronary lipid plaque is unclear. Patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention under near-infrared spectroscopy intravascular ultrasound (NIRS-IVUS) guidance were prospectively included. They were divided into 3 groups according to plasma XOR activities based on a previous report: low, normal, and high. Quantitative coronary angiography and gray-scale IVUS were analyzed. The primary end point was coronary lipid plaques in a nontarget vessel assessed by NIRS-IVUS with lipid core burden index (LCBI) and maximum LCBI in 4 mm (maxLCBI<sub>4mm</sub>). Out of 68 patients, 26, 31, and 11 patients were classified as low, normal, and high XOR activity groups. Quantitative coronary angiography demonstrated that the high XOR activity group had longer lesion length, smaller minimum lumen diameter, and higher percentage of diameter stenosis in a nontarget vessel among the 3 groups. Gray-scale IVUS analysis also showed smaller lumen area in the high XOR activity group than the others. LCBI (102.1 ± 56.5 vs 65.6 ± 48.5 vs 55.6 ± 37.8, p = 0.04) and maxLCBI<sub>4mm</sub> (474.4 ± 171.6 vs 347.4 ± 181.6, 294.0 ± 155.9, p = 0.04) in a nontarget vessel were significantly higher in the high XOR group than in the normal and low groups. In conclusion, elevated XOR activity was associated with coronary lipid-rich plaque in a nontarget vessel in patients with stable coronary artery disease.
