Title: [Efficacy tubular paraspinal approach and conventional semi-laminar approach in treating lumbar stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To analysis of the efficacy of tubular paraspinal approach and conventional semi-laminar approach in treating lumbar stenosis. Methods: Retrospective research of clinical data of 56 lumbar stenosis cases who were operated in neurosurgery department of first center of PLA general hospital from May 2015 to June 2018. Collecting the information of sex, age, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative duration in bed, as well as length of hospital stay of those patients. The 2 groups of cases, tubular paraspinal approach group (n=35)and semi-laminal approachgroup (n=21), compared by Japanese orthopedic association (JOA) score and visual analogue scale to assess the functional situation of the patients before operation, 1 week after operation, 1 month after operation, 6 months after operation, and the last follow up. Results: The operating time(83.1±7.3 vs 86.1±9.6 min), intraoperative blood loss(18.2±3.9 vs 40.5±13.3 ml), postoperative duration in bed(37.4±7.8 vs 63.7±15.8 h), as well as length of hospital stay (3.8±1.1 vs 6.5±2.0 d)were all obviously better in tubular paraspinal approach group than in traditional semi-laminar approach group(P&lt;0.05). The postoperative 1 week, 1month, and 6 months JOA score (21.8±3.4, 23.6±2.4, 24.2±2.4 vs 19.9±3.7, 21.6±2.8, 22.4±2.1)and VAS (2.2±1.0, 2.0±1.1, 0.4±0.1 vs 3.1±1.2, 2.6±1.3, 0.5±0.1) were better in tubular paraspinal approach group than semi-laminar approach group (P&lt;0.05). While at the last follow up, the JOA score and VAS were similar in the 2 groups (P&gt;0.05) . Conclusions: In non-fusion techniques for treating lumbar stenosis, tubular paraspinal approach demonstrated less blood loss, shorter stay in bed as well as in hospital, and better symptom relief in early postoperative period than traditional semi-laminal approach. While at long term follow up, both approaches achieved satisfactory outcome.
