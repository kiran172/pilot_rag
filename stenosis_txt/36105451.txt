Title: Clinical Application of Spiral CT Reconstruction Imaging in Patients with Tracheal Stenosis before Anesthesia.

Abstract: In order to solve the problem of CT reconstruction imaging, this paper presents a study on the clinical application of preanesthesia in patients with tracheal stenosis. Patients with tracheal stenosis and multislice spiral CT virtual endoscopy (CTVE) were diagnosed, and their application effects were analyzed. Methods. 60 patients with tracheal stenosis were selected for clinical observation. The patients were given tracheal stenosis examination and multislice spiral CT virtual endoscopy. The examination results of the two groups were compared and analyzed by statistical methods. Results. There was no significant difference in the detection rate, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion. Multislice spiral CT virtual endoscopy combined with a fiberoptic bronchoscope for clinical diagnosis of tracheal stenosis can complement each other. Combined use can effectively improve the detection consistency, and is safe and reliable. It can be used as an effective means for the diagnosis of tracheal stenosis.
