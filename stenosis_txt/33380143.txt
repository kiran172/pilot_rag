Title: [Myocardial infarction or broken heart syndrome?].

Abstract: Takotsubo or broken heart syndrome represents a rare type of cardiomyopathy, often imitating acute myocardial infarction. It is a sudden transient cardiac syndrome that typically involves left ventricular apical akinesis with preserved motility of basal heart segments. In contrast to acute myocardial infarction, the pathology is fully reversible in the majority of patients. In the present casereport, we discuss 78yearsold female referred to our department for typical symptomatology of acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed significant stenosis on the left anterior descending coronary artery, but ventriculography disclosed apical dysfunction and clinical course of the disease result in the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Until recently, normal or nonobstructive coronary angiography represented one of the mean diagnostic features of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. In 2018, new diagnostic criteria were introduced, importantly modifying our approach to the Takotsubo diagnostics with omitting a coronary lesion as an exclusion criterium of the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
