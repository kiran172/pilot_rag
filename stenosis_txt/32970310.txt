Title: Prognostic value of tissue-tracking mitral annular displacement by speckle-tracking echocardiography in asymptomatic aortic stenosis patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tissue-tracking mitral annular displacement (TMAD) by speckle-tracking echocardiography provides rapid and simple assessment of left ventricular (LV) longitudinal deformation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of TMAD for the assessment of LV longitudinal deformation in patients with severe AS and preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF).
METHODS: We studied 44 patients with severe AS preserved and LVEF in whom TMAD was assessed. Using TMAD analysis software, the base-to-apex displacement of automatically defined mid-point of mitral annular line in four-chamber view was quickly assessed, and the percentage of its displacement to LV length at end-diastole (%TMAD) was calculated. We investigated the association between %TMAD and the cardiac events including appearance of symptom (dyspnea on exertion and hospitalization due to heart failure), decreased LVEF (< 50%), and cardiac death.
RESULTS: During follow-up, the cardiac events developed in 16 (36%) of 44 patients. %TMAD was significantly impaired in patients with the cardiac events compared with those without the cardiac events (9.6 ± 1.9 vs 12.1 ± 2.6, p = 0.002). The cardiac events were predicted by %TMAD (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54-0.85; p = 0.0012).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that TMAD easily and rapidly estimated by speckle-tracking echocardiography may be used as a simple method to predict occurrence of the cardiac events in asymptomatic severe AS patients with preserved LVEF.
