Title: Tandem stenosis of the cervical and thoracic spine: a systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tandem spinal stenosis (TSS) is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the spinal canal in multiple segments of the spine. Predominantly observed in the cervical and lumbar regions, TSS also manifests in the conjunction of the cervical and thoracic spine. The simultaneous occurrence of cervical and thoracic spinal stenosis engenders intricate symptoms, potentially leading to missed and delayed diagnosis. Furthermore, the presence of tandem cervical and thoracic stenosis (TCTS) introduces a notable impact on the decision-making calculus of surgeons when contemplating either one-staged or two-staged surgery. Currently, there is no agreed-upon strategy for surgical intervention of TCTS in the literature.
METHODS: Medical databases in English (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP CMJD) were searched using Medical Subject Heading queries for the terms "tandem cervical and thoracic stenosis", "cervical stenosis AND thoracic stenosis", "tandem spinal stenosis" and "concomitant spinal stenosis" from January 1980 to March 2023. We included studies involving adult individuals with TCTS. Articles exclusively focused on disorders within a single spine region or devoid of any mention of spinal disorders were excluded.
RESULTS: Initially, a total of 1625 literatures underwent consideration for inclusion in the study. Following the elimination of the duplicates through the utilization of EndNote, and a meticulous screening process involving scrutiny of abstracts and full-texts, 23 clinical studies met the predefined inclusion criteria. Of these, 2 studies solely focused on missed diagnosis, 19 studies exclusively discussed surgical strategy for TCTS, and 2 articles evaluated both surgical strategy and missed diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a missed diagnosis rate of 7.2% in TCTS, with the thoracic stenosis emerging as the predominant area susceptible to oversight. Therefore, the meticulous identification of TCTS assumes paramount significance as the inaugural step in its effective management. While both one-staged and two-staged surgeries have exhibited efficacy in addressing TCTS, the selection of the optimal surgical plan should be contingent upon the individualized circumstances of the patients.
