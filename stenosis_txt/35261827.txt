Title: Airway Emergencies Due to Anterior Mediastinal T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Managed With Planned Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation and Endotracheal Stent: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Anterior mediastinal tumors can occasionally cause acute respiratory failure by compressing the trachea and bronchi. In such cases, sedative muscle relaxants during tracheal intubation can cause fatal complete tracheal obstruction. We encountered a 15-year-old male patient with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) of the anterior mediastinum. For his airway emergency due to the stenosis extended from the lower part of the trachea to the tracheal bifurcation, venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was introducedÂ from the femoral vein under local anesthesia. After a short period of tracheal intubation management, an endotracheal stent (ES) was immediately placed in the lower trachea. We performed a needle biopsy, and he was diagnosed with T-LBL. Following the diagnosis, chemotherapy was introduced. The ES was able to secure sufficient tracheal diameter, and ECMO and ventilation were promptly discontinued. In the case of tracheal stenosis from the lower part of the trachea due to anterior mediastinal tumor, depending on the degree of stenosis, VV ECMO can be considered. Moreover, ES can lead to early weaning from VV ECMO and a ventilator.
