Title: Frontal inverted papillomas: A 25-year study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: This study analyzes the treatment outcomes of frontal inverted papillomas (FIPs) in an attempt to provide guidelines for surgery selection.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: The treatment results of 29 FIPs classified into five categories were retrospectively analyzed. The five categories are F1, tumor prolapsed into frontal sinus, tumor origin outside frontal sinus; F2, tumor origin inside frontal sinus, medial to the plane of lamina papyracea; F3, tumor origin inside frontal sinus, lateral to the plane of lamina papyracea; F4, bilateral; and F5, extrasinonasal.
RESULTS: Of the 11 F1 cases, 73% had Draf I and 27% had Draf IIA procedures. There was one (9%) frontal recurrence and one (9%) frontal stenosis. Of the 10 F2 cases, 10% had Draf I, 40% had Draf IIA, 40% had Draf IIB, and 10% had Draf III surgery with a trephination. One patient (10%) had a frontal recurrence. Of the five F3 cases, 40% had Draf IIA surgery, 20% had external frontoethmoidectomy, and 40% had external frontal sinusotomy. The recurrence rate was 60%, and frontal stenosis rate was 60%. The two F4 cases had external frontal sinusotomies and Draf III surgery with no frontal recurrence or stenosis. The patient with the F5 had a frontal recurrence after Draf IIA surgery and external frontoethmoidectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Draf I or IIA surgery is adequate for most F1 tumors, and Draf II surgery is adequate for most F2 tumors. F3 and F4 tumors can be managed initially by Draf III surgery with external frontal sinusotomy added when required. F5 tumors probably require combined surgical approaches.
