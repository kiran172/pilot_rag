Title: Successful redo aortic valve replacement using Perceval for multiple recurrent prosthetic valve dysfunction.

Abstract: A 50-year-old man who required aortic valve replacement (AVR) 3 times for severe paravalvular leakage (PVL) was diagnosed with a recurrence of severe PVL. Since the PVL recurred each time because of prosthetic valve detachment from the annulus, a fourth AVR was performed using a self-expanding sutureless valve. Postoperative echocardiography showed no significant PVL. The patient was discharged without any complications and returned to normal work soon after. In cases such as our patient, sutureless AVR could be a powerful alternative to conventional AVR.
