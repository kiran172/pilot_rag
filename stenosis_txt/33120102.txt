Title: Endoscopic management of pediatric extubation failure in the intensive care unit.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the endoscopic findings associated with pediatric extubation failure (EF) and evaluated the prognosis of endoscopic procedures.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of children with EF in the intensive care unit from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2019. Fifty-one children receiving endoscopic examination were enrolled in this study. EF was defined as the need for reintubation within 72 h of the first attempted extubation.
RESULTS: Thirty-three children (65%) were successfully extubated after endoscopic procedures, and 18 children (35%) failed in extubation. There was a higher percentage of children transferred from other hospitals with intubation in the failure group (56% vs 12%, p = 0.002). Subglottic stenosis (SGS) (35%) and laryngeal and tracheal granulation (33%) were two of the most common findings. Fourteen patients (82%) with granulation were successfully extubated. Two children in the failure group were diagnosed with mitochondrial myopathies (chrM:3243) and congenital myasthenic syndrome (CHAT). The success rate in cases of SGS reached 83% (15/18). Five patients diagnosed with laryngomalacia and another 3 patients with tracheomalacia failed extubation after supraglottoplasty and needed a temporary tracheostomy.
CONCLUSION: Granulation and subglottic stenosis were the leading causes of extubation failure. Patients transferred with intubation might have a poor prognosis after endoscopic procedures. Neuromuscular and metabolic disorders could be a hidden reason for extubation failure.
