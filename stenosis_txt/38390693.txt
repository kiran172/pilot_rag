Title: Timing of Complications in Open Airway Reconstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Tracheal resection (TR) and cricotracheal resection (CTR) are performed for patients with airway stenosis, tracheal tumor, and tracheoesophageal fistula. Post-operative complications include airway edema requiring reintubation, hematoma, anastomotic dehiscence, restenosis, and death. Although these complications and associated risk factors have been well described, the time where clinical suspicion should be highest post operatively has not been characterized.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TR or CTR at a single center between 2015 and 2022 were reviewed. Variables including demographics and comorbidities were recorded. Rate, nature, and time in days of post-operative complications were evaluated.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine cases were reviewed. Average patient age was 46.8 years old and 63.8% were male. The average follow-up period was 625 ± 724 days. 19 (27.5%) patients experienced one or more major complications including four (5.8%) who died. Eight (11.6%) patients required reintubation and 4 (5.8%) patients underwent revision tracheostomy. Most complications occurred within 8 days of surgery. Restenosis was noted an average of 42.6 days after surgery, with no new restenosis occurring after 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, most post-operative complications after TR or CTR, including hematoma and anastomotic dehiscence, occurred within 8 days post-operatively. Restenosis was noted approximately 1-3 months after surgery. This may inform clinical decision-making regarding patient monitoring and surveillance after open airway surgery.
