Title: The Effect of Celecoxib on the Progression of Calcific Aortic Valve Disease-Protective or Pathogenic?

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a debilitating condition for which there are limited therapeutic options aside from valve replacement. As such, it is crucial to explore alternative management strategies for CAVD. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly celecoxib, have been the subject of debate in the literature regarding their potential impact on CAVD. We conducted an in-depth analysis of five studies exploring the effect of celecoxib on CAVD and found discrepancies in both methods and results. Our findings suggest that celecoxib may impact the development of this disease via multiple mechanisms, each of which may have different effects on its pathogenesis. We also discovered limited clinical research examining the connection between celecoxib use and CAVD in medical patients. As such, further studies are needed to clarify the role of celecoxib and other NSAIDs in CAVD progression in order to inform future treatment options and clarify their impact on the disease.
