Title: Totally Intracorporeal Robot-assisted Unilateral or Bilateral Ileal Ureter Replacement for the Treatment of Ureteral Strictures: Technique and Outcomes from a Single Center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Few studies on totally intracorporeal robot-assisted ileal ureter replacement (RA-IUR) have been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To report our technique and the outcomes of totally intracorporeal RA-IUR for unilateral or bilateral ureteral reconstruction, involving performing cystoplasty simultaneously.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen patients underwent totally intracorporeal RA-IUR from April 2021 to July 2022 at a single center. The perioperative variables were prospectively collected, and the outcomes were assessed.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: The surgical procedure included dissection of the proximal end of the ureteral stricture or renal pelvis, harvesting of the ileal ureter, rebuilding of intestinal continuity, upper anastomosis of the ileum to the renal pelvis or the ureteral end, and lower anastomosis of the ileum to the bladder. All operations were performed intracorporeally.
MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographics and perioperative results were prospectively collected and analyzed for perioperative complications and success rates. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: All patients successfully underwent totally intracorporeal RA-IUR without open conversion. Seven patients received unilateral RA-IUR and eight received bilateral RA-IUR. The mean (range) length of the harvested ileal segment was 28.3 (15-40) cm, the operative duration was 261.8 (183-381) min, the estimated blood loss was 64.7 (30-100) ml, and the duration of postoperative hospitalization was 10.5 (7-17) d. At a median (range) follow-up of 14 (8-22) mo, the subjective and functional success rates were 100% and 86.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that totally intracorporeal unilateral or bilateral RA-IUR (even with ileocystoplasty) can be performed safely and efficiently with acceptable minor complications and a high success rate.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Our study indicates that totally intracorporeal robotic ileal ureter replacement surgery is safe and feasible for ureteral reconstruction, even with ileocystoplasty. The postoperative complications are acceptable. At a median follow-up of 14 (8-22) mo, the subjective and functional success rates were 100% and 86.7%, respectively.
