Title: Valvular surgery in donor hearts before orthotopic heart transplantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Donor heart shortage has extended the waiting time and increased the mortality of patients on the transplant waiting list. Widening old standard donor criteria has successfully increased the number of heart transplantations, but for many years, a valve disease in a donor heart has been considered a primary contraindication for organ donation.
AIMS: To analyse the results of aortic and mitral valvular surgery in marginal donor hearts with valvulopathy before orthotopic heart transplantation.
METHODS: Between January 2012 and November 2015, we performed 53 heart transplantations in our department. In four donors, echocardiography performed at the time of organ procurement showed a valvular disease: three had moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation; and one had moderately severe aortic valve stenosis.
RESULTS: The mean bench mitral repair and aortic replacement time, aortic cross-clamp time and total ischaemic time were: 18 (range 7-25) minutes, 78.7 (range 57-98) minutes and 184 (range 89-255) minutes, respectively. Intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography showed good mitral repair or aortic prosthetic valve function, and good right and left ventricular function. One patient died of infectious pneumonia after 1 month. The mean duration of follow-up for the patients discharged home was 75Â±13 months, and all have returned to an active unrestricted lifestyle.
CONCLUSIONS: Our limited series demonstrates that conventional valvular procedures performed on otherwise healthy donor hearts with mitral and aortic valve pathology can efficaciously expand the donor pool for orthotopic cardiac transplantation and decrease the mortality rate on the waiting list.
