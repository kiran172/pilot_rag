Title: Current Immunosuppressive Treatment for Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a rare disease characterized by inflammation of large blood vessels, which results in vascular stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysm formation. The principal treatment has been glucocorticoids, but the recent emergence of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), represented by tocilizumab (TCZ), has significantly changed the treatment landscape. Both cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons will encounter patients receiving these drugs who require catheterization, other invasive procedures, or surgery. Several bDMARDs have shown promise against TAK in clinical studies and their use is expected to increase in the future. Janus kinase inhibitors may also be effective. Here, we review the evidence supporting the use of TCZ and other immunosuppressants in TAK and provides an update on their status as well as the relevant guidelines.
