Title: The Effect of Botulinum Toxin (Masport) Injection Following Internal Urethrotomy of Bulbar Urethral Stricture: A Pilot Study.

Abstract: The application of Botulinum toxin (Masport) in urology has a long history. We aimed to assess the effect of local Masport on improvement in patients with urethral stricture by reducing the recurrence of urethral stricture. This pilot study conducted was a double-blind randomized clinical trial with code IRCT20191222045852N1 on patients suffering from urethral stricture. Finally, 28 patients were allocated to intervention and control groups. Twelve patients received intralesional injection with Masport in addition to internal urethrotomy, while 16 patients underwent internal urethrotomy with normal saline. The Cox regression hazard model was used to evaluate the effect of treatment status on recurrence time adjusted for the age, length, and location of the stenosis, cause of the stenosis, and history of previous operations. The effect of treatment type was significant at the .05 level. The past medical history and cause of urethral stricture had a significant impact on relapse-free survival. Also, the improvement in the mean score of the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and Q-max in the group with Masport was significantly different from the group with normal saline. The internal urethrotomy with intralesional injection of Masport has a better survival prognosis than internal urethrotomy with normal saline group. Therefore, the authors suggest that, given this successful initial clinical trial, consideration be given to future studies involving the use of botox in the management of urethral strictures in conjunction with internal urethrotomy.
