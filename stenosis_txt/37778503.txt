Title: Seven-year outcomes following aortic valve replacement with a novel tissue bioprosthesis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: As bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) extends to younger cohorts, tissue durability is of paramount importance. We report 7-year outcomes from an AVR bioprosthesis utilizing novel tissue.
METHODS: This was an international investigational device exemption trial for novel AVR with annual follow-up and a subset re-consented at 5 years for extended 10-year follow-up. Safety end points and echocardiographic measurements were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee and by a dedicated core laboratory, respectively.
RESULTS: Between January 2013 and March 2016, 689 patients underwent AVR with the study valve. Mean age was 66.9 ± 11.6 years, Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score was 2.0% ± 1.8%, and 74.3% of patients were New York Heart Association functional class II and III. Five-year follow-up was completed by 512 patients, and 225 re-consented for extended follow-up. Follow-up duration was 5.3 ± 2.2 years (3665.6 patient-years), and 194 and 195 patients completed 6- and 7-year follow-ups, respectively. One-, 5-, and 7-year freedom from all-cause mortality was 97.7%, 89.4%, and 85.4%, respectively. Freedom from structural valve deterioration at 7 years was 99.3%. At 7 years, effective orifice area and mean gradients were 1.82 ± 0.57 cm2 (n = 153), and 9.4 ± 4.5 mm Hg (n = 157), respectively. At 7 years, predominantly none (96.8% [152 out of 157]) or trivial/trace (2.5% [4 out of 157]) paravalvular regurgitation and none (84.7% [133 out of 157]) or trivial/trace (11.5% [18 out of 157]) transvalvular regurgitation were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the longest surgical AVR follow-up with novel tissue in an investigational device exemption trial utilizing an independent clinical events committee and an echocardiography core laboratory. This tissue demonstrates excellent outcomes through 7 years and is the benchmark for future surgical and transcatheter prostheses.
