Title: 3D-Printed Poly (P-Dioxanone) Stent for Endovascular Application: In Vitro Evaluations.

Abstract: Rapid formation of innovative, inexpensive, personalized, and quickly reproducible artery bioresorbable stents (BRSs) is significantly important for treating dangerous and sometimes deadly cerebrovascular disorders. It is greatly challenging to give BRSs excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and bioabsorbability. The current BRSs, which are mostly fabricated from poly-l-lactide (PLLA), are usually applied to coronary revascularization but may not be suitable for cerebrovascular revascularization. Here, novel 3D-printed BRSs for cerebrovascular disease enabling anti-stenosis and gradually disappearing after vessel endothelialization are designed and fabricated by combining biocompatible poly (p-dioxanone) (PPDO) and 3D printing technology for the first time. We can control the strut thickness and vessel coverage of BRSs by adjusting the printing parameters to make the size of BRSs suitable for small-diameter vascular use. We added bis-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl) carbodiimide (commercial name: stabaxolÂ®-1) to PPDO to improve its hydrolytic stability without affecting its mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In vitro cell experiments confirmed that endothelial cells can be conveniently seeded and attached to the BRSs and subsequently demonstrated good proliferation ability. Owing to the excellent mechanical properties of the monofilaments fabricated by the PPDO, the 3D-printed BRSs with PPDO monofilaments support desirable flexibility, therefore offering a novel BRS application in the vascular disorders field.
