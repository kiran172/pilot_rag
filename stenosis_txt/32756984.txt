Title: Quantification of hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: clinical relevance of hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening volume.

Abstract: AIMS: Our aim was to establish an objective, quantitative methodology for volumetric hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) diagnosis and evaluate its clinical significance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 144 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) between 2011 and 2016. At inclusion, cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA), transthoracic echocardiography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. We quantified HALT on CTA datasets by segmenting the inner volume of TAVI frame at the level of leaflets and extracted voxels between a threshold of -200 to 200 HU based on prior recommendation. The median HALT volume was 72 [inter-quartile range (IQR): 1-154] mm3 (intra- and inter-reader agreement: intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.92 and 0.94, respectively) and 79% (n = 87/111) of the patients had HALT >0 mm3. In multivariate linear regression, oral anti-coagulation (β: -0.32; 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.01; P = 0.004) and history of myocardial infarction (β: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.01-0.63; P = 0.043) were associated with HALT quantity. Log-transformed HALT volume was associated with elevated (>13 mmHg) aortic mean gradient (AMG, OR: 12.85; 95% CI: 1.96-152.93; P = 0.021) and moderate-to-severe valvular degeneration (AMG ≥ 20 mmHg or ΔAMG ≥ 10 mmHg; OR: 10.56; 95% CI: 1.44-148.71; P = 0.046) but did not predict ischaemic brain lesions on MRI or all-cause death after a median follow-up of 29 (IQR: 11-29) months (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Through systematic analysis of asymptomatic patients with TAVI, an objective and reproducible methodology was feasible for volumetric measurement of HALT. Anti-coagulation might have a protective effect against HALT. Ischaemic brain lesions and all-cause death were not associated with HALT; nevertheless, it might deteriorate prosthesis function due to its association with elevated AMG.
