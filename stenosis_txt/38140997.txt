Title: [Paradoxical low flow-low gradient aortic stenosis: lights and shadows].

Abstract: Paradoxical low flow-low gradient aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is an increasing phenotype in the general population, particularly after the seventh decade of life. It is an AVS in which, despite the preserved ejection fraction, the mean transvalvular gradient is not suggestive of severe AVS (<40 mmHg). The pathophysiology is often intertwined with conditions resulting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, such as arterial hypertension and cardiac amyloidosis. Its management is rather controversial about the diagnosis and therapeutic management. The aims of this focus are: to clarify the role and reliability of the main available diagnostic methods, the efficacy of surgical and percutaneous treatments, and to develop a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm for managing this condition in clinical practice. This algorithm will involve a multi-parametric evaluation, integrating standard echocardiographic assessment with three-dimensional planimetric valve area calculation, determination of the energy loss index), and calcium score calculation by computed tomography scan. This approach aims to ascertain the severity of the stenosis and determine the appropriate therapeutic management.
