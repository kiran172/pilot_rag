Title: Fabrication, characterization and numerical validation of a novel thin-wall hydrogel vessel model for cardiovascular research based on a patient-specific stenotic carotid artery bifurcation.

Abstract: In vitro vascular models, primarily made of silicone, have been utilized for decades for studying hemodynamics and supporting the development of implants for catheter-based treatments of diseases such as stenoses and aneurysms. Hydrogels have emerged as prominent materials in tissue-engineering applications, offering distinct advantages over silicone models for fabricating vascular models owing to their viscoelasticity, low friction, and tunable mechanical properties. Our study evaluated the feasibility of fabricating thin-wall, anatomical vessel models made of polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (PVA-H) based on a patient-specific carotid artery bifurcation using a combination of 3D printing and molding technologies. The model's geometry, elastic modulus, volumetric compliance, and diameter distensibility were characterized experimentally and numerically simulated. Moreover, a comparison with silicone models with the same anatomy was performed. A PVA-H vessel model was integrated into a mock circulatory loop for a preliminary ultrasound-based assessment of fluid dynamics. The vascular model's geometry was successfully replicated, and the elastic moduli amounted to 0.31 ± 0.007 MPa and 0.29 ± 0.007 MPa for PVA-H and silicone, respectively. Both materials exhibited nearly identical volumetric compliance (0.346 and 0.342% mmHg-1), which was higher compared to numerical simulation (0.248 and 0.290% mmHg-1). The diameter distensibility ranged from 0.09 to 0.20% mmHg-1 in the experiments and between 0.10 and 0.18% mmHg-1 in the numerical model at different positions along the vessel model, highlighting the influence of vessel geometry on local deformation. In conclusion, our study presents a method and provides insights into the manufacturing and mechanical characterization of hydrogel-based thin-wall vessel models, potentially allowing for a combination of fluid dynamics and tissue engineering studies in future cardio- and neurovascular research.
