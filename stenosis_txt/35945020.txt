Title: Moyamoya Syndrome Presenting with Ischemic Stroke Caused by Rapid Worsening of Vessel Stenosis Associated with Triple-seropositive Antiphospholipid Syndrome.

Abstract: Several case reports of patients with both moyamoya syndrome (MMS) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) have been published. However, the relationship between MMS and APS has not been clarified. We herein report a patient with MMS who had an ischemic stroke with rapid worsening of stenosis of the middle cerebral artery associated with APS. The patient was triple-positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. Patients with MMS complicated by APS should be closely followed up with vascular imaging.
