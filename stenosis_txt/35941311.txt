Title: Outcome of primary ERCP versus primary PTC for biliary drainage in malignant hilar biliary strictures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant hilar biliary strictures can suffer from obstructive jaundice. Controversy remains on the optimal approach to obtain preoperative or palliative biliary drainage in these patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare the two modalities most commonly used in this scenario: endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC).
METHODS: MEDLINE via PubMed was searched for relevant articles published from 2005 to April 2019. Following outcome measures were used to compare ERCP and PTC: therapeutic success rate, cholangitis, pancreatitis, bleeding,Â tube dislocation, reintervention rate, mortality such as 30d mortality and in-hospital death, median survival time, drainage patency, duration until decompression and hospital stay. Risk of bias assessment for the retrospective studies was conducted by NOS. RoB 2 was used for RCT. A meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager 5.3. The certainty of evidence was appraised using GRADE.
RESULTS: Eleven articles of which one RCT and ten retrospective cohort studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for data-analysis (1417 patients; 784 ERCP, 633 PTC). The combined odds ratio (OR) for therapeutic succes was 3.5 times higher in the PTC group (95% CI 2.05-5.97; high certainty). In terms of cholangitis, ERCP carried a 1.7-fold risk as compared to PTC (95% CI 0.92-3.08; moderate certainty). Patients who underwent ERCP were 11.50 times more likely to undergo a reintervention (95% CI 3.51-37.70; moderate certainty). ERCP was comparable to PTC in terms of pancreatitis (low certainty), bleeding (high certainty) and tube dislocation rate (moderate certainty). Mortality tended to be numerically higher in the PTC group but low patient numbers, selection bias and study heterogeneity did not allow uniform comparative analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with malignant hilar biliary strictures, PTC is associated with a better therapeutic success rate, less cholangitis and lower reintervention rate as compared to ERCP.
