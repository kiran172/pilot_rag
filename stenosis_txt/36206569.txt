Title: A Case of Pulmonary Tumor Thrombotic Microangiopathy: A Rare and Fatal Phenomenon.

Abstract: Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is a pulmonary hypertensive arteriopathy thought to be caused by activation of the coagulation cascade at the surface of circulating tumor microemboli along with intimal proliferation in small pulmonary arteries in patients with metastatic carcinomas. The subsequent stenosis of the pulmonary vasculature leads to pulmonary hypertension (PH) and, cor pulmonale with eventual respiratory compromise leading to respiratory failure. PTTM is always a nearly fatal disease with most cases diagnosed postmortem. Most cases reported on this condition are from Japan where the incidence of gastric malignancy is relatively higher than other parts of the world. We report a case of a Caucasian man with a classic presentation of PTTM to help make physicians aware of this rare, rapidly progressive and usually fatal phenomenon.
