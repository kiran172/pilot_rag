Title: Evaluation of right ventricular mechanics using exercise echocardiography in asymptomatic patients with severe mitral stenosis.

Abstract: We aimed to evaluate the effect of exercise echocardiography (EE) on Right ventricular (RV) deformation parameters in asymptomatic patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) (mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2, stage C) and to determine the relation between symptoms and severity of MS. 38 rheumatic MS patients in stage C underwent EE. 20 Patients were defined; as an exercise intolerance group who couldn't reach a maximum heart rate according to their age during exercise due to developing dyspnea The remaining 18 patients who reached a maximum heart rate without dyspnea were defined; as an exercise tolerance group. RV echocardiographic parameters at baseline and peak exercise were compared between the groups. While RV global strain (RV GLS) (21.02 ± 3.33 vs. 21.92 ± 3.03) and RV free wall longitudinal strain (RV FWLS) (23.41 ± 5.66 vs. 25.08 ± 5.00) at baseline were similar in both groups (P = 0.390 P = 0.343), RV GLS (23.38 ± 4.30 vs. 26.05 ± 3.24) and RV FWLS (24.24 ± 5.78 vs. 28.05 ± 4.62) at peak exercise were reduced in exercise intolerance group (P = 0.040 P = 0.033). The best correlations were found between exercise capacity and RV FWLS at baseline and peak exercise in all MS patients (respectively; r = 0.627 P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.697 P &lt; 0.001). RV mechanics has approved the reliability of EE in patients with asymptomatic patients with severe MS. During exercise RV contractile reserve could diminish in MS patients with stage C who develop dyspnea. Moreover, since our study has a close relationship between exercise capacity and RV mechanics, using RV mechanics during exercise echocardiography may be useful for risk stratification in MS patients with severe MS.
