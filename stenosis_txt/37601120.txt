Title: Congenital esophageal stenosis caused by tracheobronchial remnants: A case report.

Abstract: Congenital esophageal stenosis caused by tracheobronchial remnants is a rare anomaly in infants and children that results in dysphagia and recurrent pneumonia. An accurate diagnosis is needed because this anomaly does not respond well to instrumental dilatation, such as bougienage and balloon dilatation, and requires surgical resection. Herein, I report a case of congenital esophageal stenosis caused by tracheobronchial remnants with characteristic imaging findings.
