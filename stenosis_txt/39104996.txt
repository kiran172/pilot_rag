Title: Left Main Snorkel Stent Thrombosis in Association With Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a rare form of large vessel arteritis that predominantly affects the aorta and its major branches. This inflammation leads to thickening, fibrosis, and stenosis of the arterial walls, which may lead to thrombus formation. The resulting symptoms are typically due to ischemia of the end organs. Coronary artery involvement is uncommon and primarily affects the ostia of the arteries. Ostial involvement of the coronary arteries can have a dramatic course, including fatal outcomes. We present the case of a 16-year-old female with TA involving the ostium of the left main coronary artery, causing severe stenosis. A successful percutaneous coronary intervention was performed on the left main artery with snorkel stent placement, which was complicated by cardiac arrest seven months later due to complete thrombosis of the proximal opening of the protruding stent.
