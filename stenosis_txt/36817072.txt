Title: Laryngeal fracture treated with ultrasound-aided fixation using an absorbable plate system.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Laryngeal trauma is not a frequently encountered disease in routine clinical practice. Blunt trauma with thyroid fractures may leave permanent voice impairment and respiratory impairment due to scar stenosis, requiring appropriate treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 38-year-old man was referred to our hospital for evaluation of inability to speak loudly and difficulty with high-pitched voice that had begun after a falling tree struck him on the anterior neck. He underwent successful fixation of fractures in their laryngeal cartilage after trauma by using the ultrasound-aided fixation system using an absorbable plate.
CONCLUSION: Laryngeal fracture is a rare entity in patients with blunt cervical trauma. Ultrasound-aided fixation using an absorbable implant system is effective for optimal reduction and fixation of fractured laryngeal cartilage, and may become an alternative method in patients with adhered and unossified cartilage.
