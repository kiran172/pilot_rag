Title: Causal associations of COVID-19 on neurosurgical diseases risk: a Mendelian randomization study.

Abstract: Many researchers have explored the potential association between one neurosurgical disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but few systematically analyzed the association and causality between COVID-19 and various neurosurgical diseases. A Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to evaluate the causal association between COVID-19 (including critically ill COVID-19, hospitalized COVID-19, and respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection) and 30 neurosurgical diseases within European populations. The consequences of inverse variance weighted models suggest that genetic susceptibility of critically ill COVID-19 may increase the risk of cerebral infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.02; p-value = 0.006), genetic susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of stroke (OR = 1.02; p-value = 0.047), and conversely, genetic susceptibility of hospitalized COVID-19 may reduce the risk of pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngioma (OR = 0.90; p-value = 0.032). In addition, evidences revealed potential associations between genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 and spinal stenosis (OR = 1.03; p-value = 0.028), diffuse brain injury (OR = 1.21; p-value = 0.040) and focal brain injury (OR = 1.12; p-value = 0.040). By testing for heterogeneity and pleiotropy, the above causal conclusions are robust. In summary, our analysis shows that COVID-19 has an independent and powerful causal influence on multiple neurosurgical disorders.
