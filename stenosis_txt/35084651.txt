Title: Evaluation of Galdakao-modified Valdivia position in endoscopic management of malignant ureteric obstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Malignant ureteric obstruction (MUO) due to pelvic malignancies is challenging for endourological management and carries high failure rates for retrograde cystoscopic ureteric stenting.
METHODS: We adopted Galdakao-modified Valdivia (GMV) position in the management of MUO in an operating room equipped with a C-arm fluoroscopy unit and an ultrasound device. We prospectively studied the added value of this approach in 50 cases who failed retrograde ureteric stenting.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven (74%) cases were done under a high level of spinal anesthesia. Mean operative time was 62 min. Antegrade ureteric stenting succeeded in 45/50 (90%) patients who failed retrograde ureteric stenting. GMV position facilitated simultaneous retrograde and antegrade management of MUO. Eight patients (16%) underwent auxiliary cystoscopic procedures to reduce the mass over the ureteric orifice (UO) guided by antegrade methylene blue or over a probing antegrade guidewire. Nephrostomy tube was inserted in the same setting in 16/50 (32%) cases. Antegrade flow of contrast to the bladder (P < 0.001) and ureteric kinks rather than tight stenosis or infiltration of UO (P = 0.014) were significantly associated with the success of antegrade ureteric stenting. No major complications were encountered.
CONCLUSION: GMV position is an ideal choice for management of MUO as it allows simultaneous access to the lower and the upper urinary systems to accomplish ureteric stenting either in a retrograde or an antegrade fashion as well as the ability to insert a nephrostomy tube in the same setting, thus shortening the inpatient care and this should be the standard of care in cases with MUO.
