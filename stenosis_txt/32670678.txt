Title: Concomitant Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction and Hyperperfusion Syndromes Following Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) are two syndromes characterized by disordered vascular autoregulatory mechanisms of brain. These may be seen after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). We present a patient who developed both syndromes after CEA which is a rare occurrence.
