Title: Functional Assessment of Lumbar Nerve Roots Using Coronal-plane Single-shot Turbo Spin-echo Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

Abstract: We investigated the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequence (TSE-DTI) in detecting the responsible nerve root by multipoint measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) values. Five patients with bilateral lumbar spinal stenosis showing unilateral neurological symptoms were examined using TSE-DTI. In the spinal canal, FA values in the symptomatic side were lower than those in the asymptomatic side. TSE-DTI using multipoint measurements of FA values can differentiate the responsible lumbar nerve root.
