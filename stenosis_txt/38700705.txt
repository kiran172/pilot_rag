Title: Prospects of CSF shunt independence among chronically shunted patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CSF shunt placement for hydrocephalus and other etiologies has arguably been the most life-saving intervention in pediatric neurosurgery in the past 6 decades. Yet, chronic shunting remains a source of morbidity for patients of all ages. Neuroendoscopic surgery has made shunt independence possible for newly diagnosed hydrocephalic patients. In this study, we examine the prospects of shunt independence with or without endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in chronically shunted patients.
METHODS: After IRB approval, a retrospective analysis was completed on patients whose shunt was ligated or removed to achieve shunt independence, with or without ETV. Clinical and imaging data were collected.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients with CSF shunts had their shunt either ligated or removed, 57 of whom had a concomitant ETV. Original reasons for shunting included: congenital hydrocephalus 20 (23%), post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) of prematurity 14 (16%), aqueductal stenosis 10 (11%), intracranial cyst 8 (9%), tumor 8 (9%), infantile subdural hematomas 8 (9%), myelomeningocele 7 (8%), post-traumatic hydrocephalus 7 (8%) and post-infectious hydrocephalus 6 (7%). The decision to perform a simultaneous ETV was made based on etiology. Forty-nine (56%) patients became shunt independent. The success rate was 46% in the ETV group and 73% in the no ETV group. Using multivariate analysis and Cox Proportional Hazards models, age > 4 months at shunt placement (p = 0.032), no shunt revisions (p = 0.01), select etiologies (p = 0.043), and ETVSS > 70 (in the ETV group) (p = 0.017), were protective factors for shunt independence.
CONCLUSION: Considering the long-term complications of shunting, achieving shunt independence may provide hope for improved quality of life. While this study is underpowered, it provides pilot data identifying factors that predict shunt independence in chronically shunted patients, namely age, absence of prior shunt revision, etiology, and in the ETV group, the ETVSS.
