Title: Esophageal Stricture: An Uncommon Complication of Cervical Inlet Patch.

Abstract: Esophageal heterotopic gastric mucosal patches (HGMP), also known as cervical inlet patches (CIP), is a rare but underdiagnosed condition characterized by the presence of salmon-colored, velvety mucosa located in the proximal esophagus, distal to the upper esophageal sphincter. The incidence of CIP ranges from 3% to 10% in adults, and its endoscopic appearance is characterized by a flat or slightly raised salmon-colored patch. In this case, we report a 78-year-old man who presented with symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux and dysphagia. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a flat area of salmon-colored patch between 17 and 20 cm from the incisors, suggestive of a CIP complicated by stricture. The biopsy results showed an oxyntic-type mucosa lined with columnar cells consistent with an inlet patch. Esophageal dilation was done with a savory dilator with no resistance at 18 mm. The patient was placed on maintenance acid suppression therapy with proton-pump inhibitors and reported complete resolution of symptoms at the 1-month follow-up.
