Title: Aortic Valve Replacement in Adult Patients with Decellularized Homografts: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: decellularized aortic homografts (DAH) represent a promising alternative for aortic valve replacement in young adults due to their low immunogenicity and thrombogenicity. Herein, we report our midterm, single-center experience in adult patients with non-frozen DAH from corlife.
METHODS: safety, durability, and hemodynamic performance were evaluated according to current guidelines in all consecutive patients who had received a DAH at our center since 03/2016.
RESULTS: seventy-three (mean age 47 ± 11 years, 68.4% (n = 50) male) patients were enrolled. The mean diameter of the implanted DAH was 24 ± 2 mm. Mean follow-up was 36 ± 27 months, with a maximum follow-up of 85 months and cumulative follow-up of 215 years. No cases of stenosis were observed, in four (5.5%) cases moderate aortic regurgitation occurred, but no reintervention was required. No cases of early mortality, non-structural dysfunction, reoperation, valve endocarditis, or thrombosis were observed. Freedom from bleeding and thromboembolic events was 100%; freedom from re-intervention was 100%; survival was 98.6% (n = 72).
CONCLUSIONS: early and mid-term results showed low mortality and 100% freedom from reoperation, thromboembolic events, and bleeding at our center. However, in order for this novel approach to be established as a valid alternative to aortic valve replacement in young patients, long-term data are required.
