Title: Simultaneous balloon aortic valvotomy and patent ductus arteriosus device closure in preterm newborn.

Abstract: Multiple congenital heart disease in the small preterm newborn such as severe narrowing of aortic valve and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a therapeutic challenge. We report successful transcatheter antegrade balloon dilatation of the aortic valve and device closure of the PDA in a 1700-gram preterm newborn. Meticulous planning and team work aids in such transcatheter intervention. &lt;Learning objective: Preterm newborn babies rarely have multiple major structural cardiac lesions complicating the care. Transcatheter intervention for multiple congenital cardiac lesions such as severe valvular aortic stenosis and large patent ductus arteriosus in a small preterm baby is challenging but feasible. Precise anatomical diagnosis and meticulous planning is essential for successful intervention with minimum complications.&gt;.
