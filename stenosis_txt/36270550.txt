Title: Clopidogrel Resistance and Ticagrelor Replacement in Dual Antiplatelet Therapy for Carotid Artery Stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUNDS: Resistance to the pharmacological effect of clopidogrel in patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy for carotid stenting may increase the risk of periprocedural neurological events. The purpose of the study was to describe the phenomenon of clopidogrel resistance in a series of patients undergoing carotid stenting.
METHODS: Data of patients who consecutively underwent carotid stenting from November 2016 to December 2020 for a significant stenosis and who underwent a dual antiplatelet therapy using acetyl-salicylic acid and clopidogrel were prospectively collected. Patients who were already taking a different thienopyridine were excluded. The effectiveness of antiplatelet drugs was assessed by the impedance aggregometry test. Primary endpoint was to evaluate the incidence of clopidogrel resistance and the effectiveness of ticagrelor as alternative therapy. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Two-hundred patients (80 females, 40%) underwent stenting for carotid stenosis (94% asymptomatic). The phenomenon of clopidogrel resistance was observed in 38 patients (19%), in whom clopidogrel was replaced by ticagrelor (90 mg/bis in die) with 100% effectiveness at aggregometry test. Platelet counts was associated to clopidogrel resistance (P = 0.001). There was no stent thrombosis at 30 days, neither major hemorrhagic events; a total of 12/200 major adverse cardiovascular events occurred (6%), including 1 in the group of patients who took ticagrelor and 11 in group of patients under clopidogrel (2.6% versus 6.7%, P = 0.55).
CONCLUSIONS: Clopidogrel was ineffective in 19% of patients undergoing carotid stenting. Platelet count seemed to affect this phenomenon. In these patients, clopidogrel was effectively replaced by ticagrelor.
