Title: A transfacet approach to the lumbar nerve root canal: technical note.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intraforaminal and extraforaminal nerve root compressions caused by disk herniation or stenosis are relatively common causes of lumbar radiculopathy. Currently, the two available surgical treatment methods are decompression from the spinal canal or lateral decompression via the Wiltse approach.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel transosseous approach to the lumbar nerve root canal.
METHODS: Transfacet foraminotomy was performed in 11 patients with intraforaminal or extraforaminal disk herniation. The outcome was measured using the Patient Satisfaction Index (PSI), need for reoperation, radiographic criteria, and finite element analysis.
RESULTS: We noted that at the time of dismissal, PSI scores of 1 and 3 were reported by 10 and one patients, respectively. At the last follow-up, 10 patients reported a PSI score of 1 or 2. Two patients required reoperation because of recurrent disk herniation. Two patients underwent computed tomography (CT) postoperatively, which showed the transfacet approach. Intriguingly, a second postoperative CT after one month showed that the hole through the facet joint had shrunk significantly.
CONCLUSION: A posterior-anterior transfacet approach for intraforaminal or extraforaminal disk herniations using an ellipsoid facetectomy is safe and allows for fast and comfortable decompression of the nerve root without compromising the long-term strength of the facet joint.
