Title: A case of cardiac strangulation following epicardial pacemaker implantation.

Abstract: An 8-year-old boy had undergone permanent epicardial pacemaker implantation with a Y-shaped bipolar ventricular lead on day 6 after birth for treatment of congenital complete atrioventricular block. He was found to have pulmonary stenosis and mitral stenosis by follow-up echocardiography. Further studies including computed tomography and cardiac catheterization revealed that the pacemaker lead had completely encircled the cardiac silhouette and was in a state of "cardiac strangulation". We removed the previous pacing leads and generator and implanted a new epicardial dual-chamber pacing system in the right atrium and right ventricle. Additionally, an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sheet was placed between the new leads and the heart to prevent recurrence of cardiac strangulation.
