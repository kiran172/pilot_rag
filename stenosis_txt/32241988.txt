Title: [New ways of solving the problem of restenosis in the surgical treatment of congenital choanal atresia in children].

Abstract: UNLABELLED: This article presents the literature data and our own findings on the surgical treatment and options for solving the problem of restenosis in congenital atresia of the choanae (CAC) in children.
PURPOSE: In order to solve the issues of prevention of the fibrosis in the postoperative period in patients with CAC, the prospects of using the carboxymethyl cellulose gel-sodium salt (CGSS) were assessed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This medicine was used in patients, who were: primarily operated, after a period of wearing a protector (n=17); primarily operated without using a protector, at the final stage of the operation and in the early postoperative period (n=15); reoperated because of the restenosis, also at the final stage of the operation and in the early postoperative period (n=12).
RESULTS: We present our results of application of the carboxymethyl cellulose gel-sodium salt for the prevention of scar adhesions in this condition: endoscopy of the nasal cavity and choanal region in all 44 patients with follow-up observation (from 1 year to 5 years) showed no signs of restenosis.
CONCLUSION: The use of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt in the intra- and postoperative period may be one of the ways of solving the problem of restenosis after surgery in children with CAC along with the use of endoscopic techniques for performing choanotomy.
