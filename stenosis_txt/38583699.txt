Title: Incidence, Predictors, and Outcomes of Nonhome Discharge Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Multicenter Australian Experience-The NHD TAVI Study.

Abstract: Patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) commonly experience nonhome discharge (NHD), a phenomenon associated with increased health care expenditure and possibly poorer outcomes. Despite its clinical relevance in TAVI, the incidence and predictors of NHD and its impact on the quality of life remain poorly characterized. Also unknown is the proportion of patients who undergo TAVI that require long-term residential care after initial NHD. Therefore, we aimed to address these questions using a large, multicenter Australian cohort. A total of 2,229 patients who underwent TAVI from 2010 to 2023 included in the Alfred-Cabrini-Epworth TAVI Registry were analyzed. The median age was 82 (interquartile range 78 to 86) years and 41% were women. A total of 257 patients (12%) were not discharged home after TAVI, with the incidence falling over time (R2 = 0.636, p &lt;0.001). A multivariable logistic regression model for NHD prediction was developed with excellent calibration and discrimination (C-statistic = 0.835). The independent predictors of NHD were postprocedural stroke (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 11.05), procedure at a private hospital (aOR 3.01), living alone (aOR 2.35), vascular access site complications (aOR 2.09), frailty (aOR 1.89), age &gt;80 years (aOR 1.82), hypoalbuminemia (aOR 1.76), New York Heart Association III to IV (aOR 1.74), and hospital length of stay (aOR 1.13) (all p &lt;0.05). NHD was not associated with mortality at 30 days and &lt;1% of all patients required longer-term residential care. In conclusion, although common after TAVI, NHD does not predict short-term mortality, most patients successfully return home within 30 days, and when used appropriately, NHD may serve as a brief and effective method of optimizing functional status without compromising long-term independence.
