Title: First experiences with a new balloon-expandable Myval transcatheter aortic valve: a preliminary study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the present article, we present our first experiences with a new type of balloon-expandable Myval valve (Meril Life Sciences, Gujarat, India).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) from June 2020 to November 2020 were included in the study.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 83 (75-87) years; 17 (68%) were female, and 20 (80%) had hypertension. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score of the group was 5.4% ± 3.5%. TAVI was performed via the transfemoral route on all patients. In 19 (76%) cases, we started the procedure without predilation. In two (10.5%) cases performed without predilation, the prosthesis did not pass the native valve. We had to implant the valve from the descending aorta in one (4%) patient. We used Prostar XL (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for six (24%) patients and ProGlide (Abbott Vascular) for 19 (76%) patients for vascular closure. Two (8%) in-hospital deaths occurred in our study but there were no deaths in the 30-day and 90-day follow-up. Vascular complications were observed in one (4%) patient. None of the patients in our study had severe paravalvular leak (PVL), while two (8%) patients had moderate PVL. A permanent pacemaker (PPM) was required in two (8%) patients for the indication of complete atrioventricular block. The mean hospital stay for the whole group was 4 (3-7) days.
CONCLUSION: Based on our experiences, the new balloon-expandable valve Myval is easy to use, efficient, and has only a few negligible drawbacks such as the need for predilation of the sheath. While shaft flexibility may have advantages in some situations including in very tortuous arteries, it may cause some difficulties in alignment of the valves.
