Title: Staged Versus Concomitant TAVI and PCI for the Treatment of Coexisting Aortic Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valvular pathologies. Severe coronary artery disease (CAD) often coexists with AS. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been established as alternatives to open surgical interventions. The data on the timing for the treatment of the 2 conditions are scarce and depend on multiple factors. This review compares the clinical outcomes of the concomitant versus staged PCI and TAVI for the treatment of AS and CAD. A systematic, electronic search was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to identify relevant articles that compared outcomes of the staged versus concomitant approaches for the TAVI and PCI. Seven studies were included involving 3745 patients. We found no statistically significant difference in primary outcomes such as 30-day mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-1.57] and secondary outcomes including length of hospital stay (mean difference = -4.74, 95% CI: -10.96 to 1.48), new-onset renal failure (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.22-3.13), cerebrovascular accidents (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 0.64-2.57), and intraoperative blood loss (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.32-2.12). New pacemaker insertion was statistically significant in favor of the concomitant approach (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63-0.96). This analysis suggests that while the 2 approaches are largely comparable in terms of most outcomes, patients at risk of requiring a pacemaker postprocedure may benefit from a concomitant approach. In conclusion, concomitant TAVI + PCI approach is nonsuperior to the staged approach for the treatment of CAD and AS. This review calls for robust trials in the field to further strengthen the evidence.
