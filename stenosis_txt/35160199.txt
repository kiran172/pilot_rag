Title: Non-Invasive Myocardial Work in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Changes in cardiac mechanics after correction of severe Aortic Stenosis (AS) are under-investigated. Myocardial Work (MW) is emerging as a useful non-invasive correlate of invasively measured myocardial performance and oxygen consumption. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of MW in the clinical management of patients with AS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Consecutive patients referred for TAVI were included in this observational study. Echocardiograms were performed before and after TAVI to measure Global Work Index (GWI), Global Constructive Work (GCW), Global Wasted Work (GWW), and Global Work Efficiency (GWE). Mean transvalvular gradient was significantly improved (p &lt; 0.05), without significant changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, nor in global longitudinal strain (GLS). GWI (p &lt; 0.001) and GCW (p &lt; 0.001), but not GWW (p = 0.241) nor GWE (p = 0.854) were significantly reduced after TAVI. Patients with a low flow low gradient (LF-LG) AS had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p &lt; 0.001), worse global longitudinal strain (GLS) (p &lt; 0.001), and lower baseline GWI (p &lt; 0.001), GCW (p &lt; 0.001) and GWE (p = 0.003). The improvement in GWI and GCW observed after TAVI in the general study population were abolished among LF-LG patients. In conclusion, non-invasive MW might be useful to further classify patients with AS and to predict non responders.
