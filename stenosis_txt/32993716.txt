Title: Assessment of carotid artery stenosis and lower limb peripheral ischemia before coronary artery bypass grafting operations: a non-randomized clinical trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease affecting the coronary, carotid, and lower limb arteries. Cerebrovascular accidents and lower limb ischemia are devastating postoperative complications. We aimed to evaluate the role of non-selective routine arterial duplex scanning in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
METHODS: This non-randomized clinical trial included 360 patients scheduled for elective isolated CABG who were divided into two groups: low-risk (n = 180) and high-risk (n = 180). Both groups underwent preoperative carotid and lower limb ultrasound screening for associated arteriopathy.
RESULTS: 16 (8.9%) patients and 22 (12.2%) patients showed ≥70% carotid artery stenosis while 11 patients (6.1%) and 20 patients (11.1%) showed ≥50% lower limb arterial stenosis in the low-risk group and the high-risk group, respectively; though the difference was not statistically significant in both the cases (p > 0.1).
CONCLUSION: Routine preoperative peripheral arterial screening by sonography is a feasible and effective strategy to avoid unnecessary post CABG complications.
