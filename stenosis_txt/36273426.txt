Title: Balloon angioplasty and stent implantation within 30 days postcongenital heart surgery (CHS) in children.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess balloon angioplasty (BAP) and stent implantation (SI) procedures early after congenital heart surgery (CHS) in children.
BACKGROUND: These interventions are considered potential high-risk procedures and often avoided or postponed.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, single centre study of all BAP and SI procedures within 30 days after CHS (01/2001 until 01/2021).
RESULTS: A total of 127 (96 SI, 31 BAP) procedures were performed in 104 patients at median 6.5 days (interquartile range: 1-15) after CHS. Balloon-to-stenosis ratio and balloon-to-reference vessel ratio were significantly smaller compared to stent-to-stenosis ratio and stent-to-reference vessel ratio (p < .001 and p = .005). There was a greater rise in absolute vessel diameter, greater rise in vessel diameter in relation to the stenosis and vessel diameter in relation to the reference vessel with SI (p < .001, p = .01, and p < .001). Up to 94% SIs fulfilled both success criteria (increase of vessel diameter ≥50% of minimal vessel diameter or achievement ≥75% of the reference vessel diameter). Major adverse events were more frequent in the BAP group (p = .05). Intraprocedural complications were 5/31 (16%) in the BAP group and 13/96 (13%) in the SI group (p = .77).
CONCLUSION: BAP and SI procedures within 30 days post-CHS can be performed safely, with a greater stent-to-stenosis ratio and a greater rise in vessel diameter with stent implantation.
