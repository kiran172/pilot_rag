Title: Prognostic significance of carotid plaque presence in peritoneal dialysis patients and its association with the apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio.

Abstract: AIM: Atherosclerosis has been reported as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population. As a phenotype of atherosclerosis, carotid plaque and its influence factors are rarely discussed among dialysis patients. The study aimed to investigate the prognosis-predictive significance of carotid plaques in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and explore risks factors for carotid plaque presence.
METHODS: It was an observational, prospective study. Patients that had undergone stable PD for at least 3 months were recruited and divided into two subgroups: group with carotid plaques and group without carotid plaques. Cox regression model was used to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (CVEs), and cardiovascular mortality. Pathogenic factors correlated to the plaque-occurrence were explored by logistic regression and verified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 233 PD patients were recruited. The cohort was followed for up to 86â€‰months. The carotid plaque presence turned out to be an independent risk factor both of CVEs [hazard ratio (HR): 2.659; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.231-5.741; P = .013] and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.716; 95% CI: 1.168-11.823; P = .026). The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) ratio was significantly associated with the presence of carotid plaques. ROC analysis indicated that the area under the curve of the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was higher than that of the traditional lipid metabolism index for detecting plaque presence.
CONCLUSION: Carotid plaque presence can predict CVEs and cardiovascular mortality in PD patients. The ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is significantly correlated to the carotid plaques and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio had a greater sensitivity than traditional lipid indices for predicting plaque presence.
