Title: Cardiac Structural Remodeling and Hemodynamic Patterns Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Background Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly utilized for most patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. TAVR is linked to enhanced long-term cardiac hemodynamics, reversal of left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy, and improved aortic valve gradients. We present a retrospective observational study assessing cardiac remodeling and valvular flow patterns post-TAVR. Methods Retrospective echocardiographic data were collected, evaluating cardiac function and valvular flow patterns before and after TAVR at a single institution. Data was compiled and statistically analyzed using a paired t-test evaluating variations at approximately 30 days and one-year post-TAVR. Results On echocardiogram 30 days and one-year post-TAVR, there was a reduction in LV mass index from 132 g/m² to 110 g/m² (95%CI: 98-122; p=0.01) and 118 g/m² (95%CI: 102-133; p=0.03), and a reduction in relative wall thickness from 0.54 to 0.49 (95%CI: 0.46-0.52; p=0.05) and 0.44 (95%CI: 0.38-0.49; p=0.03), respectively. Doppler velocity indices (DVI) increased from 0.24 to 0.61 (95%CI: 0.49-0.73; p<0.001) and 0.57 (95%CI: 0.48-0.65; p<0.001). Expected improvement in aortic valve velocities and gradients were observed post-TAVR. Conclusions Following TAVR, LV remodeling can be observed as early as 30 days. This is demonstrated by a reduction in LV mass index and relative wall thickness in conjugation with an anticipated improvement in valvular flow patterns and flow across the aortic valve.
