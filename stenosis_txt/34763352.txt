Title: Safety and efficacy of arteriovenous fistula angioplasties performed by nephrologists: report from a Brazilian interventional nephrology center.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) are the first choice vascular access for hemodialysis. However, they present a high incidence of venous stenosis leading to thrombosis. Although training in interventional nephrology may improve accessibility for treatment of venous stenosis, there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of this approach performed by trained nephrologists in low-income and developing countries.
METHODS: This study presents the retrospective results of AVF angioplasties performed by trained nephrologists in a Brazilian outpatient interventional nephrology center. The primary outcome was technical success rate (completion of the procedure with angioplasty of all stenoses) and secondary outcomes were complication rates and overall AVF patency.
FINDINGS: Two hundred fifty-six angioplasties were performed in 160 AVF. The technical success rate was 88.77% and the main cause of technical failure was venous occlusion (10%). The incidence of complications was 13.67%, with only one patient needing hospitalization and four accesses lost due to the presence of hematomas and/or thrombosis. Grade 1 hematomas were the most frequent complication (8.2%). The overall patency found was 88.2 and 80.9% at 180 and 360 days after the procedure, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that AVF angioplasty performed by trained nephrologists has acceptable success rates and patency, with a low incidence of major complications as well as a low need for hospitalization.
