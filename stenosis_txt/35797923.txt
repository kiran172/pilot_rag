Title: Clinical effectiveness of treating laryngotracheal stenosis with free hyoid bone reconstruction of the cricoid cartilage: A case series.

Abstract: We reported the free hyoid bone reconstruction of the cricoid cartilage to treat LTS in children. This retrospective case series study included LTS children who underwent hyoid bone separation and T tube implantation. Thirty-four children were included. Twenty-five children were with good outcomes after free hyoid bone reconstruction of the cricoid cartilage. Specifically, the cure rate was 92.8% for the children with mixed stenosis, followed by 63.6% in children with glottis stenosis and 55.6% in children with subglottic stenosis. Free hyoid bone reconstruction of the cricoid cartilage for the management of LTS is feasible, with good outcomes and few complications.
