Title: Correlation analysis of coronary artery tortuosity and calcification score.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery tortuosity (CAT) is regarded as a variation of vascular anatomy, and its relationship with coronary artery calcification (CAC) score is still not well clarified. Studying the correlation between coronary artery calcification scores and CAT to determine specific prevention and intervention populations seems to have more meaningful.
METHODS: The study is a cross-sectional retrospective study, including 1280 patients. CAT is defined as the presence of at least three consecutive curvatures of more than 45°measured during systole or diastole of a major epicardial coronary artery. Multivariable regression analysis was used to adjust the clinical parameters directly affecting CAT.
RESULTS: Of these individuals, 445 (35%) were evaluated having CAT, of which females are higher than males (59.1% vs. 40.9%). Moderate CAC score (101-400) (odds ratio (OR) 1.49, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.05-2.10, P = 0.025) revealed significantly associated with CAT on univariable analysis. However, multivariable analysis after adjusting for confounding factors only indicated that CAT was positively correlated with female (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.30-2.17, P < 0.001), hypertension (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04-1.75, P = 0.024), and age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03, P = 0.001), while was negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) 24-27.9(OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58-1.00, P = 0.044), and BMI > 28 (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.68, P < 0.001). Further analysis stratified by gender showed that compared with non-CAT, CAT was significantly linked with moderate CAC score (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.00-3.20, P = 0.048), hypertension (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.07-2.22, P = 0.021), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.07-3.24, P = 0.028), while was negatively related to BMI > 28 (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.84, P = 0.008) in female patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CAT is more likely to be found in females, connected with hypertension, age, and BMI. No significant correlation is found between the presence of tortuosity and calcium score or diameter stenosis on multivariable analysis. Whereas the CAT is associated with moderate CAC score in correlation analysis when women are selected as the main group.
