Title: An Unusual Cause of Recurrent Syncope - A Large Free-Floating Left Atrial Thrombus.

Abstract: Rheumatic heart disease is the most common valvular heart disease in developing countries. Recurrent syncope due to a large, free-floating left atrial thrombus is a rare presentation of rheumatic mitral stenosis. We report this uncommon finding on echocardiogram in an elderly woman presenting to the emergency department with giddiness for the past few months.
