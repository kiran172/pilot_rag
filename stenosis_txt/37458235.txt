Title: The Sutureless Biological Bentall Procedure: A New Technique to Create a Modular Valve-Conduit Construct.

Abstract: The Perceval sutureless valve (Corcym, Saluggia, Italy) has been effectively adopted by surgeons for the treatment of degenerative aortic valve stenosis. Its simplified true sutureless implantation technique has proven useful for minimally invasive cases, but the use of Perceval as part of more complex root replacement has not previously been described. We present a novel technical modification to the manufactured biologic Bentall, called the sutureless biological Bentall. This technique allows for a true modular valve-conduit construction that will simplify future reintervention.
