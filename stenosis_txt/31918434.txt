Title: Validity of cerebrovascular ICD-9-CM codes in healthcare administrative databases. The Umbria Data-Value Project.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Validation of administrative databases for cerebrovascular diseases is crucial for epidemiological, outcome, and health services research. The aim of this study was to validate ICD-9 codes for hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke in administrative databases, to use them for a comprehensive assessment of the burden of disease in terms of major outcomes, such as mortality, hospital readmissions, and use of healthcare resources.
METHODS: We considered the hospital discharge abstract database of the Umbria Region (890,000 residents). Source population was represented by patients aged >18 discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke between 2012 and 2014 using ICD-9-CM codes in primary position. We randomly selected and reviewed medical charts of cases and non-cases from hospitals. For case ascertainment we considered symptoms and instrumental tests reported in the medical charts. Diagnostic accuracy measures were computed using 2x2 tables.
RESULTS: We reviewed 767 medical charts for cases and 78 charts for non-cases. Diagnostic accuracy measures were: subarachnoid hemorrhage: sensitivity (SE) 100% (95% CI: 97%-100%), specificity (SP) 96% (90-99), positive predictive value (PPV) 98% (93-100), negative predictive value (NPV) 100% (95-100); intracerebral hemorrhage: SE 100% (97-100), SP 98% (91-100), PPV 98% (94-100), NPV 100% (95-100); other and unspecified intracranial hemorrhage: SE 100% (97-100), SP 96% (90-99), PPV 98% (93-100), NPV 100% (95-100); ischemic stroke due to occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries: SE 99% (94-100), SP 66 (57-75), PPV 70% (61-77), NPV 99% (93-100); occlusion of cerebral arteries: SE 100% (97-100), SP 87% (78-93), PPV 91% (84-95), NPV 100% (95-100); acute, but ill-defined, cerebrovascular disease: SE 100% (97-100), SP 78% (69-86), PPV % 83 (75-89), NPV 100% (95-100).
CONCLUSIONS: Case ascertainment for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke showed good or high levels of accuracy within the regional healthcare databases in Umbria. This database can confidently be employed for epidemiological, outcome, and health services research related to any type of stroke.
