Title: A Personalized Approach for Patients with Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) includes coronary embolism, dissection, spasm and microvascular dysfunction, as well as plaque rupture or erosion (causing &lt; 50% stenosis). In the most recent studies, events that can be classified as MINOCA account for approximately 6-8% of all diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Clinical suspect may suggest the need for additional diagnostic procedures beyond the usual coronary angiography, such as cardiac imaging or provocative tests. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is essential for both validating the diagnosis and ruling out other conditions with a comparable clinical presentation. The prognosis is not as good as previously believed; rather, it is marked by morbidity and mortality rates comparable to those of other types of AMI. Identification of the underlying causes of MINOCA is recommended by current guidelines and consensus documents in order to optimize treatment, enhance prognosis, and encourage prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction. In this narrative review, we have outlined the various causes of MINOCA and their specific therapies in an attempt to identify a personalized approach to its treatment.
