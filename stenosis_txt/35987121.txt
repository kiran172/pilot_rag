Title: Characterization of an iPSC line NCHi006-A from a patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).

Abstract: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe congenital heart defect characterized by underdeveloped structures on the left side of the heart, including hypoplasia of the left ventricle and stenosis or atresia of the aortic and mitral valves. Here, we generated an iPSC line from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a male patient with HLHS through Sendai virus-mediated transfection of 4 Yamanaka factors. This iPSC line exhibited normal morphology, expressed pluripotency markers, had a normal karyotype, and could differentiate into cells of three germ layers. This iPSC line can be used for studying cellular and developmental etiologies of HLHS.
