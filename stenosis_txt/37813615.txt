Title: A Super-elderly Case of Suspected New-onset Vasospastic Angina Complicated by Myocardial Bridge.

Abstract: A 90-year-old man experienced chest oppressive sensation at 12:30 AM for the first time. Electrocardiography showed a newly developed inversion of the terminal T-wave in the V<sub>2-5</sub> leads. A left coronary angiogram showed no significant atherosclerotic stenosis. A myocardial bridge was found in the mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD). Myocardial scintigraphy with 123I beta-methyl 15-para-iodophenyl 3(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid revealed a reduced uptake in the apical and septal areas. Based on these findings, we suspected new-onset vasospastic angina complicated by a myocardial bridge in the territory of the LAD. He remained in good condition without recurrent anginal attacks after nifedipine was started before bedtime.
