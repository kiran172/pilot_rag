Title: "(Pseudo)cavities inside the heart: What may they unfold?".

Abstract: Subvalvular aortic stenosis manifesting as a subaortic membrane predisposes to bacterial endocarditis, which typically affects the aortic valve (AoV) or, less frequently, the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). We present the case of a 60-year-old woman expressing an odd form of a subvalvular aortic membrane in conjunction with a left Valsalva sinus pseudoaneurysm as a result of an endocarditis complication.
