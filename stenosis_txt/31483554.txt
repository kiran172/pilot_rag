Title: Pregnancy and transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a severely stenotic Freestyle full aortic root stentless bioprosthesis.

Abstract: Symptomatic degenerative prosthetic aortic valve stenosis during pregnancy represents a significant risk to both mother and fetus, and until recently, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) during pregnancy was often the only choice for women opting to continue pregnancy. However, symptomatic severe stenosis in a pregnant woman with a degenerated full aortic root Freestyle stentless bioprosthesis (FSB) and reimplanted coronary arteries presents additional complexities that require an alternative surgical approach. In this case report, we describe the first successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in SAVR for a severely stenotic degenerative FSB in a pregnant woman and subsequent delivery of a healthy infant several months later. TAVR in SAVR of a severely stenotic aortic FSB should be considered as a surgical option in symptomatic pregnant women. Short-term and long-term implications for future pregnancy should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team and with the patient.
