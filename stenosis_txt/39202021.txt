Title: Sex as a Predictor of Outcomes for Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis: A Comparative Analysis between CAS and CEA.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Reporting gender-related outcomes for symptomatic carotid lesion revascularization after both endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures in an unselected group of patients treated by Italian Vascular Specialists.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients presenting with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis treated by CAS and by CEA. The primary endpoint was the 30 days any stroke occurrence rate; secondary endpoints were technical success, occurrence of transient ischemic attack (TIA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and death. Demographic, clinical and procedural data were all noted in order to identify the outcome's determining factor.
RESULTS: A total of 265 patients (193 males and 72 females) were enrolled, and of these 134 (50.5%) underwent CEA and 131 CAS (49.5%). At 30 days, the overall new stroke rate was 3.4% (one fatal), and no TIA, AMI or deaths were observed. Among strokes, seven major and two minor strokes were reported, with six after CEA and three after CAS (p = 0.32; OR: 2; CI95%: 0.48-8.17). The timing of revascularization has been found to be slightly associated with new stroke occurrence: seven out nine strokes were observed in patients treated within 14 days from symptom onset (5.5% vs. 1.4%; p = 0.08, OR: 3.8, CI95%: 0.77-18.56). Lastly, female patients presented a significantly higher risk of post-operative stroke compared to male patients: 6.9% vs. 2.1% (p: 0.05; OR: 3.52; CI95%: 0.91-13.52).
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience seems to suggest that both CEA and CAS provide safe and effective results in treating patients presenting with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Regardless of the type of revascularization, female sex is an independent risk factor for stroke recurrence after treatment.
