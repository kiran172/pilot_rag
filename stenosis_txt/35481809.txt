Title: Midterm outcomes (2 years) using the Venovo™ and Sinus Obliquus™ venous stents in the treatment of non-thrombotic and post-thrombotic iliac vein lesions - Results from a multi-centre Asian cohort.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Medium-term outcome data are lacking for dedicated venous stents especially from the Asian population.
OBJECTIVES: Aim was to determine the 2-year patency and symptomatic relief gained from using the BD Venovo™ and Optimed Sinus Obliquus™venous stents for ilio-femoral obstruction (IFO).
METHODS: 60 patients (71 limbs; 39 females; mean age of 66.4 ± 11.9 years) were included in this prospective dual centre Asian cohort. Clinical improvement was determined by change in the CEAP, rVCSS and pain scores. Stent patency and stenosis were measured using area reduction on CTV and diameter reduction on Duplex ultrasound.
RESULTS: At 2 years, 65.7% showed ≥1 CEAP score improvement from baseline and rVCSS and pain scores remained low and sustained. 87.1% venous leg ulcers remained healed. Freedom from target lesion revascularisation was 94.3% and overall stent patency was 87.1%. There were no stent fractures or migration reported.
CONCLUSION: Dedicated venous stents for IFO were associated with sustained clinical improvement and a high freedom from reintervention at 2 years in Asian patients.
