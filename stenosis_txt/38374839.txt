Title: Large Left Atrial Thrombus in a Patient With Severe Mitral Stenosis and Atrial Fibrillation Despite Anticoagulant Therapy: A Case Report.

Abstract: This case report highlights a patient with atrial fibrillation, severe mitral stenosis, and left atrial dilatation who developed a large thrombus, despite being on anticoagulant therapy. The complexity of thrombus formation in patients with multiple risk factors is described, emphasising the need for regular echocardiographic assessments to detect and monitor thrombi, even in patients undergoing anticoagulant treatment. The interplay between atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, and left atrial dilatation contributes to thrombus formation, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to the management of these patients. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the optimal treatment strategies for such cases. Timely identification and intervention are critical to mitigate the risk of thromboembolic complications in these high-risk patients.
