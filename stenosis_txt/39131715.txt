Title: Course of Esophageal Strictures in Eosinophilic Esophagitis Using Structured Esophagram Protocol.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A key unknown in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is the long-term course of esophageal stenosis. Our aim was to evaluate the course of esophageal strictures using structured serial esophagrams and determine predictors of diameter improvement in patients with EoE.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 78 EoE patients who completed 2 structured esophagrams at an academic tertiary referral center between 2003 and 2021. Maximum and minimum esophageal diameters were measured during esophagram using a standardized protocol to reduce measurement errors.
RESULTS: The median age at first esophagram was 36.2 (12.9-64.3) years; 60.3% of patients were male; 41 patients had active EoE; and 9 were inactive. Of the patients, 39.7% had allergic rhinitis, asthma (32.1%), and atopic dermatitis (7.7%). Medical therapies at second esophagram and esophagogastroduodenoscopy included proton pump inhibitors (39.5%), swallowed topical steroids (31.6%), diet elimination (13.2%), biologic therapies (1.3%), and clinical trial medications (1.3%). Median maximum diameter significantly increased by 1.0 mm (Q1: -1.0 mm, Q3: 3.0 mm) (P = .034), independent of dilation (P = .744). Increase was most profound in patients starting in the lowest maximum diameter group (9-15 mm) with median increase of 3.0 mm. For patients in disease remission at the second esophagram, there was a significant increase in maximum diameter per year compared to active disease at 0.8 mm (Q1: 0.0 mm, Q3: 5.3 mm) and 0.0 mm (Q1: -0.4 mm, Q3: 0.6 mm) respectively (P = .019).
CONCLUSION: Long-term improvement in esophageal strictures in patients with EoE may occur but is modest and likely occurs over years. Progression also appears to be minimal. Continuous medical treatment may reduce the rate of stricture recurrence and may improve stricture diameter over time.
