Title: Impact of real-time optical coherence tomography and angiographic coregistration on the percutaneous coronary intervention strategy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) with angiographic coregistration (ACR) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for procedural decision-making is evolving; however, large-scale data in real-world practice are lacking.
AIMS: Our study aims to evaluate the real-time impact of OCT-ACR on clinician decision-making during PCI.
METHODS: Patients with angiographic diameter stenosis >70% in at least one native coronary artery were enrolled in the study. The pre- and post-PCI procedural strategies were prospectively assessed after angiography, OCT, and ACR.
RESULTS: A total of 500 patients were enrolled in the study between November 2018 and March 2020. Among these, data related to 472 patients with 483 lesions were considered for analysis. Preprocedural OCT resulted in a change in PCI strategy in 80% of lesions: lesion preparation (25%), stent length (53%), stent diameter (36%), and device landing zone (61%). ACR additionally impacted the treatment strategy in 34% of lesions. Postprocedural OCT demonstrated underexpansion (15%), malapposition (14%), and tissue/thrombus prolapse (7%), thereby requiring further interventions in 30% of lesions. No further change in strategy was observed with subsequent postprocedural ACR. Angiographic and procedural success was achieved in 100% of patients, and the overall incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year was 0.85%.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes reflect the real-time impact of OCT-ACR on the overall procedural strategy in patients undergoing PCI. ACR had a significant impact on the treatment strategy and was associated with better clinical outcomes at 1 year after index PCI. OCT-ACR has become a practical tool for improving outcomes in patients with complex lesions.
