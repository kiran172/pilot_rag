Title: Congestive colopathy in a patient with arteriovenous malformations and multiple mesenteric thromboses.

Abstract: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in mesenteric vessels are exceptionally rare. These congenital vascular anomalies lead to direct vascular flow between the highly pressured arterial system and the low-pressure venous system. We describe the case of a patient with prior left colectomy for splenic flexure colonic adenocarcinoma presenting with persistent abdominal pain after developing multiple mesenteric thromboses. CT and colonoscopy showed left hemicolon congestion, anastomotic stenosis and mucosal oedema. Mesenteric angiogram revealed AVMs in the right colic and left colic arteries. Embolisation of the left colic AVM led to symptom resolution without recurrence at interval follow-up.
