Title: Evolving Developments in Cardiac CT.

Abstract: In this review, the authors describe some of the latest cardiac CT advances in the evaluation of cardiovascular disease. This includes automated coronary plaque quantification and subtyping, and cardiac CT fractional flow reserve and CT perfusion as techniques to noninvasively assess the physiologic significance of coronary stenosis. The authors also focus on noncoronary applications involving the expanding role of cardiac CT in structural heart disease interventions. Developments in cardiac CT for the evaluation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and infiltrative cardiomyopathy and for functional analysis of myocardial contractile dysfunction are discussed. Finally, the authors review studies evaluating photon-counting CT in cardiac disease.
