Title: Cerebrovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Pooled Patient-Level Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular events remain one of the most devastating complications of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Data from real-world contemporary cohorts on longitudinal trends and outcomes remain limited. The aim of this study was to assess incidence, temporal trends, predictors, and outcomes of cerebrovascular events following transfemoral TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The CENTER2 (Cerebrovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With Balloon-Expandable Valves Versus Self-Expandable Valves 2) study includes patients undergoing TAVI between 2007 and 2022. The database contains pooled patient-level data from 10 clinical studies. A total of 24 305 patients underwent transfemoral TAVI (mean age 81.5±6.7 years, 56% women, median Society of Thoracic Surgeon Predicted Risk of Mortality 4.9% [3.1%-8.5%]). Of these patients, 2.2% (n=534) experienced stroke in the first 30 days after TAVI, and 40 (0.4%) had a transient ischemic attack. Stroke rates remained stable during the treatment period (2007-2010: 2.1%, 2011-2014: 2.5%, 2015-2018: 2.1%, 2019-2022: 2.1%; P<sub>trend</sub>=0.28). Moreover, 30-day cerebrovascular event rates were similar across Society of Thoracic Surgeon Predicted Risk of Mortality risk categories: 2.1% in low-risk, 2.6% in intermediate-risk, and 2.5% in high-risk patients (P=0.21). Mortality was higher in patients with 30-day stroke than without at 30 days (20.3% versus 4.7%; odds ratio, 5.1 [95% CI, 4.1-6.5]; P&lt;0.001) and at 1 year (44.1% versus 15.0%; hazard ratio, 3.5 [95% CI, 3.0-4.2]; P&lt;0.001). One-year mortality rates for stroke did not decline over time (2007-2010: 46.9%, 2011-2014: 46.0%, 2015-2018: 43.0%, 2019-2022: 39.1%; P<sub>trend</sub>=0.32). At 1 year, 7.0% of patients undergoing TAVI had a stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: In 24 305 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI, 30-day cerebrovascular event incidence remained ≈ 2.2% between 2007 and 2022. Thirty-day stroke rates were similar throughout Society of Thoracic Surgeon Predicted Risk of Mortality risk categories. Mortality rates after stroke remain high.
