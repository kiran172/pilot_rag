Title: Common carotid artery dissection from sportive choking.

Abstract: Tandem occlusions of the anterior circulation refer to the simultaneous presence of a cervical carotid artery occlusion or high-grade stenosis and an ipsilateral large vessel occlusion involving the intracranial internal carotid artery, M1 or proximal M2 middle cerebral artery. Whilst carotid occlusion usually results from progressive atherosclerotic disease, in younger individuals it may arise secondary to a dissection for which there are multiple aetiologies, with trauma being an important cause in patients having a relevant history. We present a rare case of traumatic left common carotid artery dissection in a young professional Jiu-Jitsu fighter presenting with delayed stroke symptoms and angiographic findings of a tandem occlusion. This case was successfully managed with endovascular clot retrieval and antiplatelet medication.
