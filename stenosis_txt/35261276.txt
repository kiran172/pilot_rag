Title: Impact of Percutaneous Transluminal Renal Angioplasty on Autonomic Nervous System and Natriuresis in Hypertensive Patients With Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Background We investigated the early postoperative effect of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and the circadian characteristics of natriuresis and autonomic nerve activity. Methods and Results A total of 64 patients with hypertension with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (mean age, 60.0±21.0 years; 31.3% fibromuscular dysplasia) who underwent angioplasty were included, and circadian characteristics of natriuresis as well as heart rate variability indices, including 24-hour BP, low-frequency and high-frequency (HF) components, and the percentage of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals &gt;50 ms were evaluated using an oscillometric device, TM-2425, both at baseline and 3 days after angioplasty. In both the fibromuscular dysplasia and atherosclerotic stenosis groups, 24-hour systolic BP (fibromuscular dysplasia, -19±14; atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, -11±9 mm Hg), percentage of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals &gt;50 ms, HF, brain natriuretic peptide, and nighttime urinary sodium excretion decreased (all P&lt;0.01), and heart rate increased (both P&lt;0.05) after angioplasty. In both groups, revascularization increased the night/day ratios of percentage of differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals &gt;50 ms (both P&lt;0.01) and HF, and decreased those of low frequency/HF (all P&lt;0.05) and nighttime urinary sodium excretion (fibromuscular dysplasia, 1.17±0.15 to 0.78±0.09; atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, 1.37±0.10 to 0.99±0.06, both P&lt;0.01). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that a 1-SD increase in baseline low frequency/HF was associated with at least a 15% decrease in 24-hour systolic BP after angioplasty (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% CI, 1.03-5.67]; P&lt;0.05). Conclusions Successful revascularization results in a significant BP decrease in the early postoperative period. Intrarenal perfusion might be a key modulator of the circadian patterns of autonomic nerve activity and natriuresis, and pretreatment heart rate variability evaluation seems to be important for treatment success.
