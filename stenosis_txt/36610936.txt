Title: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of post-irradiation stenosis of the vertebral artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The outcomes of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) in patients with medically refractory post-irradiation stenosis of the vertebral artery (PISVA) have not been clarified.
AIM: This retrospective study evaluated the safety and outcomes of PTAS in patients with severe PISVA compared with their radiation-naïve counterparts (non-RT group).
METHODS: Patients with medically refractory severe symptomatic vertebral artery stenosis and undergoing PTAS between 2000 and 2021 were classified as the PISVA group or the non-RT group. The periprocedural neurological complications, periprocedural brain magnetic resonance imaging, the extent of symptom relief, and long-term stent patency were compared.
RESULTS: As compared with the non-RT group (22 cases, 24 lesions), the PISVA group (10 cases, 10 lesions) was younger (62.0 ± 8.6 vs 72.4 ± 9.7 years, P = 0.006) and less frequently had hypertension (40.0% vs 86.4%, P = 0.013) and diabetes mellitus (10.0% vs 54.6%, P = 0.024). Periprocedural embolic infarction was not significantly different between the non-RT group and the PISVA group (37.5% vs 35.7%, P = 1.000). At a mean follow-up of 72.1 ± 58.7 (3-244) months, there was no significant between-group differences in the symptom recurrence rate (0.00% vs 4.55%, P = 1.000) and in-stent restenosis rate (10.0% vs 12.5%, P = 1.000).
CONCLUSION: PTAS of severe medically refractory PISVA is effective in the management of vertebrobasilar ischemic symptoms in head and neck cancer patients. Technical safety and outcome of the procedure were like those features in radiation-naïve patients.
