Title: Rare Complication Post-Conization for Cervical Dysplasia: Rectovaginal Fistula.

Abstract: (1) Background: High-grade cervical dysplasia is primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Conservative surgery is the preferred treatment approach for this condition. The most commonly employed technique is the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), which involves removing the affected portion of the cervix. Excisional treatments are often curative, and complications are typically rare and minor. (2) Methods: The loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is the standard method used for conservative surgery in high-grade cervical dysplasia. It entails the excision of the specific area of the cervix where the abnormal cells are present. The procedure employs a wire loop carrying an electrical current to remove the affected tissue. (3) Results: Excisional treatments, such as LEEP, have shown to be effective in treating high-grade cervical dysplasia. They have a high success rate in eliminating abnormal cells and reducing the risk of cervical cancer. Complications associated with LEEP are infrequent and usually minor. Short-term complications may include bleeding, which can be managed easily. Long-term complications may involve cervical canal stenosis, which can impact fertility. (4) Conclusions: Conservative surgery, particularly the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), is the preferred and effective treatment for high-grade cervical dysplasia caused by HPV infection. It offers a high cure rate with rare and minor complications. While short-term bleeding is a common occurrence, it is manageable. Long-term complications such as cervical canal stenosis may impact fertility. However, an extremely rare and possibly unique complication described in this case is the development of a vaginorectal fistula. This complication is likely due to indirect thermal injury resulting from compromised tissue. Further research is needed to better understand and prevent such complications.
