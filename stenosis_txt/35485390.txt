Title: Evaluating the effect of multivalvular disease on mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis: a meta-analysis and systematic review.

Abstract: Aims: To determine the prognosis of multivalvular disease in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis. Methods: Patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis with covariate-adjusted risk of mortality associated with concomitant valve disease (mitral regurgitation [MR], mitral stenosis [MS] or tricuspid regurgitation [TR]) were included. Results: Moderate-to-severe MR was associated with increased mortality at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.11-2.30; p = 0.01) and 1 year (HR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.22-2.87; p = 0.004). The presence of all-grade MS did not impact 30-day or 1-year mortality (HR, 30 days: 1.60; 95% CI: 0.71-3.63; p = 0.26; and HR, 1 year: 1.90; 95% CI: 0.98-3.69; p = 0.06); however, an increased risk of 1-year mortality (HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.03-2.70; p = 0.04) was observed with severe MS compared with no MS. Moderate-to-severe TR had a higher risk of all-cause mortality at 1 year (HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.24-1.78; p &lt; 0.001) compared with no or mild TR. Conclusion: Moderate-to-severe MR or TR, and severe MS, significantly increase mid-term mortality after TAVR.
