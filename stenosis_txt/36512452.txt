Title: Smoking is an independent risk factor for stricture recurrence after the urethroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To clarify the association between smoking and stricture recurrence after urethroplasty.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched with keywords: "urethroplasty," "buccal mucosa graft urethroplasty," "oral mucosa graft urethroplasty," "excision and primary anastomosis urethroplasty," "urethral stricture recurrence" until July 1, 2022. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on PICOS principles. The quality of included studies was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (N.O.S.) system. Hazard ratio (H.R.), odds ratio (OR), and relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were extracted or re-calculated from included studies. Meta-analysis was performed with Stata 15.0 based on univariate and multivariate data separately. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the stability of the meta-analysis. I2 was calculated to evaluate heterogeneity. Publication biases were assessed by Egger's and Begg's tests. Funnel plots of univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were also offered.
RESULTS: Twenty one studies with 6791 patients were involved in this meta-analysis. The analysis results of the two stages were consistent. In the univariate meta-analysis stage, 18 studies with 5811 patients were pooled, and the result indicated that smoking might promote stricture recurrence (RR=1.32, P=0.001). Based on the adjusted estimate, 11 studies with 3176 patients were pooled in the multivariate meta-analysis stage, and the result indicated that smoking might promote stricture recurrence (RR=1.35, P=0.049). There was no significant heterogeneity in both the univariate and multivariate stages.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that smoking may prompt stricture recurrence after the urethroplasty. Quitting smoking may be a good option for patients undergoing urethroplasty surgery.
