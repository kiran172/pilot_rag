Title: Pheochromocytoma-induced myocardial infarction: A case report.

Abstract: The pheochromocytoma is an uncommon endocrine neoplasm that originates from chromaffin cells and causes significant cardiovascular effects through the intermittent or sustained release of catecholamines. In this report, we present a rare case of myocardial infarction (MI) induced by pheochromocytoma. A 53-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a history of intermittent palpitations, back pain, and sweating for over 10 years, which had worsened over the past 2 days. The patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels were significantly elevated, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation, leading to an initial diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning, indicative of stress cardiomyopathy. Emergency coronary angiography revealed no significant stenosis, and the patient's blood pressure was fluctuating. Computerized tomography (CT) scan of the adrenal gland revealed a bilateral adrenal mass, with the left adrenal mass being larger in size after contrast-enhanced CT scan. The patient's left adrenal gland was successfully removed through laparoscopic adrenalectomy, and histopathology results confirmed the presence of adrenal pheochromocytoma. Follow-up for 3 months after discharge showed the patient had no symptoms and good prognosis. The abnormal findings on echocardiography and ECG resolved. Prompt diagnosis and management of pheochromocytoma are crucial for a favorable prognosis.
