Title: Effect of prostaglandin-E1 treatment on pyloric wall thickness in newborns with ductal-dependent critical congenital heart diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is used in the medical treatment of ductal-dependent critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in neonates. Apnea/bradycardia, hypotension, hypokalemia, and fever are the most important side effects of PGE1. Moreover, gastric outlet obstruction has been reported in a few case reports. A prospective study was conducted to investigate the effect of PGE1 treatment on pyloric wall thickness in newborns with congenital heart diseases.
METHODS: A total of 22 newborns with ductal-dependent CCHD having PGE1 infusion longer than a week were included in this study. Ultrasonographic measurements were performed before and one week after the PGE1 infusion to evaluate the pyloric thickness and length. The protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.govidentifier NCT04496050.
RESULTS: A total of 22 neonates with mean gestational age 38 ± 1.8 weeks and birth weight 3105 ± 611 gr were enrolled in the study. The median time of the second ultrasound was seven days. The median cumulative dose of PGE1 given during this period was 108 mcg/kg/min. There was a statistically significant increase in post-treatment pyloric thickness and length compared to pre-treatment measurements (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). None of the patients with increased thickness and pyloric muscle length presented any symptoms.
CONCLUSION: PGE1 treatment significantly increased the pyloric thickness and length after at least one-week treatment. PGE1 with its action mechanism is likely to cause gastric outlet obstruction, although not exactly pyloric stenosis on the condition used for a long time.
