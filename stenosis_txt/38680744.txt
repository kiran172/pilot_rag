Title: Endovascular resolution of post-surgical complications in the portal vein: Report of two cases.

Abstract: Stenosis of the portal vein is one of the main complications after hepatobiliar and pancreatic surgery, with a reported incidence of 19.6% after pancreaticoduodenectomy and 3% after liver transplant. It is associated with the intraoperative resection of the portal vein, local recurrence of the primary tumor and radiotherapy. The portal lesion secondary to bile drainage catheter insertion is extremely rare or unusual, with few cases described in the literature. This article describes 2 cases: the first of a male patients 49 years old post-operative to liver transplant with partial portal thrombosis and stenosis of the mesoportal joint, and the second a female patient 50 years old with history of cholecystectomy, exploration of the bile duct and placement of Kehr "T" tube with secondary portal lesion. The 2 cases were successfully treated through minimally invasive procedures by an interventionist radiologist.
