Title: Treatment for cephalic arch stenosis with cephalic vein to external jugular vein bridging graft.

Abstract: AIM: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or cephalic vein transposition to the axillary vein is mainly used for treatment of cephalic arch stenosis, a common complication of brachiocephalic fistulas. However, the results of such interventions have been disappointing.
METHODS: We used a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis with a 6 mm diameter to bridge the cephalic vein and the ipsilateral external jugular vein, and successfully created a new drainage outlet and established immediate restoration of flow through brachiocephalic fistulas.
RESULTS: This surgery allowed the cephalic venous arch and subclavian vein, which are vulnerable to stenosis, to be bypassed altogether and the puncture segment could be elongated by about 20 cm.
CONCLUSION: It is a safe and effective alternative to traditional methods of treatment for cephalic arche stenosis.
