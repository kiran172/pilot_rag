Title: The Effect of Obesity on Vaginoplasty Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Some surgeons use body mass index criteria within the patient selection processes before vaginoplasty, thereby limiting access to select obese patients. We sought to better characterize the effect of obesity on postoperative outcomes across multiple vaginoplasty techniques.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective review of all transfeminine patients undergoing primary vaginoplasty procedures from December 2018 to July 2022 was conducted. Patients were stratified into cohorts according to the World Health Organization Obesity Class criteria. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, operative details, postoperative complications, and all-cause revision were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 237 patients met the inclusion criteria. Average follow-up duration was 9.1 Â± 4.7 months. Multivariate regression revealed that patients with class I and class II/III obesity were associated with higher odds of developing vaginal stenosis (class I: odds ratio [OR], 7.1 [ P = 0.003]; class II/III: OR, 3.4 [ P = 0.018]) and all-cause revision (class I: OR, 3.7 [ P = 0.021]; class II/III: OR, 4.8 [ P = 0.027]). Undergoing either robotic peritoneal or robotic intestinal vaginoplasty was associated with lower odds of delayed wound healing (peritoneal: OR, 0.2 [ P < 0.001]; intestinal: OR, 0.2 [ P = 0.011]). Lastly, adherence to dilation regimen was negatively associated with development of vaginal stenosis (OR, 0.04; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obesity may be at a higher risk of developing vaginal stenosis after vaginoplasty, which may ultimately necessitate operative revision. Although patients with obesity may remain surgical candidates, proper preoperative counseling and adherence to postoperative vaginal dilation regimens are critical to optimizing outcomes.
