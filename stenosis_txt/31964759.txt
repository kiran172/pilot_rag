Title: Health Care Supervision for Children With Williams Syndrome.

Abstract: This set of recommendations is designed to assist the pediatrician in caring for children with Williams syndrome (WS) who were diagnosed by using clinical features and with chromosome 7 microdeletion confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromosome microarray, or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The recommendations in this report reflect review of the current literature, including previously peer-reviewed and published management suggestions for WS, as well as the consensus of physicians and psychologists with expertise in the care of individuals with WS. These general recommendations for the syndrome do not replace individualized medical assessment and treatment.
