Title: Can balloon-assisted enteroscopy predict disease outcomes in patients with small-bowel Crohn's disease?

Abstract: There are limited studies on the endoscopic assessment of disease activity using balloon-assisted enteroscopy (BAE) and its predictive role for long-term outcomes of patients with small bowel Crohn's disease (CD). We sought to investigate the value of BAE as a predictor of long-term outcomes in patients with small-bowel CD. A total of 111 patients with small-bowel CD whose endoscopic disease activity was assessed using BAE based on the small-bowel simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (small-bowel SES-CD) at Samsung Medical Center were retrospectively selected from January 2014 to August 2020. The outcome was an evaluation of the risk of surgery according to a small-bowel SES-CD of 0-6 vs. ≥ 7 and endoscopic findings (presence of any ulcer and degree of stricture) using the Cox proportional hazards model. The risk of surgery was significantly increased in patients with a small-bowel SES-CD of ≥ 7 compared to a small-bowel SES-CD of 0-6 [hazard ratio (HR) 6.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48-26.91; p = 0.013]. In addition, the risk of surgery was significantly increased in patients with stenosis with "cannot be passed" compared to the cases without stenosis (HR 12.34; 95% CI 1.66-91.92; p = 0.014), whereas there was no significance in any ulcer. The present study demonstrated the role of BAE in the endoscopic assessment of disease activity and its predictive value for the risk of surgery in small-bowel CD patients. Further optimization of BAE utilization for the assessment of disease activity is warranted in clinical practice.
