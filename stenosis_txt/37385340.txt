Title: The Necessity or Not of Additional Endovascular Therapy to Medical Therapy for Symptomatic Intracranial Artery Stenosis: Insights from 30-Day and 1-Year Results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment between endovascular therapy and medical treatment for symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis is still unclear. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of 2 treatments based on the results from currently published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were used for searching the RCTs evaluating the addition of endovascular therapy to medical therapy for treating symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis from the inception of these databases to September 30, 2022. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using STATA version 12.0.
RESULTS: A total of 4 RCTs were involved in the current study, including 989 participants. In the 30-day results, the data showed that compared with the medical therapy alone group, the additional endovascular therapy group was associated with a higher risk of death or stroke (relative risk (RR): 2.857; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.756-4.648; P < 0.001), ipsilateral stroke (RR: 3.525; 95% CI: 1.969-6.310; P < 0.001), death (risk differences (RD): 0.01; 95% CI: 0.004-0.03; P = 0.015), hemorrhagic stroke (RD: 0.03; 95% CI: 0.01-0.06; P < 0.001), and ischemic stroke (RR: 2.221; 95% CI: 1.279-3.858; P = 0.005). In the 1-year results, the additional endovascular therapy group was related to a greater incidence of ipsilateral stroke (RR, 2.247; 95% CI, 1.492-3.383; P < 0.001) and ischemic stroke (RR: 2.092; 95% CI: 1.270-3.445; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Given that the medical treatment alone was related to a lower risk of stroke and death in the short-term and long-term compared with endovascular therapy combined with medical therapy. Based on this evidence, these findings do not support the addition of endovascular therapy to medical therapy for treating patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis.
