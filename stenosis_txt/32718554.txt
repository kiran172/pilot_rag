Title: Meta-analysis Comparing Transradial Versus Transfemoral Secondary Access in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Up to a quarter of vascular complications during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) result from secondary access via the femoral artery (FA). The radial artery (RA) is increasingly used as an alternative to the FA for secondary access in TAVI. Limited data exist on the outcomes of RA secondary access versus FA secondary access. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing secondary access sites. PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane library and CINAHL were searched systematically for studies comparing RA and FA as secondary access sites for TAVI. Primary outcomes of interest were vascular complications and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). Risk ratio (RR), standardized mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. Six observational studies comprising 6,373 patients (RA: 1,514, FA: 4,859) met inclusion criteria. Secondary access was utilized for aortography during valve deployment and to manage primary access site complications. Procedural characteristics were similar in both groups. RA was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (RR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.64, p <0.00001). No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of overall vascular complications, however, the risk of major vascular complications was lower with RA (RR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.63, p <0.00001). The incidence of stroke and all-cause mortality was lower in RA, whereas no difference was observed in the risk of MI. In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that RA secondary access is associated with better outcomes for TAVI than FA.
