Title: Clinical outcome of endoscopic treatment of symptomatic Hepaticojejunal anastomotic strictures after pancreatoduodenectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepaticojejunostomy anastomotic stricture (HJAS) is an adverse event after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) which can result in jaundice and/or cholangitis. With endoscopy, HJAS can be managed. However, few studies report the specific success and adverse event rates of endoscopic therapy after PD.
METHODS: Patients with symptomatic HJAS, who underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at the Erasmus MC between 2004-2020, were retrospectively included. Primary outcomes were short-term clinical success defined as no need for re-intervention <3 months and long-term <12 months. Secondary outcome measures were cannulation success and adverse events. Recurrence was defined as symptoms with radiological/endoscopic confirmation.
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were included. The hepaticojejunostomy was reached in 49/62 (79%) of the patients, subsequently cannulated in 42/49 (86%) and in 35/42 patients (83%) an intervention was performed. Recurrence of symptomatic HJAS after technically successful intervention occurred in 20 (57%) patients after median time to recurrence of 7.5 months [95%CI, 7.2-NA]. Adverse events were reported in 4% of the procedures (8% of patients), mostly concerning cholangitis.
DISCUSSION: Endoscopic treatment for symptomatic HJAS after PD has a moderate technical success rate and a high recurrence rate. Future studies should optimize endoscopic treatment protocols and compare percutaneous versus endoscopic treatment.
