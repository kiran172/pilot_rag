Title: Bronchoscopic retrograde recanalization of complete tracheal obliteration after tracheostomy.

Abstract: Complete tracheal obliteration after tracheostomy remains a considerable challenge for otolaryngologists and pulmonologists. Here, we report for the first time a novel method of interventional bronchoscopy to successfully recanalize complete tracheal obliteration. Three patients with suprastomal tracheal obliteration and tracheostomy dependence were referred to our center for further management. Using interventional bronchoscopy, a TBNA needle was retrogradely inserted from the stoma to locate the original passage through the occlusion, and then its stylet was left as a guide wire for the sequential dilations. Once the tracheal lumen was restored, endoprosthesis would be implanted to maintain the airway patency. All cases achieved successful recanalization with effortless breathing after the treatment and restored phonation. Bronchoscopic retrograde recanalization using a TBNA needle is a promising and effective treatment for complete tracheal obliteration.
