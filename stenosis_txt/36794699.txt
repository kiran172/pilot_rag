Title: Preclinical assessment of the feasibility, safety and lesion durability of a novel 'single-shot' pulsed field ablation catheter for pulmonary vein isolation.

Abstract: AIMS: Single-shot pulmonary vein isolation can improve procedural efficiency. To assess the capability of a novel, expandable lattice-shaped catheter to rapidly isolate thoracic veins using pulsed field ablation (PFA) in healthy swine.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study catheter (SpherePVI; Affera Inc) was used to isolate thoracic veins in two cohorts of swine survived for 1 and 5 weeks. In Experiment 1, an initial dose (PULSE2) was used to isolate the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) in six swine and the SVC only in two swine. In Experiment 2, a final dose (PULSE3) was used for SVC, RSPV, and left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) in five swine. Baseline and follow-up maps, ostial diameters, and phrenic nerve were assessed. Pulsed field ablation was delivered atop the oesophagus in three swine. All tissues were submitted for pathology. In Experiment 1, all 14/14 veins were isolated acutely with durable isolation demonstrated in 6/6 RSPVs and 6/8 SVC. Both reconnections occurred when only one application/vein was used. Fifty-two and 32 sections from the RSPVs and SVC revealed transmural lesions in 100% with a mean depth of 4.0 Â± 2.0 mm. In Experiment 2, 15/15 veins were isolated acutely with 14/15 veins (5/5 SVC, 5/5 RSPV, and 4/5 LSPV) durably isolated. Right superior pulmonary vein (31) and SVC (34) sections had 100% transmural, circumferential ablation with minimal inflammation. Viable vessels and nerves were noted without evidence of venous stenosis, phrenic palsy, or oesophageal injury.
CONCLUSION: This novel expandable lattice PFA catheter can achieve durable isolation with transmurality and safety.
