Title: Efficacy of probing adjunctive with low-dose mitomycin-C irrigation for the treatment of epiphora in adults with nasolacrimal duct stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to investigate the efficacy of adjunctive low-dose mitomycin-C (MMC) during successful lacrimal duct probing in adults with nasolacrimal ducts (NLDs) stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective case-control study on patients with NLD stenosis who were randomized into two groups. All patients underwent probing without or with an application of MMC. Former group received 0.2 mg/ml MMC irrigation for 5 min. The main outcome measures were objective evaluation of patency with irrigation, as well as patients' subjective assessment of improvement.
RESULTS: There were 73 eyes in 58 consecutive patients; patient mean age ranged from 19 to 78 years (mean 44 years). Female included larger group of patients (63%) and mean duration of the symptoms was 26.1 months (range, 2-120 months). After mean follow-up of 11 months (range, 9-14 months), 23 (60%) of the 38 eyes in the MMC groups and 8 (22%) of the 35 eyes in control group had complete response and remained symptom free. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.005). According to the patient's satisfaction, epiphora was partially improved in 6 (17%) eyes of control group and 4 (10%) eyes in MMC group. Application of MMC has a better outcome in patients with severe stenosis (P = 0.007); patients who had symptoms more than 12 months (P = 0.02) and patients with constant epiphora were compared with intermittent symptoms (P = 0.001). No complications were detected during patients follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests acceptable long-term results for probing adjunctive with MMC irrigation for adults with NLD stenosis that can be recommended as a simple and effective procedure for these patients.
