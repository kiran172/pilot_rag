Operating room setup, camera settings, access to the bladder, and negotiation of the ureteral orifice, lasertripsy, basketing of the stone fragments, endoscopic treatment of ureteral tumors and ureteral stenosis, flexible URS at the end of semirigid URS, and Double-J stent placement are described step by step.
