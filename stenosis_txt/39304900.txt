Title: Airway management for patients with tracheal stenosis and severe scar contracture of the face and neck via bronchoscopy: a case report.

Abstract: Both anaesthesiologists and surgeons experience challenges in managing airway stenosis and scar contracture in the face and neck. Herein, we report the case of a 38-year-old woman (BMI 23.1 kg/m2, third-degree burns covering 40% of her body, an American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status III) with an unusual case of airway constriction. This patient had a predictable difficult airway (mouth opening of 2 cm, bilateral nostril scar hyperplasia, Mallampatti score III, scarring of the head and neck, and severe tracheal stenosis). Tracheal stenosis measuring 5.5 mm in width as observed 8 cm below the glottis, and the bronchoscope could not pass through it. After two failed attempts at laryngeal mask insertion, we decided to instead insert a custom-made tracheal tube under the guidance of a fiberoptic bronchoscope. The operation was successful, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).
