Title: Infective Endocarditis Complicated With Septic Embolic Stroke After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Case Report.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a relatively novel procedure developed for aortic stenosis (AS) management in patients with moderate to high surgical risk, especially the elderly with multiple comorbidities. Infective endocarditis following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (post-TAVI-IE) is an uncommon complication that contributes to very high morbidity and mortality. Further complications from post-TAVI-IE include ischemic stroke from septic emboli. Here, we report a case of an 82-year-old man with severe symptomatic AS who underwent TAVI, presenting with fever and alteration of consciousness, which was diagnosed as post-TAVI-IE per Duke criteria complicated by acute hemiparesis from septic emboli stroke. He was treated successfully conservatively using antibiotics. We have reviewed the options of treatment and outcomes for post-TAVI-IE.
