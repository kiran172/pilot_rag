Title: Efficacy of topical 5-Fluorouracil in the management of ocular surface squamous neoplasia: a study of 101 eyes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and side-effect profile of topical 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in the treatment of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN).
METHODS: Retrospective study of 101 eyes of 100 patients treated with 5-FU with one week on and 3 weeks off regimen.
RESULTS: Of the 100 patients (101 eyes), the mean age at diagnosis of OSSN was 49 (median, 52 years; range, 11-87 years). History of prior intervention was noted in 6 (6%) eyes. Tumor epicenter included bulbar conjunctiva (n = 54; 53%), limbus (n = 27; 27%), and cornea (n = 20;20%). Mean number of cycles of topical 5-FU administered was 3 (median, 3; range, 1-8). Complete tumor regression was achieved with topical 5-FU in 89 (88%) eyes with a mean number of 2 cycles (median, 2; range, 1-6) of 5-FU. The remaining 12 (12%) lesions underwent additional treatment including excisional biopsy (n = 7), extended enucleation (n = 3), and topical Interferon alpha 2b (n = 2) for complete tumor control. Over a mean follow-up period of 6 months (median, 5 months; range, 1-36 months) following treatment, tumor recurrence was noted in 2 (2%) patients, and side-effects were noted in 7 (7%) eyes including conjunctival hyperemia (n = 1), punctal stenosis (n = 1), sterile keratitis (n = 4), and limbal stem cell deficiency (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: Topical 5-FU is an effective non-invasive therapy for OSSN with a minimal side-effect profile.
