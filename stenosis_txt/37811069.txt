Title: Assessment of functional and cosmetic outcomes of Extended-Tubularized incised plate for mid-shaft and distal hypospadias as a modification of Snodgrass repair: a cross-sectional study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hypospadias is a congenital abnormality of anterior urethral and penile development where the urethral meatus is ectopically located on the ventral aspect of the penis. It is a relatively common condition affecting ~1 in 250 male birth. Extended-Tubularized Incised Plate (E-TIP) is a modification of Snodgrass repair by extending the midline incision to the apical part of the glans resulting in a more normal appearing location of the meatus and straight urinary stream without increasing the risk of complications.
AIM OF STUDY: To evaluate functional and cosmetic outcomes of E-TIP repair for mid-shaft and distal hypospadias as a modification of Snodgrass repair.
PATIENT AND METHOD: A prospective cross-sectional study including 53 cases of mid-to-distal hypospadias repaired with the E-TIP technique between November 2019 and February 2022 in Baghdad. The authors start with the standard technique described by Snodgrass, but the midline incision of the urethral plate extended up to the apical part of the glans tip, and tabularization started distally creating a slit-like a neomeatus. Outcome assessment depended on an objective evaluation of the following parameters: maximum flow rate, post-void residual, Hypospadias Objective Score Evaluation (HOSE) score, and direction of the urinary stream.
RESULTS: The mean age was 3.4±2.1 years, ranging from 0.6 to 9 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 14.4±6.9 months, and the location of the meatus was coronal in 16 patients (30%), subcoronal in 25 (47%), and mid-distal shaft in 12 (23%). The glans width was greater than or equal to 14 mm in 46 patients (87%) and less than 14 mm in 7 (13%). Q.max was above the fifth percentile of age-related uroflowmetry nomograms for healthy children 5-15 years old in 29 boys (93.5%) and below the fifth percentile in 2 (6.5%). Post-void residual urine was less than 10% of voided volume in 28 out of 31 boys (90%) and greater than 10% in 3 (10%). Regarding cosmetic outcomes, 50 boys (94%) had good penile appearance and their HOSE score greater than or equal to 14 with a slit-like meatus located at the tip of the glans, while 3 (6%) of them their score was less than 14. The overall mean HOSE score postoperatively for all patients was 15±0.9. Six patients (11%) had a deviated urinary stream and 47 (89%) had a straight stream.
CONCLUSION: E-TIP repair is a good alternative to standard Snodgrass repair for mid-shaft to distal hypospadias with a good functional and cosmetic outcome, particularly the neomeatus position at the tip of the glans, which is similar to the normal one without increasing the risk of meatal stenosis.
