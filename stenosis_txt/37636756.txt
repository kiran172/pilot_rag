Title: Limited Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis of Nose and Paranasal Sinuses - a Case Report.

Abstract: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare disease with involvement of multiple organ system. It classically affects the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract and kidneys. 90% of patients present with upper respiratory diseases like rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, nasal septal perforation, serous otitis media, impaired hearing and stridor due to subglottic stenosis. Disease manifests in two forms as limited disease i.e. without renal involvement and generalized disease i.e. with renal involvement. It needs to be differentiated from chronic granulomatous diseases like tuberculosis and delay in the treatment should be prevented. Here we present a case with disease limited to Nose and Paranasal sinuses.
