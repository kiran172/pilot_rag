Title: Association between Inguinal Hernia and Arterial Disease: A Preliminary Report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inguinal hernia (IH) is a major problem in general surgery and its prevalence is increasing. The presence of hernias has been associated with a wide spectrum of venous diseases, with the involvement of imbalances in collagen and extracellular matrix deposition and metalloproteinases dysfunction. We aimed to evaluate whether the association between IH and vascular diseases is also present with respect to arterial diseases.
METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional observational study enrolling consecutive patients undergoing surgical repair of IH. Arterial diseases (AD) considered were carotid stenosis, peripheral artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysms.
RESULTS: Study population consisted of 70 patients. Mean age was 63.2 Â± 4.7 years. Prevalence of AD was 42.9% in the whole cohort. AD patients were older (p = 0.015), and more frequently had hypertension (p = 0.001) and active smoking habits (p = 0.001) than the no-AD group. Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was higher in AD than in no-AD patients (p &lt; 0.001). At multivariable analysis, increased ACR (odds ratio, OR: 1.14, p &lt; 0.001), old age (OR: 1.25, p = 0.001) and a smoking habit (OR: 3.20, p = 0.001) were significant correlates for the presence of AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of AD in patients with IH is non-negligible. Old age, a smoking habit and an abnormal excretion of urine albumin are associated with the presence of AD in these patients. Future studies are needed to gain more insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this association, exploring also the specific role of metalloproteinases.
