Title: [Epidemiology and pathophysiology of giant cell arteritis].

Abstract: EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF GIANT CELL ARTERITIS. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a granulomatous vasculitis. It affects patients over 50 years of age, predominantly women. The pathophysiology of GCA involves genetic and environmental factors leading to the development of inflammation and subsequent large artery wall remodelling, the mechanisms of which are increasingly understood. The process is thought to begin with the activation of dendritic cells in the vessel wall. These then recruit and activate CD4 T cells, inducing their proliferation and polarisation into Th1 and Th17 cells, which produce interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) respectively. IFN-γ activates vascular smooth muscle cells, which produce chemokines that induce the recruitment of other mononuclear cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells and monocytes). This inflammatory infiltrate, the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages induce the production of other mediators that cause remodeling of the vascular wall based on destruction of the arterial wall, neoangiogenesis and intimal hyperplasia. This remodelling leads to the ischaemic manifestations of GCA by causing stenosis or even occlusion of the affected vessels. More recently, mechanisms have been identified that allow the perpetuation of inflammation and vascular remodelling, explaining the chronic evolution of GCA.
