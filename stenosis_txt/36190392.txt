Title: Foreign Body Ingestion and Management in Children.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate of the children who came to our hospital with the complaint of foreign body (FB) ingestion and were treated.
METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was made of the records of children who presented at our institution between January 2014 and August 2021 with the complaint of FB ingestion.
RESULTS: Evaluation was made of 297 children, comprising 121 female children (40.7%) with a mean age of 61.1 Â± 50.3 months (range, 4-202 months). The ingested FB most frequently was coins (n = 88, 29.6%). The most common complaint on presentation was vomiting in 47 cases (15.8%). Endoscopy was applied to 75 cases (25.3%), and most common FB was removed from the upper esophagus in 31 cases (41.3%). The most frequently removed FB was coins at the rate of 40%. Of the 211 cases left to a spontaneous course, 117 were in the intestines, 22 in the stomach, and in 72 cases localization could not be determined on conventional radiography as the FB was not opaque. In 7 cases with a bolus of food caught in the esophagus, 3 had corrosive esophagus stricture (1 case with colon transposition), 2 had operated esophagus atresia, 1 had eosinophilic esophagitis, and 1 had congenital esophagus stricture.
CONCLUSIONS: Although there can be serious outcomes, there is spontaneous expulsion in most cases. However, a significant proportion requires a timely endoscopic procedure. Attention must be paid to underlying diseases when FBs, such as a food bolus, are in the esophagus.
