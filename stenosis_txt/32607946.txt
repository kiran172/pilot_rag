Title: A method to measure the extent of myocardial ischemia and steal with SPECT myocardial blood flow quantitation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We introduced a method to measure the extent of myocardial ischemia and steal with SPECT MBF quantitation.
METHODS: Eighty-seven patients who received rest/Dipyridamole-stress 99mTc-Sestamibi (MIBI) dynamic SPECT scans and coronary angiography were included. Dynamic SPECT images were reconstructed with full physical corrections. The one-tissue kinetic model was utilized to quantify K1 and further converted to MBF with required corrections. Rest MBF, stress MBF and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) were converted to a flow status polar map by a flow diagram. Extents of 7 flow statuses were verified their cutoff points for detecting stenoses. The diagnostic performance (DP) was compared to that of MFR.
RESULTS: Cutoff point of the extent to detect ≥ 50% stenosis was 3.01% for ischemia-steal status and 20.3% for the combined status of ischemia-steal and moderate. Using these criteria, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy to detect ≥ 50% stenosis were (80%, 75%, 79%) and (86%, 68%, 80%) for ≥ 70% stenosis. The DP was superior to that of MFR < 2.0 criterion (≥ 50%: 70%, 63%, 69%; ≥ 70%: 73%, 61%, 69%) (all p < 0.015).
CONCLUSION: SPECT MBF quantitation integrated with the flow diagram can measure the extent of myocardial ischemia and steal which appeared more accurate to detect angiographic stenoses than the single MFR parameter.
