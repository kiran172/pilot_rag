Title: Esophagobronchial fistula complicated by esophageal achalasia treated by per-oral endoscopic myotomy.

Abstract: A 48-year-old man who underwent balloon dilation for esophageal achalasia more than 20Â years prior developed severe dysphagia and cough during mealtimes. Endoscopic findings showed a markedly dilated esophagus with residue, narrowing of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), and a fistula in the middle thoracic esophagus. Esophagography showed narrowing of the EGJ and outflow of contrast from the esophagus to the bronchus. In addition, computed tomography showed marked esophageal dilatation and diffuse granular shading in both lungs. Based on these imaging findings, the patient was diagnosed with deterioration of esophageal achalasia and an esophagobronchial fistula (EBF) secondary to achalasia. The increased intra-esophageal pressure caused by the achalasia was suspected to have inhibited the closure of the EBF. Therefore, we believed that per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) would help treat the achalasia and simultaneously contribute to closing of the EBF. Immediately after POEM, the dysphagia and cough improved. Furthermore, the EBF was closed. 14 months after POEM, the patient did not exhibit deterioration of esophageal achalasia and EBF. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of POEM implemented in cases of esophageal achalasia complicated by EBF. Therefore, this case is worth reporting.
