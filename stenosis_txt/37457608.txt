Title: Endoscopic Glucocorticoid Injection for the Treatment of a Refractory Benign Esophageal Stenosis in a Patient With Plummer-Vinson Syndrome.

Abstract: Plummer-Vinson syndrome (PVS) or Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome is a rare clinical condition characterized by the triad of esophageal webs/stenoses, iron-deficiency anemia, and progressively worsening dysphagia. It occurs mostly in Caucasian women in the fourth to seventh decades, particularly in northern countries. Esophageal webs and stenoses can be encountered during endoscopic evaluation for the patient's complaint of dysphagia. Esophageal stenoses are characterized as simple or complex. A stenosis should be considered refractory once the patient has undergone several sequential dilatations within short intervals, optimized treatment for potential underlying causes (eosinophilic esophagitis or acid reflux), and after neuromuscular causes have been excluded. Glucocorticoid injection into a stenosis during an endoscopic dilation session has been proven to be beneficial as the initial treatment modality of refractory nonmalignant esophageal stenoses. We present a case of a 39-year-old woman with refractory esophageal stenosis in the setting of PVS which was successfully treated with serial endoscopic glucocorticoid injections while she received oral iron supplementation. To our knowledge, there are no previous cases of esophageal stenoses associated with PVS in the literature requiring endoscopic glucocorticoid injection for successful resolution.
