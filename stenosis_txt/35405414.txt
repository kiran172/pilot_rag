Title: Magnetic Compression Technique for Esophageal Anastomosis in Rats.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The magnetic compression technique (MCT) is used for the anastomosis of hollow organs by the means of suction between magnets. The MCT is useful for establishing digestive tract anastomoses in rats, for example, end-to-side small intestinal anastomosis and colonic anastomosis. We aim to determine the feasibility of MCT-based esophageal anastomosis in rats.
METHODS: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley albino rats (230-250 g) were randomly divided into an MCT group and a control group (hand-sewn esophageal anastomosis). The time required to construct the anastomosis, postoperative complications, and survival rate was compared between the two groups. At 2 wk postoperatively, the animals were sacrificed to assess the burst pressure and histological features of the anastomoses.
RESULTS: The mean anastomosis time was significantly lower for MCT (11.17 ± 1.64 min) than for the hand-sewn technique (27.42 ± 2.23 min; P < 0.001). The survival rate was slightly higher in the MCT group (91.67%) than in the control group (66.67%, P = 0.317). The magnets were discharged from the body after 8.33 ± 0.89 d (range, 7-10 d). No anastomotic leakage or stenosis occurred in the MCT group. Three rats developed anastomotic stenosis and two rats developed anastomotic leakage in the control group. The burst pressures were similar in the two groups. An histological examination showed that compared with the control group, the MCT group had better alignment of the tissue layers and less inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: The MCT is a simple and feasible technique for esophageal anastomosis in rats and has the potential for clinical application.
