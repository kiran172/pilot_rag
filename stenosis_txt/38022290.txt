Title: Concern for Increased Prevalence of Heyde's Syndrome in Patients on Hemodialysis.

Abstract: The association between aortic stenosis and increased gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations is known as Heyde's syndrome. An acquired von Willebrand deficiency mediates the connection between these two seemingly dispersed pathologies. As von Willebrand factor passes through a stenosed aorta, it is broken down and can no longer inhibit angiogenesis, leading to angiodysplasias. Heyde's syndrome can manifest with chronic, refractory anemia requiring multiple hospitalizations for symptomaticâ€¯gastrointestinal bleeding and transfusion. Hitherto, Heyde's syndrome has been considered exceptionally rare, with 1-3% of populations with aortic stenosis. However, given that 31.7% of patients with gastrointestinal angioplasty have aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations are not screened for in patients without anemia, the prevalence of Heyde's syndrome is most likely higher than currently reflected in the literature. Also, the prevalence of Heyde's syndrome in populations who are predisposed to angiodysplasias, such as those on hemodialysis, is understudied. We aim to impart a need for increased research on the prevalence of Heyde's syndrome, especially in high-risk patients. This case report presents a patient with severe Heyde's syndrome on hemodialysis, showing an unconsidered risk factor for Heyde's syndrome in need of further research.
