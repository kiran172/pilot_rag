Title: [Fluid-solid coupling model and analysis on pulse wave propagation properties of iliac artery].

Abstract: In this work, we investigated the influence of the bifurcation geometry of the iliac artery on the propagation properties of the pulse wave, and applied software to establish the straight bifurcation and curved bifurcation bi-directional fluid-solid coupling finite element analysis models based on the iliac artery, and compared and analyzed the influence of the bifurcation angle of the blood vessel on the propagation characteristics of the pulse wave. It was found that the bifurcation geometry had a significant effect on the pulse wave propagation in the iliac arteries, and the pressure and velocity pulse wave amplitudes predicted by these two models had a good agreement with that before the vessel bifurcation in a cardiac cycle. The curvilinear bifurcation model predicted the pulse wave amplitude to be lower and the pressure drop to be smaller after the bifurcation, which was more in line with the actual situation of the human body. In addition, the bifurcation point is accompanied by the stress concentration phenomenon in the vessel wall, and there is a transient increase in the velocity pulse waveform amplitude, which was consistent with the fact that the bifurcation site is prone to phenomena such as arterial stenosis and hardening. The preliminary results of this paper will provide some reference for the use of pulse waveforms in the diagnosis of arterial diseases.
