Title: The diagnostic value of echocardiography combined with serum Hcy and PCSK9 in coronary heart disease.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases. This study analyzed the diagnostic value of echocardiography combined with serum homocysteine (Hcy) and proprotein convertase subtilisin 9 (PCSK9) in CHD. Here, 108 CHD patients were selected as the study group. Additionally, 108 patients with suspected CHD excluded by coronary angiography were selected as the control group. Serum Hcy and PCSK9 levels were detected by circulating enzymatic and biochemical analysis assay. The contrast echocardiography showed that the contrast agent filling velocity (β) and the maximum number of microbubbles (A) in the study group were declined compared to the control group. Serum Hcy and PCSK9 levels in the study group were higher than those in the control group. In addition, β, A, Hcy and PCSK9 are important influencing factors of CHD. The coronary artery disease branch numbers and the degree of stenosis in CHD patients were negatively correlated with β and A values, and positively correlated with serum Hcy and PCSK9 levels. β, A combined with serum Hcy and PCSK9 levels have diagnostic value for CHD, and are significantly correlated with the severity of CHD.
