Title: Assessment of tissue mitral annular displacement in patients with coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The high incidence of coronary heart diseases requires early diagnosis to prevent complications. This study aims to assess the mean value of tissue mitral annular displacement (TMAD), using Speckle tracking echocardiography (2D STE) in patients with coronary artery stenosis.
METHODS: 149 patients aged 50 to 76 years were included in this cross-sectional study who were admitted with primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to the emergency department. In all patients, the TMAD data were measured using 2D speckle tracking technology.
RESULTS: 149 patients with a mean age of 61.83 ± 7.14 years old were studied. Regarding the involved coronary artery as left anterior descending (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), or left circumflex artery (LCX), the TMAD data was reduced significantly (P < 0.001) in the relevant walls [base of anterior and anteroseptum (4.46 ± 3.53 mm), base of inferior and inferoseptum (4.91 ± 3.81 mm), and base anterolateral and inferolateral walls (5.53 ± 3.827 mm), respectively.] TMAD in anterior, inferior, and lateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were 2.64 ± 0.870, 4.78 ± 3.8, and 2.80 ± 0.83 mm, respectively which were significantly reduced compared to the non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (P < 0.001). TMAD in different LV function categories was only reduced in those with LAD lesion and with severe LV systolic dysfunction (2.47 ± 0.834 mm, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The current study describes a significant relationship between TMAD and left ventricular function, ACS type, and the culprit coronary artery. In different types of ACS, the TMAD value was worse in the subgroups of STEMI and in the walls affected by the stenosed coronary artery. This method might be helpful in defining the culprit coronary artery.
