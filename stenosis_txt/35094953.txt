Title: Dramatic improvement in innominate artery compression syndrome with only postural changes in a bedridden elderly patient.

Abstract: We present the case of a bedridden elderly patient who demonstrated dramatic improvement in innominate artery compression syndrome with postural changes alone. A 94-year-old woman presented with dyspnea. Physical findings revealed stridor in the right-sided decubitus position. Her symptoms did not improve with conventional asthma treatment. Plain computed tomography revealed tracheal compression by the bent innominate artery. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography with postural changes altered the compression sites of the organs, resolving the tracheal stenosis. The number of similar bedridden elderly patients will increase in an aging society. We report this case to aid physicians in managing such patients.
