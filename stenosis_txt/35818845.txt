Title: A Case of Traumatic Nasal Valve Stenosis Successfully Treated with Open Rhinoplasty and Z-Plasty.

Abstract: External nasal deformity is common and can be treated surgically. It often occurs in conjunction with the development of the nasal septal cartilage, vomer, and vertical plate of the ethmoid bone but may be caused by trauma. Here, we present a case of external nasal deformity caused by trauma. A woman presented with nasal obstruction due to dysfunction of the nasal valve area and was referred to our department for treatment. No chronic rhinosinusitis or nasal septal deviation that causes nasal obstruction was noted at the initial examination. However, trauma-related scarring was observed in the nasal valve area, and a Cottle test yielded positive results. The patient underwent combined rhino- and Z-plasty surgery and is currently undergoing follow-up at an outpatient clinic.Although otolaryngologists generally use an endonasal approach to treat nasal obstruction, it is important to perform an appropriate evaluation of the external nose and to collaborate with a plastic surgeon, as necessary.
