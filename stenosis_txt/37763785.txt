Title: A Novel Score to Predict One-Year Mortality after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, Naples Prognostic Score.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a widespread valvular disease in developed countries, primarily among the elderly. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a viable alternative to aortic valve surgery for patients with severe AS who are deemed a high surgical risk or for whom the AS is found to be inoperable. Predicting outcomes after TAVR is essential. The Naples Prognostic Score (NPS) is a new scoring method that evaluates nutritional status and inflammation. Our study is aims to examine the relationship between the NPS and outcomes for patients receiving TAVR. Material and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 370 patients who underwent TAVR across three tertiary medical centres from March 2019 to March 2023. The patients were divided into two groups based on their NPS, namely, low (0, 1, and 2) and high (3 and 4). Our study is primarily aimed to determine the one-year mortality rate. Results: Within one year, the mortality rate for the entire group was 8.6%. Nonetheless, the low-NPS group had a rate of 5.0%, whereas the high-NPS group had a rate of 13%. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.06. Conclusions: Our results show that NPS is an independent predictor of one-year mortality in patients undergoing TAVR.
