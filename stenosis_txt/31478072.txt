Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis utilizing the next-generation fully retrievable and repositionable valve system: mid-term results from a prospective multicentre registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in bicuspid aortic valve (BiAV) stenosis using a mechanically expanded Lotus™ device. The prior experience with first-generation devices showed disappointing results mainly due to increased prevalence of aortic regurgitation (AR) that exceeded those observed in tricuspid stenosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected baseline, in-hospital, 30-day and 2-year follow-up data from a prospective, multicentre registry of patients with BiAV undergoing TAVI using Lotus™ valve. Safety and efficacy endpoints were assessed according to VARC-2 criteria. The study group comprised 24 patients. The mean age was 73.5 years and the mean EuroSCORE 2 was 4.35 ± 2.56%. MDCT analysis revealed Type 1 BiAV in 75% of patients. The mean gradient decreased from 60.1 ± 18.3 to 15 ± 6.4 mm Hg, the AVA increased from 0.6 ± 0.19 to 1.7 ± 0.21 cm2. One in-hospital death was observed secondary to aortic perforation. There was no severe AR and the rate of moderate AR equalled 9% at 30 days (n = 2). Device success was achieved in 83% and the 30-day safety endpoint was 17%. In the 2-year follow-up, the overall mortality was 12.5% and the 2-year composite clinical efficacy endpoint was met in 25% of the patients (n = 6) CONCLUSIONS: The TAVI in selected BiAV patients using the Lotus™ is feasible and characterized by encouraging valve performance and mid-term clinical outcomes.
