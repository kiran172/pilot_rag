Title: Influence of angioplasty and stenting on intracranial artery stenosis: preliminary results of high-resolution vessel wall imaging evaluation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the imaging changes on high-resolution vessel wall imaging (HR-VWI) in patients before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) contribute to predicting the clinical outcome.
METHODS: The study included 24 severe intracranial artery stenosis (SICAS) patients undergoing PTAS with Wingspan Stent between 2018 and 2020 and had a 1-year follow-up. Three HR-VWI sessions (preprocedural, early [within 24 h], and delayed postprocedural [134.7 ± 27.1 days)]) in each subject were performed with 3-Tesla MRI. We evaluated periprocedural HR-VWI changes in patients with and without recurrent cerebral ischemic symptoms (RCIS) within 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: On CE-T1WI of the patients without RCIS, a significant decrease in enhanced area was observed on early postprocedural (0.04 ± 0.02 cm2, p = 0.001) and delayed postprocedural (0.04 ± 0.02 cm2; p = 0.001) HR-VWI compared to preprocedural (0.07 ± 0.02 cm2) HR-VWI. Patients with RCIS demonstrated no significant loss of enhanced area on CE-T1WI of early postprocedural HR-VWI (p = 0.180). Significant decreases in calibrated T1 signals were observed in both presence (1.77 ± 0.70 vs. 0.79 ± 0.52; p = 0.018) and absence (1.42 ± 0.62 vs. 0.83 ± 0.40; p = 0.001) of RCIS in early postprocedural HR-VWI.
CONCLUSION: The preliminary results showed the presence of reduced contrast enhancement immediately after PTAS may indicate less recurrent stroke events within 1 year. Further studies are necessary to confirm the phenomena in a longer observation period.
KEY POINTS: • Early postprocedural high-resolution vessel imaging (HR-VWI) within 24 h can effectively predict a 1-year outcome following intracranial stenting. • For stenotic lesions after stenting without reduced contrast enhancement on HR-VWI within 24 h may need closer clinical surveillance for potentially higher risk of stroke events within 1 year.
