Abstract: Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease that involves the aorta and its primary branch arteries. It is characterized by wall thickening,stenosis or aneurysm formation of involved arteries,leading to ischemia of related organs. The clinical diagnosis and treatment of TAK is challenging. In order to further improve the level of diagnosis and treatment of TAK in China and standardize the diagnosis and treatment of TAK, a clinical practice guidelines based on evidence-based medicine evidence was developed under the leadership of the National Clinical Medical Research Center for Dermatologic and Immunologic Diseases. Eleven recommendations for 11 clinical questions problems that are important to the diagnosis and treatment of TAK were developed based on the latest research evidence and expert opinions, combined with real clinical practice in China.
