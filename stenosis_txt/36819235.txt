Title: Predictors of hyperperfusion syndrome after stent implantation in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) is a serious complication after stent implantation in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). This study aims to explore the predictive value of preprocedural computed tomography perfusion (CTP) for HPS after intracranial stenting.
METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study we collected data from consecutive patients from June 2012 to September 2019 who underwent stent implantation due to severe symptomatic ICAS. Patients who underwent CTP before the procedure were enrolled. CTP was postprocessed using the automated RAPID software to assess the preoperative cerebral perfusion. According to the presence or absence of HPS, the patients were classified into two groups: the HPS group and the non-HPS group. The baseline data, lesion characteristics, and preoperative CTP parameters between the two groups were compared. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal predictor of HPS.
RESULTS: Among the 170 eligible patients, 6 patients (3.53%) had HPS, including 3 who presented with intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs), 1 who had dysphoria, 1 who had delirium, and 1 who had a headache. There were no significant differences in baseline and lesion characteristics between the HPS and non-HPS groups. Compared with the non-HPS group, the HPS group had a significantly higher volume of time-to-maximum (T<sub>max</sub>) &gt;4 s (429.5 vs. 93 mL; P=0.006) and T<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s (200 vs. 0 mL; P=0.003). The optimal volume threshold for maximizing sensitivity in predicting HPS was 65.5 mL with T<sub>max</sub> &gt;4 s [area under the curve (AUC), 0.832; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.650 to 1.000; P=0.006].
CONCLUSIONS: T<sub>max</sub> &gt;4 s volume may be a predictor of HPS after stent implantation in symptomatic ICAS. Further prospective studies should be conducted to confirm our conclusion.
