Title: Stroke without cerebral arteriopathy in sickle cell disease children: causes and treatment.

Abstract: Cerebral arteriopathy (CA) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is classically described as chronic stenosis of arteries in the anterior brain circulation, leading to ischemic stroke. Some studies have, however, reported strokes in children with SCD but without CA. In order to better understand the etiology and risk factors of these strokes, we retrospectively analyzed ischemic strokes occurring in a large cohort of children over a 13-year period. Between 2007 and 2020, 25 of 1,500 children with SCD had an ischemic stroke in our center. Among them, 13 (52%) had CA, described as anatomical arterial stenosis, while 12 (48%) did not. Patients with stroke without CA were older than patients with stroke attributed to SCD-CA (9.0 years old vs. 3.6 years old; P=0.008), and more frequently had SC genotype (25% vs. 0%, respectively). Their strokes more frequently involved the posterior circulation, with cerebellar involvement in 42%. Retained stroke etiologies in patients without typical SCD-related CA were reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, cerebral fat embolism, arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism, hyperviscosity, vasculitis in a context of infectious meningo-encephalitis, and severe hemodynamic failure. No recurrence was observed in the 24 months following stroke, even though 67% of the patients in this group were no longer receiving exchange transfusions. In conclusion, in a cohort of pediatric SCD patients with an efficient stroke screening strategy, half of the ischemic strokes that occurred were related to causes other than CA. They affected a different population of SCD children and systematic long-term transfusion programs may not be necessary in these cases.
