Title: Association between Serum Phosphate Levels and the Development of Aortic Stenosis in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis.

Abstract: We aimed to investigate the factors associated with the development of aortic stenosis (AS) in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD), and to elucidate the prognosis of HD patients with AS. Patients on HD that had also undergone echocardiography at Nagasaki Renal Center between July 2011 and June 2012 were included. Patients with AS at the time of inclusion were excluded. The diagnosis of AS was based on an annual routine or additional echocardiography. The patients were followed up until June 2021. The association between patient background and AS was also evaluated. Of the 302 patients (mean age, 67.4 Â± 13.3 years; male, 58%; median dialysis history, 4.7 years), 60 developed AS and 10 underwent aortic valve replacement. A Cox proportional hazards model revealed that age (hazard ratio (HR), 1.07; 95% confidential interval (CI), 1.04-1.10; p &lt; 0.001) and serum phosphate levels (HR, 1.40; 95%CI, 1.16-1.67, p &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for developing AS. Incidentally, there was no significant mortality difference between patients with AS and those without (p = 0.53). Serum phosphate levels are a risk factor for developing AS and should be controlled. Annual echocardiography may contribute to the early detection of AS and improves the prognosis of patients undergoing HD.
