Title: The Association Between Angiographically Derived Radial Wall Strain and the Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The radial wall strain (RWS) is a novel angiography-based method to assess the biomechanical property of the coronary artery and whether it can predict future acute myocardial infarction (AMI) events remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association between angiography-derived RWS and future AMI events in mild to intermediate lesions.
METHODS: We performed a matched case-control analysis nested in a retrospective cohort of patients who had received prior angiography (the index procedure) at least 1 month before and were hospitalized again for repeat angiography. Patients with at least 1 de novo mild to intermediate lesion identified at the index procedure and eligible for RWS analysis were enrolled. The study identified cases with target lesion-related AMI diagnosed at the repeat angiography, matching each case to 3 control subjects without AMI.
RESULTS: Altogether 44 patients with lesion-related AMI and 132 matched controls were enrolled. The median diameter stenosis of the overall interrogated lesions was 34.0%. The baseline maximum RWS (RWS<sub>max</sub>), which was defined as the highest RWS in the stenotic segment, was significantly higher in lesions responsible for AMI than those that remained quiescent (median 13% vs 10%; P &lt; 0.001). RWS<sub>max</sub> was predictive of lesion-related AMI, with an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.76-0.90; P &lt; 0.001) and an optimal cutoff &gt;12%. RWS<sub>max</sub> &gt;12% was found to be independently associated with subsequent AMI events with a risk ratio of 7.25 (95% CI: 3.94-13.37; P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among angiographically mild to intermediate lesions, a high-strain pattern identified by angiography-derived RWS was associated with an increased risk of AMI events.
