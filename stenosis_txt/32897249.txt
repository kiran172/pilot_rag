Title: Risk factors for cardiac, obstetric, and neonatal complications in patients with heart disease during pregnancy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Heart disease in pregnancy can cause clinical deterioration and maternal-fetal death. It is essential to evaluate risk factors related to complications.
METHODOLOGY: This was a observational, analytical retrospective cohort study with a non-probabilistic convenience sample of pregnant women with congenital or acquired heart disease, corrected or not, or arrhythmias requiring urgent intervention. Patients with mild or moderate valvular regurgitation, mild valvular stenosis, patients without echocardiography or without delivery information were excluded from the study. The outcome was a composite of cardiac, obstetric, and neonatal events. Univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed with logistic regression model and discriminatory capacity with area under the curve and independent analysis of the modified World Health Organization (mWHO) risk classification (mWHO).
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients with an average age of 25 ± 6.5 years presented cardiac events in 13.5%, obstetric in 14.42%, and neonatal in 28.85%. The univariate analysis found an association with New York Heart Association functional status, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, gestational age < 27 weeks, hypoxemia, and mWHO risk. In multivariate only cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR], 2.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-6.86) and gestational age at delivery (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.67) maintain association with outcomes. The area under the curve for the mWHO risk is 0.75.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high rate of adverse events in patients with heart disease during pregnancy. Gestational age and cesarean delivery behaved as predictors of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes. The mWHO risk classification had an acceptable prediction of adverse outcomes.
