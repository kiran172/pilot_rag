Title: Transapical Delivery of a Sapien Valve for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in an 11-Year-Old Patient with Truncus Arteriosus.

Abstract: Complex congenital heart defects may necessitate repeated surgical interventions throughout a patient's lifetime. Each subsequent procedure exposes patients to a greater cumulative risk, thus adding to the potential morbidity and mortality of the surgery. Transcatheter interventions can help mitigate the surgical risk for many defects and can delay or mitigate the need for surgery. This case report describes the rare use of a transapically delivered transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) therapy in a high-risk pediatric patient to postpone the need for surgery and potentially reduce the number of lifelong surgical interventions. The case highlights how transcatheter aortic valve therapies can be considered for non-standard, higher risk pediatric patients to postpone the need for surgical valve replacement and may serve as a paradigm shift in the care of complex patients with aortic valve pathology.
