Title: Surgical management of rectovaginal fistula after stapled transanal rectal resection for prolapsed hemorrhoids.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Rectovaginal fistula is an epithelium-lined direct communication route between the vagina and the rectum. The gold standard of fistula management is surgical treatment. Rectovaginal fistula after stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) may be challenging to treat, due to the extensive scarring, the local ischemia, and the risk of rectal stenosis. We aimed to present a case of iatrogenic rectovaginal fistula after STARR that was successfully treated with a transvaginal primary layered repair and bowel diversion.
METHODS: A 38-year-old woman was referred to our division for continuous fecal discharge through her vagina that developed a few days after she had a STARR for prolapsed hemorrhoids. Clinical examination revealed a 2.5 cm-wide direct communication between the vagina and rectum. After proper counseling, the patient was admitted to transvaginal layered repair and temporary laparoscopic bowel diversion RESULTS: No surgical complications were observed. The patient was successfully discharged home on postoperative day 3. Bowel diversion was reversed after 2 months. At the current follow-up (6 months), the patient is asymptomatic and without recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: The procedure was successful in obtaining anatomical repair and relieving symptoms. This approach represents a valid procedure for the surgical management of this severe condition.
