Title: Direct angioplasty for acute ischemic stroke due to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis-related large vessel occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial artery atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is among the causes of intracranial large artery occlusion (LVO). The optimal treatment strategy for patients with ischemic stroke due to ICAS-related LVO remains unclear. In this retrospective case series, we discussed our experience with direct angioplasty as frontline therapy for ICAS-related LVO.
METHODS: We extracted data for patients who had a known pre-existing ICAS and undergone direct angioplasty as frontline therapy for ICAS-related LVO in the anterior circulation at our institution between January 2019 and December 2019. We analysed procedural details, the degree of reperfusion, functional outcomes, and complications. Successful reperfusion was defined as a modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia (mTICI) score of 2 b - 3. Functional outcomes at 90 days were assessed using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (good outcome: mRS of 0-2).
RESULTS: We analysed data for five patients (mean age: 51.6 ± 11 years). The mean time from symptom onset to recanalization was 371 ± 38.6 min. Occlusions involved the first segment of the middle cerebral artery in four patients and the intracranial internal carotid artery in one patient. Successful reperfusion was achieved in four (80%) patients. The remaining patient (20%) underwent intracranial stenting as rescue therapy, achieving a final mTICI of 2a. No re-occlusion was observed on follow-up images. Four patients (80%) achieved good outcomes at 90 days. There were no cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, although asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was observed in one patient.
CONCLUSION: Direct angioplasty may represent an alternative treatment strategy in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to known ICAS-related LVO.
