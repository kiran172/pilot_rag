Title: Descriptive study of the clinical and myocardial status of a population with anatomopathological aortic valve amyloidosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) and transthyretin (ATTR) cardiac amyloidosis (CA) share the same clinical profiles and cardiac phenotype. Amyloid deposits have been frequently reported in aortic valves of patients with severe AS referred for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and myocardial status of patients with aortic valve amyloidosis after aortic valve surgery.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective descriptive study of 46 patients who underwent SAVR for severe AS with amyloid deposits upon histological analysis. All patients were screened for cardiac involvement. Amyloid deposits typing was successful in 35 (76%) patients and 28 (80%) were ATTR. Two (4%) had positive bone scintigraphy and among the 5 myocardial biopsies performed during surgery, 80% were positive for ATTR deposits.
CONCLUSION: ATTR is the predominant type in the presence of amyloid deposits on the aortic valve after surgery for severe AS but is only rarely accompanied by cardiac uptake on bone scintigraphy. Early stages of myocardial involvement are frequent and myocardial biopsy is more sensitive for detection of mild amyloid deposits than bone scintigraphy.
