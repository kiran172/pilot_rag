Title: Inferior Vena Cava Repair Using Diaphragm in Animal Model.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Repair and reconstruction of the vena cava with an autologous vein requires multiple incisions. Prosthetic material is linked with an increased risk of infection and thrombosis. Therefore in this study, we created an animal model of vena cava repair using the diaphragm. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and outcomes of using diaphragm for the repair and replacement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) after resection of a part of the infrarenal IVC in an animal model, as it may be encountered in trauma patients and extensive tumors of retroperitoneum.
METHODS: Five healthy dogs of both sexes were prepared. After general anesthesia and laparotomy, a 1 cm width with 4 cm length defect was arranged on anterior aspect of the infrarenal IVC, subsequently, the anterior aspect of the right diaphragm with 1 cm width and 4 cm length was resected and was anastomosed to cover the defect of the IVC as a patch graft, with the pleural side of the diaphragm facing the luminal aspect and the peritoneal side on the outside. The observation period was 6 weeks.
RESULTS: All of the IVCs were macroscopically patent without thrombosis and stenosis. Pathologic assay revealed complete endothelialization of diaphragm. One dog died at the third night of operation without distinct reason.
CONCLUSIONS: The diaphragm is an accessible and safe option in the repair and reconstruction of IVC particularly when restrictions exist for the use of prosthetic material in a contaminated space of the abdomen.
