Title: Demographics, Procedural Characteristics, and Clinical Outcomes When Cardiogenic Shock Precedes TAVR in the United States.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This paper details trends and outcomes in U.S. patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) who present pre-procedurally with cardiogenic shock.
BACKGROUND: Demographic, procedural characteristics, and clinical outcomes in U.S. patients undergoing TAVR after presenting with cardiogenic shock are unknown.
METHODS: The STS/ACC TVT (Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy) registry linked with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services claims data was used to identify patients between 2014 and 2017 who presented with cardiogenic shock before TAVR in comparison to a high-risk cohort that did not present with cardiogenic shock. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day procedural complications.
RESULTS: Presentations with cardiogenic shock currently represent 4.1% of the U.S. TAVR population. A total of 2,220 patients with acute cardiogenic shock undergoing TAVR (median STS 9.8) were compared with 12,851 high-risk patients (median STS 10.2). Cardiogenic shock was associated with higher 30-day mortality (19.1% vs. 4.9%) and higher rates of complications. The absence of 30-day major complications was not associated with a marked reduction in 30-day mortality, and overall procedural success rates were high. The risk of death from acute cardiogenic shock before TAVR was strongly related to the degree of shock pre-procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR appears to be a viable treatment option for patients presenting with aortic stenosis and acute cardiogenic shock. Although procedural success is high, this population remains at an elevated risk of death, which appears to be mostly driven by the degree of pre-procedural shock.
