Title: Diagnostic value of high-resolution vessel wall imaging technique in intracranial arterial stenosis and occlusion: a comparative analysis with digital subtraction angiography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diagnostic value of HR-VWI in intracranial arterial stenosis and occlusion and compare it with DSA.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical data of 59 patients with intracranial arterial stenosis in our hospital was conducted to compare the diagnostic results of the two methods for different degrees of intracranial stenosis and various morphological plaques.
RESULTS: The diagnosis of stenosis and occlusion by both methods showed no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05). Comparison of plaque morphology detected by HR-VWI with pathological examination results showed no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05); however, there was a significant difference between plaque morphology detected by DSA and pathological examination results (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, there was a significant difference between plaque morphology detected by HR-VWI and DSA (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: HR-VWI technique is comparable to DSA technique in diagnosing intracranial arterial stenosis and occlusion, but it is superior to DSA in plaque morphology diagnosis.
