Title: Concomitant Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Valve-in-Mitral Annular Calcification.

Abstract: Contemporary challenges in structural heart intervention include redo transcatheter aortic valve replacement and transcatheter mitral valve replacement in severe mitral annular calcification. We report a case of concomitant redo transcatheter aortic valve replacement and transcatheter mitral valve replacement in mitral annular calcification in a patient with radiation heart disease. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
