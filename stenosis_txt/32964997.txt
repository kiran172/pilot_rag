Title: Reduced glomerular filtration rate and prior cardiovascular event entail similar risk for coronary atherosclerotic burden.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Prior cardiovascular event and kidney dysfunction are both strong risk factors for coronary artery disease. The aim of this study is to assess coronary atherosclerotic burden in a large population of patients undergoing coronary angiography, according to prior cardiovascular event or chronic kidney disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 700 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography (CA). Serum creatinine to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was measured. Clinically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was defined by the presence of a coronary lesion resulting in a luminal stenosis >50%. For the purpose of the study, the whole population was divided into 4 subgroups according to the presence/absence of eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or prior cardiovascular event: eGFR≥60/no event (Group A), eGFR≥60/yes event (Group B), eGFR<60/no event (Group C), eGFR<60/yes event (Group D).
PATIENTS: As expected, patients in group D had the worst clinical and biochemical profile. These patients also presented the highest values of urinary albumin creatinine ratio (ACR, p<0.001) and the lowest values of eGFR (p<0.01). One-hundred-ninety-six patients had three-vessel disease. Patients who had undergone PCI procedure showed a lower eGFR as compared to patients who had not (p=0.009). Considering group A as reference, the risk of having three-vessel disease was increased in group B (OR= 2.09; 95% CI 1.37-3.19), in group C, (OR= 1.80; 95% CI 1.04-3.14), and finally in group D (OR= 3.35; 95% CI 2.01-5.58). The risk carried by group C was not significantly different from that carried by Group B: OR= 0.86; 95% CI 0.5-1.5.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, low eGFR seems to have the same excess risk of prior CV event.
