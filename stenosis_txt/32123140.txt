Title: Hemodynamic Outcome and Valve Durability Beyond Five Years After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate hemodynamic outcome, structural valve deterioration, and bioprosthetic valve failure beyond 5 years after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: Demographic, procedural, and outcome data were obtained from all patients treated with TAVR at our institution from 2006 to 2012. We included all patients with echocardiographic data at baseline and with a follow-up echocardiography more than 5 years after TAVR. Standardized definitions were used to assess durability of transcatheter aortic valves.
RESULTS: A total of 452 patients were treated with apical or transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) from 2006-2012, and 103 (23%) patients were still alive more than 5 years post TAVI. Mean duration of follow-up was 7.0 ± 0.9 years, with a maximum duration of 9.8 years. Seventy-nine of the 103 patients (76.7%) underwent follow-up echocardiography. Mean aortic gradient decreased from 51.8 ± 14.3 mm Hg before TAVR to 11.7 ± 5.8 mm Hg after TAVR (P<.001), and remained stable at 10.6 ± 6.3 mm Hg during late follow-up (P=.26). Bioprosthetic valve failure occurred in 3 patients (3.8%); two of these patients required reintervention. Seven patients (8.9%) had moderate structural valve deterioration, and 1 patient (1.3%) had severe structural valve deterioration.
CONCLUSION: TAVR with self-expanding and balloon-expandable valves appears to be a long-lasting treatment strategy for severe aortic stenosis with excellent long-term hemodynamic function and very low incidence of structural valve deterioration and bioprosthetic valve failure.
