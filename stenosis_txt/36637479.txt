Title: CTA-determined tricuspid annular dilatation is associated with persistence of tricuspid regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIM: The aim of this study was to analyse the predictive value of CTA-determined tricuspid annular dilatation (TAD) on the persistence of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) and concomitant at least moderate TR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: 288 consecutive patients treated with TAVR due to severe AS and concomitant at least moderate TR at baseline were included in the analysis. As cutoff for TAD, the median value of the CTA-determined, to the body surface area-normalized tricuspid annulus diameter (25.2 mm/m2) was used. TAD had no impact on procedural characteristics or outcomes, including procedural death and technical or device failure according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 criteria. However, the primary outcome of the study-TR persistence after TAVR was significantly more frequent in patients with compared to patients without TAD (odds ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval 1.33-5.16, p &lt; 0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for clinical and echocardiographic baseline characteristics, which are known to influence aetiology or severity of TR, confirmed TAD as an independent predictor of TR persistence after TAVR (adjusted odds ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.20-4.46, p = 0.01). Moreover, 2 year all-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients with persistence or without change of TR compared to patients with TR improvement (log-rank p &lt; 0.01).
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TAVR for severe AS and concomitant at least moderate TR at baseline, TAD is a predictor of TR persistence, which is associated with increased 2-year all-cause mortality.
