Title: Chronic abdominal aortic occlusive disease related to antiphospholipid syndrome: a rare presentation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Chronic abdominal aortic occlusive disease (CAAOD) is an uncommon manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), impacting cardiovascular health and peripheral arterial circulation. We investigated CAAOD in antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)-positive patients, aimed to offer comprehensive clinical and radiological insights.
METHODS: aPL-positive patients with arterial thrombotic events were categorised into CAAOD and non-CAAOD. Extensive data, including clinical features, radiological images and outcomes, were analysed.
RESULTS: This case-control study involved 114 patients who experienced arterial events from 2013 to 2021, revealing 12 patients with abdominal aortic stenosis or occlusion. The CAAOD group, predominantly young (36.67Â±11.83) males (75.00%), exhibited significantly higher rates of critical smoking habits (66.67% vs 25.49%, p=0.006) and hyperhomocysteinaemia (66.67% vs 31.37%, p=0.026). Radiological findings showed long-segment infrarenal aorta stenosis in CAAOD, occasionally involving renal and common iliac arteries. The lesions presented varying degrees of stenosis, including smooth lumen narrow and total vascular occlusion. Treatment modalities typically involved interventions or surgery, complementing anticoagulation therapy.
CONCLUSION: The study shed light on the rare occurrence of CAAOD in APS, highlighting the roles of smoking and hyperhomocysteinaemia as notable risk factors. These findings emphasised the significance of early diagnosis and management of CAAOD.
