Title: Aortic Annular Enlargement with Modified Y-Incision Technique Devised from Preoperative Three-Dimensional Computed Tomography.

Abstract: The Y-incision technique introduced by Dr. Bo Yang in 2021 is a very innovative technique that can enlarge the aortic annulus by two or more sizes without violating the left atrium or mitral valve. However, we encountered a case in which the left coronary artery ostium was located close to the left-non commissure. Therefore, we considered it would be dangerous to expand the incision to the left coronary annulus. We therefore devised a new technique that enlarges only the noncoronary annulus in an "L" fashion instead of a "Y" fashion. In performing this surgery, preoperative three-dimensional images were useful for understanding the anatomy when planning the aortic annular enlargement procedure. The L-incision technique can be a useful alternative method of aortic annulus enlargement.
