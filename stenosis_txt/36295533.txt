Title: Remimazolam for General Anesthesia in a Patient with Severe Aortic Stenosis Undergoing High-Risk Surgery: A Case Report.

Abstract: High-risk surgeries for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) are challenging for anesthesiologists and can result in hemodynamic deterioration and even mortality. We describe a case in which remimazolam was used to induce and maintain general anesthesia for a high-risk, noncardiac surgery accompanied by ongoing bleeding. An 86-year-old man with severe AS was scheduled to undergo proximal gastrectomy due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and severe anemia. Remimazolam, a novel, ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, was administered along with remifentanil for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Throughout the anesthetic process, the patient's cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance were well preserved without any vasopressor support. Remimazolam seems to have possible effectiveness as a relatively safe agent for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in patients with severe AS who are undergoing high-risk, noncardiac surgery with bleeding.
