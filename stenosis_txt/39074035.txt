Title: Prevalence of stricturing, penetrating complications and extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease detected on cross-sectional imaging in a tertiary care setting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stricturing, penetrating complications and extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) are frequent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is limited data on the prevalence of these complications in patients with IBD. Therefore, we aimed to assess the burden of these complications detected incidentally on cross-sectional imaging.
METHODS: A retrospective study conducted at two tertiary care centers in London, Ontario. Patients (≥18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of IBD who underwent CT enterography (CTE) or MR enterography (MRE) between 1 Jan 2010 and 31 Dec 2018 were included. Categorical variables were reported as proportions and the mean and standard deviations were reported for continuous variables.
RESULTS: A total of 615 imaging tests (MRE: 67.3% [414/615]) were performed in 557 IBD patients (CD: 91.4% [509/557], UC: 8.6% [48/557]). 38.2% (213/557) of patients were male, with mean age of 45.6 years (±15.8), and median disease duration of 11.0 years (±12.5). Among patients with CD, 33.2% (169/509) had strictures, with 7.8% having two or more strictures and 66.3% considered inflammatory. A fistula was reported in 10.6% (54/509), the most common being perianal fistula (27.8% [15/54]), followed by enterocutaneous fistula (16.8% [9/54]), and enteroenteric fistula (16.8% [9/54]). Additionally, 7.4% (41/557) of patients with IBD were found to have an EIM on cross-sectional imaging, with the most prevalent EIM being cholelithiasis (63.4% [26/41]), followed by sacroiliitis (24.4% [10/41]), primary sclerosing cholangitis (4.8% [2/41]) and nephrolithiasis (4.8% [2/41]).
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 40% of patients with CD undergoing cross-sectional imaging had evidence of a stricture or fistulizing disease, with 7% of patients with IBD having a detectable EIM. These results highlight the burden of disease and the need for specific therapies for these disease phenotypes.
