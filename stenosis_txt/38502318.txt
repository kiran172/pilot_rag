Title: Quality of epicardial adipose tissue predicts major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) have been shown to be associated with several heart disease, including coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure (HF). It is reported that the quality of EAT, represented by fat attenuation determined using computed tomography (CT) imaging, can detect the histologically-assessed remodeled EAT. We tested the hypothesis that quality of EAT would predict major adverse cerebral and cardiovascular events (MACCE) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). A total of 125 consecutive severe AS patients who underwent TAVI were enrolled (39 male, mean 85.4 ± 4.0 years). Using CT imaging before TAVI, we measured the average CT fat attenuation of EAT (EAT attenuation) and investigated the association with MACCE. During the mean follow up period of 567 ± 371 days, 21 cases of MACCE were observed. Patients with MACCE had greater levels of EAT attenuation compared to those without (- 74 ± 3.7 Hounsfield Units (HU) vs - 77 ± 5.5 HU, p = 0.010). Based on the ROC curves, the high EAT attenuation was defined as > - 74.3 HU. According to this cut-off index, 44 patients were classified into the high EAT attenuation group (28 female, mean age 87 ± 3.6 years), whereas 81 patients were classified into the low EAT attenuation group (13 female, 85 ± 4.1 years). Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated that the patients in the high EAT attenuation group showed greater prevalence of MACCE (log-rank 6.64, p = 0.010). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that EAT attenuation and Logistic EuroSCORE were independently associated with the incidence of MACCE. Our results suggest that quality of EAT, assessed by EAT attenuation detected by CT imaging, can predict the cerebral and cardiovascular events after TAVI in patients with AS.
