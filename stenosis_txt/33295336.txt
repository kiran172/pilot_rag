Title: [Coronary wire entrapment and unintended extraction of a just deployed stent].

Abstract: A 53-year-old male was admitted to our department for unstable angina. Coronary angiography showed a subocclusive stenosis in the ostial-proximal tract of an intermediate branch in the context of a left dominance system. We proceeded with an ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention considering this intermediate branch lesion in the setting of a bifurcation (Medina 0,0,1), where the proximal and distal main branches were represented by the left main and left anterior descending (LAD) arteries, respectively. After pre-dilation of the intermediate branch lesion, we advanced a "safety balloon" in order to protect the LAD branch and, simultaneously, we deployed a 3.0/22 mm drug-eluting stent in the intermediate branch. After in-stent post-dilation, we felt a strong resistance during the guidewire removal from the LAD indicating a wire entrapment. After a vigorous traction of the jailed guidewire, we observed the accidental removal of the just deployed stent from the guiding catheter. We re-advanced a guidewire on the LAD and a 3.25/23 mm drug-eluting stent was successfully implanted on the intermediate branch. We briefly discuss the occurred complication and some technical aspects regarding this case.
