Title: Timing and Outcomes of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Limited data exist regarding the timing of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with coronary artery disease who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aimed to investigate clinical outcomes of patients who underwent TAVI and planned PCI according to the timing of PCI in relation to the TAVI. Consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI with planned PCI between January 2013 and November 2017 were included. Patients were divided according to the timing of PCI. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization, and stroke. Among 1,756 patients who underwent TAVI, 258 patients underwent planned PCI either before TAVI (n = 143, 55.4%), concomitantly with TAVI (n = 77, 29.8%), or after TAVI (n = 38, 14.7%). All patients in the post-TAVI PCI group were treated using balloon-expandable valves, and neither hemodynamic instability during TAVI nor PCI-related complications were observed. In a multivariable analysis, the timing of PCI was not associated with 2-year major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events rate (concomitant vs pre-TAVI, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52 to 1.66; p = 0.79; post- vs pre-TAVI, HR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.16; p = 0.10). In conclusion, there were no significant differences in terms of mid-term outcomes among pre-TAVI, concomitant, and post-TAVI PCI groups when the timing of PCI was carefully selected by heart team.
