Title: Drug-coated Balloons in the Neurovascular Setting: A Comprehensive, Systematic Review of Current Use and Indications.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons (DCB) are an established tool in the prevention and treatment of coronary and peripheral artery restenosis. The underlying effects of restenosis resemble those in the neurovascular field, yet data on the use of DCB in cervical and intracranial arteries is rare.
METHODS: Medline, and international and major national guidelines and recommendations were systematically searched for data addressing the use of DCB in the neurovascular setting.
RESULTS: Of the 1448 relevant records found in Medline, 166 publications were considered for this review.
CONCLUSIONS: Data on the use of DCB in the neurovascular setting show a possible benefit over preceding alternatives, such as self-expanding stents, and balloon-mounted or drug-eluting stents. Nonetheless, the role of DCB remains under-researched, and publications remain lacking.
