Title: A bibliometric analysis on the most-cited publications on carotid endarterectomy throughout history.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold standard surgical procedure for managing carotid stenosis due to atherosclerosis and reducing the risk of ischemic stroke. This bibliometric analysis summarizes the most-cited articles on CEA and highlights the contributing articles to today's evidence-based practice.
METHODS: A title-specific search using the Scopus database was used to perform the search. Pertinent article-based, journal-based, and author-based parameters were obtained for review.
RESULTS: A total of 6,824 articles were published between 1970 and 2020. The top 100 most-cited articles accumulated a total of 54,153 citations with an average citation count (CC) of 541, with only a 4.53% self-citation rate for all authors. The publication trends peaked between 1997 and 2010, in which two-third of the highly cited works were published. The most prolific categories with top citations are the clinical, indications, and management, in a descending order. There were 41 published Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) in the most-cited list.
CONCLUSIONS: Citation analysis on carotid endarterectomy has witnessed a marked shift in the publication trends from studying the outcome and complications to comparing carotid stenting with endarterectomy. This analysis is a good introductory article to physicians interested in this topic, as it summarizes the highly impactful articles and enlists the most-cited RCT on CEA.
