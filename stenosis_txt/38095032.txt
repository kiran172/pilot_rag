Title: [Aortic stenosis : new developments in management].

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve disease in our countries; most often of degenerative origin, its prevalence is constantly increasing due to the aging of the population. Its development is a continuum ranging from aortic sclerosis to severe aortic stenosis, the diagnosis of which is essentially based on transthoracic echocardiography, which will allow classification into subcategories. Even if today no treatment makes it possible to prevent the progression of the disease, the management has clearly evolved with an increasingly important place for new approaches to valve replacement by the percutaneous route, and an indication of management at an increasingly early stage.
