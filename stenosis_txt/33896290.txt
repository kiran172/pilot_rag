Title: The effect of complex vascular anatomy on silent new ischemic cerebral lesions in carotid artery stenting procedures (from the COMPLEX-CAS Trial).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting is a minimally invasive, durable alternative treatment option, which is an alternative to the reference method, carotid endarterectomy, for patients with carotid artery stenosis; however, silent new ischemic cerebral lesions (SNICLs) after carotid artery stenting remain as a matter of concern. Hence, we aimed to assess the effect of complex vascular anatomy on silent new ischemic cerebral lesions in carotid artery stenting procedures.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 122 patients (mean age: 69.5 ± 7.1 years, male:83) who underwent carotid artery stenting for carotid artery revascularization. The patients having symptomatic transient ischemic attack or stroke after carotid artery stenting were excluded. The presence of a new hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging without any neurological findings was considered as the SNICL. Patients were classified into two groups as DWI-positive and DWI-negative patients.
RESULTS: Among the study population, 32 patients (26.2%) had SNICLs. The DWI-positive group had a significantly higher common carotid artery (CCA)-internal carotid artery (ICA) angle, older age, more frequent history of stroke, a higher proportion of type III aortic arch, and longer fluoroscopy time than the DWI-negative group. High CCA-ICA angle was identified as one of the independent predictors of SNICL (OR (odds ratio) = 1.103 95%CI (confidence interval): (1.023-1.596); p = 0.034), and CCA-ICA angle higher than 34.5 degrees predicted SNICL with a sensitivity of 62.5% and a specificity of 62.2% (area under the curve: 0.680; 95% CI: 0.570 to 0.789; p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The higher CCA-ICA angle may predict pre-procedure SNICL risk in carotid artery stenting and may have clinical value in the management of patients with carotid artery stenosis.
