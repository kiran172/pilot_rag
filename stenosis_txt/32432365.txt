Title: Esophageal atresia: Associated anomalies, mortality, and morbidity in Jordan.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Esophageal atresia is a developmental disorder in which the upper and lower esophagus fail to connect. It has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2,500-4,500 live births and has poorer outcomes in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. This study focused on the disorder's epidemiology, morbidity, and mortality in Jordan to address the lack of data regarding esophageal atresia in this country.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study covering a 16-year period at a tertiary care academic hospital. Data were extracted from archived medical records and operative notes. All patients who had complete congenital esophageal atresia data were included. In total, the records of 55 patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the included patients, 9% were diagnosed prenatally and 47% were diagnosed with polyhydramnios. The mean gestational age was 37 weeks, the mean birthweight was 2,550 g, and 60% of patients were male. Isolated cases of esophageal atresia were reported in 58.2% of patients. There was a high rate of associated congenital anomalies (41.8%), with cardiac lesions the most common (20%), and 5.5% were syndromic. Parental consanguinity was found in 18.2% of patients. Postoperative surgical-related morbidities included stricture (18/24; 75%) and leakage (5/24; 20.8%). Fistula recurrence occurred in one patient (4.2%). The mortality rate was 12.8%.
CONCLUSION: Esophageal atresia causes a high rate of mortality and exhibits post-operative morbidities. Moreover, associated anomalies were frequently observed. A high level of the malformation was found among offspring from consanguineous marriages.
