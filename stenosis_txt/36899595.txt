Title: A new approach to calculating fiber fields in 2D vessel cross sections using conformal maps.

Abstract: An arterial vessel has three layers, namely, the intima, the media and the adventitia. Each of these layers is modeled to have two families of strain-stiffening collagen fibers that are transversely helical. In an unloaded configuration, these fibers are coiled up. In the case of a pressurized lumen, these fibers stretch and start to resist further outward expansion. As the fibers elongate, they stiffen, affecting the mechanical response. Having a mathematical model of vessel expansion is crucial in cardiovascular applications such as predicting stenosis and simulating hemodynamics. Thus, to study the mechanics of the vessel wall under loading, it is important to calculate the fiber configurations in the unloaded configuration. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new technique of using conformal maps to numerically calculate the fiber field in a general arterial cross-section. The technique relies on finding a rational approximation of the conformal map. First, points on the physical cross section are mapped to points on a reference annulus using a rational approximation of the forward conformal map. Next, we find the angular unit vectors at the mapped points, and finally a rational approximation of the inverse conformal map is used to map the angular unit vectors back to vectors on the physical cross section. We have used MATLAB software packages to achieve these goals.
