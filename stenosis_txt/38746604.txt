Title: TREATMENT OF SUBGLOTTIC STENOSIS: A SINGLE INSTITUTION EXPERIENCE.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to present experiences of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Zagreb University Hospital Center with the treatment of patients with subglottic stenosis. Subglottic stenosis is a rare congenital or acquired disorder of airway patency that is part of a wider complex of disorders known as laryngotracheal stenosis with the ultimate effect in the form of respiratory insufficiency that can be life-threatening. As an acquired condition, it is most often the result of iatrogenic damage to the larynx and trachea during invasive airway management, whether it is intubation or tracheotomy. In the case of intubation as the etiologic factor, cases of prolonged intubation were most common. Retrospective analysis of patient medical histories over a ten-year period was performed and 29 patients met the inclusion criteria. All patients were monitored for at least two years after completion of treatment. Out of a total of 29 treated patients, 20 were permanently decannulated, of which 4 have paresis of one or both vocal cords. In conclusion, there is no clear treatment protocol for patients with subglottic stenosis. The optimal modality of treatment is combined endoscopic and open surgical treatment.
