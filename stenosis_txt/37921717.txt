Title: Comprehensive Myocardial Assessment by Computed Tomography: Impact on Short-Term Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Quantification of myocardial changes in severe aortic stenosis (AS) is prognostically important. The potential for comprehensive myocardial assessment pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) by computed tomography angiography (CTA) is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate whether quantification of left ventricular (LV) extracellular volume-a marker of myocardial fibrosis-and global longitudinal strain-a marker of myocardial deformation-at baseline CTA associate with post-TAVR outcomes.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with symptomatic severe AS between January 2021 and June 2022 who underwent pre-TAVR CTA were included. Computed tomography extracellular volume (CT-ECV) was derived from septum tracing after generating the 3-dimensional CT-ECV map. Computed tomography global longitudinal strain (CT-GLS) used semi-automated feature tracking analysis. The clinical endpoint was the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among the 300 patients (80.0 ± 9.4 years of age, 45% female, median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score 2.80%), the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 58% ± 12%, the median CT-ECV was 28.5% (IQR: 26.2%-32.1%), and the median CT-GLS was -20.1% (IQR: -23.8% to -16.3%). Over a median follow-up of 16 months (IQR: 12-22 months), 38 deaths and 70 composite outcomes occurred. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, accounting for clinical and echocardiographic variables, demonstrated that CT-ECV (HR: 1.09 [95% CI: 1.02-1.16]; P = 0.008) and CT-GLS (HR: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.01-1.13]; P = 0.017) associated with the composite outcome. In combination, elevated CT-ECV and CT-GLS (above median for each) showed a stronger association with the outcome (HR: 7.14 [95% CI: 2.63-19.36]; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive myocardial quantification of CT-ECV and CT-GLS associated with post-TAVR outcomes in a contemporary low-risk cohort with mostly preserved LVEF. Whether these imaging biomarkers can be potentially used for the decision making including timing of AS intervention and post-TAVR follow-up will require integration into future clinical trials.
