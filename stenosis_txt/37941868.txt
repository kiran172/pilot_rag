Title: Takayasu Arteritis with Severe Renal Artery Stenosis and an Aberrant Renal Artery in a Child: A Case Report and Discussion.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic, idiopathic large vessel vasculitis mainly affecting the aorta and its major branches. It is one of the common causes of reno-vascular hypertension in Indian children. We report a ten-year-old boy who presented with hypertensive encephalopathy, proteinuria, and haematuria without any renal dysfunction. He was initially diagnosed to be a case of acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis, but detailed clinical examination and haemato-radiological investigations revealed Takayasu arteritis, type V (P+). He had unilateral severe renal artery stenosis along with a small kidney and an aberrant renal artery on left side. He is found to have resistant hypertension, unresponsive to multiple anti-hypertensive drugs, and had a fatal outcome. This case illustrates renal involvement in TA and the significance of four-limb blood pressure measurement in any non-obese child with hypertension. Furthermore, the possible role of aberrant renal artery in the pathogenesis of resistant hypertension is discussed.
