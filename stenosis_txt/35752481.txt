Title: Analysis of Dysfunctioning Mechanical Prostheses Excised from the Mitral Valve Position.

Abstract: Described herein are findings in 16 patients who had their dysfunctioning mechanical prostheses in the mitral valve position replaced. The mechanical prostheses had been in place from 2 to 157 months (mean 80). All but 1 patient had the mechanical prosthesis excised because of prosthetic stenosis or regurgitation or both secondary to prosthetic thrombus (despite warfarin therapy) on cloth-ring "pannus" overlaying the orifice or parabasilar detachment ("leak"). The dysfunction was the result of non-infected causes in 13 patients and to infective causes in 3. Three patients (19%) died in the early post-operative period; the other 13 patients survived >1 year. The prostheses were excised in a variety of methods by the explanting surgeons. The best procedure to excise the mechanical prosthesis appears to be mainly operator dependent.
