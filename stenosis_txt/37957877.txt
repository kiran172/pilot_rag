Title: Prenatal Ultrasound Diagnosis and Clinical Analysis of Fetal Small Bowel Obstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fetal small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a serious condition with high morbidity and mortality rates. Prenatal ultrasound is an important tool for detecting SBO, but the optimal cutoff value for intestinal diameter remains undefined.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the ultrasonic characteristics of fetal SBO and determine the optimal cutoff value for intestinal diameter to enhance prenatal ultrasound diagnosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the ultrasonic characteristics and postpartum data of 76 cases diagnosed with SBO. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to identify the optimal cutoff value for dilated intestinal diameter.
RESULTS: Among the 76 cases, 31 displayed the "double bubble sign" on ultrasound, with 20 cases identified as annular pancreas, 6 as duodenal atresia, and 5 as duodenal membranous stenosis. In 45 cases, the lesions were located in the jejunal or ileal segment and exhibited intestinal dilatation above the lesion site, including 27 cases of small bowel atresia, 7 cases of membranous jejunal stenosis, and 11 cases of small bowel volvulus. Out of the 76 cases, 9 showed no abnormalities after birth. ROC curve analysis determined optimal cutoff values of 17.5mm and 10.5mm for predicting "double bubble sign" lesions in the gastric and duodenal widths. For predicting small intestinal dilatation, the optimal cutoff values for dilated width and length of the intestinal tube were 11.5mm and 21.5mm, respectively, with high sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasonic imaging and changes in intestinal diameter provide valuable information for prenatal diagnosis and management of SBO. Establishing these cutoff values can improve the accuracy of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis for SBO.
