Title: Critical tracheal stenosis from adenoid cystic carcinoma during pregnancy: Case report.

Abstract: Malignancy during pregnancy complicates approximately 0.1% of patients. Primary tumors of the trachea comprise only 0.2% of respiratory system malignancies. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an adenocarcinoma that can originate from the seromucinous submucosal glands of the trachea and cause airway obstruction. Here we present the collaborative operative management of a Cesarean section delivery for a patient with critical airway obstruction secondary to ACC.
