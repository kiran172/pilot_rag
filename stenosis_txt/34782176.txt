Title: Voice outcomes and its impact on quality of life after open airway surgery in children.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Open airway surgery is used to treat severe grades of laryngotracheal stenosis in children. Scarring of the airway following these procedures may lead to voice impairment and impact quality of life. This study was designed to characterize vocal outcome in children submitted reconstructive airway surgery and verify how this correlates to voice related quality of life in this population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children submitted to open airway surgery that had been decannulated for a minimum of 30 days and had functional speech were invited to participate. Pediatric Voice-Related Quality-of-Life survey (PVRQoL) was applied, consensus auditory perceptive of voice (CAPE-V) protocol was used for perceptual voice evaluation and acoustic analysis was performed using Praat software.
RESULTS: Twenty children were enrolled in the study with an average age of 4 years and 8 months. Averages for PVRQoL exceeded normative values in 80% of the children. Half of the children had normal voice or mild dysphonia and half had moderate dysphonia, according to perceptual evaluation. Measures of F0, jitter and particularly shimmer were abnormal in most of the children.
CONCLUSION: Voice quality varies from normal to moderately impaired in children following reconstructive airway surgery. Voice quality impacts quality of life in the majority of cases and the degree of dysphonia does not always correlate with voice related quality of life scores.
