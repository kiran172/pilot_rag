Title: Exercise-induced vasospastic angina diagnosed with a hand grip test in the catheterization laboratory: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Exercise-induced vasospastic angina (VSA) is a relatively uncommon clinical scenario and is difficult to diagnose in the catheterization laboratory.
CASE SUMMARY: A 61-year-old Japanese man presented to our hospital with complaints of angina upon exertion in the morning. Neither a 12-lead electrocardiogram nor an echocardiogram showed any abnormal findings. Invasive coronary angiogram revealed moderate stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery. A hand grip test was performed, during which the patient experienced chest pain, and coronary angiogram showed coronary spasm at the site of organic stenosis with delayed coronary flow. Intracoronary nitrates (300â€…ug) were administered, resulting in the release of coronary spasm.
CONCLUSION: The hand grip test may serve as a useful method for diagnosing exercise-induced VSA in the catheterization laboratory.
