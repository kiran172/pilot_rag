Title: The expression of interleukin-25 increases in human coronary artery disease and is associated with the severity of coronary stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL) 25, also known as IL-17E, is an inflammatory cytokine and has been demonstrated to be closely related to cardiovascular diseases by regulating immunity and inflammation, including atherosclerosis. This study was aimed to evaluate the expression of IL-25 in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: In this study, the expression of IL-25 in normal (n=6) and atherosclerotic (n=10) human coronary arteries was detected by immunofluorescent staining. In addition, the serum IL-25, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α concentrations in stable angina pectoris (SAP, n=44), unstable angina pectoris (UAP, n=46), acute myocardial infarction (AMI, n=34), and non-CAD (control, n=36) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.
RESULTS: IL-25 was significantly increased in coronary arteries of CAD patients when compared with normal coronary arteries, with macrophages and T lymphocytes being the sources of IL-25, especially macrophages. Moreover, the serum concentrations of IL-25 were markedly elevated in CAD patients and gradually increased in SAP, UAP, and AMI groups. In addition, IL-25 levels were positively correlated with the IL-6 and TNF-α levels, and Gensini score in CAD patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that IL-25 was independently positively correlated with the occurrence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A receiver operator characteristic curve suggested that IL-25 presented a significant diagnosis value in ACS.
CONCLUSION: IL-25 is increased in the coronary arteries and serum of CAD patients and is associated with the severity of coronary stenosis and the occurrence of ACS, suggesting that IL-25 may be one of the biomarkers of ACS.
