Title: Preliminary Implantation of a Novel TAVR Device With Polymeric Leaflets for Symptomatic Calcific Aortic Disease.

Abstract: The indication for transcatheter aortic valve replacement to younger patients remains controversial. Here, we report a successful implantation of the first polymeric transcatheter aortic valve replacement device in a patient with severe calcific aortic stenosis. Compared with conventional valves, the novel valve has better durability, larger orifice area, and better morphological adaptability. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
