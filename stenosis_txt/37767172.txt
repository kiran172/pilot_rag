Title: Isolated unilateral pulmonary artery atresia with contralateral pulmonary artery branch stenosis: A "window" for intervention.

Abstract: Adult presentation of unilateral pulmonary artery atresia in association with contralateral branch pulmonary stenosis is rare. We present the case of a quadragenarian, who manifested with right ventricular failure and hemoptysis. This report discusses the diagnostic workup and therapeutic options along with a brief overview of the concerned literature.
