Title: Mass-like Lesions Causing Compression of Large Vessels in Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis.

Abstract: A 69-year-old woman with a history of otitis media with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis who had been receiving corticosteroid monotherapy presented with shortness of breath. The otitis media had been alleviated, but she had saddle nose. Chest enhanced computed tomography showed stenoses of the bronchi and large vessels surrounded by mass-like lesions in the mediastinum. These manifestations indicated an active state of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). After she was started on high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide, the mass-like lesions disappeared with improvements of the stenoses. Ameliorating mass-like lesions resulting from GPA requires therapeutic intervention using corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.
