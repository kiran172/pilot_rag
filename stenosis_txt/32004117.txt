Title: Urethrographic Evaluation of Anatomic Findings and Complications after Perineal Masculinization and Phalloplasty in Transgender Patients.

Abstract: Transgender patients seeking gender-affirming surgery are a growing population with unique health care needs. The radiologist must understand the challenges these patients face to facilitate a positive patient-physician interaction during the series of postoperative fluoroscopic evaluations. The authors present a standard two-stage surgical approach and common postoperative fluoroscopic findings after perineal masculinization and phalloplasty procedures. Perineal masculinization including urethral lengthening is performed first, followed by skin-flap-based phalloplasty. Patients undergo voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) after intravesical administration of contrast media by way of an indwelling suprapubic catheter after each stage. Retrograde urethrography plays a complementary role to supplement the limitations of VCUG after the second stage. The article reviews the expected postoperative anatomy and explains standardized terminology developed at the authors' institution. Imaging features of common and rare complications are discussed, including contained leak, stenosis, occlusion, and fistula. The successful postoperative imaging study in a transmasculine patient relies on open communication among the interdisciplinary team of specialized surgeons, radiologists, and medical providers, as well as special modifications to existing imaging techniques.
