Title: Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome in Children: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data on median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) in children are scant. It is postulated that MALS can cause chronic abdominal pain. It is unclear what percentage of children with this condition are symptomatic and what comorbidities are associated with this syndrome.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, data on consecutive patients in a single center diagnosed coincidentally with MALS during routine echocardiogram were reviewed. Symptom burden, comorbidities, and the effect of anthropometric indices on MALS were investigated. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to describe the findings and to compare variables with normal distribution.
RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2020, there were 82 children, 55 females (67%), mean age 13.9 ± 3.2 years, with MALS and complete record. Mean velocity across the stenotic area was 2.6 ± 0.4 m/s. Forty-six patients (57%) had abdominal pain. Age, gender, weight, body mass index (BMI), and Doppler velocity had no statistically significant influence on symptom occurrence. Conversely, patients with joint hypermobility and symptoms of orthostatic intolerance were more likely to have abdominal pain from MALS. Of 24 patients with joint hypermobility, 18 patients had abdominal pain (p=0.027). Thirty-eight patients with orthostatic intolerance (OI) with MALS complained of abdominal pain vs 13 patients with OI and no abdominal pain (p=<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Nearly half of patients with MALS had abdominal pain. Age, gender, weight, and the degree of stenosis had no statistically significant influence on symptom occurrence. OI, specifically postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and joint hypermobility on exam predicted a higher propensity for abdominal pain in patients with MALS.
