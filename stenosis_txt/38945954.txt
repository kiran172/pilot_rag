Title: Noncoding RNA regulates the expression of Krm1 and Dkk2 to synergistically affect aortic valve lesions.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is becoming an increasingly important global medical problem, but effective pharmacological treatments are lacking. Noncoding RNAs play a pivotal role in the progression of cardiovascular diseases, but their relationship with CAVD remains unclear. Sequencing data revealed differential expression of many noncoding RNAs in normal and calcified aortic valves, with significant differences in circHIPK3 and miR-182-5p expression. Overexpression of circHIPK3 ameliorated aortic valve lesions in a CAVD mouse model. In vitro experiments demonstrated that circHIPK3 inhibits the osteogenic response of aortic valve interstitial cells. Mechanistically, DEAD-box helicase 5 (DDX5) recruits methyltransferase 3 (METTL3) to promote the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of circHIPK3. Furthermore, m6A-modified circHIPK3 increases the stability of Kremen1 (Krm1) mRNA, and Krm1 is a negative regulator of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Additionally, miR-182-5p suppresses the expression of Dickkopf2 (Dkk2), the ligand of Krm1, and attenuates the Krm1-mediated inhibition of Wnt signaling. Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway significantly contributes to the promotion of aortic valve calcification. Our study describes the role of the Krm1-Dkk2 axis in inhibiting Wnt signaling in aortic valves and suggests that noncoding RNAs are upstream regulators of this process.
