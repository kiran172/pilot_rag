Title: Postoperative peripheral neuropathy considered to be induced by surgical stress.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most surgeons are unaware that idiopathic neuropathy, which occurs independently of mechanical injury, can present as postoperative peripheral neuropathy. The aim of this study was to reveal the presence of postoperative neuropathy considered to be induced by surgical stress and to make surgeons aware that idiopathic neuropathy can occur postoperatively.
METHODS: We conducted a survey among orthopedic surgeons regarding patients with postoperative neuropathies of unknown cause. For each case, the type of neuropathy, preceding surgery and anesthesia, patient background, clinical findings, and clinical course were investigated.
RESULTS: Seven patients were identified. The mean time from surgery to the onset of neuropathy was 9.3 days (range 1-15 days). Five of the patients fully recovered spontaneously within 1 year, while the remaining two underwent neurolysis. One patient presented with hourglass-like constrictions in the radial nerve. No inflammatory cells were found in the epineurium of the affected nerve.
CONCLUSIONS: Although it is rare, postoperative idiopathic neuropathy occurs in clinical practice, and it is crucial that surgeons recognize the existence of this neuropathy to elucidate its pathogenesis as well as to reduce the risk of litigation.
