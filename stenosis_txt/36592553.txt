Title: Low-temperature plasma radiofrequency ablation tuboplasty and myringotomy: A preliminary report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of Low-temperature plasma radiofrequency ablation (RF) tuboplasty and myringotomy for treating chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) with chronic obstructive eustachian tube dysfunction (COETD) involving hypertrophic tissue of the ET orifice.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This was a prospective study of 43 ears with COME and COETD who underwent RF tuboplasty. Outcomes included the ability to perform a Valsalva maneuver, tympanometry results, and TM status. Success was defined by an improvement in tympanogram type and Valsalva maneuver. Follow-up ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 43 ears (43 patients) were included in the study. Mucosal hypertrophy of the ET orifice was seen in 35 (81.4 %) patients, while polypoid tissue was observed in 8 (18.6 %) patients. All patients completed the 12-month follow-up, the success rate was 95.3 % (41/43) at postoperative 3 months, 39/43 (90.4 %) at postoperative 6 months, and 37/43 (86.0 %) at postoperative 12 months. No procedure-related serious adverse events were reported for any patient, and there were no cases of patulous ET. Stenosis/scar of anterior-post wall in the ET orifice occurred in two patients at 6 months postoperatively and in one patient at 12 months postoperatively, which the Valsalva maneuver was positive. Thus, no further treatment was applied for the ET orifice in 3 patients. The risk of stenosis of the ET orifice was 3/47 (6.4 %).
CONCLUSIONS: RF eustachian tuboplasty may be an effective treatment for patients with COME, COETD and hypertrophic mucosa in the ET orifice, particularly as an adjunct to balloon tuboplasty.
