Title: Laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy and round ligament bladder hitching for ureteral stenosis in parametrial deep endometriosis: Our tips for a tension-free anastomosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and the efficacy of laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy with round ligament bladder hitching.
METHODS: This is a monocentric retrospective study. Enrolled patients affected by deep endometriosis underwent laparoscopic nerve-sparing parametrectomy and monolateral ureteroneocystostomy with bladder suspension to the round ligament. Perioperative and postoperative outcomes were collected, as well as urinary and pain symptoms before and after surgery.
RESULTS: Laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy with round ligament bladder hitching was performed in nine women. The most frequent postoperative complication was post-voiding urinary retention (22.2%). No ureteral fistula or stenosis of the anastomosis was reported.
CONCLUSION: In selected cases of ureteral resection and reimplantation, performing a round ligament bladder hitching allowed us to overcome the ureteral gap. This is a safe and feasible procedure to ensure stability of the anastomosis and avoid the possible disadvantages of the "standard" psoas hitch procedure.
