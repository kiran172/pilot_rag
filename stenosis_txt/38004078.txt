Title: Differences between Lower Extremity Arterial Occlusion vs. Stenosis and Predictors of Successful Endovascular Interventions.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: In patients with peripheral artery disease, there is insufficient understanding of characteristics that predict successful revascularization of the lower extremity (LE) chronic total occlusions (CTOs) and baseline differences in demographic, clinical, and angiographic characteristics in patients with LE CTO vs. non-CTO. We aim to explore these differences and predictors of successful revascularization among CTO patients. Materials and Methods: Two vascular centers enrolled LE-CTO patients who underwent endovascular revascularization. Data on demographics, clinical, angiographic, and interventional characteristics were collected. LE non-CTO arterial stenosis patients were compared. A total of 256 patients with LE revascularization procedures were studied; among them, 120 had CTOs and 136 had LE stenosis but no CTOs. Results: Aspirin use (Odds ratio, OR: 3.43; CI 1.32-8.88; p = 0.011) was a positive predictor whereas a history of malignancy (OR: 0.27; CI 0.09-0.80; p = 0.018) was a negative predictor of successful crossing in the CTO group. The CTO group had a higher history of myocardial infarction (29.2 vs. 18.3%, p = 0.05), end-stage renal disease (19.2 vs. 9.6%, p = 0.03), and chronic limb-threatening ischemia as the reason for revascularization (64.2 vs. 22.8%, p &lt; 0.001). They were more likely to have advanced TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) stages, multi-vessel revascularization procedures, longer lesions, and urgent treatment. Conclusions: The use of aspirin is a positive predictor whereas a history of malignancy is a negative predictor for successful crossing in CTO lesions. Additionally, LE-CTO patients have a higher incidence of comorbidities, which is expected given their higher disease burden. Successful endovascular re-vascularization can be associated with baseline clinical variables.
