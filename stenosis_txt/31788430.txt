Title: Urologic trauma from vaginal dilation for congenital vaginal stenosis: A newly-described and challenging complication.

Abstract: Vaginal dilation is first line therapy for vaginal agenesis. No major urologic complications have even been described. We present the management and successful outcome of immediate repair for urethral trauma in a patient with history of congenital anomalies managed with vaginal dilation. Proper exposure is difficult, but urologic repair can be achieved with or without concomitant vaginal repair.
