Title: New Technologies in the Assessment of Carotid Stenosis: Beyond the Color-Doppler Ultrasound-High Frame Rate Vector-Flow and 3D Arterial Analysis Ultrasound.

Abstract: Atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery is the main cause of ischemic stroke, with a high incidence rate among people over 65 years. A timely and precise diagnosis can help to prevent the ischemic event and decide patient management, such as follow up, medical, or surgical treatment. Presently, diagnostic imaging techniques available include color-Doppler ultrasound, as a first evaluation technique, computed tomography angiography, which, however, uses ionizing radiation, magnetic resonance angiography, still not in widespread use, and cerebral angiography, which is an invasively procedure reserved for therapeutically purposes. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is carving out an important and emerging role which can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of an ultrasound. Modern ultrasound technologies, still not universally utilized, are opening new horizons in the arterial pathologies research field. In this paper, the technical development of various carotid artery stenosis diagnostic imaging modalities and their impact on clinical efficacy is thoroughly reviewed.
