Abstract: Coronary stenting was performed for a 76-year-old patient with acute coronary syndrome with severe stenosis of the right coronary artery. Puff rupture including cholesterol crystals was detected on nonobstructive general angioscopy. One month after intervention, continuous release of cholesterol crystals was found despite successful percutaneous coronary intervention. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
