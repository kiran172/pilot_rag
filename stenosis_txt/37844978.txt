Title: Renal artery stenosis stenting with unmasking and embolisation of a renal arteriovenous fistula.

Abstract: A man in his 70s was presented to the emergency department with uncontrollable hypertension and worsening renal function on a background of atherosclerosis-related bilateral renal artery stenosis. Following progressive deterioration in renal function and refractory hypertension, the patient was referred to interventional radiology for consideration of renal artery stenting. Following stenting of the right renal artery, a large renal arteriovenous fistula became apparent, which required emergent embolisation. Both procedures were successful, with excellent clinical and radiological responses.
