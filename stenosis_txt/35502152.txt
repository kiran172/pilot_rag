Title: Routine punctoplasty: isn't it time we preserved the integrity of the punctum?

Abstract: Punctoplasty is a common procedure in the management of punctal stenosis and was first described by Sir William Bowman in 1853. Several types of punctoplasty are described, and include 1-snip, 2-snip, triangular 3-snip, rectangular 3-snip and 4-snip procedures. The understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the punctum has greatly improved in the last decade aided by electron microscopic and molecular techniques. The use of minimally invasive modalities for primary cases is on the rise with successful preservation of the physiological functions of the punctum and canaliculus. The paper reviews the current anatomical and physiological evidence to present an alternative perspective. Given our evolving understanding, it may be time to debate the practice of performing routine punctoplasty.
