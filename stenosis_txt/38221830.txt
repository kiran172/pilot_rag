Title: Mitral-Tricuspid Regurgitation Change After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Its Effect on Mortality and Hospitalization.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are present in approximately 20-60% of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study aims to evaluate the impact of TAVI on MR and TR, pulmonary hypertension, and reverse cardiac remodeling in these patients.  Methods: Out of 240 patients who underwent TAVI, 79 who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed.
RESULTS: In our study, 46.8% (n = 37) of the patients were male. Nineteen (24.1%) patients died within two years. Before TAVI, 34 (43%) patients had moderate-to-severe MR, which decreased to 18 (22.7%) after the procedure (P < 0.05). Similarly, the number of patients with moderate-to-severe TR decreased from 26 (32.9%) before TAVI to 12 (15%) after the procedure (P < 0.05). Of the patients, 50.6% (n = 40) did not require hospitalization after the procedure, while 25 were hospitalized once, 12 twice, and 2 three times. The mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) values of the patients decreased from 44.30 ± 14.42 mmHg before the procedure to 39.09 ± 11.77 mmHg after the procedure (Z=-3.506, P < 0.001). No correlation was found between changes in MR and TR grades after TAVI and mortality or hospitalization during follow-up. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), free wall annular S' velocity, left atrial volume (LAV), or LAV index (LAVI) before and after TAVI.  Conclusion: There was a significant decrease in moderate-to-severe MR and TR after TAVI; however, this did not impact hospitalization or mortality rates. Additionally, no significant differences were observed in right ventricular systolic function or in LAV and LAVI before and after TAVI.
