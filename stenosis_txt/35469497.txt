Title: Evaluation of Remodeling of Visceral Arteries and Impact on Renal Function Post-endovascular Repair of Type B Aortic Dissection Vis-A-Vis Baseline Visceral Artery Morphology.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the remodeling of visceral arteries post-endovascular repair (TEVAR) of type B aortic dissection and to investigate interval change in renal volume and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) vis-a-vis baseline visceral artery morphology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients of type B aortic dissection who underwent TEVAR with a baseline and follow-up CT during the study period were included. Baseline morphology of visceral arteries (celiac, superior, and inferior mesenteric artery and bilateral renal artery) were classified into 7 patterns depending upon the origin of the artery (from true/false lumen) and the extension of dissection flap, while occluded vessels were categorized as pattern 8.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two branches were analyzed in 25 patients (23 males; mean age: 50.1 years) with a mean follow-up of 386 days. 51 visceral branches were arising from the true lumen without any stenosis. Of the remaining 81 branches, 48 showed favorable remodeling (P = .0001). The highest incidence of favorable remodeling was observed in arteries arising from the true lumen (pattern 2,3: 44/48; 91.6%) whereas only one thrombosed and artery arising from the false lumen each (pattern 5 and 8) showed favorable remodeling. Kidneys perfused by false lumen or occluded renal artery suffered statistically significant volume loss compared to kidneys perfused by true or both lumens (-16.5% vs .2%; P = .01); however, the change in eGFR failed to reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Visceral arteries arising from the true lumen are more likely to undergo favorable remodeling. The kidneys supplied by false lumen or by occluded renal artery suffer significantly more volume loss after TEVAR.
