Title: Long-Term Valve Durability in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: AIMS: To evaluate the long-term incidence of structural valve deterioration (SVD) in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHOD AND RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2018, 693 underwent TAVI at two centres. Four hundred and twenty-one (421) patients (mean age 83.6±6.0 yrs) survived for ≥2 years post TAVI and had at least two consecutive transthoracic echocardiographies (TTEs) with the latest TTE no less than 2 years after TAVI, and were therefore included in the analysis for SVD. Median follow-up was 4.7 (3.6-6.0) years and median echocardiography follow-up 3 (3.0-4.0) years. All-cause mortality was 30.9% (130) with a median time to death of 4.1 (3.0-5.6) years. The cumulative incidence of SVD increased from 1.7% (95% CI, 0.4-2.9) at 3 years to 3.5% (95% CI, 1.5-5.8) at 5 years and 4.7% (95% CI, 1.6-7.9) at 10 years. The overall median time to SVD was 3 (2-4) years. Twelve (12) patients demonstrated SVD stage 2, and 1 patient stage 3. No SVD required re-intervention. All other patients showed no significant changes in valve parameters over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Structural valve deterioration is an uncommon event, occurring in 5% over a total follow-up of 10 years. Most patients show stable valve parameters. However, the analysis is limited by the loss of follow-up (owing to patient mortality), which renders extrapolation of the data to a younger patient population difficult.
