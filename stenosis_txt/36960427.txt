Title: Colon capsule retention in a patient with large bowel stenosis due to diverticulosis - a case report.

Abstract: Capsule retention is a rare complication to capsule endoscopy. It is often asymptomatic and resolves itself spontaneously. In some cases, endoscopy or surgery is necessary to remove the capsule. Cases of capsule retention in the colon are not reported very often and precautions in subsequent investigations must be considered. We present a case of a 74-year-old woman who underwent colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) due to a positive fecal immunochemical test. The CCE was incomplete, and the patient was referred to conventional colonoscopy, which was complicated by perforation of the large bowel during the procedure. This lead to a CT scan showing the capsule proximal to a stenotic colon segment which was subsequently surgically removed. In patients who report lack of capsule excretion and stenosis is not verified, colonoscopy can be carried out, but with caution.
