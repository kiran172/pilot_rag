Title: Future of invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic assessment for coronary artery disease management.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease represents a global health challenge. Accurate diagnosis and evaluation of hemodynamic parameters are crucial for optimizing patient management and outcomes. Nowadays a wide range of both non-invasive and invasive methods are available to assess the hemodynamic impact of both epicardial coronary stenosis and vasomotor disorders. In fact, over the years, important developments have reshaped the nature of both invasive and non-invasive diagnostic techniques, and the future holds promises for further innovation and integration. Non-invasive techniques have progressively evolved and currently a broad spectrum of methods are available, from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with pharmacological stress and coronary computed tomography (CT) to the newer application of FFR-CT and perfusion CT. Invasive methods, on the contrary, have developed to a full-physiology approach, able not only to identify functionally significant lesions but also to evaluate microcirculation and vasospastic disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the current state-of-the-art of invasive and non-invasive hemodynamic assessment for CAD management.
