Title: Moyamoya syndrome presenting in an adult with Down syndrome: A case report with a literature review.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is an unusual occlusive cerebrovascular condition commonly seen in children, marked by stenosis of the internal carotid artery and circle of Willis, causing, cerebral ischemia. Moyamoya syndrome is a Moyamoya-like arteriopathy with risk factors including autoimmune disorders, thyroid disease, sickle cell disease, or Down syndrome. Trisomy 21 is a genetic disorder consistent with specific physical and behavioral characteristics, with intellectual impairment. We describe a rare case of Moyamoya syndrome manifesting as ischemic stroke in an adult with Down syndrome.
