Title: Sex Differences in Factors Associated With Progression of Aortic Valve Calcification in the General Population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend measurement of the aortic valve calcification (AVC) score to help differentiate between severe and nonsevere aortic stenosis, but a paucity exists in data about AVC in the general population. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of AVC progression in the general population and to identify potential sex differences in factors associated with this progression rate.
METHODS: Noncontrast cardiac computed tomography was performed in 1298 randomly selected women and men aged 65 to 74 years who participated in the DANCAVAS trial (Danish Cardiovascular Screening). Participants were invited to attend a reexamination after 4 years. The AVC score was measured at the computed tomography, and AVC progression (ΔAVC) was defined as the difference between AVC scores at baseline and follow-up. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with ΔAVC.
RESULTS: Among the 1298 invited citizens, 823 accepted to participate in the follow-up examination. The mean age at follow-up was 73 years. Men had significantly higher AVC scores at baseline (median AVC score 13 Agatston Units [AU; interquartile range, 0-94 AU] versus 1 AU [interquartile range, 0-22 AU], P&lt;0.001) and a higher ΔAVC (median 26 AU [interquartile range, 0-101 AU] versus 4 AU [interquartile range, 0-37 AU], P&lt;0.001) than women. In the fully adjusted model, the most important factor associated with ΔAVC was the baseline AVC score. However, hypertension was associated with ΔAVC in women (incidence rate ratios, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.06-2.34], P=0.024) but not in men, whereas dyslipidemia was associated with ΔAVC in men (incidence rate ratio: 1.66 [95% CI, 1.18-2.34], P=0.004) but not in women.
CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the AVC score was the most important marker of AVC progression. However, sex differences were significant; hence, dyslipidemia was associated with AVC progression only among men; hypertension with AVC progression only among women.
