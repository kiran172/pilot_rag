Title: Vascular Stents Coated with Electrospun Drug-Eluting Material: Functioning in Rabbit Iliac Artery.

Abstract: A stenting procedure aimed at blood flow restoration in stenosed arteries significantly improves the efficiency of vascular surgery. However, the current challenge is to prevent neointimal growth, which reduces the vessel lumen, in the stented segments in the long run. We tested in vivo drug-eluting coating applied by electrospinning to metal vascular stents to inhibit the overgrowth of neointimal cells via both the drug release and mechanical support of the vascular wall. The blend of polycaprolactone with human serum albumin and paclitaxel was used for stent coating by electrospinning. The drug-eluting stents (DESs) were placed using a balloon catheter to the rabbit common iliac artery for 1, 3, and 6 months. The blood flow rate was ultrasonically determined in vivo. After explantation, the stented arterial segment was visually and histologically examined. Any undesirable biological responses (rejection or hemodynamically significant stenosis) were unobservable in the experimental groups. DESs were less traumatic and induced weaker neointimal growth; over six months, the blood flow increased by 37% versus bare-metal stents, where it increased by at least double the rate. Thus, electrospun-coated DESs demonstrate considerable advantages over the bare-metal variants.
