Title: Experience with modified two stage inner preputial flap for repair of proximal hypospadias with chordee: A single institution study with intermediate follow up.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We present our modified technique of using the inner preputial flap to cover the penile shaft, while removing the subcutaneous tissue of the distal part of the flap to act similar to graft. Herein, we present our experience with modified two stage inner preputial flap for repair of proximal hypospadias with chordee.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The current study was a single-institution retrospective study between January 2016 and December 2020. Thirty-one patients with proximal hypospadias with chordee were included and underwent our modified technique. We excluded re-operative hypospadias and incomplete follow-up cases (<6 month of follow up). Patient demographics, outcomes and complications in the form of fistula formation, diverticulum, metal stenosis, stricture formation and glans dehiscence were reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 31 patients were included in the study and underwent our modified technique. The median age was 18 months (9-60) & IQR 15-25). The median follow up was 40 months. Overall, success was achieved in 24 cases (77.4%). Complications occurred in seven cases (22.6%) and included urethrocutanous fistula in three patients (9.7%), diverticulum in two patients (6.5.%), metal stenosis in one patient (3.2%) and glans dehiscence in one patient (3.2%).
CONCLUSION: Our technique provides a favourable outcome with a low complication rate for repair of proximal severe hypospadias.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case Series Study (Level IV).
