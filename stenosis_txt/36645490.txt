Title: Double-barreled IMA-M2 and STA-MCA bypass in severe stenosis of terminal internal carotid artery: three case reports.

Abstract: EC-IC bypasses have been performed to treat complex aneurysms or moyamoya disease or atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease. We report the three cases that underwent EC-IC revascularization of the IMA-M2 bypass using the radial artery graft concurrently after the STA-MCA anastomosis to prevent potential ischemic damage during the operation and augment more flow in terminal internal carotid artery stenosis. All patients experienced neither perioperative complications nor further events for a 3-month follow-up. The double-barreled IMA-M2 and STA-MCA bypass is a good option for substantial amount of EC-IC revascularization with minimizing ischemic injury and maximizing flow amount in patients with severe hemodynamic compromise.
