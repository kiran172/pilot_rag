Title: The Importance of Pan-Immune Inflammation Value (PIV) in Predicting Coronary Collateral Circulation in Stable Coronary Artery Patients.

Abstract: In this study, the correlation between pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) and coronary collateral circulation (CCC) in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) was analyzed. The study included 663 patients with CCS who underwent coronary angiography and had coronary stenosis of â‰¥95% in at least one major coronary vessel. The participants were divided into two groups: good CCC (Rentrop score 2-3) and poor CCC (Rentrop score 0-1). PIV score was calculated as monocyte x platelet x neutrophil/lymphocyte count. When the patient groups who developed good and poor CCC were compared, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P &lt; .001), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, CRP/albumin ratio (CAR) (P &lt; .001), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) (P &lt; .001), and PIV (P &lt; .001) were higher in patients with poor CCC. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, SII, NLR, CRP, CAR, and PIV were found to be independent predictors of poor CCC (P &lt; .001, for all). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that a cut-off value of 442.2 for PIV predicted poor CCC slightly better compared to other markers, with 76.8% sensitivity and 70.1% specificity (area under ROC curve = 0.808 (95% CI: 0.764-0.851), P &lt; .001). These findings suggest that PIV can be used as an independent predictor of CCC development.
