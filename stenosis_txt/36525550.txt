Title: Utility of Digital Single-operator Video Cholangioscopy for the Endoscopic Management of Biliary Complications After Liver Transplantation-A Single-center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Liver transplant recipients (LTRs) frequently develop biliary complications, and endoscopy is crucial for their subsequent management. Recently, single-operator video cholangioscopy (SOVC) with digital imaging quality was introduced. This study evaluated the utility of digital SOVC for the management of biliary complications in LTRs.
METHODS: This observational study retrospectively analyzed all LTRs undergoing digital SOVC between 2015 and 2019 at a tertiary referral center. Endpoints included the assessment of biliary strictures, performance of selective guidewire passage across biliary strictures, and diagnosis and treatment of biliary stone disease.
RESULTS: In total, 79 digital SOVCs performed in 50 LTRs were identified. Fifty-eight percent of the procedures were performed for biliary stricture assessment, and using visual signs or guided biopsies, SOVC excluded malignancy in all cases (100%). Of all the examinations, 29.1% (23/79) were performed solely because of a previous failure of conventional endoscopic methods to pass a guidewire across a biliary stricture. Using SOVC, guidewire passage was successfully performed in 73.9% of these examinations, enabling subsequent endoscopic therapy. Furthermore, biliary stones were found in 16.5% (13/79) of the examinations. In 38.5% of these cases, standard fluoroscopy failed to detect stones, which were only visualized using digital SOVC. Biliary stone treatment was successful in 92% (12/13) of the examinations. Complications occurred in 11.4% of all SOVCs. No procedure-associated mortalities were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital SOVC is effective and safe for the endoscopic management of biliary complications in LTRs and offers unique diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities that strongly impact the clinical course in selected cases.
