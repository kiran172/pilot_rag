Title: Single-incision versus conventional laparoscopic pyloromyotomy for pediatric hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of single-incision versus conventional laparoscopic pyloromyotomy in pediatrics, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify studies that compared single-incision laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (SILP) and conventional laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (CLP) for infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). Meta-analysis was used to pool and compare variables such as operative time, time to full feeding, length of hospital stay, mucosal perforation, inadequate pyloromyotomy, wound infection, incisional hernia and overall complications.
RESULTS: Among the 490 infants with HPS in the seven studies, 205 received SILP and 285 received CLP. There was significant longer time to full feeding for SILP compared with CLP. However, pooling the results for SILP and CLP revealed no significant difference in operative time, length of hospital stay and postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: SILP is a safe, feasible and effective surgical procedure for infants with HPS when compared to CLP. SILP is equivalent to CLP in terms of operative time, length of hospital stay and postoperative complications. We conclude that LS should be considered an acceptable option for HPS.
