Title: Kawasaki disease with giant aneurysm of left coronary artery and complete occlusion of right coronary artery.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile medium-vessel vasculitis affecting children. Though coronary artery aneurysm is a common complication, stenosis and occlusion are rare. Here, we report a case of Kawasaki disease with concomitant aneurysm and complete occlusion of different coronary arteries in the same patient.
