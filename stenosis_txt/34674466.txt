Title: [Efficacy of 3D printed fistula stent in the treatment of enteroatmospheric fistula].

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Objective: To investigate the efficacy of fistula stent made by 3D printing technique in the treatment of enteroatmospheric fistula. Methods: A descriptive case series study was carried out.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) patients with open abdomen; (2) patients with enteroatmospheric fistula.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) patient with two or more fistulas; (2) distal obstruction; (3) bowel stenosis over 50%. According to above criteria, 17 EAF patients admitted to the General Surgery Department of Jinling Hospital from June 2019 to January 2020 were retrospectively included in study. Based on the intestinal radiography, CT reconstruction and finger exploration, the size of fistula, the diameter of the intestinal tube and the angle of the intestinal lumen around the fistula were assessed. The 3D printing fistula stent was designed and established based on estimated data, and then placed through the fistula.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: (1) success rate of stent implantation; (2) outflow of intestinal contents after implantation; (3) tolerated exercise time; (4) receiving definite operation time for intestinal fistula; (5) time to recovery of enteral nutrition. The t-test was used to compare the outflow amount of intestinal content before and after the stent implantation and the tolerated exercise time. The changes of the outflow amount of intestinal content and tolerated exercise time were analyzed by repeated measurement ANOVA. Results: Seventeen EAF patients with open abdomen included 13 males and 4 females. All the patients successfully received intestinal fistula stent implantation. Gastrointestinal angiography 2 days after implantation showed that the digestive tract was unobstructed, and the stent was successfully kept in place until definite surgery. No stent implantation-related adverse reactions were found in patients undergoing definite intestinal fistula surgery. The average outflow amount of intestinal fluid within 7 days after implantation decreased from (702.7±198.9) ml/d to on the first day after implantation (45.8±22.4) ml/d on the 7th day(F=10.380, P&lt;0.001). The ambulatory time and exercise time of patients continued to increase after stent implantation. The average tolerated exercise time within 14 days after stent implantation increased from (9.1±3.8) min/d to (106.9±21.8) min/d (F=41.727, P&lt;0.001). Within 120 days after stent implantation, 15 patients successfully underwent definite surgery for intestinal fistula and reconstruction of abdominal wall. Patients needed a median (IQR) of 3 (2, 5) days to recover enteral nutrition. The average time from stent placement to surgery was (87.2±17.6) days. Two patients died of severe abdominal infection with multiple organ failure. Conclusion: 3D printing fistula stent can significantly and the outflow of intestinal contents and the difficulty of nursing, and help to restore enteral nutrition and rehabilitation exercise as soon as possible in EAF patients with open abdomen.
