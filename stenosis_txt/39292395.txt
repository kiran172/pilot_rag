Title: Right parasternal view in dobutamine stress echocardiography for aortic stenosis assessment.

Abstract: Dobutamine stress echocardiography is an integral part of the evaluation of aortic stenosis (AS) severity in low-gradient AS. In transthoracic echocardiography, in 20% of the patients, the highest aortic valve peak transvalvular velocity and mean gradient are achieved with continuous wave Doppler, from the suprasternal or right parasternal view. We present a case of a 79-year-old-male, with low-gradient aortic stenosis, where the highest peak aortic valve velocity and mean gradient, were consistently obtained from the right parasternal view, during all stages of a dobutamine stress echocardiogram. Use of the right parasternal view was important in avoiding overestimation of aortic valve area and underestimation of aortic valve mean gradients and therefore AS severity at rest. Furthermore, it correctly identified significant increase of aortic valve mean gradients during stress and therefore confirmed the diagnosis of severe AS. This case report highlights the importance of routinely attempting right parasternal view, in patients undergoing stress echocardiography to ensure the maximum possible aortic valve gradient is obtained.
