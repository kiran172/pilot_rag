Title: Multimodality Imaging of Intimal Sarcoma Causing Both Severe Mitral Stenosis and Mitral Regurgitation.

Abstract: Intimal sarcomas (IS) are rare, malignant, rapidly progressive mesenchymal tumors that typically occur in the tunica intima of larger vessels, and they rarely involve the heart. IS are frequently misdiagnosed during the initial clinical presentation. This case report describes an uncommonly located IS, highlighting specific findings obtained through multimodality imaging.
