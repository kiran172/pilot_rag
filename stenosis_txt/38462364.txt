Title: [Comparative study of percutaneous transfacet screw and pedicle screw in oblique lumbar interbody fusion for the treatment of single-level lumbar spinal stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To conduct a comparative study of radiological and clinical outcomes between percutaneous transfacet screw (TFS) and pedicle screw (BPS) in oblique lateral lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) for single-level lumbar spinal stenosis. Methods: A retrospective cohort study. Patients who underwent OLIF with TFS or BPS for the treatment of single-level lumbar spinal stenosis at Beijing Jishuitan Hospital from January 2019 to June 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Radiological parameters and clinical indicators were compared between the two groups. Radiological parameters included preoperative, immediate postoperative (within 5 days), and 1-year postoperative measurements of disc height and segmental lordosis angle, as well as interbody fusion status at 1 year postoperatively. Clinical indicators included operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for back pain, and leg pain before and 1 year after surgery. Results: Four male and 10 female patients with an average age of (61.0±11.2) years underwent OLIF with TFS, while 9 male and 12 female patients underwent OLIF with BPS, with a mean age of (60.9±6.7) years. There was no statistically significant difference in preoperative disc height between the TFS and BPS groups (P&gt;0.05). The immediate postoperative disc height was (12.9±2.1) mm and it was (10.4±1.7) mm at 1-year follow-up in the TFS group; in the BPS group, it was (12.9±2.1) mm immediately postoperatively and (11.9±2.1) mm at 1-year follow-up; there was statistically significant difference between the two groups at 1-year follow-up (P=0.037). The segmental lordosis angle showed no significant differences within each group or between the two groups at preoperative, immediate postoperative, or 1-year postoperative follow-up (all P&gt;0.05). At 1-year postoperative follow-up, the fusion rates was 92.9%(13/14) in the TFS group and 95.2%(20/21) in the BPS group, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). The TFS group had a significantly shorter operative time and less blood loss compared to the BPS group [(164.3±33.9) minutes vs (191.7±31.8) minutes and (74.3±46.9) ml vs (124.8±54.0) ml, respectively] (both P&lt;0.05). Both groups showed significant improvement in ODI and VAS scores at 1 year postoperatively compared to those preoperatively, but with no statistically significant difference was found between the groups (both P&gt;0.05). Conclusions: OLIF with TFS fixation can effectively restore disc height and alleviate back and leg pain in patients with single-level lumbar spinal stenosis. Compared to the OLIF with BPS procedure, OLIF with TFS has shorter operative time and less blood loss.
