Title: Prognostic value of cervical ligamentum flavum thickness as a morphological parameter to predict cervical stenosis.

Abstract: One of major causes of cervical central stenosis (CCS) is thickened change of cervical ligament flavum (CLF). The association of a morphological parameter called cervical ligament flavum thickness (CLFT) with CCS has not been reported yet. Thus, the purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship between CCS and CFJT.Data were obtained from 88 patients with CCS. A total of 87 normal controls also underwent cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (CSMRI). All subjects underwent axial T2-weighted CSMRI. Using our picture archiving and communications system, thickness of ligament flavum of the cervical spine at C6/7 level was analyzed.The mean CLFT was 1.41 ± 0.24 mm in normal subjects and 2.09 ± 0.39 mm in patients with CCS. The CCS group was found to have significantly (P < .001) higher rate of CLFT than normal subjects. ROC curves were used to assess the usefulness of CLFT as a predictor of CCS. In the CCS group, the best practical cut off-point of CLFT was 1.71 mm (sensitivity = 90.9%; specificity = 90.8%), with AUC of 0.94 (95% confidence interval: 0.90--0.98).Greater CLFT values were associated with greater possibility of CCS. Thus, treating physician should carefully examine CLFT, as it can help diagnose CCS.
