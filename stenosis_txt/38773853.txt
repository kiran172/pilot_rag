Title: The PIGTAIL paradigm for a fast and safe transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement is the preferred primary access route whenever possible. Despite advancements in expertise and delivery system profiles, complications associated with the primary femoral access still significantly affect procedural morbidity and outcomes. The current standard for accurate main access planning involves proper preprocedural evaluation guided by computed tomography. Several baseline clinical and anatomical features serve as predictors for the risk of vascular injury occurring during or after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. In this paper, we aimed at reviewing the most up-to-date knowledge of the topic for a safe transfemoral access approach according to a paradigm we have called "PIGTAIL."
