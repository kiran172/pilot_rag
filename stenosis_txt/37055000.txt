Title: Trends in mortality and postoperative complications among octogenarian patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Elderly patients represent a large portion of patients undergoing vascular surgery. This study aims to assess the contemporary frequency of octogenarians undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and to evaluate their postoperative complications and survival rates.
METHODS: The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) dataset was queried for patients who underwent elective CEA between 2012 and 2021. Patients aged >90 years were excluded, as well as emergent and combined cases. The population was divided into two age groups: <80 years and ≥80 years. Frailty scores were generated using Vascular Quality Initiative variables grouped into 11 domains historically associated with frailty. Patients with scores within the first 25th percentile, between the 25th and 50th percentile, and above the 75th percentile were categorized into low, medium, and high frailty classes, respectively. Procedural indications were defined as hard (stenosis ≥80% or ipsilateral neurologic symptoms) or soft. Primary outcomes of interest were 2-year stroke-free and 2-year overall survival comparing (i) octogenarians with nonoctogenarians and (ii) octogenarians by frailty class. Standard statistical methods were used.
RESULTS: Overall, 83,745 cases were included in this analysis. Between 2012 and 2021, a consistent proportion averaging 17% of CEA patients were octogenarians. Among this age group, the proportion of patients undergoing CEA for hard indications increased over time from 43.7% to 63.8% (P < .001). This increase was accompanied by a statistically significant increase in the combined 30-day perioperative stroke and mortality rate from 1.56% in 2012 to 2.96% in 2021 (P = .019). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significantly lower 2-year stroke-free survival among octogenarians compared with the younger group (78.1% vs 87.6%; P < .001). Similarly, there was a significantly lower 2-year overall survival among octogenarians compared with the younger group (90.5% vs 95.1%; P < .001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses showed that high frailty class was associated with increased 2-year stroke risk (hazard ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-3.17; P < .001) and 2-year mortality (hazard ratio, 2.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.71-3.47; P < .001). Repeat Kaplan-Meier analysis stratifying octogenarians by frailty class revealed that octogenarians with low frailty can have stroke-free and overall survival rates comparable with nonoctogenarians (88.2% vs 87.6% [P = .158] and 96.0% vs 95.1% [P = .151], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Chronological age should not be regarded as a contraindication for CEA. Frailty score calculation is a better predictor for postoperative outcomes and is an appropriate tool to risk stratify octogenarians, aiding in the decision between best medical treatment or intervention. The risk benefit assessment for high frailty class octogenarians is paramount because the postoperative risks may outweigh the long-term survival benefits of the prophylactic CEA.
