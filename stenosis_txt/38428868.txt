Title: Bibliometric analysis of interspinous device in treatment of lumbar degenerative diseases.

Abstract: In recent years, with the introduction of the concept of lumbar non-fusion, the interspinous device has emerged. The purpose of this study is to bibliometrically analyze the state, areas of interest, and emerging trends in the usage of interspinous devices for the treatment of lumbar degeneration disease, as well as related research fields. Between January 1, 2000 and June 14, 2023, a comprehensive collection of publications on the topic of interspinous devices in the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease (IDTLDD) was procured from the Web of Science. A bibliometric analysis and visualization were subsequently conducted, utilizing various tools including HisCite, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and bibliometrix package. This process involved the gathering of data on the country, institution, author, journal, reference, and keywords. A comprehensive analysis of 401 publications sourced from 149 journals was conducted, with 1718 authors affiliated with 1188 institutes across 240 countries/regions. Notably, the United States emerged as the leading contributor with 134 published articles on interspinous devices in the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease (33.42%). The most productive institution was Capital Medical University, with (10, 2.49%) publications. The author with the highest publication output was Block, Jon E, with 10 publications. European Spine Journal demonstrated the highest level of productivity, with a publication of (n = 39, 9.73%). The term "X-Stop" was the most frequently utilized keyword, followed by "Lumbar spinal stenosis." The study identified various topics of current interest, such as "Invasive decompression" and "Coflex." The present study provides a comprehensive survey of research trends and developments in the application of interspinous device for the treatment of lumbar degenerative diseases, including relevant research findings and collaborative efforts among authors, institutions, and countries.
