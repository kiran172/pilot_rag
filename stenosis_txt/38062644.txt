Title: Cause, severity, and efficacy of treatment for hearing loss in children with Trisomy 18: A single institution-based retrospective study.

Abstract: Trisomy 18 is a common chromosomal aberration syndrome, characterized by variable clinical manifestations, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal findings, leading to a shorter survival and severe developmental delay in survivors. However, recently, intensive therapeutic intervention has allowed for prolonging survival. In terms of otological complications, only a limited number of relevant reports have been published. To demonstrate the characteristic of hearing loss (HL) in children with Trisomy 18, we retrospectively evaluated 22 patients (44 ears) by comprehensive auditory evaluation with the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) test and temporal bone computed tomography (CT). ASSR revealed that 20 patients (91%) had bilateral moderate to profound HL, more frequent and severe than that in Trisomy 21; among 42 ears having HL, 12 ears (29%) had conductive HL, and 26 ears (62%) had mixed HL. CT scans of 38 ears revealed that 34 ears (89%) had an external and middle ear malformation. Hearing aids (HA) were fitted in 17 patients (air and bone-conduction HAs). The threshold hearing with HA was improved in all of them. Accurate otological evaluation using ASSR and CT and intervention by HAs could be a feasible choice for children with Trisomy 18.
