Title: Basivertebral nerve ablation with concurrent lumbar laminotomy.

Abstract: Lumbar radiculopathy due to impingement of nerve roots from facet hypertrophy and/or disc herniation can often coincide with vertebrogenic low back pain. This is demonstrated on MRI with foraminal stenosis and Modic changes. We examine the potential of using a combination of basivertebral nerve ablation (BVNA) and lumbar laminotomy as an alternative to traditional spinal fusion in specific patient populations. This unique combination of surgical techniques has not been previously reported in the medical literature. We report a man in his late 30s with chronic low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy, treated with BVNA and concurrent laminotomy. The patient reported progressive improvements in his mobility and pain over the next 2 years. We discuss the advantages of using this technique for lumbar radiculopathy and Modic changes compared with conventional surgical modalities.
