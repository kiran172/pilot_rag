Title: A rare case of surgically managed multiple congenital thoraco-lumbar and lumbar block vertebrae with kypho-scoliosis and adjacent segment disease with myelopathy in a young female.

Abstract: Spinal block vertebrae is a rare condition reported in 0.25% of South Asian population. This condition may not only result in deformity of lower back but also alter the bio-mechanics of spine leading to adjacent level degeneration and spinal canal stenosis. There is little literature evidence on surgical management of such a condition. Here we report a case of multiple congenital thoraco-lumbar and lumbar block vertebrae with lumbar kypho-scoliosis, adjacent segment disease and myelopathy in a young Asian female. She was operated with minimal possible instrumentation and decompression. Patient is pain free now and is able to walk without support, one year following the primary treatment.
