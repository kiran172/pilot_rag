Title: Gastric Explosion While Using Electric Cautery During Gastrojejunostomy: A Case Report.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal gases become combustible when several gases reach a certain concentration. This occurs in situations where the gastrointestinal tract is obstructed for a certain amount of time. Hence, we present this case of a gastric explosion in a patient while performing a gastrojejunostomy. The reason underlying this combustion involved concomitant chronic pyloric stenosis. Operative procedures should include this information to enhance the safety of the patient and the surgical team.
