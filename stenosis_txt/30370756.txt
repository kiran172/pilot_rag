Title: Longer bridging stent-grafts in iliac branch endografting does not worsen outcome and expands its applicability, even in concomitant diseased hypogastric arteries.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The iliac side branch device (IBD) is a valid method for the treatment of abdominal aorto-iliac aneurysms. However there is still a lack of evidence regarding the optimal length of the bridging stent graft (BSG) since aneurysmal degeneration of the hypogastric artery (HA) is an exclusion criterion. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of longer BSG compared to the widely used 38mm stent-grafts in terms of reintervention rate and primary patency.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed our prospectively collected database of all patients who underwent an endovascular aneurysm repair using an IBD in our center between April 2005 and May 2015. The used BSGs were divided into 2 groups. In group A, the BSG was â‰¤38 mm, and group B>38 mm. The primary endpoint was BSG-related events, including stenosis, occlusion or endoleak. Secondary endpoints were technical success, primary patency and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: Two hundred sixty IBDs were implanted in 215 consecutive patients. Ninetyseven (37%) in group A and 163 (63%) in group B. The technical success rate was 100%. The 30-day mortality was 1% (N.=1) and 1.2% (N.=2) respectively for group A and B (P=0.8). The freedom from BSG-related events amounted to 84% at 60 months for the total cohort. The comparison between the two groups shows no significant difference, while a slight favorable trend for group B (75% vs. 91% at 60 months, P=0.081) was observed. No differences were found as to primary patency (96% and 99% at 60 months respectively for group A and B, P=0.237).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of longer stent-grafts (>38 mm) seems not to affect the performance of BSG even in the long run, expanding the indication for IBD also for aneurysms of the hypogastric artery.
