Title: [Effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors on functional activity of the spinal cord and nerve roots in patients with degenerative lumbar spine diseases].

Abstract: UNLABELLED: High neuroprotective activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in patients with vascular diseases of the brain and spinal cord has been confirmed.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors on functional activity of the spinal cord and nerve roots in patients with degenerative lumbar spine diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was performed. We evaluated clinical and radiological parameters (gender, age of patients, type of antihypertensive drug, concomitant diseases, ODI (6) and SF-36 (7) scores of patient quality of life), functional recovery, increase of signal intensity and its area in T2WIs, localization and maximum spinal canal stenosis, as well as maximum spinal cord and nerve root compression.
RESULTS: The study included 117 medical records of respondents (88 men and 29 women aged 56.9Â±13.2 years) who underwent lumbar spine surgery for degenerative diseases. Arterial hypertension was verified in 68 (58.1%) patients, diabetes mellitus in 22 (18.8%) respondents. Age (p=0.002), diabetes mellitus (p=0.007), arterial hypertension (p=0.015) and antihypertensive therapy (p=0.023) were significantly associated with worse clinical and neurological status of patients. Binary logistic regression model demonstrated that only arterial hypertension was significantly associated with low preoperative quality of life (p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: Intake of AT II-1 receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for arterial hypertension is a significant predictor of decrease in signal intensity of the spinal cord and its roots according to T2WIs.
