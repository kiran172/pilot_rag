Title: Preemptive angioplasty for contralateral leg stenosis following EXCLUDER Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis implantation.

Abstract: The GORE EXCLUDER Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis (IBE) device is designed to seal off a common iliac artery (CIA) aneurysm, preserving the internal iliac artery during endovascular aortic repair. We report the case of an 84-year-old man with isolated saccular right CIA aneurysm (35 mm) and a relatively small terminal aorta (24 mm). The IBE device was successfully placed, and intraoperative angiography revealed no leakage or delay. However, postoperative computed tomography revealed marked compression of the contralateral leg by a bridging component. Although his ankle-brachial index was preserved, its acute occlusion was judged highly possible; we decided to perform preemptive angioplasty. The angiography revealed the stenosis only in the left anterior oblique view, and angioplasty was uneventfully performed. The leg was successfully patent at 1-year follow-up. When compression by IBE and bridging component in the terminal aorta is expected, caution should be preserved at intraoperative angiography following the device deployment.
