Title: Lymphangiomatosis presented with melena and chylous ascites: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Lymphangioma, a rare benign tumor of the lymphatic system, is called lymphangiomatosis when it involves >1 organ, which is more rarely complicated with thoracic obstruction, the relationship between them remains unclear. With the development of enteroscopy, clinicians know more about small intestinal lymphangioma and attempt to treat it through enteroscopic injection sclerotherapy(EIS).
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old male firstly manifested with gastrointestinal bleeding after a gastric perforation, who was diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis by balloon-assisted enteroscopy and abdomen CT showing >1 organ with multiple cysts besides the small intestine. The patient received an EIS, then the melena disappeared. Surprisingly he came back because of refractory ascites confirmed to be chylous by chemical tests 7 months later.
DIAGNOSIS: Lymphangiography could not determine the location of lymphatic leakage, Ultrasonography showed stenosis of the left cervical part of the thoracic duct.
INTERVENTION: On the condition that medical treatment is ineffective, thoracic duct exploration and lysis of fibrous adhesion were performed.
OUTCOMES: Ascites significantly reduced at last.
LESSONS: Lymphangiomatosis is the malformation of the lymphatic system involving multiple organs, it has a possibility to be associated with thoracic obstruction. Capsule endoscopy and enteroscopy are effective methods to diagnose small intestinal lymphangioma, and EIS is an effective therapy.
