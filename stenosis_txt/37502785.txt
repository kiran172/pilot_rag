Title: Carotid Artery Stenting for Carotid Arterial Fibromuscular Dysplasia Evaluated Vascular Wall Structure Using Optical Coherence Tomography: A Case Report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is often diagnosed based on angiography. However, it is difficult to distinguish from vasculitis by angiography. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the detailed intravascular findings of lesions in FMD using optical coherence tomography (OCT).
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 30-year-old woman with left carotid artery stenosis. The lesion was diagnosed with a suspected case of FMD by MRA, and gradually progressed over the course of 7 years. Therefore, we underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS) using OCT, and good dilatation of the lesion was obtained.
CONCLUSION: OCT evaluation during CAS allowed for a definitive diagnosis of FMD because the OCT images revealed a detailed finding of the three layers of the carotid artery.
