Title: Recent improvement in operative techniques lead to lower pacemaker rate after Perceval implant.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to compare pacemaker rate usage following two different operating techniques for implanting the Perceval aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we studied patients with isolated or concomitant Perceval aortic valve replacement operated on first between April 2013 and January 2016, following traditional operating techniques, with patients operated on between January 2016 and December 2020, after the adoption of a modified protocol based on different annulus sizing, higher positioning of the valve and no ballooning after valve deployment was adopted. The operations were performed by 2 surgeons, and patients were followed-up for a period of 30 days.
RESULTS: A total of 286 patients, with a mean age of 77 (4.9) years, had Perceval valves implanted during the study period, of which 79% were isolated aortic valve procedures. Most patients (66.8%) underwent minimally invasive procedures. Cross-clamp time was 55.1 (17.6) min. The overall postoperative pacemaker insertion rate was 8.4%, which decreased decisively after the 2016 change in the implant protocol (16% vs 5.6%; P = 0.005), adjusted odds ratio of 0.31 (95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.74, P = 0.012). Univariable and multivariable analysis showed that larger valve size (P = 0.01) and ballooning (P = 0.002) were associated with higher risk of implanting a pacemaker. Postoperative 30-day mortality was of 4.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in the operating techniques for implanting the Perceval valve may decrease the rate of pacemakers implanted postoperatively. Although further studies are needed to confirm these results, such a risk reduction may lead to wider use of Perceval valves in the future, potentially benefiting patients who are suitable candidates for minimally invasive surgery.
