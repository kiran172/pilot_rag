Title: A Novel Technique for Performing Transfemoral Transcatheter Self-Expanding Aortic Valve Replacement With No Contrast Which Minimizes Acute Kidney Injury.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) treats severe aortic stenosis. However, patients with limited renal function may be ineligible for contrast use during valve deployment. We evaluate TAVR via transfemoral approach using 2-wire technique and no contrast injection. Primary endpoints are acute kidney injury and procedural success. Safety analysis includes mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary obstruction, and more. Forty-six patients were included; most with preserved ejection fraction. Baseline creatinine was 1.63 ± 0.68 and post-TAVR was significantly better (1.47 ± 0.64, P < 0.01). No statistical difference existed between creatinine at baseline and 30 days. After TAVR, 91% had no paravalvular leak (PVL). Peak-velocity post-TAVR was 1.32 ± 0.33 and mean-gradient was 7 ± 4. No valve repositioning during deployment was required. No mortality at 30 days without incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction or coronary obstruction. One patient had retroperitoneal bleeding requiring transfusion. The noncontrast technique for self-expanding valve deployment is feasible and safe in patients who cannot tolerate contrast.
