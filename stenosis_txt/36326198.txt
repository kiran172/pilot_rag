Title: Trends and outcomes in transcatheter aortic valve implantation in Belgium: a 13-year single centre experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been adopted as an alternative to surgery in severe aortic stenosis treatment, even in low-intermediate risk. The aim of this study is to retrospectively report our single-centre 13-year TAVI experience with emphasis on learning curve, referral indication and trends in outcomes over time.
METHODS: We included 361 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI from January 2008 to December 2020, grouped according to similar per-year volume of procedures: G1 (2008-2014), G2 (2015-2017) and G3 (2018-2020).
RESULTS: The number of procedures increased (group size: 59 vs. 106 vs. 196). No major differences were observed in STS-PROM and EuroSCORE-II between groups, despite TAVI in patients with prior surgical revascularisation was mainly performed in G1. Trans-femoral approach raised from 80.8 to 93.4%, while the most common alternative access was trans-subclavian. The pre-dilation rate was higher in G1 with lower prosthesis post-dilation rate. The length of hospital stay decreased in time by 30%. At 30 days a reduction in all-cause mortality, vascular complications, bleedings and para-valvular leak combined with higher rate of permanent pacing were observed over the groups. At 1-year there was no difference in all-cause mortality but over 30% reduction in cardiovascular death (8.5 vs. 7.5 vs. 5.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Favourable trends were observed across the groups, with an improvement in periprocedural outcomes and cardiovascular mortality at 1-year. These improvements could depend on increased expertise because mortality reduction was noted only after reaching a significant procedure volume. A trend towards lower risk patients selection was present in our cohort, as previously described worldwide.
