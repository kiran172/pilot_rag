Title: Association of Baseline Tricuspid Regurgitation With Health Status and Clinical Outcomes After TAVR and Mitral TEER.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with worse clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER), but little is known about its association with health status outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to explore, using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and American College of Cardiology TVT (Transcatheter Valve Therapy) Registry, the association between baseline TR and health status after TAVR and M-TEER and to determine if baseline TR was associated with clinical endpoints.
METHODS: Health status was assessed using Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary (KCCQ-OS) score in patients enrolled in the TVT Registry who underwent isolated TAVR or M-TEER between January 2019 and June 2021. The association among baseline TR and KCCQ-OS score, being alive and well, and clinical outcomes was examined.
RESULTS: In total, 130,097 TAVR patients (13.1% with moderate TR, 2.3% with severe TR) and 19,593 M-TEER patients (33.2% with moderate TR, 14.7% with severe TR) were included. Mean KCCQ-OS scores were lower with severe vs moderate vs none to mild TR at baseline prior to TAVR (39.4 ± 24.2 vs 45.2 ± 24.7 vs 51.3 ± 25.3; P < 0.01) or M-TEER (38.1 ± 23.9 vs 41.9 ± 24.7 vs 45.4 ± 25.2; P < 0.01) and similarly at 30 days and 1 year. The odds of being alive and well at 1 year were lower with moderate or severe TR before TAVR (adjusted OR: 0.79 [95% CI: 0.74-0.85] and adjusted OR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.70-0.94], respectively) and severe TR before M-TEER (adjusted OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.40-0.71). Furthermore, moderate or severe TR before TAVR was associated with higher 1-year mortality and readmission, whereas moderate or severe TR before M-TEER was associated with higher 1-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of U.S. patients who underwent TAVR or M-TEER, greater baseline TR was associated with worse health status and clinical outcomes. Understanding adverse outcomes of TR in patients with coexisting valvular abnormalities is important, especially with rapidly evolving transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions.
