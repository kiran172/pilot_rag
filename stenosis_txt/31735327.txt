Title: Effect on 30-Day Readmissions after Early Versus Delayed Discharge after Uncomplicated Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from the Nationwide Readmissions Database).

Abstract: Early discharge after transcatheter aortic valve implantation has been shown to be safe in single-center studies and trials, but outcomes in broader clinical practice are unknown. Using the National Readmission Databases (1/2014 to 9/2015), we compared 30-day readmission rates between early (<3 days) and late (≥3 days) discharges after uncomplicated endovascular TAVR in a propensity-matched cohort. We examined factors associated with failure of early discharge by testing for interactions of patient factors with discharge strategy. Among 4,955 hospitalizations for uncomplicated TAVR, 1,857 (37%) were discharged early with substantial site-level variability (range 0% to 87%; median odds ratio 3.69). In the propensity matched cohort (n = 3,346), there were similar rates of 30-day readmission by discharge strategy (early vs late: 10.3% vs 10.6%; stratified log-rank p = 0.555). There was a statistically significant interaction between discharge strategy and number of chronic conditions (p = 0.007), where readmission rates were lower in patients discharged early in those with 0 to 4 chronic conditions, but not in those with 5 to 10 or >10. In conclusion, in a large "real-world" cohort, early discharge after uncomplicated TAVR was not associated with a higher rate of 30-day rehospitalization, yet there was significant variability across US hospitals. No patient characteristics were associated with increased risk of readmission with early discharge.
