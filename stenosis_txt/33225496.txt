Title: Use of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for resection of a large paratracheal mass causing critical tracheal stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Critical airway stenosis is challenging for surgeons and anesthesiologists to secure a reliable airway for ventilation. The use of venovenous (VV)-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been described as a strategy to provide adequate gas exchange in such instances. We present a case of a young female with a complex paratracheal mass significantly compressing the trachea; a planned intraoperative VV-ECMO was instituted to allow safe orotracheal intubation of a double-lumen endotracheal tube for lung isolation and tumor resection.
