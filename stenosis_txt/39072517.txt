Title: Graft Kidney Artery Stenosis in Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant Recipient With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Case Report.

Abstract: Here, we report a rare case of transplant renal artery stenosis in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who received a kidney from a deceased donor. The transplant renal artery stenosis was caused by the rotation and compression of the transplanted kidney, a consequence of the preexisting polycystic kidney. To address the transplant renal artery stenosis, the patient underwent additional surgical removal of the native polycystic kidney, which corrected the stenosis and restored the function of the transplanted kidney. This case highlighted the importance of monitoring for various causes of renal artery stenosis following kidney transplant.
