Title: Comparison of the Effectiveness of Ring-Stripping Retrograde Endarterectomy and Carotid Artery Crossover Bypass in the Treatment of Patients with Symptomatic Riles Type 1A Common Carotid Artery Occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The surgical procedure most appropriate for treating symptomatic Riles type 1A common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) is unclear. This study compares the effects of ring-stripping retrograde endarterectomy (RSRE) and carotid artery crossover bypass (CACB) on cerebral perfusion improvement in patients with symptomatic Riles type 1A CCAO.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of symptomatic Riles type 1A CCAO patients treated at our centre. Postoperative improvements in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) flow rate, ipsilateral cerebral blood perfusion (CBP) and the stroke recurrence rate were compared between patients who underwent RSRE and those who underwent CACB.
RESULTS: A total of 20 CCAO patients were surgically treated at our centre from 2011 to 2018. Nine of these patients underwent RSRE, and eleven underwent CACB. No significant differences were identified between the groups in the ipsilateral blood flow rate of the ICA immediately after surgery and the ipsilateral-to-contralateral mean transit time ratios 1 day after surgery. However, the flow rate in the ICA was significantly higher in the RSRE group than in the CACB group 1 year after surgery (135.44 ± 19.22 ml/min vs. 116.36 ± 17.70 ml/min, p = 0.033). For CBP, the ipsilateral-to-contralateral mean transit time ratios were significantly lower in RSRE patients than in CACB patients 1 year after surgery (1.005 ± 0.052 vs. 1.064 ± 0.066, p = 0.044). In addition, the postoperative modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at the latest follow-up point (p = 0.884) and the stroke recurrence rate during the follow-up (88.9% vs. 90.9%, p > 0.999) were not significantly different between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the postoperative mRS score and the stroke recurrence rate were not significantly different between RSRE and CACB patients, compared to CACB, RSRE was better for improving the ipsilateral ICA flow rate and cerebral perfusion in symptomatic Riles type 1A CCAO patients.
