Title: [Digitalization and clinical decision tools].

Abstract: Digitalization in cardiovascular emergencies is rapidly evolving, analogous to the development in medicine, driven by the increasingly broader availability of digital structures and improved networks, electronic health records and the interconnectivity of systems. The potential use of digital health in patients with acute chest pain starts even in the prehospital phase with the transmission of a digital electrocardiogram (ECG) as well as telemedical support and digital emergency management, which facilitate optimization of the rescue pathways and reduce critical time intervals. The increasing dissemination and acceptance of guideline apps and clinical decision support tools as well as integrated calculators and electronic scores are anticipated to improve guideline adherence, translating into a better quality of treatment and improved outcomes. Implementation of artificial intelligence to support image analysis and also the prediction of coronary artery stenosis requiring interventional treatment or impending cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or death, have an enormous potential especially as conventional instruments frequently yield suboptimal results; however, there are barriers to the rapid dissemination of corresponding decision aids, such as the regulatory rules related to approval as a medical product, data protection issues and other legal liability aspects, which must be considered.
