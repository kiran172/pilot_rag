Title: [Thoracoscopic tracheal resection in a child under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation].

Abstract: Congenital tracheal stenosis in children is a rare, severe and life-threatening respiratory tract malformation characterized by respiratory failure. We have performed 74 surgical interventions in these patients under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between 2013 and 2022. In this article, we present surgical treatment of a newborn with congenital tracheal stenosis. For the first time in the world, the patient underwent thoracoscopic resection and reconstruction of the trachea under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
