Title: Recovery of cyanosis after esophageal intubation in a neonate with tracheal agenesis: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheal agenesis (TA) is a rare congenital defect that consists of a complete or partial absence of the trachea below the larynx, with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). It is a severe congenital defect with a very high mortality rate. The recommended surgical approach is esophageal ligation and gastrostomy. Despite the progress in reconstructive surgical techniques, the outcome of the anomaly is still very poor. We described a case of TA with a TEF in a female newborn with a hemivertebra, single ventricle, single atrioventricular valve, single atrium, and cardiac left isomerization.
CASE: The patient, who was born at 37 weeks of age, was diagnosed with imaging methods, as the cyanosis did not improve despite being intubated many times in the delivery room; the cyanosis improved after esophageal intubation. Despite all life support treatment, the patient died on the fourth day of life. At autopsy, tracheal agenesis was diagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS: In newborns who cannot be intubated in the delivery room or whose lungs cannot be ventilated despite being intubated and whose cyanosis cannot be corrected, tracheal agenesis should be considered and ventilation with esophageal intubation should also be tried.
