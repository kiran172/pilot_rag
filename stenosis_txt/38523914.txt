Title: Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR): The Best Surgical Intervention Option in an Unusual Presentation of Carotid Dissection in a 37-Year-Old Pregnant Female.

Abstract: Carotid artery dissection (CAD) is a condition that compromises blood flow and leads to serious complications such as a stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). This case report demonstrates an unusual case of right internal carotid artery dissection, stenosis of >70%, and an intraluminal thrombus. The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of right-sided neck pain and severe headache status-post a complicated pregnancy. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the right carotid was conducted and showed a right internal carotid artery dissection with 70% luminal stenosis and thrombosis. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA), transfemoral carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS), or transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) were all surgical intervention options that were explored. Risks and benefits were compared between the three surgical intervention options, and transcarotid artery revascularization was deemed the best surgical option in this patient's case.
