Title: New Intercostal Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Access: No Touch.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is routinely performed via the transfemoral or transapical route. Subclavian, transcarotid, and transaortic access are described as alternative routes for TAVR. The small intercostal approach can be used for a safe TAVR without touching the ribs and sternum.
