Title: Adult cavernous haemangioma of the vocal cords with a unique presentation of acute respiratory distress: a case report.

Abstract: Laryngeal haemangiomas can commonly be seen in children, and first-line treatment is usually propranolol. However, in adults, cavernous haemangioma of the vocal cord(s) is an extremely rare condition - with this being the only published adult case presenting with acute respiratory distress - the mainstay of treatment is surgical excision under microlaryngoscopy. Presentation in adults can be unpredictable, but primarily consists of hoarseness which can be associated with, dyspnoea, dysphagia, and haemoptysis - and in one documented case stenosis of the aero-digestive tract led to death. Due to these airway difficulties, surgery can often prove challenging. In this study, we explore the unusual case of a previously well 71-year-old gentleman presenting to the Emergency Department, with worsening shortness of breath as his primary complaint. Uniquely, in this case, an awake fibre-optic intubation was undertaken to manage the difficult airway and a microlaryngoscopy was performed. A 20x10x15mm lesion was excised, which had characteristics in keeping with a cavernous haemangioma on microscopic examination.
