Title: Acute myocardial infarction and polycythemia rubra vera: The double effect of treatment with hydroxyurea.

Abstract: We report a case of acute myocardial infarction in a patient with polycythemia rubra vera, who has been treated with hydroxyurea. The patient presented with chest pain extending to both arms accompanied by nausea and sweating. Hemoglobin was 18.1 mg/dL, hematocrit 53.2%, white blood cells 9600/mm³, and platelets 745,000/mm³. The levels of specific cardiac injury markers were increased, troponin I increased to 110 ng/mL and creatine kinase-MB to 361 U/l, respectively. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in leads V2-6, D1, and aVL as well as ST depression in D2, D3 and aVF. Echocardiography demonstrated hypokinesis of the interventricular septum and lateral wall with mildly reduced left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction (EF≈45%). Coronary angiography revealed proximal-LAD subtotal occlusion and 80% mid-LAD stenosis with distal-LAD vasospasm. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with a drug-eluting stent in mid- and proximal-LAD. Hypercoagulable state of polycythemia rubra vera may be complicated with acute myocardial infarction, in addition to the vasospastic effect and endothelium lesions of hydroxyurea regardless its favorable effect as a standard therapy.
