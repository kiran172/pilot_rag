Title: [Clinical application of a self-developed suction-irrigation device in endoscopic ear surgery for attic cholesteatoma].

Abstract: Objective: To introduce a new self-developed irrigation device(SID) that does not employ a sheath or an irrigation-suction system and evaluate to its efficiency in transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) for attic cholesteatoma. Methods: 38 patients who were subjected to TEES for attic cholesteatoma between October 2019 to June 2021 were included in this study, including 17 males and 21 females with an average age of (38.6±11.9) years. SID and underwater continuous drilling were used during operation. Width of endoscope and irrigation speed were measured when SID was applied. The operating time, surgical view and complications were compared between two groups. Results: The width of the endoscope was 3.5-4.6 mm in diameter and the irrigation speed was 20-40 ml/min when SID was used. SID cleaned the lens at the tip of the endoscope and created a clear field of view during TEES. The operation time was (86.6±18.1) min. The skin of the external ear canal was found injured during operation in 3 patients, but there were no complications such as necrosis of the flap, stenosis of external ear canal, sensorineural hearing loss, facial paralysis and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Conclusions: SID is simple and enhances the efficacy of TEES, providing a new irrigation choice in TEES for attic cholesteatoma.
