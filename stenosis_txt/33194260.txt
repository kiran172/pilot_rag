Title: Late-onset occlusion of the Monro foramina after endoscopic third ventriculostomy in adults: Case discussion and review of the literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Few cases of adult idiopathic occlusion of the foramen of Monro (AIOFM) are described in the literature. The diagnosis of AIOFM after an endoscopic procedure is even more infrequent.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We described the case of a 50-year-old woman who developed bilateral membranous occlusion of both Monro foramina 20 years after an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) for triventricular hydrocephalus due to an aqueductal stenosis. The patient underwent an endoscopic treatment (left foraminoplasty and septostomy) to check the patency of the stoma on the floor of the third ventricle. After the endoscopic procedure, the symptoms improved and the postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the resolution of the biventricular hydrocephalus.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral occlusion of both FM with consequent bilateral lateral ventricles enlargement is an extremely rare condition, especially if we consider the cases of biventricular hydrocephalus after endoscopic procedures. In our opinion, an endoscopic approach should be attempted as first choice procedure, avoiding any intraventricular stent or shunt placement.
