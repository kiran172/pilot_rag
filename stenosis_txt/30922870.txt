Title: Five-Year Results of the Bioflow-III Registry: Real-World Experience with a Biodegradable Polymer Sirolimus-Eluting Stent.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to assess long-term safety and performance of the Orsiro sirolimus-eluting coronary stent with biodegradable polymer in a large unselected population and in pre-specified subgroups.
METHODS: BIOFLOW-III is a prospective, multicenter, international, observational registry with follow-up visits scheduled at 6 and 12 months, and at 3 and 5 years (NCT01553526).
RESULTS: 1356 patients with 1738 lesions were enrolled. Of those, 392 (28.9%) declined to participate in the study extension from 18 months to 5 years, 37 (2.7%) withdrew consent, and 89 (6.6%) were lost to follow-up. At 5-years, Kaplan-Meier estimates of target lesion failure, defined as a composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting and clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 10.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.4; 12.0] in the overall population, and 14.0% [95% CI: 10.5; 18.6], 10.3% [95% CI: 7.8; 13.5], 1.8% [95% CI: 0.3; 12.0], and 11.3% [95% CI: 8.5; 15.1] in the pre-defined risk groups of patients with diabetes mellitus, small vessels ≤2.75 mm, chronic total occlusion, and acute myocardial infarction. Definite stent thrombosis was observed in 0.3% [95% CI: 0.1; 0.9] of patients.
CONCLUSION: These long-term outcomes provide further evidence on the safety and performance of a sirolimus-eluting biodegradable polymer stent within daily clinical practice. The very low definite stent thrombosis rate affirms biodegradable polymer safety and performance.
