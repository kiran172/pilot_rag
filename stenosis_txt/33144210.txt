Title: Longitudinal Survey of Trainee Case Log Entry for Carotid Endarterectomy: Trends in Neurologic, General, and Vascular Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple surgical specialties perform carotid endarterectomy (CEA). As indications for CEA narrows, neurosurgery residents are less exposed to this procedure. This study aims to determine trends in CEA training among graduating trainees in neurosurgery and compare these to general and vascular surgery.
METHODS: ACGME case log reports were retrospectively reviewed from 2013 to 2019 for neurologic, general, and vascular surgery residencies and vascular surgery fellowship. These annual reports contain the mean number of logged cases for graduating trainees and their level of participation. We analyzed trends in logged cases over the study period and compared mean number of logged cases between specialties and their respective required minimum numbers.
RESULTS: Neurosurgery residents (13.5 ± 0.76) performed significantly more CEAs than their counterparts in general surgery (9.4 ± 0.34, P < 0.01) but less in integrated vascular surgery (57.7 ± 0.88) and vascular surgery fellowship (47.9 ± 0.79, both P < 0.001). The only statistically significant change over the study period was a decline in mean number of cases logged by general surgery residents at -0.4 cases/year (P < 0.001). Trainees in all specialties reported around twice as many cases as the respective Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education required minimum numbers. Neurosurgery residents demonstrated increasing participation as lead surgeons by 0.7 cases/year (P = 0.04) and a concurrent decline as senior surgeons by 1.4 cases/year (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery residents exceeded their minimum requirements for CEA, with increasing trend in higher level of participation. But neurosurgery residents' exposure to this procedure was far less significant than their colleagues in vascular surgery, a gap that may widen over time and should be addressed proactively.
