Title: Predictors of COVID-19 outcomes in adult congenital heart disease patients - anatomy versus function.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) should be considered as an increased risk population with poor outcomes when suffering from COVID-19.
AIMS: This study aimed to collect clinical outcome data and to identify risk factors of a complicated course of COVID-19 among ACHD patients.
METHODS: Among all outpatients who came to medical attention via telemedicine or direct physician contact at our institution between September 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, we included all with a COVID-19 diagnosis. The incidence of COVID-19, a clinical course of the disease, and outcome were determined.
RESULTS: One hundred and four (8.7%) out of 1 197 patients who were seen at our outpatient clinic for ACHD patients met the definition of COVID-19. Most of them reported a mild course of COVID-19 (99 [95.5%]). Five patients (4.5%) experienced severe symptoms and needed hospitalization. Two patients (1.9% of all with a confirmed diagnosis, 40% with severe infection) died. In the multivariable analysis, decreased systemic ventricular systolic function and any significant valve stenosis were predictors of a complicated disease course.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previous results showing that a physiology-based model, rather than an anatomy-based model, better predicted COVID-19 outcomes among ACHD patients, which is of importance for patients and healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
