Title: The imaging of cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy.

Abstract: This review provides a detailed description of the imaging features of cervical spondylotic myelopathy and radiculopathy, with a focus on MRI. Where relevant, we will outline grading systems of vertebral central canal and foraminal stenosis. Whilst post-operative appearances of the cervical spine are outside the scope of this paper, we will touch on imaging features recognised as predictors of clinical outcome and neurological recovery. This paper will serve as a reference for both radiologists and clinicians involved in the care of patients with cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy.
