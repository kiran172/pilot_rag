Title: Dialysis Access: At the Intersection of Policy, Innovation, and Clinical Care.

Abstract: The Advancing American Kidney Health executive order aims to reduce the incidence of end-stage kidney disease, promote home dialysis therapies, increase the number of kidney transplants, and encourage innovation in new technologies, evidence-based practice, and early detection of kidney disease. Improvements in dialysis access care are essential to the success and expansion of this program, and to being able to provide high-quality, cost-efficient care to this patient population. Specifically, the need for expanded access to home dialysis will require surgeons and interventionalists to become proficient and trained in peritoneal dialysis catheter placement and for the referral process to be streamlined to accommodate the increased interest in this modality. In addition, new technologies, namely percutaneous fistula creation, bioengineered vessels, and a variety of interventions to reduce arteriovenous stenosis, will hopefully allow for timely and durable vascular access options that will support implementation of the executive order.
