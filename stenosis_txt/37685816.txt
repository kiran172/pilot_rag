Title: Improved Early Outcomes in Women Undergoing Aortic Valve Interventions.

Abstract: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in female patients has been associated with higher mortality (up to 3.3-8.9%) and postoperative complication rates when compared with their male counterparts. In recent years, TAVI has been shown to provide a greater benefit than SAVR in women. We sought to assess the early outcomes of the contemporary aortic valve intervention practice (surgical and transcatheter) in patients referred to our cardiac surgery unit. The data of consecutive patients who underwent isolated aortic valve intervention for aortic valve stenosis during the 2018-2022 period were retrieved from our internal database. Several preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analyzed, including the predicted risk of a prosthesis-patient mismatch. Nine hundred and fifty-five consecutive patients-514 women and 441 men-were included. Among them, 480 patients-276 female and 204 male-received a transcatheter procedure, and 475-238 women and 237 men-had conventional SAVR. The women were older and had higher EuroSCORE II, while the male patients presented a higher incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities. There was no difference in mortality or major postoperative complication rates after either the surgical or transcatheter procedures between the female and male populations. The availability and targeted use of different techniques and technologies have enabled the safe and effective treatment of female patients treated for severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis with similar results when compared with their male counterparts.
