Title: Inversion technique under fluoroscopy for removal of self-expanding nitinol esophageal stent after long-term placement: review of 107 consecutive cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Removal of self-expanding esophageal metal stents that have been implanted for a long time can be difficult and risky.
PURPOSE: In this paper, we describe the use of the "inversion technique" under fluoroscopy for removal of self-expandable nitinol esophageal stents that have been placed for long periods and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the method.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent removal of self-expanding nitinol esophageal stents by the inversion technique under fluoroscopy at our center. Demographic characteristics, type of esophageal stents, stent retention time, reasons for stent removal, and related complications were collected from the case records and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 112 metal esophageal stents (62 fully covered esophageal stents and 50 partially covered esophageal stents) were extracted from the 107 patients included in the study. Indications for stent implantation were malignant esophageal stenosis (27 patients), benign esophageal stenosis (42 patients), and esophageal fistula (38 patients). Median duration of stent retention was 77 days (29-727 days). All stents were removed successfully without major complications such as esophageal rupture, massive hemorrhage, asphyxia, or cardiorespiratory arrest.
CONCLUSION: Inversion technique under fluoroscopy appears to be a safe, effective, and quick procedure for removal of self-expanding nitinol esophageal stent after long-term placement.
