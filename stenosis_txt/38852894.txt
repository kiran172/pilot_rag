Title: Ulceration location is associated with clinical course in carotid stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Plaque ulceration in carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for cerebral ischemic events; however, the characteristics that determine plaque vulnerability are not fully understood. We thus assessed the association between plaque ulceration sites and cerebrovascular ischemic attack.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected the clinical data of 72 consecutive patients diagnosed with carotid artery stenosis with plaque ulcers. After excluding patients with pseudo-occlusion, a history of previous carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting before the ulcer was first discovered, follow-up data of less than 1 month, or carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting performed within 1 month after the ulcer was first discovered, 60 patients were ultimately included. Patients were divided into proximal and distal groups based on the ulcer location relative to the most stenotic point. The primary endpoints were ipsilateral cerebrovascular ischemic events ("ischemic events"), such as amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, or ischemic stroke due to carotid artery stenosis with plaque ulceration. The association between ulcer location and ischemic events was also assessed.
RESULTS: In the patients with plaque ulcer, more patients had proximal than distal plaque ulcers (39 vs 21; P = .028). The median follow-up duration was 3.8 years (interquartile range, 1.5-6.2 years). Nineteen patients (32%) experienced ischemic event. Ischemic events occurred more frequently in the distal than in the proximal group (18% vs 59%; P = .005). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated a significantly shorter event-free time in the distal group (log-rank P = .021). In univariate analysis, distal ulcer location was associated with ischemic events (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-7.65; P = .03). Multivariate analysis using two different models also showed that distal ulcer location was independently associated with ischemic events (Model 1: OR, 3.85; 95% CI, 1.26-11.78; P = .03; Model 2: OR, 4.31; 95% CI, 1.49-12.49; P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with carotid artery stenosis and plaque ulcers located distal to the most stenotic point are more likely to experience cerebrovascular ischemic attacks. Therefore, carotid plaques with ulcers located distal to the most stenotic point may be a potential indication for surgical treatment.
