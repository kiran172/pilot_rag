Title: Unicuspid aortic valve: Case series and review.

Abstract: A unicuspid aortic valve is a very rare valvular lesion. Its physical manifestations vary and are associated with other cardiovascular abnormalities such as aortic stenosis/insufficiency and aortopathy. Echocardiography remains the modality of choice, with computerized tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance used as adjunctive imaging. Herein, we present a case series of three patients with unicuspid aortic valves treated at our institution, with a focus on 2D and 3D echocardiographic imaging.
