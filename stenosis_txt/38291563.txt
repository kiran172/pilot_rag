Title: Localized Photodynamic Therapy Using a Chlorin e6-Embedded Silicone-Covered Self-Expandable Metallic Stent as a Palliative Treatment for Malignant Esophageal Strictures.

Abstract: Localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a polymeric-photosensitizer (PS)-embedded, covered self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS). PDT is minimally invasive and a noteworthy potential alternative for treating esophageal strictures, where surgery is not a viable option. However, preclinical evidence is insufficient, and optimized irradiation energy dose ranges for localized PDT are unclear. Herein, we validated the irradiation energy doses of the SEMS (embedded in a PS using chlorin e6 [Ce6] and covered in silicone) and PDT-induced tissue changes in a rat esophagus. Cytotoxicity and phototoxicity in the Ce6-embedded SEMS piece with laser irradiation were significantly higher than that of the silicone-covered SEMS with or without laser and the Ce6-embedded silicone-covered SEMS without laser groups (all p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, surface morphology, atomic changes, and homogeneous coverage of the Ce6-embedded silicone-covered membrane were confirmed. The ablation range of the porcine liver was proportionally increased with the irradiation dose (all p &lt; 0.001). The ablation region was identified at different irradiation energy doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 J/cm2. The in vivo study in the rat esophagus comprised a control group and 100, 200, and 400 J/cm2 energy-dose groups. Finally, histology and immunohistochemistry (TUNEL and Ki67) confirmed that the optimized Ce6-embedded silicone-covered SEMS with selected irradiation energy doses (200 and 400 J/cm2) effectively damaged the esophageal tissue without ductal perforation. The polymeric PS-embedded silicone-covered SEMS can be easily placed via a minimally invasive approach and represents a promising new approach for the palliative treatment of malignant esophageal strictures.
