Title: Robotic voluminous paraesophageal hernia repair: a case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment for sliding esophageal hernia with mild gastroesophageal reflux is usually conservative, but surgical treatment is recommended for refractory sliding esophageal hernia, paraesophageal hernia liable to prolapse, or paraesophageal hernia with ulceration and/or stenosis. Robotic surgery overcomes laparoscopic pitfalls by providing steady-state three-dimensional visualization, augmented dexterity with endo-wrist movements, and superior ergonomics for the surgeon.
CASE PRESENTATION: To investigate robotic paraesophageal hernia repair, a literature search was conducted using PubMed with the following key words: mini invasive surgery, robotic surgery, hiatal hernia, and Nissen fundoplication. We present the case of a 44-year-old Italian woman with a 20-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease refractory to medical treatment, who underwent robotic Nissen fundoplication. In our center, we use the da Vinci® Xi™ Surgical System, which is an advanced tool for minimally invasive surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Various reports published in the literature suggested that the robot-assisted approach was effective and was associated with very low postoperative morbidity and was accompanied by satisfactory symptomatic and anatomical radiological outcomes during a follow-up period. The robotic approach to paraesophageal repair is safe and effective with low complication rates. With increased experience, the operative time, length of stay, and complications decrease without compromising surgical principles.
