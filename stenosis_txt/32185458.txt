Title: Prevention and management of complications in various antegrade enema procedures in children: a review of the literature.

Abstract: The antegrade continence enema (ACE) procedures are successful surgical options to achieve bowel cleaning in children with faecal incontinence due to a neuropathy or an anorectal malformation and an intractable constipation. The reversed and orthotopic appendicocecostomy, tubularized ileal conduit and the tubularized cecal flap are frequently applied procedures in the treatment of faecal incontinence (FI). The most common complications are the stoma stenosis, leakage, prolapse, adhesive obstruction and the difficulty in catheterization. Each procedure has its own advantages and disadvantages with different complication rates. The postoperative complications of ACE procedures may reduce patient compliance and quality of life. Most of these complications can be preventable and are easy to manage. This review aimed to discuss the prevention and management strategies for various ACE procedure complications.
