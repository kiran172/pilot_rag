Title: Optimal use of antithrombotic agents in ischemic stroke with atrial fibrillation and large artery atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Optimal antithrombotic regimens to prevent recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation (AF) and atherosclerotic large-vessel stenosis remain unknown.
AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of multiple antithrombotic therapies on outcomes at 1 year after ischemic stroke due to two or more causes.
METHODS: We identified 862 patients with ischemic stroke due to AF and large artery atherosclerosis from the linked data. These patients were categorized into three groups according to antithrombotic therapies at discharge: (1) antiplatelets, (2) oral anticoagulants (OAC), and (3) antiplatelets plus OAC. The study outcomes were recurrent ischemic stroke, composite outcomes for cardiovascular events, and major bleeding after 1 year. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance the three groups using propensity scores.
RESULTS: Among 862 patients, 169 (19.6%) were treated with antiplatelets, 405 (47.0%) were treated with OAC, and 288 (33.4%) were treated with antiplatelets and OAC. After applying IPTW, only OAC had a significant beneficial effect on the 1-year composite outcome (hazard ratio (HR): 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.60, p < 0.001) and death (HR: 0.35, 95% CI: (0.19-0.63), p < 0.001). The combination of antiplatelet agents and OAC group had an increased risk of major bleeding complications (HR: 5.27, 95% CI: (1.31-21.16), p = 0.019). However, there was no significant difference in 1-year recurrent stroke events among the three groups.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that OAC monotherapy was associated with lower risks of composite outcome and death in patients at 1 year after ischemic stroke due to AF and atherosclerotic stenosis. In addition, the combination of an antiplatelet and OAC had a high risk of major bleeding.
