Title: [Fracture of a Gastrointestinal Stent during Chemotherapy for Unresectable Advanced Gastric Cancer-A Case Report].

Abstract: A 79-year-old man with shortness of breath on exertion had right pleural effusion and ascites effusion on CT, and was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma on pleural cytology. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis, and biopsy from the same site revealed Group 5(tub2). The patient was diagnosed as unresectable advanced gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis and peritoneal and pleural dissemination. After placement of an uncovered metallic stent for the pyloric stenosis, SOX therapy was started. Three months after stent placement, a CT scan to determine the effect of chemotherapy showed stenosis in the gastrointestinal stent, partial breakage of the stent on the mouth side, and prolapse of the stent into the stomach. There were no symptoms such as abdominal pain, and the patient was placed on standby for retrieval of the dislodged stent. The prolapsed stent was retrieved endoscopically, and a covered metallic stent was additionally implanted as a"stent in stent". The patient has had no further passage obstruction and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. We report a case of fracture of a gastrointestinal stent during chemotherapy for unresectable advanced gastric cancer.
