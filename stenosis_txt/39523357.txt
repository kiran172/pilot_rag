Title: Prevalence, diagnosis and management of intracranial atherosclerosis in White populations: a narrative review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) represents a leading cause of ischemic stroke worldwide, conferring increased risk of recurrent stroke and poor clinical outcomes among stroke survivors. Emerging evidence indicates a paradigm shift, pointing towards increasing detection rates of ICAD among White populations and an evolving epidemiological profile across racial and ethnic groups. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of ICAD, focusing on its pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, and evolving epidemiological trends, including underlying mechanisms, advanced neuroimaging techniques for diagnostic evaluation, racial disparities in prevalence, and current and emerging management strategies.
MAIN BODY: Atherosclerotic plaque accumulation and progressive arterial stenosis of major intracranial arteries comprise the pathophysiological hallmark of ICAD. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of intracranial artery stenosis (ICAS) or high-grade ICAS is reached when luminal narrowing exceeds 50% and 70%, respectively. Advanced neuroimaging, including high-resolution vessel wall MRI (HRVW-MRI), has recently enabled ICAD detection before luminal stenosis occurs. While earlier studies disclosed significant racial disparities in ICAS prevalence, with higher rates among Asians, Hispanics, and Blacks, recent evidence reveals rising detection rates of ICAD among White populations. Genetic, environmental and epigenetic factors have been suggested to confer an increased susceptibility of certain ethnicities and races to ICAD. Nevertheless, with improved accessibility to advanced neuroimaging, ICAD is increasingly recognized as an underlying stroke etiology among White patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke and stroke of undetermined etiology. While conventional management of ICAS entails risk factor modification, pharmacotherapy, and endovascular treatment in selected high-risk patients, substantial progress remains to be made in the management of ICAD at its early, pre-stenotic stages.
CONCLUSION: ICAD remains a critical yet underappreciated risk factor for ischemic stroke across all populations, highlighting the need for increased awareness and improved diagnostic strategies. The emerging epidemiological profile of ICAD across racial groups necessitates a reassessment of risk factors, screening protocols and preventive strategies. Future research should focus on refining the diagnostic criteria and expanding the therapeutic options to cover the full spectrum of ICAD, with the aim of improving patient outcomes and reducing the global burden of intracranial atherosclerosis and stroke.
