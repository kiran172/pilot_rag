Title: Causes and Secondary Prevention of Acute Ischemic Stroke in Adults.

Abstract: Stroke still remains a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke. Causes of ischemic stroke can be classified into large-artery atherosclerosis, cardiogenic embolism, small-vessel disease, stroke of other determined etiology, and stroke of undetermined etiology. Stroke causes in adults are mainly attributable to classical cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking. In neuroimaging, stroke subtypes can be defined according to lesion localization and distribution (territorial infarct, lacunar infarct, hemodynamic infarct), which provide information as to the underlying etiology. Acute stroke management comprises rapid neurological assessment and rapid imaging to initiate effective reperfusion treatment with intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. Stroke survivors are at increased risk of recurrent stroke. Therefore, diagnosis of the underlying cause and optimal secondary prevention is of importance. Pharmacologic secondary prevention includes antithrombotic therapy with antiplatelet drugs, oral anticoagulation, and treatment of vascular risk factors. Nonpharmacologic measures of secondary prevention comprise surgical or interventional revascularization of symptomatic carotid stenosis and interventional closure of patent foramen ovale.
