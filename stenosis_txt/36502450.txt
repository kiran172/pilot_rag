Title: Role of aortopexy in the treatment of aberrant innominate artery in children.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the surgical and follow-up outcomes in children who operated for aberrant innominate artery.
METHODS: A total of 15 consecutive patients (12 males, 3 females; mean age 16.3 ± 19.0 months; range 3 months to 6 years) who underwent aortopexy between February 2018 and December 2021 were evaluated. Demographic data, preoperative and postoperative clinical status and postoperative outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age at operation was 16.3 ± 19.0 months. The median weight was 8.3 kg (range, 7-14.5 kg).There was no complications at intraoperative period. The mean percent degree of tracheal stenosis was 0.68 ± 0.12. The median (range) MV duration, PICU stay, and ward stay of the patients were 2 h (0-3 h), 2.5 days (1-4 days), and 5 days (3-8 days), respectively. The mean patients' number of emergency service applications and hospitalization at the preoperative period was 6.2 ± 3.9/2.3 ± 1.6 and, at the postoperative period was 3.3 ± 2.2/0.9 ± 0.8. In comparison of the preoperative and postoperative service application number and hospitalization number, there was significant difference (p < 0.005 and 0.006, respectively). No reoperation was required. There was no mortality.
CONCLUSION: Aberrant innominate artery is rarely seen. These pathologies misdiagnosis with different reactive airways. Following the diagnosis, treatment can be achieved by surgery successfully.
