Title: Management of pediatric choanal atresia restenosis and subglottic stenosis using steroid-eluting stents.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To depict the novel use of steroid-eluting stents in the treatment of choanal atresia (CA) restenosis and subglottic stenosis (SGS).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of three pediatric patients, one with CA and two with SGS, treated with mometasone furoate eluting mini stents (PROPEL) was performed. Patients were evaluated for restenosis and adverse events between one to twelve months postoperatively.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, patient one with CA showed no signs of restenosis and required no further intervention. Patient two with SGS demonstrated an open subglottic lumen with no signs of restenosis as well as improved phonation following his planned serial procedures. Post-operatively, patient three with SGS exhibited no restenosis of the subglottic lumen, tolerated intermittent tracheostomy capping, and demonstrated improved phonation.
CONCLUSION: In this case series, we outline successful treatments for the management of CA restenosis and SGS with mometasone furoate-eluting stents. To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of this treatment in pediatric patients with CA restenosis and the second reported application in pediatric patients with SGS.
