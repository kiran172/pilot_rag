Title: Revealing the true nature of a parachute mitral valve during an ultra-trail race.

Abstract: Pre-participation screening and management of congenital cardiac valvulopathy in competitive athletes can be challenging, particularly within the context of ultra-endurance disciplines. A 55-year-old female athlete without a reported history of cardiac disease exhibited clinical signs of cardiogenic pulmonary edema during a 156â€¯km ultra-trail race. The echocardiographic assessment revealed the presence of a parachute mitral valve, with no evidence of mitral stenosis or regurgitation at rest, but it demonstrated severe dynamic mitral stenosis during exercise. In competitive athletes, the detection of rare valvulopathy should prompt a comprehensive cardiac evaluation aimed at assessing the potential for dynamic valvular dysfunction.
