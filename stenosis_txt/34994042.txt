Title: Whole liver transplantation in children under 10 kg: How to minimize the high risks of a still challenging procedure.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Whole liver transplantation in infants <10 kg is a rare procedure with moderate outcomes (67%-79% graft survival at 1 year) and high rates of vascular complications (hepatic artery thrombosis 5-26%).
METHODS: Retrospective single-center analysis of whole liver transplantation in infants <10 kg and systematic review of the literature focused on survival rates and surgical complications.
RESULTS: Between January 2005 and December 2020, 175 liver transplantations in 173 children were performed at our center. A total of 92 (53%) children weighed less than 10 kg; 19 (21%) of them underwent WLT and constitute the study population. Median age of the recipients was 10 months (21 days-24 months) and median body weight 6.5 (3.1-9.8) kg. Median age of the donors was 5 (1-84) months and median body weight 6.1 (4-21) kg. Median donor-to-recipient body weight ratio was 1.2 (range: 0.6-4.5). Postoperatively, neither hepatic artery nor portal vein thrombosis occurred. A biliary complication occurred in 4 cases: 1 bile leak (early), 3 anastomotic stenoses (1 delayed and 2 late), and 1 non-anastomotic stenosis (late). Patient survival rate at 1, 5, and 10 years was 100%, 92%, and 92%, respectively. Overall, death-censored graft survival after 1, 5, and 10 was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Our results are excellent in terms of complications and graft and patient survival. This involves not only high-end surgical performance but also close interdisciplinary perioperative cooperation based on strong standard operating procedures and mainly focused on fluid management, hemostasiology, and strict monitoring of vessel patency.
