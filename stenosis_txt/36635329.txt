Title: Incidence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of airway complications after lung transplantation.

Abstract: Airway complications may occur after lung transplantation and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We investigated the incidence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of these complications. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 137 patients who underwent lung transplantation between 2008 and 2021. The median follow-up period was 20 months. Of the 137 patients, 30 (21.9%) had postoperative airway complications, of which 2 had two different types of airway complications. The most common airway complication was bronchial stenosis, affecting 23 patients (16.8%). Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that a recipient's body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.663; p = 0.013) was a significant independent risk factor for airway complications, as was postoperative treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; HR, 3.340; p = 0.034). Of the 30 patients who had airway complications, 21 (70.0%) were treated with bronchoscopic intervention. Survival rates did not differ significantly between patients with and without airway complications. Thus, our study revealed that one fifth of patients who underwent lung transplantation experienced airway complications during the follow-up period. Obesity and receiving postoperative ECMO are risk factors for airway complications, and close monitoring is warranted in such cases.
