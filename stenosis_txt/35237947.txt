Title: Plasma sICAM-1 as a Biomarker of Carotid Plaque Inflammation in Patients with a Recent Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) identifies carotid plaque inflammation and predicts stroke recurrence in patients with atherothrombotic stroke. The aim of the study was to identify plasma inflammatory biomarkers associated with plaque inflammation according to 18F-FDG uptake. We conducted a prospective study of consecutive adult patients with a recent (&lt; 7 days) anterior circulation ischemic stroke and at least one atherosclerotic plaque in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. We included 64 patients, 57.8% of whom showed a carotid stenosis ≥ 50%. All patients underwent an early (&lt; 15 days from inclusion) 18F-FDG PET, and a blood sample was obtained at days 7 ± 1 from the stroke. The plasma concentration of 16 inflammation-related molecules was analyzed in a Luminex using xMAP technology. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between plasma biomarkers and the standardized uptake value (SUV) of 18F-FDG uptake. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and fractalkine (FKN) were independently associated with plaque inflammation (β = 0.121, 95% CI 0.061-0.181, p &lt; 0.001; β = 0.144, 95% CI 0.012-0.276, p = 0.033; β = 0.136, 95% CI 0.037-0.235, p = 0.008). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, sICAM-1 was associated with SUVmax ≥ 2.85 (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, p = 0.020). Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the association between biomarkers and stroke recurrence. sICAM-1 was associated with stroke recurrence (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.05, p = 0.002). In summary, elevated concentrations of sICAM-1 were associated with carotid plaque inflammation and an increased risk of stroke recurrence in patients with recent ischemic stroke and carotid atherosclerosis.
