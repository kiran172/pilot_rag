Title: Transcription Factor 21: A Transcription Factor That Plays an Important Role in Cardiovascular Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organisation's Health Report 2019, approximately 17.18 million people die from cardiovascular disease each year, accounting for more than 30% of all global deaths. Therefore, the occurrence of cardiovascular disease is still a global concern. The transcription factor 21 (TCF21) plays an important role in cardiovascular diseases. This article reviews the regulation mechanism of TCF21 expression and activity and focuses on its important role in atherosclerosis in order to contribute to the development of diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
SUMMARY: TCF21 is involved in the phenotypic regulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), promotes the proliferation and migration of VSMCs, and participates in the activation of inflammatory sequences. Increased proliferation and migration of VSMCs can lead to neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. Abnormal hyperplasia of neointima and inflammation are one of the main features of atherosclerosis. Therefore, targeting TCF21 may become a potential treatment for relieving atherosclerosis.
KEY MESSAGES: TCF21 as a member of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors regulates cell growth and differentiation by modulating gene expression during the development of different organs and plays an important role in cardiovascular development and disease. VSMCs and cells derived from VSMCs constitute the majority of plaques in atherosclerosis. TCF21 plays a key role in regulation of VSMCs' phenotype, thus accelerating atherogenesis in the early stage. However, TCF21 enhances plaque stability in late-stage atherosclerosis. The dual role of TCF21 should be considered in the translational medicine.
