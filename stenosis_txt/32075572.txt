Title: Total small vessel disease score and cerebro-cardiovascular events in healthy adults: The Kashima scan study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We explored the association between the total small vessel disease score obtained from baseline magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent cerebro-cardiovascular events in neurologically healthy Japanese adults.
METHODS: The presence of small vessel disease features, including lacunae, cerebral microbleeds, white matter changes, and basal ganglia perivascular spaces on magnetic resonance imaging, was summed to obtain a "total small vessel disease score" (range, 0-4). After excluding participants with previous stroke or ischemic heart disease, intracranial artery stenosis (≥50%), or cerebral aneurysm (≥4 mm), a total of 1349 participants (mean age, 57.7 years; range, 22.8-85.0 years; 46.9% male) were classified into three groups by total small vessel disease score: 0 (n = 984), 1 (n = 269), and ≥2 (n = 96). Cerebro-cardiovascular events (i.e., any stroke, transient ischemic attack, ischemic heart disease, acute heart failure, and aortic dissection) were defined as the primary end point. The hazard ratio (HR) of events during follow-up was calculated using Cox proportional hazards modeling with adjustments for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Cumulative event-free rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: During follow-up (mean, 6.7 years), 35 cerebro-cardiovascular (16 cerebrovascular) events were identified. Higher small vessel disease score was associated with increased risk of cerebro-cardiovascular events (HR per unit increase, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.46; P = 0.001). Events were more frequent among participants with higher score (P &lt; 0.001, log-rank test).
CONCLUSIONS: This study offered additional evidence for the clinical relevance of total small vessel disease score, suggesting the score as a promising tool to predict the risk of subsequent vascular events even in healthy populations.
