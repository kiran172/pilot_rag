Title: Surgical Referral for Hemodialysis Access Maintenance.

Abstract: Hemodialysis access is the lifeline for end-stage renal disease patients. However, dialysis access is associated with a host of complications, including thrombosis, recurrent stenosis, infection, aneurysmal changes and bleeding. Although endovascular therapy remains the first-line treatment owing to its less invasive nature, there are certain situations where surgical referral is recommended or even necessary. Regardless, management of dialysis access complications requires a multidisciplinary approach. Interventional radiologists should be familiar with the appropriate timing for surgical referral to better serve the complex patient population.
