Title: [Transcheter aortic valve implantation as a method of treatment of chronic heart failure in elderly and old patients: Literature review (part 2).].

Abstract: The most common heart valve defect among the elderly and senile is aortic valve stenosis. The traditional method of treating severe aortic valve stenosis is open surgery to replace aortic valve. At the same time, a more modern, minimally invasive method of correcting aortic stenosis is transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This intervention is primarily indicated for patients of old age suffering from severe chronic heart failure associated with aortic stenosis, who have a high surgical risk. Currently, TAVI has evolved from a complex and dangerous procedure into an effective and safe method of treatment thanks to the development of a new generation of devices. Currently, there are still topical issues of using TAVI in individual clinical cases (use of TAVI in the elderly (60-75 years), TAVI in centenarians (90 years or more), TAVI in frailty, the feasibility of performing TAVI with low surgical risk, etc.), as well as issues related to longevity valves used for TAVI and prognosis in terms of quality and life expectancy.
