Title: Standardized Aortic Valve Neocuspidization for Treatment of Aortic Valve Diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve replacement is the traditional surgical treatment for aortic valve diseases, yet standardized aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) is a promising alternative that is gaining popularity. The purpose of this article is to review the available published literature of AVNeo using glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium, also known as the Ozaki procedure, including indications, outcomes, potential benefits, and modes of failure for the reconstructed valve.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using keywords related to aortic valve repair, AVNeo, or Ozaki procedure. All articles describing performance of AVNeo were reviewed.
RESULTS: Reported early mortality after AVNeo varies from 0% to 5.88%. The largest cohort of patients in the literature includes 850 patients with an inhospital mortality rate of 1.88%. Cumulative incidence of aortic valveÂ reoperation was 4.2% in the largest series. Reoperation was uncommon and mainly due to infective endocarditis or degeneration of the reconstructed valve (most commonly due to aortic valve regurgitation, rather than stenosis).
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve neocuspidization is a versatile and standardized alternative to aortic valve replacement with a biological prosthesis. Early to midterm outcomes from a number of centers are excellent and demonstrate the safety and durability of the procedure. Long-term outcomes and clinical trial data are necessary to determine which patients benefit the most from this procedure.
