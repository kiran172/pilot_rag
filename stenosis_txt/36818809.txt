Title: Atrioventricular groove patch plasty in an infant with pulmonary stenosis after arterial switch operation: a case report.

Abstract: A 9-month-old infant developed pulmonary stenosis (PS) after an arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries, accompanied by a Shaher Type 4 coronary anatomy. As the right coronary artery (RCA) ran across the anterior side of the right ventricle (RV), atrioventricular (AV) groove patch plasty was performed to relieve PS. The distance between the RCA and tricuspid valve was confirmed by preoperative-computed tomography. The AV groove was carefully incised, ensuring the position of the tricuspid valve, and maintaining a distance of 3 mm from the tricuspid annulus to avoid approaching the RCA. While suturing the monocuspid valve patch, only the endocardial side of the RV was sutured, and RCA injury was prevented. Thus, especially in patients < 1 year of age, careful incision of the AV groove and suturing only the endocardial side is important to avoid injuring the RCA in AV groove patch plasty.
