Title: The Effect of Ascending Aortic Repair on Left Ventricular Remodeling.

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is common in patients with thoracic aortic diseases and is associated with increased long-term mortality. Thoracic aortic aneurysms are reported to increase LV afterload because of kinetic energy loss within the aneurysm sac, which may improve after surgical repair. However, LV afterload may also increase because of the stiffness of prosthetics used for aortic repair. We sought to investigate the long-term effect of surgical aortic repair with prostheses on postsurgical LV mass. We reviewed patients who underwent ascending aortic replacement with a prosthesis at our institution from January 2008 to December 2018. We calculated the LV mass index based on pre- and postoperative echocardiogram measurements. The primary outcome was the change in LV mass index 6 months after aortic repair. Patients aged &lt;18 years and those who had concomitant cardiac operations, severe aortic valve disease, or who had no echocardiographic data were excluded. Of 1,008 patients who underwent ascending aortic replacement, 134 (51 with acute aortic dissections) were included. The median baseline and follow-up LV mass index were 107 (90 to 135) g/m2 and 101 (83 to 123) g/m2, respectively. Overall, there was a significant reduction of LV mass index over time (p = 0.03). LV mass index decreased in 77 patients (59%). Presentation due to acute aortic dissection (p = 0.03) and baseline LV mass index (p &lt;0.001) were significant predictors of LV mass reduction. In conclusion, LV mass index may significantly decrease over time after the aortic repair, but the course is highly variable. The largest decrease occurred in patients who presented because of aortic dissections rather than for elective repair of aneurysms.
