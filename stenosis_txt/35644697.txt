Title: The 30-Day Readmission Rate of Same-Day Discharge Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from National Readmission Database 2015 to 2019).

Abstract: The length of hospital stay after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has decreased over the years, and next-day discharge is being increasingly adopted in clinical practice. Whether further expediting discharge after TAVI by allowing same-day discharge (SDD) in selected patients is safe or derives additional benefits remains unanswered. Using the United States Nationwide Readmission Database 2015 to 2019, we identified 196,618 patients who received TAVI (mean age 79.5 8.4 years, 45.0% female). Of these, 245 patients (0.12%) were discharged on the same day they received TAVI (SDD group), and the remaining 196,373 were discharged on a different day (different-day discharge [DDD] group). A propensity score-matched analysis was done. The rate of unplanned readmission within 30 days of discharge was not significantly different between the SDD and DDD groups (11.0% vs 10.6%, hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.90, p = 0.921). Hospitalization costs were significantly lower in the SDD group than the DDD group ($37,811 ± 18,029 vs $49,130 ± 27,007, p <0.001). In conclusion, the 30-day readmission rate was similar for patients discharged on the same day after TAVI and for patients discharged at a later time point.
