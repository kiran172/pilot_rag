Title: Valve disease and aortopathy associations of bicuspid aortic valve phenotypes differ between men and women.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Determine whether associations between bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) phenotypes, valve disease and aortopathy differ between sexes.
METHODS: 1045 patients with BAV (76.0% men, n=794) from two surgical centres were included in this cross-sectional study. Valve phenotype was classified intraoperatively as right-left (RL), right-non-coronary (RN), left-non-coronary (LN) or 2-sinus BAV. Echocardiography was used to determine type and degree of valve disease, and aortic dimensions. Aortic dilatation was defined as diameter ≥4.5 cm.
RESULTS: RL was the most common phenotype (73.6%), followed by RN (16.2%), 2-sinus BAV (9.2%) and LN (1.1%), with no difference in phenotype distribution between men and women (p=0.634). Aortic valve insufficiency (AI) prevalence differed significantly with valve phenotype in men (p=0.047), with RL and LN having the highest prevalence (34.1% and 44.0%, respectively). In women, RN had a higher proportion of AI than RL (21.3% vs 7.3%, p=0.017). Men with RL had larger root dimensions, in particular at the sinus (mean difference 0.24 cm compared with RN, p=0.002). Men with 2-sinus BAV had the highest prevalence of root phenotype dilatation (7.0%, other phenotypes ≤2.3%, p=0.031), whereas women with 2-sinus BAV did not have root dilatation and smaller sinus dimensions (mean difference: 0.35 cm compared with RL, p=0.021). Aortic root segments were larger in men with AI compared with aortic stenosis (sinus mean difference: 0.40 cm, p<0.001). The difference was even larger in women (mean difference: 0.78 cm, p<0.001), and women with AI also had larger tubular segments (mean difference: 0.61 cm, p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant sex differences in clinical associations of BAV phenotypes, which should be considered in further studies on the role of phenotypes in individualised patient management.
