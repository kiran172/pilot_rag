Title: Case of effective suction to secure the true lumen for acute occlusion after carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: During or following carotid endarterectomy, dissection and occlusion of the internal carotid artery can occur. In cases of stenosis or almost complete occlusion, recanalization is relatively easy; however, in cases of complete occlusion, advancing a guidewire into the true lumen may be challenging. Few reports on how to address this problem have been published. Here, we report a case of suction-enabled advancement of the wire into the true lumen during endovascular treatment of an acute occlusion of the internal carotid artery after carotid endarterectomy. An 80-year-old man underwent carotid endarterectomy; the next morning, he exhibited aphasia and right-sided paralysis, and magnetic resonance images showed left cerebral infarction and left internal carotid artery occlusion. The patient was transferred to our hospital for recanalization. Imaging with contrast material showed that the left internal carotid artery was completely occluded. During recanalization, futile attempts were made to advance the wire into the true lumen. The occlusion was aspirated, and angiography then showed an inflow of contrast material into the vessel, which indicated slight distal widening; this widening allowed the wire to move into the true lumen. The occlusion extended distally, and 2 stents were placed over the entire lesion. Good recanalization was eventually achieved.
