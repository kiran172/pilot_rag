Title: Incidence, predictors, and outcome of prosthesis-patient mismatch after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is common, but the incidence, predictors and outcome of PPM are still controversial.
METHODS: A total of 18 articles incorporating 72,016 patients were identified form PubMed and Embase online database.
RESULTS: The pooled incidences of overall, and severe PPM following TAVR were 32.0% and 10.0% separately. Comparing to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), TAVR had lower incidence of overall (OR, 0.31, 95% CI, 0.20-0.50) and severe PPM (OR, 0.38, 95% CI, 0.28-0.52). PPM was associated with a larger body surface area (BSA), larger body mass index (BMI) and previous myocardial infarction in comparison with those patients without PPM. Although PPM was not rare after TAVR, no significant differences were observed both in short- and mid-term all-cause mortality (30 day: OR: 1.51, 95% CI, 0.79-2.87, 1 year: OR: 1.02, 95% CI, 0.96-1.08, and 2 years: OR: 0.99, 95% CI, 0.79-1.24) between patients with PPM and those without PPM.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that the incidence of PPM was lower than that of SAVR, PPM was not seen to have an impact on short- and mid-term survival.
