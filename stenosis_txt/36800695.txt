Title: [Aortic valve reconstruction surgery with Ozaki technique: initials results from a single center].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve (AV) replacement is the gold standard treatment for severe symptomatic AV disease. Recently, AV reconstruction surgery (Ozaki procedure) emerges as a surgical alternative with good results in the medium term.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 37 patients who underwent AV reconstruction surgery between January 2018 and June 2020 in a national reference center in Lima, Peru. The median age was 62 years, interquartile range (IQR: 42-68). The main indication for surgery was AV stenosis (62.2%), in most cases due to bicuspid valve (19 patients, 51.4%). Twenty-two (59.4%) patients had another pathology with surgical indication associated to AV disease, 8 (21.6%) had dilatation of the ascending aorta with indication for replacement.
RESULTS: One in-hospital death occurred (1/38, 2.7%) due to perioperative myocardial infarction. There was a significant reduction in the medians of the peak (70 mmHg, CI 95% = 50.03-79.86 vs. 14 mmHg, CI 95% = 11.93-17.5, p < 0.0001) and mean (45.5 mmHg CI 95% = 30.6-49.68 vs. 7 mmHg, CI 95% = 5.93-9.6, p < 0.0001) AV gradients when we compared baseline characteristics with first 30-days results. In an average of 19 (± 8.9) months of follow-up, survival, reoperation-free survival for valve dysfunction, and survival free of AV insufficiency ≥ II were 97.3%, 100% and 91.9%, respectively. Significant reduction in the medians of the peak and mean AV gradients was maintained.
CONCLUSIONS: AV reconstruction surgery showed optimal results in term of mortality, reoperation-free survival, and hemodynamic characteristics of the neo-AV.
