Title: Clinically Significant Incidental Findings on CT Imaging During TAVI Work-up: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) population is mostly elderly and frail. Clinically significant incidental findings (SIFs) are commonly encountered in the work-up of TAVI patients. This is a systematic review of current literature on the occurrence of SIFs on computed tomography (CT) imaging preceding TAVI and their association with mortality, delayed planning, and procedure cancellation.
METHODS: A systematic search on Medline, Embase, and Cochrane resulted in 19 retrospective studies (published from 2010-2020) reporting SIFs in the work-up for TAVI. A total of 6358 individuals from 19 studies were analyzed, with mean age of 80 years and sex equally divided. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, with weighting based on study size.
RESULTS: Pooled prevalence of patients with SIF was 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8-26.6) and most findings (48.3%) were found in the lungs. Pooled prevalence of new malignancies was 3.4% (95% CI, 2.5-4.4). Higher mortality in patients with SIF was only found in studies with a follow-up period >4 years (hazard ratio, 1.5-1.7). TAVI was more frequently cancelled in patients with SIF vs those with no SIF (ranges, 10.1%-47.1% vs 5.2%-37.0%, respectively). SIF did not delay time to TAVI (ranges, 6-91 days in SIF patients vs 4-81 days in non-SIF patients).
CONCLUSION: SIFs are common in patients screened for TAVI. SIF is associated with a higher risk of TAVI cancellation and with increased mortality risk over the long term, which should be taken into consideration in decision making. These findings may help inform patients and aid patient selection.
