Title: Ileal Ureter Utilization in Patients With Previous Urinary Diversions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a subset of patients who develop strictures requiring Ileal Ureter (IU) in the setting of prior urinary diversion or augmentation (ileal conduits, neobladders, continent urinary diversions). To our knowledge, there are no prior studies on patients with IU substitution into established lower urinary tract reconstructions.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients (18 years) undergoing IU creation from 1989 to 2021 was performed. A total of 160 patients were identified. In total, 19 (12%) patients had IUs into diversions. We examined demographics, stricture cause, diversion type, renal function, and postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients were identified. Sixteen were male. Mean age was 57.7(SD 17.0) years. Diversions included continent urinary reservoirs (4), neobladders (5), ileal conduits (7), and bladder augmentations with Monti channels (3). Fifteen had unilateral surgery, and 4 had bilateral "reverse 7" IU creation. Average length of stay was 7.6 days (SD 2.9). Average follow-up was 32.9 months (SD 27). Mean preoperative creatinine was 1.5 (SD 0.4); mean postoperative creatinine at most recent follow-up was 1.6 (SD 0.7). There was no significant difference between pre- and postoperative creatinine (P = .18). One patient had a ventriculoperitoneal Shunt infection resulting ventriculoperitoneal shunt externalization, 1 had Clostridium difficile infection potentially causing an entero-neobladder fistula, 2 with ileus, 1 urine leak, and 1 wound infection. None required renal replacement therapy.
CONCLUSION: Patients with urinary diversions and prior bowel reconstructive surgeries with subsequent ureteral strictures are a challenging cohort of patients. In properly selected patients, ureteral reconstruction with ileum is feasible and preserves renal function with minimal long-term complications.
