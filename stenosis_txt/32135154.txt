Title: Cryotherapy Ablation in Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease of the Trachea.

Abstract: Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated condition comprising a group of disorders with shared clinicopathologic features. Manifestations of IgG4-RD are increasingly recognized in multiple organs, but tracheal involvement remains rare. Patients may present with a mass in the affected organ and most will respond to glucocorticoids, particularly in early stages of disease; however, between 15% and 60% of patients will experience relapse. We consider cryotherapy effective and safe for tumor debulking and symptomatic relief in IgG4-RD. We report on a case of a patient with upper tracheal stenosis exhibiting marked reduction in tumor size and symptom burden, after cryotherapy ablation.
