Title: Microdebrider Assisted Resection of Suprastomal Lesions via Tracheostoma: A Novel Technique.

Abstract: Subglottic lesions are the commonest airway conditions leading to life threatening complications. Many conditions can present as subglottic lesions and can affect various age groups. There are various methods to manage these conditions described in the literature. We have devised a new method of managing these lesions by using a microdebrider inserted through the tracheal stoma. Here we describe three cases of subglottic lesions with pre-existing tracheostomy managed by this technique. The advantages and the post operative follow up of these patients are described. The follow up of the patients after 1Â year showed significant improvement leading to their decannulation. Thus we would like to publish our results with scope of further research of this technique in this area and the treatment of such conditions affecting upper airway.
