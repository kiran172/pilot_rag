Title: Mitral Valve Endocarditis in Patient Awaiting TAVI: A Case Report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The current literature focuses on the risk of infective endocarditis (IE) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, the risk of IE in patients waiting for TAVI is not well-studied. We present a unique case of a patient waiting for TAVI with decompensated heart failure who was found to have a large mitral vegetation, and consider risk factors for the development of IE in this population.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of an 85-year-old male with severe aortic stenosis and recurrent small bowel angiodysplasias, requiring frequent blood transfusions and intravenous iron. He presented to a peripheral hospital in decompensated heart failure. Transfer was arranged to our center to expedite TAVI, under the premise that worsening aortic stenosis precipitated his decompensated state. Prior to TAVI, an echocardiogram was done, and demonstrated a 30 × 18 mm mass on the mitral valve with anterior leaflet perforation and severe mitral regurgitation. The findings were consistent with IE, and the TAVI was cancelled. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient unfortunately deteriorated and palliative care was provided.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need for further research regarding the risk of IE in patients waiting for TAVI. Current literature focuses on the development and management of IE following TAVI. Clinicians must understand that TAVI candidates have multiple risk factors for IE, including valvular disease, age, and comorbidities. IE should be considered as a possible cause for decompensated heart failure in patients awaiting TAVI.
