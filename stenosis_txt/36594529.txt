Title: Nationwide experience with transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Insights from the POL-CAROTID registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The carotid artery is an alternative access route for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), especially useful in patients unsuitable for traditional access routes including transfemoral (TF), subclavian, transapical, and aortic.
AIMS: To investigate the feasibility and safety of transcarotid (TC) access for TAVI in comparison to the TF approach in a multicenter setting.
METHODS: A total of 41 patients, treated between December 2014 and December 2018, were retrospectively reported to the Polish Registry of Common Carotid Artery Access for TAVI (POL-CAROTID). The median follow-up time was 619 (365-944) days, and Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) definitions were applied. Clinical outcomes were compared with 41 propensity-matched TF-TAVI patients.
RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) patients' age was 78.0 (7.2) years, and 29 patients (70.7%) were men. Prohibitive iliofemoral anatomy and/or obesity (46.3%) and/or the presence of a stent graft in the abdominal aorta (31.7%) were the most common indications for TC-TAVI. Device success for TC-TAVI was comparable with the matched TF-TAVI group (90.2% vs. 95.3%, respectively, P = 0.396), and no periprocedural mortality was observed. Moreover, early safety was similar between the two groups (92.7% vs. 95.3%, respectively, log-rank P = 0.658) with only 1 case of non-disabling stroke during the first month after TC-TAVI. Consequently, no cerebrovascular events were observed in the mid-term, and the clinical efficacy of TC-TAVI corresponded well with TF-TAVI (90.2% vs. 92.7%, respectively, log-rank P = 0.716). A total of 4 (9.8%) deaths were noted in the TC-TAVI cohort in comparison to 3 (7.3%) in the TF-TAVI group.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicated that the first cohort of Polish patients with implantations of second-generation transcarotid transcatheter heart valves had a similar prognosis to TF-TAVI with regard to safety and feasibility. TC access may be considered an optimal alternative for patients in whom the TF approach is precluded.
