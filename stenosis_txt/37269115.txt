Title: Ultrasound-Guided Radial Arterial Catheterization in Patients With Regurgitant and Stenotic Left-Sided Cardiac Valvular Lesions.

Abstract: Background. The pulse characteristics of arterial circulation might affect radial artery catheterization's success rate. Therefore, we hypothesized that the success rate of radial artery catheterization would be lower in the left-sided severe stenotic valvular lesion group than severe regurgitant valvular lesion group. Methods. This prospective study was conducted among patients with left-sided cardiac valvular lesions undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. The patients with left-sided severe valvular stenosis and left-sided severe valvular regurgitation were included in the study. Radial artery cannulation was performed using an ultrasound-guided out-of-plane short-axis approach. The outcome measures were success rate, number of attempts, and cannulation time. Result. One hundred fifty-two patients were recruited for the study, and all were eligible for final analysis. The first attempt success rate was non-significantly higher in the stenotic valvular lesion group than the regurgitant group (69.7% vs 56.6%; P = .09). Furthermore, the number of attempts (median; 95% CI) was significantly higher in the regurgitant group (1; 1.2-1.43 vs 1; 1.38-1.67; P = .04). However, it may not be of clinical relevance. Moreover, the cannulation time and the number of redirections of the cannula were comparable. Heart rate was significantly higher in the regurgitant group (91.8 ± 13.9 vs 82.26 ± 15.92 beats/min; P = .00), while the incidence of atrial fibrillation was significantly higher in the stenotic lesion (P = .00). No failure was reported, and the incidence of periarterial hematoma was comparable. Conclusion. The success rate of ultrasound-guided radial arterial catheterization is comparable in left-sided stenotic valvular and regurgitant lesion groups.
