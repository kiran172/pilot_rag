Title: The Longest Documented Postoperative Survivor of a Brock Procedure 63 Years Later.

Abstract: An infant with critical pulmonary valve stenosis underwent a Brock procedure in 1957 with subsequent repair of pulmonary stenosis and an atrial septal defect at age 6. At age 17 she underwent repair for paradoxical embolization secondary to a residual atrial septal defect. She presented 54 years later with recurrent pulmonary stenosis and a symptomatic 6.2-cm pulmonary artery aneurysm repaired with a 23-mm aortic homograft. This patient is the longest reported postoperative survivor after a Brock procedure. She continues to do well 63 years after her initial surgery.
