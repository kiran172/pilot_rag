Title: Clinical impact of non-lying time on hospital-associated functional decline in older patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: The purposes of the present study were: (1) to investigate the relationship between hospital-associated functional decline (HAFD) and non-lying time and (2) to clarify the optimal cut-off value for non-lying time associated with HAFD in older patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). From January 2021 to December 2022, patients admitted to a university hospital who underwent trans-femoral TAVI were consecutively recruited. We measured short physical performance battery (SPPB) pre and post-TAVI, and non-lying time from post-operative days 3-5. HAFD was defined as at least 1 point decrease in SPPB during pre and post-TAVI. Among 75 patients (47 female, mean age of 84.5 years) enrolled, 14 patients were classified as having HAFD. Non-lying time was significantly shorter in the HAFD group than in the non-HAFD group (371 min vs. 539 min, P < 0.001). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined an optimal cut-off value of 477 min for differentiating the patients more likely to experience HAFD (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 92%; area under the curve, 0.798). The non-lying time could be one of the associated factors of HAFD in older patients with TAVI. Non-lying time of about 480 min (8 h) during hospitalization may be an initial target for preventing HAFD.
