Title: Short Versus Long Antibiotic Therapy and Risk of Recurrence of Acute Cholangitis Due to Malignant Biliary Strictures.

Abstract: Malignancies can cause severe stenosis of the biliary tract and therefore predispose a patient to bacterial cholangitis. Upon endoscopic drainage, antibiotic therapy (AT) is performed according to individual clinical judgement, as the optimal duration of AT is unclear to date, especially in the case of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). In a case-based retrospective study, patients with malignant biliary strictures and acute cholangitis were included upon endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC). The outcome of cases treated with short AT (≤6 days) was compared to that of long AT (≥7 days). Recurrent cholangitis (RC) before scheduled stent exchange was the primary end point. In total, 124 patients were included, with 183 cases of proven cholangitis in total. The overall median duration of AT was 7 days (range 1-20), with 74 cases (40%) receiving short AT and 109 (60%) receiving long AT. Short AT was not an independent risk factor for RC (HR = 0.66, p &gt; 0.2), while colonization with MDROs was associated with a higher risk of RC (HR = 2.21, p = 0.005). Placement of a metal stent was associated with minor risk of RC (HR = 0.4, p = 0.038). In conclusion, short AT is possible in selected patients with non-severe cholangitis and malignant biliary strictures. Scheduled screening for MDROs is recommended and placement of a metal stent should be performed if possible.
