Title: First case report of the use of two stents following coronary artery obstruction during indirect mitral annuloplasty.

Abstract: The case of a 71-year-old male with end stage heart failure and severe mitral regurgitation is presented, where percutaneous indirect mitral annuloplasty was performed. During device implantation in the coronary sinus the circumflex artery was compromised at two anatomic locations, while the mitral regurgitation was efficiently reduced. After weighing risks and alternative therapeutic options, stent implantation was chosen as bailout strategy to leave the device in place and retain the efficient MR reduction. The anatomical proximity of Cx and coronary sinus in the mitral valve plane bears the risk of circumflex artery damage during surgical and interventional mitral repair. Usually, a device exchange solves the problem of arterial flow limitation in most cases. While stent implantation remains off label use in this setting and should not be performed without critical evaluation, it has been performed successfully in similar clinical settings as well (e.g. artery stenosis by surgical suture).
