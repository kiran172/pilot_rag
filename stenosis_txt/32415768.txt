Title: Arterioplasty using gastroepiploic artery patch for common femoral artery occlusive disease.

Abstract: We present the first case of arterioplasty of the common femoral artery performed using a gastroepiploic artery (GEA) patch for a 59-year-old man on haemodialysis. He was incidentally diagnosed with coronary artery disease with left main trunk stenosis and double-vessel disease upon screening examination for peripheral artery disease. Preoperative computed tomography revealed a severely narrowed right common femoral artery. We planned a simultaneous off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) involving the bilateral internal thoracic arteries and GEA, and endarterectomy of the right common femoral artery. Because the remnant GEA was sufficiently long and its diameter was sufficiently large, we used a GEA patch during arterioplasty to preserve the saphenous vein. This method is limited to simultaneous surgery with CABG using GEA but is a useful alternative for preserving the saphenous vein.
