Title: Stroke events after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Temporal relationships and affected brain regions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite continuous improvements in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), periprocedural strokes remain a devastating complication. Randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate a reduction in clinically apparent strokes or mortality after TAVI due to cerebral embolic protection (CEP). To identify potential targets of CEP strategies during TAVI, we evaluated affected brain regions, and temporal patterns of stroke onset in a routine clinical sample.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 3,164 consecutive patients treated with TAVI from 2008 to 2019 at a single center were screened for cerebrovascular events. Affected cerebral regions were determined according to clinical symptoms and brain imaging. Rates of disabling stroke and non-disabling stroke at 30 days were 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. The frequency of all strokes decreased from 5.0% to 3.0% over time (P = .012). Patients with impaired left-ventricular function (OR 2.19), increased CHA2DS2-VASc (OR 1.39) and moderate/severe spontaneous echo contrast (OR 3.60) had a higher stroke risk. Acute symptom onset occurred during TAVI (19.4%), within 24 hours (40.3%) or later (25.0%); 98.3% of strokes were of ischemic origin. In intraprocedural strokes, 53.2% of lesions were found in locations considered protected by current CEP devices, and 37.5% of patients with intraprocedural strokes were exclusively affected in these areas. Baseline or procedural parameters were not associated with embolic distribution patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Most strokes occurred early after TAVI - but not necessarily during the procedure - and affected multiple brain regions only partially protected by current CEP devices. Efficient prevention of cerebrovascular events may require strategies beyond the TAVI procedure to minimize stroke risk and additional randomized controlled trials will be required to clarify the role of CEP in efficient stroke prevention during TAVI.
