Title: Simultaneous Stenting With Edwards SAPIEN Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prestenting of the landing zone for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) with a balloon-expandable valve can dilate a stenotic right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), prevent paravalvar leak (PVL), and protect against conduit tear. Simultaneous stenting (SS) with the Melody valve has been described, but to our knowledge, SS with a SAPIEN valve has not been reported. We report our experience with this novel technique.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent TPVR at Rady Children's hospital and UCSD Medical Center was performed. Patients were included if they had underwent SAPIEN TPVR with SS. Rationale for stent choice was a bare metal stent to relieve long-segment stenosis and covered stents to prevent PVL or to protect against conduit tear.
RESULTS: A total of 17 cases were identified. The majority of RVOTs were transannular patches (n = 9, 56%), with a minimum diameter of 19.6 Â± 5.2 mm, and the most common valve placed was an Edwards SAPIEN 26.0 mm (n = 10, 59%). All SAPIEN valves placed were of the S3 generation. The procedure was successful in all patients, with no conduit tears. Minor complications occurred in 3 patients (17.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous stent deployment with a SAPIEN TPVR is an alternative 1-step technique for patients who require prestenting. SS simplifies the procedure, has low complication rates, and offers the benefits of a longer landing zone and decreased PVL.
