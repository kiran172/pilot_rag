Title: CNS Manifestations in Mucolipidosis Type II-A Retrospective Analysis of Longitudinal Data on Neurocognitive Development and Neuroimaging in Eleven Patients.

Abstract: Mucolipidosis type II (MLII), an ultra-rare lysosomal storage disorder, manifests as a fatal multi-systemic disease. Mental inhibition and progressive neurodegeneration are commonly reported disease manifestations. Nevertheless, longitudinal data on neurocognitive testing and neuroimaging lack in current literature. This study aimed to provide details on central nervous system manifestations in MLII. All MLII patients with at least one standardized developmental assessment performed between 2005 and 2022 were included by retrospective chart review. A multiple mixed linear regression model was applied. Eleven patients with a median age of 34.0 months (range 1.6-159.6) underwent 32 neurocognitive and 28 adaptive behaviour assessments as well as 14 brain magnetic resonance imagings. The scales used were mainly BSID-III (42%) and VABS-II (47%). Neurocognitive testing (per patient: mean 2.9, standard deviation (SD) 2.0) performed over 0-52.1 months (median 12.1) revealed profound impairment with a mean developmental quotient of 36.7% (SD 20.4) at last assessment. The patients showed sustained development; on average, they gained 0.28 age-equivalent score points per month (confidence interval 0.17-0.38). Apart from common (63%) cervical spinal stenosis, neuroimaging revealed unspecific, non-progressive abnormalities (i.e., mild brain atrophy, white matter lesions). In summary, MLII is associated with profound developmental impairment, but not with neurodegeneration and neurocognitive decline.
