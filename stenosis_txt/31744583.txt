Title: Outcome of congenital tracheal stenosis in children over two decades in a national cardiothoracic surgical unit.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the outcomes of congenital tracheal stenosis among children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all children who underwent surgical repair of congenital tracheal stenosis reviewing charts, operative notes, echocardiograms, CT and MRI data from January 2002 to February 2019.
RESULTS: Twenty-six children underwent surgical treatment for tracheal stenosis. The median age was 3 months (range 0.3-35 months) and the median weight was 4.7 kg (range 2.5-13 kg) at the time of surgical intervention. Stridor was the most common presenting symptom in 17 patients (65% of patients). Twenty-one patients (81%) had concurrent cardiac anomalies, with pulmonary arterial sling being the most common, present in nine patients (34%). Extracorporeal life support was utilised in seven patients (27%) pre-operatively. Laryngeal release was required in 16 patients. In 7 patients an end-to-end anastomosis was performed, in 18 patients slide tracheoplasty, and 1 patient had a double slide tracheoplasty. The median cardiopulmonary bypass time was 106 minutes (range 25-255 minutes). The median cross-clamp time was 30 minutes (range 5-67 minutes). The median post-operative duration of ventilation was 5 days (range 0.5-16 days). The median ICU length of stay was 12.5 days (range 2-60 days). There were three hospital mortalities with 88% survival. One patient only required reintervention with balloon dilation. Twenty-two patients (85%) remained symptom-free on median follow-up at 7.6 years (range 0.2-17 years). Two patients since 2017 had 3D printed tracheas produced from CT imaging to assist surgical planning.
CONCLUSION: Congenital tracheal stenosis can be managed effectively with excellent outcomes and 3D printed models assist in planning the optimal surgical intervention.
