Title: Socioeconomic disparity in transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement: a population study of National Inpatient Sample from 2015 to 2020.

Abstract: There is limited data on the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on transcatheter (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) outcomes for aortic stenosis (AS). This study conducted a population-based analysis to assess the influence of SES on valve replacement outcomes. Patients with AS undergoing TAVR or SAVR were identified in National Inpatient Sample from Q4 2015-2020. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to compare in-hospital outcomes between patients living in neighborhoods of income at the lowest and highest quartiles. Of 613,785 AS patients, 9.77% underwent TAVR and 10.13% had SAVR. These rates decline with lower neighborhood income levels, with TAVR/SAVR ratio also declining in lower-income areas. Excluding concomitant procedures, 58,064 patients received isolated TAVR (12,355 low-income and 15,212 high-income) and 43,694 underwent isolated SAVR (10,029 low-income and 10,811 high-income). Low-income patients, in both TAVR and SAVR, were younger but had more comorbid burden. For isolated TAVR, outcomes were similar across income groups. However, for isolated SAVR, low-income patients experienced higher in-hospital mortality (aOR = 1.44, p < 0.01), pulmonary (aOR = 1.13, p = 0.01), and renal complications (aOR = 1.14, p < 0.01). They also had more transfers, longer waits for operations, and extended hospital stays. Lower-income communities had reduced access to TAVR and SAVR, with TAVR accessibility being particularly limited. When given access to TAVR, patients from lower-income neighborhoods had mostly comparable outcomes. However, patients from low-income communities faced worse outcomes in SAVR, possibly due to delays in treatment. Ensuring equitable specialized healthcare resources including expanding TAVR access in economically disadvantaged communities is crucial.
