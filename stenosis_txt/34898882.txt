Title: Usefulness of transaortic approach for a complex double-outlet right ventricle.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Surgical procedures for double-outlet right ventricle with ventricular septal defect are based on rerouting the blood flow of the left ventricle to the aorta through the ventricular septal defect (VSD) with an intraventricular baffle. The right atriotomy is the most common approach combined with a right ventriculotomy in some cases, particularly in pulmonary stenosis association. However, in complex cases, this standard operative strategy may not provide an adequate exposure. We describe the transaortic approach as an alternative procedure to repair a complex case of double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) with subaortic stenosis.
