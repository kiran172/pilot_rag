Title: Simultaneous Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Infrarenal Aortic Aneurysm Repair for Severe Aortic Stenosis and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Report of 2 Cases and Literature Review.

Abstract: The prevalence of concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) has been increasing in the elderly population. Both conditions have adverse outcomes, if not adequately managed. No clear recommendations are available in the literature until today, in regards of the management sequence making thus the decision-making challenging. We report 2 cases of AAA and significant AS treated with endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) during the same procedure and a review of the literature on this topic. Based on our experience, the combined procedure with TAVI followed by EVAR seems to be feasible, safe, and effective while detailed preoperative planning and a carefully tailored management strategy by a multidisciplinary team are essential.
