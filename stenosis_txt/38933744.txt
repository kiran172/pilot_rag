Title: Correlation Between Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Findings at 3 to 6 Weeks and Functional Outcome at 3 Months Following Acute Ischaemic Stroke Due to Extracranial Carotid Artery Atherosclerotic Disease.

Abstract: We wanted to evaluate if optical coherence tomography angiography OCTA findings could predict the functional outcome in extracranial carotid artery atherosclerotic disease (ECAD) associated stroke. This exploratory study was performed on adults with acute ischaemic stroke due to ECAD at 3-6 weeks following stroke onset with risk factor matched controls without carotid artery stenosis. Twenty-three stroke patients (cases) and 23 controls were enrolled. There was significant difference between cases and controls in deep vessel density at the macula (p = .0007) and in radial peripapillary capillary perfusion density (RPCPD) at the optic nerve head (ONH) (p = .0007). Statistically significant difference was noted in the total superficial vessel density (SVD) at the macula (SVD within 1 standard deviation [SD] versus SVD beyond 1 SD of control data) in the ipsilateral eye and functional outcome at 3 months (poor versus very good outcome, modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-1 versus mRS 2-6, respectively; p = .0361). There was statistically insignificant correlation between the RPCPD at the ONH and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission, mRS at discharge, and mRS at 3 months following stroke onset (r = .33, r = .35, r = .39; p = .11, p = .09, p = .06, respectively). The findings of this exploratory study suggested that OCTA findings may predict 3 month outcomes in cases of ECAD-related stroke and could be useful in decision making in future intervention studies as to whether intervene or not in patients having critical or non-critical ECAD for preventing stroke.
