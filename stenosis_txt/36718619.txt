Title: Racial and ethnic differences in aortic stenosis: the tip of the iceberg.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a lack of data on the epidemiology and management of severe aortic stenosis (AS) in diverse populations. We summarize the contemporary literature on the racial and ethnic differences in AS prevalence, treatment and outcomes and discuss possible explanations for these disparities to inform future research and improve the delivery of care to under-represented patient groups.
RECENT FINDINGS: African American (AA) patients have significantly less prevalence of severe AS than White patients whereas paradoxically having higher traditional risk factors for severe AS. Non-White patients have less referral for aortic valve replacement (AVR) after adjusting for clinical and echocardiographic parameters. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are both underutilized in non-White patients. Differences in race and ethnicity have not shown to result in worse in-hospital and long-term survival outcomes after either SAVR or TAVR.
SUMMARY: Much research is warranted to explore the epidemiology, true prevalence and treatment outcomes of severe AS in diverse populations. Greater inclusion of non-White ethnic groups in the primary analysis of prospective trials is needed. Lastly, further research is warranted to explore the complex causes of racial and ethnic disparities in utilization of surgical and transcatheter interventions.
