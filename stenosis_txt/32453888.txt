Title: Role of 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography in guiding transcatheter mitral valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter mitral valve replacement technologies have been developed to treat a wide range of mitral valve pathologies including primary and secondary mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, in addition to degenerative bioprosthetic valves and failed annuloplasty rings.
OBJECTIVE: Transesophageal echocardiography, particularly with use of 3-dimensional imaging is key in successfully guiding these interventions. In this review, we highlight the key role of 3D transesophageal echocardiography in guiding TMVR, including valve-in-native valve, valve-in-prosthetic valve, valve-in-prosthetic ring, and valve-in-mitral annular calcification interventions.
