Title: CT Findings of Central Airway Lesions Causing Airway Stenosis-Visualization and Quantification: A Pictorial Essay.

Abstract: The tracheobronchial tree is a system of airways that allows the passage of air to aerate the lungs and entire body. Several pathological conditions can affect this anatomical region. Multidetector CT (MDCT) helps identify and characterize various large airway diseases. Post-processing tools, such as virtual bronchoscopy and automatic lung analysis, can help enhance the performance of imaging studies. In this pictorial essay review, we provide imaging findings of various bronchial lesions manifested as wall thickening and endoluminal nodules on conventional MDCT and advanced image visualization and analysis.
