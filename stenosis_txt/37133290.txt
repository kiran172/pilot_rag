Title: Balloon-Assisted Catheterization of Occluded Carotid Artery (BOCA) Technique in Acute Stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke from tandem occlusion of internal carotid artery (ICA) poses a technical challenge to neurointerventionalists.
OBJECTIVE: To present a novel balloon-assisted catheterization of occluded carotid artery (BOCA) technique used for rapid and effective catheterization of occluded/critically stenosed ICA in tandem occlusion.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 10 patients with tandem carotid occlusion, treated with BOCA technique for revascularization between July 2020 and June 2021, was performed. Clinical, radiographic, and procedural data; details of BOCA technique; complications; and outcomes were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 10 patients, 8 (80%) had complete occlusion of the cervical ICA and the remaining 2 had high-grade stenosis with poor intracranial flow. The mean age was 63.2 years. The mean presenting NIH Stroke Scale was 13.4. The BOCA technique resulted in recanalization of ICA in all patients and allowed mechanical thrombectomy of middle cerebral artery. Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade 2b/3 was achieved in all 10 patients. The mean groin-to-reperfusion time was 41.4 minutes. The mean internal carotid artery stenosis was 99.7% preoperatively and 41.1% postoperatively. Only one patient needed stent at the end of the procedure because of dissection.
CONCLUSION: The BOCA technique can be used in distal first approach for acute stroke from tandem ICA occlusion. This technique allows direct guide catheterization of occluded ICA by tracking over a partially inflated balloon.
