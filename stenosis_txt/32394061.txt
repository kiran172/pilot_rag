Title: Tricuspid Regurgitation in Adults after Repair of Right Ventricular Outflow Obstructive Lesions.

Abstract: We determined the prevalence and factors associated with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in adults with repair of right ventricular (RV) outflow obstruction. A total of 256 patients (128 males) were studied at 25.7 ± 7.2 years after surgery, of whom 179 had repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), 31 had pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS), and 46 had pulmonary stenosis (PS). The mitral and tricuspid annulus diameters, maximum right atrial (RA) area, RV end-systolic and end-diastolic areas, and tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation were assessed using echocardiography. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe TR was 20.7%. Subgroup analysis revealed that prevalence was greater in patients with repaired TOF (20.7%) and PAIVS (35.5%) than PS patients (10.9%). As a group, severity of TR was found to be correlated with RA area (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), RV end-diastolic (r = 0.28, p < 0.001) and end-systolic (r = 0.22, p = 0.001) areas, and tricuspid valve annulus diameter (r = 0.15, p = 0.022). Moderate-to-severe TR was associated with development of cardiac arrhythmias with an odds ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.1, p = 0.031). Multivariate analysis revealed maximum RA area (β = 0.36, p = 0.016) as an independent determinant of severity of TR. Moderate-to-severe TR occurs in about one-fifth of adults with repaired TOF, PAVIS, and PS and is associated with RA dilation and risk of development of cardiac arrhythmias.
