Title: Modern approaches and innovations in the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral vascular diseases.

Abstract: Amongst the three major vascular beds (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) has traditionally received the least attention, despite its growing global burden. The aging population has led to the increased prevalence of PVD, thereby increasing visibility to its various diagnostic and treatment modalities. In the past decade, research and development of innovations in the management of PVD has exploded. Modern advances in imaging, molecular technology, medical devices, and surgical techniques have reduced the morbidity and mortality of PVD. However, many challenges still remain due to the debilitating and progressive nature of this disease. In this article, we will introduce some common vascular diseases, the state of art in diagnosis and treatment, the limitations of modern technology, and our vision for this field over the next decade.
