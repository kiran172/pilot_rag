Title: Assessing outcomes after thrombectomy with or without iliac vein stenting for young provoked DVT patients with iliac vein stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the outcomes of thrombectomy with/without iliac vein stenting for young and transiently provoked DVT patients with iliac vein stenosis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected multicenter database. Acute, transiently provoked DVT patients between 18 and 45 years old with iliac vein stenosis were included. All patients underwent thrombectomy. Outcomes including the Villalta score, the VEINES-QOL score, and adverse events were evaluated.
RESULTS: The data of 522 patients were collected of whom 75 were included, 58 underwent thrombectomy alone (nonstenting group) and 17 underwent thrombectomy and stenting (stenting group). Within 6 months, the Villalta score of patients in stenting group is lower than that of patients in nonstenting group (6 mo: 0.73 ± 0.77 vs. 1.41 ± 0.56, p = .0004), and the VEINES-QOL score of stenting group is higher than that of nonstenting group (6 mo: 89.00 ± 2.94 vs. 87.47 ± 3.72, p = .2141). At the following follow-ups, the Villalta score (12 mo: 0.56 ± 0.49 vs. 0.60 ± 0.58, p = .8266) and VEINES-QOL score (12 mo: 88.36 ± 2.29 vs. 88.31 ± 3.36, p = .9604) between the two groups are similar.
CONCLUSION: The stenting group had better efficacy within 6 months after intervention, while there was no significant difference in the symptom, signs, and quality of life between two groups after 6 months within a 2-year follow-up.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Registration Number: ChiCTR2200056073).
