Title: Intestinal tuberculosis with small bowel stricture and hemorrhage as the predominant manifestation: Three case reports.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intestinal tuberculosis is a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that mainly affects the ileum and cecum. Small bowel tuberculosis, characterized by predominant involvement of the small intestine, is an extremely rare condition with highly atypical clinical presentations, making diagnosis even more challenging.
CASE SUMMARY: We report three cases of small intestinal tuberculosis, two of the patients presented primarily with abdominal pain, and one presented with gastrointestinal bleeding. All patients underwent blood tests and imaging examinations. Small bowel endoscopy (SBE) revealed that the main lesions in these patients were intestinal stenosis or gastrointestinal bleeding caused by small intestinal ulcers. One patient ultimately underwent surgical treatment. Following a complex diagnostic process and comprehensive analysis, all patients were confirmed to have small intestinal tuberculosis and received standard antituberculosis treatment, leading to an improvement in their condition.
CONCLUSION: Patients with SBTs present with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and occasional gastrointestinal bleeding. Accurate diagnosis requires a thorough evaluation of clinical symptoms and various tests to avoid misdiagnosis and complications.
