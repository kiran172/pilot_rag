Title: ST-Segment Alterations in the Electrocardiogram of Acute Pulmonary Thromboembolism: A Rabbit Model.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying electrocardiogram (ECG) alterations in a rabbit model of acute pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). Twelve healthy adult New Zealand white rabbits were used, with eight in the experimental group (PTE group) and four in the control group. After developing the rabbit model of acute PTE, ECG and coronary angiography were performed. HE staining was conducted on the right and left ventricular tissues, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?), and Troponin I (TNI) mRNA expression in the myocardium. There were considerable changes in the ST segment of the ECG in the PTE group. Coronary angiography revealed the absence of spasm, stenosis, and occlusion. In the plasma of the PTE group, the levels of D-dimer, BNP, TNF-?, and TNI were significantly elevated, and these changes were statistically significant (P<0.05). PCR analysis of ventricular myocardial tissue indicated significantly higher levels of BNP, TNF-?, and TNI mRNA in the PTE group than in the control group. These differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). The ST-T variations on the ECG of rabbits with acute PTE correlate strongly with the temporary changes in right heart volume caused by acute PTE.
