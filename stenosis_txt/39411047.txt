Title: Successful Surgical Management of Severe Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction Caused by Cardiac Rhabdomyoma in a Neonate.

Abstract: Cardiac rhabdomyoma is the most common primary cardiac tumor in infants and can be diagnosed by fetal echocardiography. This benign tumor can be found in various locations within the heart, including the left ventricle, right ventricle, or septum, and is typically multiple. While spontaneous regression may occur, hemodynamic disorders, arrhythmias, and sudden death have also been reported. Surgical treatment is recommended for life-threatening ventricular outflow tract stenosis, heart failure, and arrhythmias. This case report presents a successful surgical treatment approach in a newborn with rhabdomyoma that caused severe left ventricular outflow tract stenosis.
