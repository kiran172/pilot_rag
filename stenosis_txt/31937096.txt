Title: Detection of significant left renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dysplasia with selective angiography.

Abstract: A 22-year-old female, was referred with a history of a headache and elevated blood pressure without family history of hypertension or familial dyslipidemia. Initially, a spiral computed tomographic angiography of the renal arteries was conducted, demonstrating completely abnormal left renal artery at the medial portion of the vessel with suspicious stenosis, which was supposed to be due to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Subsequently, the patient underwent selective renal angiography and balloon angioplasty. Severe stenosis was observed on the left side and moderate stenosis on the right side in the medial and proximal part of the vessels, respectively. After the diagnosis of FMD, the left side was treated by balloon and finally, the patient was discharged with good control of blood pressure by losartan/amlodipine treatment.
