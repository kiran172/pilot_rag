Title: Ovarian Ectopic Pregnancy in a Female With Mitral Valve Repair and Mitral Stenosis: A Case Report on a Rare Type of Ectopic Pregnancy.

Abstract: Ovarian ectopic pregnancy (OEP) occurs in cases where the fertilized egg is implanted outside the uterus in either of the ovaries. Assisted reproductive technologies and intrauterine device failure are high-risk factors associated with ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Pregnancies categorized under OEP have a higher risk of serious morbidities to maternal health. Clinical presentations of OEP are usually noted as abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Transvaginal ultrasound is considered the preferred primary modality for the diagnosis of OEC. It can be life threatening, especially in patients with mitral valve replacement (MVR) or heart diseases like rheumatic heart disease, majorly due to anticoagulant therapy. Pregnancy in MVR-mitral stenosis patients has been reported to have an increased risk of obstetric hemorrhage, miscarriage, and associated complications during delivery. Management of OEP depends on the patient's physical and clinical condition, with a primary focus on preserving the affected ovary function. This is a case of a 35-year-old pregnant female with a history of MVR presented with per vaginal bleeding and ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Radio imaging showed the product of conception attached to the right ovarian cyst. The patient was counseled for exploratory laparotomy and subsequently had right ovarian cystectomy alone with bilateral tubal ligation by modified Pomeroy's method.
