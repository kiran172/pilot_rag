Title: Prevalence and Predictors of Atherosclerotic Peripheral Arterial Obstructive Disease in Severe Heart Valve Diseases.

Abstract: Despite witnessing an upsurge in heart valve diseases (HVDs), the correlation between HVDs and atherosclerotic peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and predictors of PAOD in HVDs.In this study, a total of 245 consecutive patients were examined: 153 with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS), 66 with severe primary mitral valve regurgitation (MR), and 26 with severe pure native aortic valve regurgitation (AR). All patients underwent ultrasound scan of the carotid artery to ascertain the presence of internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS). ICAS was defined as a peak systolic velocity ≥ 125 cm/second and/or ≥ 50% reduction in diameter. In addition, we measured the ankle-brachial index in each leg using a volume plethysmograph. A result of ≤ 0.9 was considered lower extremity artery disease (LEAD).The presence of ICAS was statistically more frequent in patients with severe AS than in patients with severe MR and AR (11.1% versus 1.5% versus 3.8%; P = 0.038). LEAD was present in patients with severe AS (17.6%) and MR (10.6%) but not in patients with severe AR (P = 0.037). The multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of severe AS (OR, 5.6 [1.3-24.9]; P = 0.023) was an independent predictor for ICAS, while history of coronary artery disease (OR, 4.8 [2.2-10.5]; P < 0.001) was an independent predictor for LEAD.The prevalence of PAOD varies depending on each valvular disease. Individual screening should be considered on the basis of atherosclerotic risk factors, especially for patients with severe AS.
