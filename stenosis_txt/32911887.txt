Title: ["Point line anterograde dissection" for the safe preparation of supraclavicular flap].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the application in the preparation of supraclavicular island flap by "point line anterograde dissection (PLAD) ". Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 45 flaps of 43 patients treated with supraclavicular artery island flap from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Beijing Tongren Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University from January 2013 to June 2019. The patients were all male, aged 35-72 years old. There were 26 cases of hypopharyngeal cancer, 4 cases of recurrent laryngeal cancer, 2 cases of cervical esophageal cancer, 1 case of tonsillar cancer, 1 case of parotid gland cancer, 3 cases of postoperative pharyngeal fistula after hypopharyngeal cancer, 2 cases of esophageal fistula after trauma, 2 cases of esophageal stricture after hypopharyngeal carcinoma operation, 1 case of autoimmune laryngeal stenosis, and 1 case of cheek defect after maxillary sinus cancer operation."Point" was the origin of the supraclavicular artery in the transverse carotid artery. "Line" was an extension line made along the starting point of the supraclavicular vessel for anterograde anatomy of 1-2 cm and the direction of the blood vessel. The extension line was used as the central axis of the designed island flap. Characteristics of flap blood supply, the time of flap preparation, flap survival, donor area recovery and clinical follow-up were recorded. Results: The arterial blood supply of the flap was constant, and the venous reflux was variable. The area of the prepared flap was (4-8) cm√ó(10-18) cm, and the preparation time was 30-60 min, with a median of 42 min. Skin flap survival rate was 100%. Partial necrosis of skin flap occurred in 1 patient and postoperative pharyngeal fistula occurred in 5 patients, all of whom were cured by dressing change. The donor site defects were closed and sutured directly. 3 patients had partial incision dehiscence and healed after dressing change. During the follow-up, 1 patient was lost, and the remaining 42 patients were followed up for 8 to 55 months.40 patients involved swallowing function, all of them returned to regular diet or soft fluid after operation.40 patients involved malignant tumors and local tumor recurrence in 3 patients among whom, there were 2 cases of lymph node recurrence, and 2 cases of distant metastasis, including 1 case of lung metastasis and 1 case of bone metastasis. Conclusion: PLAD is a simple, safe and efficient method for the preparation of supraclavicular island flap.
