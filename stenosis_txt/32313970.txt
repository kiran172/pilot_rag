Title: [Postacute care after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)].

Abstract: With increasing age valvular heart disease is among the most frequent diseases of the heart. Relevant valvular disease impairs not only the long-term prognosis but also physical resilience, activities of daily living and the quality of life. In cases of middle to high-grade symptomatic cardiac defects, valve replacement or valve reconstruction is still the surgical procedure of choice; however, in recent years the transcatheter percutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVI) procedure has become more prominent for the most frequent defect, aortic valve stenosis. This article provides an overview of the aftercare and rehabilitation of patients following a TAVI intervention.
