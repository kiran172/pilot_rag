Title: Double intrathoracic arterial cannulation plus peripheral cannulation for whole-body perfusion in an infant.

Abstract: We report a technique for distal body perfusion in an infant with hypoplastic aortic arch and isthmus stenosis by ultrasound- guided cannulation of the femoral artery using an intra-arterial vascular sheath establishing whole-body perfusion by triple cannulation.
