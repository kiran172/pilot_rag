Title: Rotational Atherectomy Complicated by Coronary Perforation Is Associated With Poor Outcomes: Analysis of 10,980 Cases From the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society Database.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rotational atherectomy (RA) during PCI is linked to a higher likelihood coronary perforations (CP). However, the evidence base on incidence, predictors and outcomes of this complication in RA-PCI remains limited.
METHODS: Using the British Cardiac Intervention Society database, data were analysed on all RA-PCI procedures in UK 2007-2014. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine baseline, procedural and outcome associations.
RESULTS: During 10,980 RA-PCI procedures, 167 CPs were recorded (1.52%) with a stable annual incidence. Baseline and procedural covariates associated with higher rates of RA perforation were number of stents used, female gender, smoking, and left-main stenosis. CP was significantly associated with shock, DC cardioversion, heart block, transfusion, emergency surgery, periprocedural MI, in-hospital major bleed, acute kidney injury, dissection, side branch loss and in-hospital death. CP was also associated with higher rates of in-hospital MACCE (OR 12.22, 95% CI 7.67-19.47), 30-day mortality (OR 10.02, 95% CI 5.87-17.09) and 12-month mortality (OR 3.90, 95% CI 2.53-6.02).
CONCLUSIONS: CP is more frequent in RA-PCI than all-comer PCI and is associated with a significant burden of morbidity and mortality. There are a limited number of baseline and procedural co-variates associated with CP in RA-PCI, making it difficult to predict.
