Title: Gastric outlet obstruction in an 11-year-old girl: A case report.

Abstract: Pyloric stenosis commonly affects infants and rarely causes gastric outlet obstruction in adolescents and older children. We present the case of an 11-year-old girl with a 2-month history of recurrent postprandial vomiting and weight loss. On physical examination, the patient presented with abdominal distension. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a very small pyloric orifice through which the endoscope could not be advanced. Abdominal ultrasonography and a computed tomography confirmed pylorus thickening. She underwent Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty with symptom resolution.
