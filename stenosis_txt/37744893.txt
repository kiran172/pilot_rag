Title: Kounis and Takotsubo, Two Syndromes Bound by Adrenaline: The "ATAK" Complex.

Abstract: Background. The term "ATAK" complex has been coined by the association of adrenaline, takotsubo, anaphylaxis and Kounis syndrome. We present an uncommon case of an "ATAK" complex with biphasic onset and a midventricular takotsubo pattern. Case Summary. A 50-year-old male was brought to the emergency department in anaphylactic shock. He had progressive exertional dyspnea and angina for the past 2 days. The intravenous administration of adrenaline for anaphylactic shock resulted in chest pain and concerning ECG repolarization findings. The patient was immediately transferred to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography showed a midventricular ballooning pattern without significant coronary stenosis, with subsequent recovery during hospitalization, suggestive of takotsubo syndrome. The allergy tests remained inconclusive for the trigger. Discussion. Adrenaline-mediated stress is the link between these two entities, in which Kounis syndrome itself or anaphylactic shock treatment (adrenaline) are potential triggers for takotsubo syndrome.
