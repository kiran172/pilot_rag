Title: Rare Cause of Severe Mitral Regurgitation after TAVI: Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Pre-procedure mitral regurgitation (MR) is a frequent coexistent finding in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and most of them (up to 55%) experience a significant improvement in MR after the procedure. Although seldom described, mitral valve perforation after TAVR is a potentially serious complication that physicians should be aware of, as moderate or severe MR in TAVR recipients is associated with a high early mortality rate. We herein describe the case of a 65-year-old man presenting with worsening heart failure symptoms 5 months after TAVR due to an intraprocedural anterior mitral leaflet perforation and discuss the diagnostic process and therapeutic course of the case. Furthermore, we draw attention to the essential role of echocardiography in the management of TAVR procedures, taking into account its ability in detecting early complications, and emphasize the value of CT as a main determinant to predict long-term MR improvement after TAVR and to assess the potential candidates for double valve repair with percutaneous techniques.
