Title: Quantifying the Effect of Body Habitus on Cardiac Auscultation Via Computational Hemoacoustics.

Abstract: The effect of body habitus on auscultation of heart murmurs is investigated via computational hemoacoustic modeling. The source of the heart murmur is first obtained from a hemodynamic simulation of blood flow through a stenosed aortic valve. This sound source is then placed at the aortic valve location in four distinct human thorax models, and the propagation of the murmur in each thorax model is simulated by solving the elastic wave equations in the time-domain. Placing the same sound source in different thorax models allows for the disambiguation of the effect of body habitus on cardiac auscultation. The surface acceleration resulting from the murmur on each subject's chest surface shows that subjects with higher body-mass index and thoracic cross-sectional area yield smaller acceleration values for the S1 sound. Moreover, the spectral analysis of the signal shows that slope from linear regression in the normal heart sound frequency range (10-150 Hz) is larger for children at the aortic, pulmonic, and mitral auscultation points compared to that for adults. The slope in the murmur frequency range (150-400 Hz) was larger for female subjects at the mitral point compared to that for male subjects. The trends from the results show the potential of the proposed computational method to provide quantitative insights regarding the effect of various anatomical factors on cardiac auscultation.
