Title: Features of Carotid Endarterectomy in Russia. How do we Resolution Issues?

Abstract: This review of the literature discusses the solution of unresolved issues related to carotid endarterectomy in Russia: (1) A program has been created for choosing the tactics of revascularization of patients with simultaneous atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary and carotid arteries; (2) Using the methods of computer modeling, studying the genetics and morphology of restenosis, it was found that the classic carotid endarterectomy with plasty of the reconstruction zone with a patch is an unsafe type of revascularization; (3) An eversion carotid endarterectomy with transposition of the internal carotid artery over the hypoglossal nerve has been developed, which makes it possible to prevent damage to the latter during repeated carotid endarterectomy for restenosis; (4) It has been established that carotid endarterectomy is associated with a high risk of complications in patients over 75 years of age; (5) It has been proven that emergency carotid endarterectomy in the first hours after the development of a stroke is not safe because. combined with the maximum number of all non-favorable cardiovascular events; (6) 3 new types of carotid endarterectomy with carotid glomus preservation have been developed.
