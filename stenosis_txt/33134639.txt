Title: Mycotic right subclavian artery aneurysm: a rare and challenging pathology.

Abstract: Mycotic subclavian artery aneurysms are rare but challenging pathology. We report a 67-year-old woman who presented with recurrent bacteremia secondary to chronic clavicular osteomyelitis. Imaging demonstrated a right subclavian artery aneurysm near the innominate artery bifurcation and in close proximity to the infected clavicle. Owing to the anatomic location, among other factors, she underwent open repair using a rifampin-soaked Dacron conduit. Analysis of the aneurysm wall identified bacteria consistent with intraoperative bone and blood cultures. Contributions from multiple surgical and medical specialties provided a favorable, long-term outcome for the patient.
