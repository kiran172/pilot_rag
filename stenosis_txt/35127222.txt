Title: Localized kinking during deployment of a flow redirection lumen device (FRED) could be due to excessive pushing.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy analysis of flow redirection lumen device (FRED) demonstrated the excellent safety profile of FREDs for aneurysm treatment. We describe the first case in which FRED deployment for a paraclinoid aneurysm resulted in in-stent stenosis, necessitating balloon angioplasty, and an additional stent.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old woman had a left paraclinoid aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 6.1 mm. We planned FRED deployment. We experienced in-stent stenosis just after the deployment of a FRED. Devices such as guidewires and catheters could not cross the lesion through the FRED because of an obstruction in the FRED. Balloon angioplasty and subsequent stenting resolved thrombosis and kinking. FRED has potential for kinking locally.
CONCLUSION: Surgeons should consider this possibility when treating cerebral aneurysm using FRED. Cone-beam computed tomography after deployment of FRED may be useful for evaluating the stent shape.
