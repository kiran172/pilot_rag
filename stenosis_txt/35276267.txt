Title: In-hospital complications and long-term outcomes associated with timing of carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid revascularization performed within 2 weeks of symptoms has proven to reduce risk of recurrent stroke in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. However, the optimal timing of revascularization within the 2-week window has yet to be determined. The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive analysis of in-hospital and long-term outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed within different time intervals after most recent symptoms.
METHODS: We analyzed 2003 to 2016 data from the Vascular Quality Initiative Vascular Implant Surveillance and Interventional Outcomes Network. Only revascularizations performed for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were included. Procedures were categorized as urgent (0-2 days from latest symptom), early (3-14 days), or late (15-180 days). The primary in-hospital outcome was stroke/death. The primary long-term outcomes of interest were 5-year recurrent ipsilateral stroke/death. Multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression were utilized to compare outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 18,970 revascularizations were included: 1130 (6.0%) urgent, 4643 (24.5%) early, and 13,197 (69.6%) late. Earlier CEA had increased odds of in-hospital stroke/death compared with late CEA (urgent: adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.8; P = .001; early: adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2; P < .001). No differences were seen in 5-year risk of stroke/death (urgent: adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79-1.15; P = .592; early: adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.07; P = .928).
CONCLUSIONS: Urgent and early CEA were associated with increased perioperative risk without difference in 5-year outcomes compared with late CEA. Short-term recurrent stroke prevention could not be assessed. Updated population-based studies comparing recurrent stroke prevention with urgent or early revascularization vs best medical management are warranted.
