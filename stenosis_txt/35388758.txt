Title: Choroidal Changes in Carotid Stenosis Patients After Stenting Detected by Swept-source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) patients show reduced blood flow in the ophthalmic artery. This study aimed to assess the changes in the choriocapillaris and choroidal thickness in patients with unilateral carotid artery stenosis after carotid stenting using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT)/swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SSOCTA).
METHODS: Fifty-three mild to moderate CAS patients and 40 controls were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and SS-OCT/SS-OCTAA imaging before and 4 days after carotid artery stenting. SS-OCTA was used to image and measure the perfusion of the choriocapillaris (mm2), while SS-OCT was used to image and measure the choroidal thickness (Î¼m). The stenosed side was described as the ipsilateral eye, while the other side was the contralateral eye.
RESULTS: Choroidal thickness was significantly thinner (P = 0.024) in CAS when compared with controls. Ipsilateral eyes of CAS patients showed significantly thinner (P = 0.008) choroidal thickness when compared with contralateral eyes. Ipsilateral eyes of CAS patients showed thicker (P = 0.027) choroidal thickness after carotid artery stenting, while contralateral eyes showed thinner choroidal thickness (P = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: Our report suggests that in vivo quantification of the choroid with the SS-OCT/SSOCTA may allow monitoring of CAS and enable the assessment of purported treatments.
