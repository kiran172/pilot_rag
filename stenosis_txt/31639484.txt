Title: Angioplasty Using Drug-Coated Balloons in Ostial Vertebral Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ostial vertebral artery stenosis (OVAS) is a relevant cause of acute ischemic posterior circulation stroke. Percutaneous trans-luminal angioplasty (PTA) might offer a promising treatment modality, but restenosis rate is high. So far, little is known about recanalization using drug-coated balloons (DCB) in OVAS. We aimed to show feasibility and safety of DCB-PTA in OVAS.
METHODS: Retrospective, monocenter case series of 12 patients with ostial vertebral artery stenosis (≥50%) treated with PTA using a drug-coated balloon.
RESULTS: Median age was 69.5 years (IQR 57-78.5) with a female rate of 41%. Patients were treated either with a SeQuent Please NEO or Neuro Elutax SV DEB. Median preinterventional stenosis degree was 75% (IQR 70-85) with a median lesion length of 4.5 mm (IQR 4-7.5). Median postinterventional stenosis degree was 40% (IQR 27-50). All treated vessels remained patent. No major complications such as dissection, vessel perforation, hemorrhage, or ischemic events occurred. Moreover, we did not detect any restenosis during a median follow-up period of 6.1 months. The clinical outcome was excellent with median mRS scale of 0 (IQR 0-1).
CONCLUSIONS: PTA using drug-coated balloons is feasible and safe in patients with ostial vertebral artery stenosis.
