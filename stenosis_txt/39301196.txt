Title: Malignant Airway Stenosis Successfully Treated Using a Combination of Interventional Pulmonology, Chemotherapy, and Radiotherapy.

Abstract: Interventional pulmonology can be helpful in cases of malignant airway stenosis. We present a 73-year-old man diagnosed with lung cancer who presented with symptomatic airway stenosis caused by a large endobronchial tumor. Oncological treatment was started with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and a multimodality bronchoscopic approach using balloon bronchoplasty, electrosurgery, and argon plasma coagulation. Response evaluation showed relief of symptoms, disappearance of the endobronchial tumor, and complete resolution of the airway stenosis.
