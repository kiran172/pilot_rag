Title: Myocardial CT perfusion compared with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in evaluation of the coronary microvascular function: An iPOWER substudy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A significant number of women with angina and no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD; <50% stenosis) have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) which carries an adverse cardiovascular prognosis. Coronary microvascular function can be evaluated by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) as a coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) and by static CT myocardial perfusion (CTP) as a myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR). Whether these methods are correlated is not known. We assessed the correlation between CFVR and MPR and investigated whether women with angina, CMD and no obstructive CAD have reduced MPR compared with asymptomatic women.
METHODS: Static CTP with adenosine-induced vasodilation and TTDE of the left anterior descending artery with dipyridamole-induced vasodilation were successfully performed and analysed in 99 women with stable angina and no obstructive CAD and 33 asymptomatic women with no obstructive CAD. CMD was defined as CFVR < 2.
RESULTS: Correlation between rate-pressure product corrected MPR and CFVR was weak but significant (r = .23; p = .007). MPR was highest among asymptomatic women with normal CFVR (median [interquartile range; IQR] 158 [145-181] %). Symptomatic women with normal CFVR had reduced MPR (148 [134-162] %; age-adjusted p < .001); however, the lowest MPR was found in symptomatic women with CMD (140 [129-164] %; age-adjusted p < .001), independent of cardiovascular risk factors and haemodynamic parameters (p = .017).
CONCLUSION: Women with angina, CMD and no obstructive CAD had markedly diminished MPR compared with asymptomatic women. Correlation between CFVR and MPR was weak, suggesting that CTP and TTDE are not interchangeable for detection of CMD.
