Title: Superficial femoral vein transposition as a solution for hemodialysis vascular access.

Abstract: The significant growth in the number of individuals dependent on hemodialysis for renal replacement therapy and unrestricted use of short and long-term catheters have challenged vascular surgeons in search of solutions for patients whose options for access via the upper limbs have been exhausted and for the increasing rates of central venous stenosis in these patients. When access via the upper limbs is impossible, exceptional techniques can be used and the lower limbs offer feasible alternative vascular access sites for hemodialysis. This article reports a case of superficial femoral vein transposition to make a loop arteriovenous fistula in a patient with no possibility of access via the upper limbs and presents a literature review on this technique that remains little used.
