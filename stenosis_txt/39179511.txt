Title: Challenging Conventional Treatment: Retrograde Implantation of a Covered Stent in Superior Mensenteric Artery Occlusion Case.

Abstract: Background: This case report describes a novel endovascular technique for treating superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion, a condition leading to chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI). Traditional treatment methods for CMI, primarily due to SMA stenosis, are often complex and risky, particularly for patients unsuitable for conventional surgery. Objective: This study details the application of retrograde recanalization followed by the deployment of a VIABAHN covered stent in a patient with complete SMA ostium occlusion. Methods: The procedure's success in re-establishing mesenteric blood flow demonstrates its potential as a less invasive, safer alternative to traditional surgical approaches. This technique's innovation lies in its retrograde approach, allowing for effective treatment in cases where antegrade access is unfeasible. Results: The patient showed significant symptom improvement without procedural complications, underscoring the method's efficacy and safety. Conclusion: These findings suggest that retrograde stent implantation can be a viable option for managing SMA occlusions, especially in high-risk surgical cases. The successful application of this technique in this case contributes to the evolving landscape of endovascular interventions in vascular surgery and offers a promising direction for future research and clinical practice in treating SMA-related conditions.
