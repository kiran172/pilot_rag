Title: Unraveling a rare cause of spinal stenosis: Coexistent AL and ATTR amyloidosis involving the ligamentum flavum.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Amyloidosis is a protein misfolding disorder that leads to the deposition of beta-pleated sheets of a fibrillar derivative of various protein precursors. Identification of the type of precursor protein is integral in treatment decision-making. The presence of two different types of amyloid in the same patient is unusually rare, and there are no previous reports of two different types of amyloid deposition in the ligamentum flavum (LF) in the same patient.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we describe two patients with spinal stenosis who underwent laminectomies and were found to have AL and ATTR amyloid deposits in the LF.
CONCLUSION: As the spine is becoming recognized as a site for ATTRwt amyloid deposition, patients undergoing spinal decompression surgery may potentially benefit from evaluation for amyloidosis in the LF.
