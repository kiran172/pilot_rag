Title: The Heart-Team Approach for the Treatment of Radiation-Induced Aortic Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease: A Case Report.

Abstract: We describe the case of a 54-year-old woman admitted to the cardiology ward for the correction of radiation-induced aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease. After careful workup, she underwent surgical aortic valve replacement and aortocoronary bypass with venous grafts. This case demonstrates the late cardiovascular complications that can develop after radiation therapy for cancer, and the surgical complexity of these patients. Thorough workup is needed for the treatment of radiation-induced valvulopathy and coronary artery disease, as these patients are often poor surgical candidates with hostile chests. Multidisciplinary heart-team assessment is paramount, and consideration should be given to catheter-based approaches.
