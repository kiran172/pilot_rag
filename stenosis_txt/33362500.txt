Title: Validation and Diagnostic Performance of a CFD-Based Non-invasive Method for the Diagnosis of Aortic Coarctation.

Abstract: Purpose: The clinical diagnosis of aorta coarctation (CoA) constitutes a challenge, which is usually tackled by applying the peak systolic pressure gradient (PSPG) method. Recent advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have suggested that multi-detector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA)-based CFD can serve as a non-invasive PSPG measurement. The aim of this study was to validate a new CFD method that does not require any medical examination data other than MDCTA images for the diagnosis of CoA. Materials and methods: Our study included 65 pediatric patients (38 with CoA, and 27 without CoA). All patients underwent cardiac catheterization to confirm if they were suffering from CoA or any other congenital heart disease (CHD). A series of boundary conditions were specified and the simulated results were combined to obtain a stenosis pressure-flow curve. Subsequently, we built a prediction model and evaluated its predictive performance by considering the AUC of the ROC by 5-fold cross-validation. Results: The proposed MDCTA-based CFD method exhibited a good predictive performance in both the training and test sets (average AUC: 0.948 vs. 0.958; average accuracies: 0.881 vs. 0.877). It also had a higher predictive accuracy compared with the non-invasive criteria presented in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines (average accuracies: 0.877 vs. 0.539). Conclusion: The new non-invasive CFD-based method presented in this work is a promising approach for the accurate diagnosis of CoA, and will likely benefit clinical decision-making.
