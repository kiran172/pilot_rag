Title: Pulmonary vein stenosis: Anatomic considerations, surgical management, and outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate outcomes of pulmonary vein stenosis repair in a large single-center cohort.
METHODS: Clinical data from a pulmonary vein stenosis registry were retrospectively reviewed identifying patients who underwent pulmonary vein stenosis repair. The primary/index operation was defined as the patient's first pulmonary vein stenosis operation during the study period.
RESULTS: Between January 2007 and August 2019, 174 patients underwent pulmonary vein stenosis repair. Bilateral pulmonary vein stenosis occurred in 111 patients (64%); 71 patients (41%) had 4-vessel disease. Fifty-nine patients (34%) had primary pulmonary vein stenosis. Median age was 9 months (interquartile range, 5-27) and weight was 6.5 kg (4.7-10.2). Surgical techniques evolved and included ostial resection, unroofing, reimplantation, sutureless, modified sutureless, and a newer anatomically focused approach of pulmonary vein stenosis resection with lateralization or patch enlargement of the pulmonary vein-left atrium connection. Twenty-three patients (13%) required reoperation. Cumulative 2-year incidence of postoperative transcatheter intervention (balloon dilation ± stenting) was 64%. One-, 2-, and 5-year survivals were 71.2%, 66.8%, and 60.6%, respectively. There was no association between surgery type and reoperation rate (hazard ratio, 2.38, P = .25) or transcatheter intervention (hazard ratio, 0.97, P = .95). The anatomically focused repair was associated with decreased mortality on univariate (hazard ratio, 0.38, P = .042) and multivariable analyses (hazard ratio, 0.19, P = .014). Antiproliferative chemotherapy was also associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.47, P = .026).
CONCLUSIONS: This large single-center surgical pulmonary vein stenosis experience demonstrates encouraging midterm results. A new anatomically focused repair strategy aims to alleviate pulmonary vein angulation to minimize turbulence and shows promising early outcomes. Continued follow-up is required to understand longer-term outcomes for this surgical approach.
