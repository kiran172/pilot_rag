Title: Unanticipated Difficult Airway During Elective Surgery: A Case Report and Review of Literature.

Abstract: Difficult airway during anesthesia is responsible for several cases of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially when it is unanticipated. Patients with either history of or with predictive factors of a difficult airway show better outcomes since all preventative measures will ensure patient safety. Approximately 30% of all deaths attributed to anesthesia are related to unsuccessful intubation. In this article, we discuss a patient who had a tracheostomy following an unanticipated difficult airway with undiagnosed subglottic stenosis and also reviewed the current literature on the difficult airway.
