Title: Application of the radial artery after angiography in patients undergoing total arterial coronary revascularization.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: There is growing evidence supporting the utilization of the radial artery as a secondary arterial graft in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. However, debates continue over the recovery period of the radial artery following angiography. This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes and experiences related to the use of the radial artery post-angiography in total arterial coronary revascularization.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on data from patients who underwent total arterial CABG surgery at the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital from July 1, 2020, to September 30, 2022. Preoperative assessments included ultrasound evaluations of radial artery blood flow, diameter, intimal integrity, and the Allen test. Additionally, pathological examinations of the distal radial artery and coronary artery CT angiography were conducted, along with postoperative follow-up to assess the safety and efficacy of using the radial artery in patients undergoing total arterial CABG.
RESULTS: A total of 117 patients, compromising 102 males and 15 females with an average age of 60.0 ± 10.0 years, underwent total arterial CABG. The internal mammary artery was used in situ in 108 cases, while in 4 cases, it was grafted to the ascending aorta due to length limitations. Bilateral radial arteries were utilized in 88 patients, and bilateral internal mammary arteries in 4 patients. Anastomoses of the proximal radial arteries to the proximal ascending aorta included 42 cases using distal T-anastomosis and 4 using sequential grafts. The interval between bypass surgery and coronary angiography ranged from 7 to 14 days. Pathological examination revealed intact intima and continuous elastic membranes with no significant inflammatory infiltration or hyperplastic lumen stenosis in the radial arteries. There were no hospital deaths, 3 cases of perioperative cerebral infarction, 1 secondary thoracotomy for hemorrhage control, 21 instances of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) assistance, and 2 cases of poor wound healing that improved following debridement. CT angiography performed 2 weeks post-surgery showed no internal mammary artery occlusions, but 4 radial artery occlusions were noted.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasound may be used within 2 weeks post-angiography to assess the recovery of the radial artery in some patients. Radial arteries with intact intima may be considered in conjunction with the internal mammary artery for total arterial coronary CABG. However, long-term outcomes of these grafts require further validation through larger prospective studies.
