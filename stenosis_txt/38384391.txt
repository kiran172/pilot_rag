Title: Successful Retrieval of Filter Embolic Protection Device Fragment Trapped by a Carotid Stent: A Case Report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Embolic protection devices are useful for preventing distal embolism during carotid artery stenting (CAS); however, complications have been reported. The successful removal of a filter fragment trapped at the distal edge of a carotid stent during the retrieval procedure is described.
CASE PRESENTATION: CAS was performed for internal carotid artery stenosis in a patient in his 70s, and the carotid stent was successfully placed. During the retrieval procedure, the tip of the filter was trapped at the distal edge of the stent and detached from the filter. Using a snare kit, the filter tip was successfully retrieved, and no postoperative neurological symptoms occurred.
CONCLUSION: The edge of a carotid stent can potentially trap devices. When trapping or fragmentation of a device is suspected, it is necessary to evaluate the situation and cause, and the device should be appropriately retrieved without using force.
