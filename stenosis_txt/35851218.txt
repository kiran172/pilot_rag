Title: Renal abnormalities associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-K端ster-Hauser syndrome.

Abstract: Mayer-Rokitansky-K端ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a rare congenital disorder affecting female reproductive system (agenesis of uterus and upper part of vagina) alone (type 1), or associated with abnormalities of other organs and systems (type 2). We report a case of a 21-year-old woman diagnosed with MRKH due to primary amenorrhea during puberty and operated for formation of neovagina. She was admitted to the Department of Urology with abdominal pain and oligoanuria, where the physical examination and imaging studies revealed a malformation of the upper urinary tract: a solitary dystopia of kidney in the pelvis with stenosis of ureteropelvic junction and hydronephrosis. After initial desobstruction with a DJ stent, a pyeloplasty was performed. Females with primary amenorrhea are often delayed with the diagnosis of potential MRKH syndrome, and those diagnosed with the syndrome should undergo detailed examination to exclude concomitant urinary abnormalities.
