Title: Endarterectomy may be an effective additional treatment for three diffuse coronary artery disease complicated with diabetes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of coronary endarterectomy (CE) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with diabetes complicated with three diffuse coronary artery stenosis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 460 patients with diabetes mellitus and diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease who underwent CABG in our department from September 2015 to December 2021. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether they underwent CE: the simple CABG group (group A, n = 254) and the CABG combined CE group (group B, n = 206). The perioperative outcomes, recurrent angina pectoris during 1-year follow-up, and the patency rate of the grafted vessel in coronary CT angiography were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the 30 days mortality rate between the two groups (2.3% vs 2.4%, p &lt; 0.05). Group A had a shorter operation time [(3.55 ± 0.59) h versus (4.35 ± 0.65) h], less bypass grafts [(2.72 ± 0.83) versus (3.65 ± 0.72) vessels/case], a lower incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction (7.1% vs 12.6%), and a lower number of patent graft vessels at 1-year follow-up [(2.15 ± 0.42) versus (2.88 ± 0.68) vessels/case] compared with group B (all p &lt; 0.05). Group A had a higher incidence of recurrent angina during follow-up (14.49% vs 6.47%) (p &lt; 0.05). Although there was no significant difference in the incidence of MACCE events between the two groups, the probability of revascularization was higher in group A.
CONCLUSION: Compared with single CABG, combined CE in patients with diabetes mellitus and diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease can achieve more complete revascularization, reduce the recurrence of angina pectoris and the needing of postoperative revascularization, but the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction is higher.
