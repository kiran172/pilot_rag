Title: Evaluation of endovascular treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia for patients in the PLAN gray zone.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of endovascular therapy for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) in patients categorized under the gray and yellow zones of the patient risk, limb severity, and anatomic pattern (PLAN) concept over a 2-year follow-up period.
METHODS: Patients who underwent endovascular therapy for peripheral artery disease and presented with CLTI from February 2017 to February 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were grouped into yellow and gray zones based on the PLAN concept. Preoperative and postoperative walking distances, Rutherford classes, and postoperative target vessel patency rates were recorded and compared between the groups. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post-procedure.
RESULTS: Of the 387 patients evaluated, the yellow and gray groups comprised 88 patients each. The overall patency rates were similar between the groups (84 (95.45%) vs. 81 (92.05%), respectively). The occlusion-/stenosis-free survival times, amputation-free survival time, and mean survival time were not significantly different. However, the gray group had a significantly higher number of atherectomy interventions (74 vs. 59) and crosser devices used (62 vs. 42).
CONCLUSION: Endovascular therapy is an effective treatment option for patients in the gray zone of the PLAN color coding system.
