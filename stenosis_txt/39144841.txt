Title: Dyspnea Due to Laryngeal Cicatricial Pemphigoid: A Case Report.

Abstract: Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare, chronic, vesiculobullous disease characteristically affecting the mucous membranes and healing with cicatrization. Laryngeal involvement is rare and leads to airway stenosis. We present a 74-year-old Caucasian woman with CP, affecting the oral cavity, esophagus, lower eyelids, and larynx. Regardless of regular treatment with hydrocortisone and azathioprine, she developed bilateral cicatrization of the aryepiglottic folds and ovoid stenosis of the laryngeal introitus, leading to dyspnea. To avoid tracheostomy, we were able to utilize infraglottic high-frequency jet ventilation under total intravenous anesthesia to perform a CO2 laser supraglottoplasty with sectioning of the aryepiglottic folds. Post-operatively, her dyspnea at rest resolved; there was no progression at the six- and 12-month follow-up, and she was satisfied with the result.
