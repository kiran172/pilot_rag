Title: Redo Mitral Valve Replacement After Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement.

Abstract: The rising preference for percutaneous mitral valve-in-valve replacement (ViV TMVR) over redo surgical mitral valve replacement (MVR) is primarily due to its reduced bleeding risk. This report details a bloodless redo MVR performed for mitral stenosis post-ViV TMVR. We present detailed intraoperative findings, including images of the extracted bioprosthetic valves and cardiac anatomy, providing valuable insights into the surgical complexities encountered. The case underscores the importance of meticulous planning and execution in redo MVR, especially in patients with a history of multiple valve interventions. Additionally, this report discusses the potential complications associated with ViV TMVR, contributing to the evolving understanding of this procedure's long-term outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for careful consideration of patient-specific factors and the inherent risks of redo valve surgeries, aiming to improve patient outcomes in complex cardiac cases.
