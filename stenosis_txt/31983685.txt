Title: [Intracranial Pseudoaneurysm Arising after Radiotherapy for Oligodendroglioma:A Case Report].

Abstract: Intracranial pseudoaneurysms arising after radiotherapy for brain tumors are a relatively rare occurrence and associated with high-volume radiotherapy such as stereotactic radiosurgery. Herein, the authors report a rare case of intracranial pseudoaneurysm after conventional radiotherapy for oligodendroglioma. Case:A 46-year-old female incidentally presented with an intracranial hemorrhage from a middle temporal artery aneurysm. Four years earlier, she underwent surgical resection and conventional radiation therapy for oligodendroglioma. The aneurysm was successfully treated with middle cerebral artery(MCA)aneurysm trapping, in conjunction with a parietal branch superficial temporal artery-MCA bypass, to prevent re-rupture. Formation of intracranial pseudoaneurysm after conventional radiotherapy is extremely rare. However, the occurrence of cerebral aneurysm(s), as well as vascular stenosis during follow-up for brain tumors treated with radiotherapy, should be considered.
