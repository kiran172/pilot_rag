Title: Two-staged surgical repair of Berry syndrome type 2B.

Abstract: Berry syndrome is a rare congenital heart disease that requires complete corrective surgery. In certain extreme cases, such as ours, a two-stage as opposed to single-stage repair is a possibility. In doing so, we also used annotated and segmented three-dimensional models for the first time in Berry syndrome, adding to growing evidence that such models enhance the understanding of complex anatomy for surgical planning.
