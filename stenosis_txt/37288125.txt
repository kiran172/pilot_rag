Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Bioprosthetic Valve Failure: Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves 3 Aortic Valve-in-Valve Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is safe and effective for high-risk patients with bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) but has not been studied in low- and intermediate-risk patients. One year outcomes of the PARTNER 3 Aortic Valve-in-valve (AViV) Study were evaluated.
METHODS: This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study enrolled 100 patients from 29 sites with surgical BVF. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and stroke at 1 year. The key secondary outcomes included mean gradient, functional capacity, and rehospitalization (valve-related, procedure-related, or heart failure related).
RESULTS: A total of 97 patients underwent AViV with a balloon-expandable valve from 2017 to 2019. Patients were 79.4% male with a mean age of 67.1 years and Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 2.9%. The primary endpoint occurred in 2 patients (2.1%) who had strokes; there was no mortality at 1 year. Five patients (5.2%) had valve thrombosis events, and 9 patients (9.3%) had rehospitalizations, including 2 (2.1%) for strokes, 1 (1.0%) for heart failure, and 6 (6.2%) for aortic valve reinterventions (3 explants, 3 balloon dilations, and 1 percutaneous paravalvular regurgitation closure). From baseline to 1 year, New York Heart Association class III/IV decreased from 43.3% to 4.5%, mean gradient from 39.1 ± 18.2 mm Hg to 19.7 ± 7.6 mm Hg, and ≥moderate aortic regurgitation from 41.1% to 1.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: AViV with a balloon-expandable valve improved hemodynamic and functional status at 1 year and can provide an additional therapeutic option in selected low- or intermediate-risk patients with surgical BVF, although longer term follow-up is necessary.
