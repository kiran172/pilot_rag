Title: A case of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas originating from the branch duct: cast in the mold sign.

Abstract: A 59-year-old man with jaundice and lower common bile duct stenosis was referred to our institution for diagnosis and treatment. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-circumscribed smoothly marginated solid mass lesion in the pancreatic head. He underwent pyloric preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. Histopathological specimen revealed that the mass was located in the dilated branch duct of the pancreatic head, and an intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm originating from the branch pancreatic duct was diagnosed. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, the mass within the dilated duct branch in the pancreatic head was similar to a "cast in the mold" image, which we retrospectively deemed, might be reflecting the nature of this tumor.
