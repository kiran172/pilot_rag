Title: Safety and Efficacy of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Rectal Neoplasms Extending to the Dentate Line: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a superior, minimally invasive technique compared with other snare-based endoscopic resection techniques for rectal neoplasms extending to the dentate line (RNDLs). However, performing a successful ESD in the anal canal can be challenging due to vascularity and limited scope stability. In this meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ESD for RNDLs.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive electronic database search from January 2005 through January 2024 for studies evaluating outcomes of ESD performed for managing RNDLs. Pooled proportions were calculated using random-effect models. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 and Q statistics.
RESULTS: Data were extracted from 11 studies comprising 496 patients. The pooled en bloc resection rates were 93.60% (95% CI = 90.70-95.70). The pooled R0 resection rate was 80.60% (95% CI = 70.50-87.80). The pooled recurrence rate was 4.00% (95% CI = 2.40-6.50). There was no evidence of significant heterogeneity calculated using the Q test and I2 statistic. The main adverse events were anal pain, postprocedural bleeding, and anal stricture with pooled rates of 20.20% (95% CI = 14.80-26.90), 8.20% (95% CI = 4.70-14.0), and 3.50% (95% CI = 2.10-5.70), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: ESD is a safe and effective option for managing RNDLs with a low recurrence rate. Adverse events such as postprocedural perianal pain, postprocedural bleeding, and anal stenosis seem to be more common compared with colorectal ESD done for more proximal lesions. However, these can typically be managed conservatively or with minimally invasive endoscopic techniques.
