Title: Nf1 in heart development: a potential causative gene for congenital heart disease: a narrative review.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease is the most frequent congenital disorder, affecting a significant number of live births. Gaining insights into its genetic etiology could lead to a deeper understanding of this condition. Although the Nf1 gene has been identified as a potential causative gene, its role in congenital heart disease has not been thoroughly clarified. We searched and summarized evidence from cohort-based and experimental studies on the issue of Nf1 and heart development in congenital heart diseases from various databases. Available evidence demonstrates a correlation between Nf1 and congenital heart diseases, mainly pulmonary valvar stenosis. The mechanism underlying this correlation may involve dysregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The Nf1 gene affects the EMT process via multiple pathways, including directly regulating the expression of EMT-related transcription factors and indirectly regulating the EMT process by regulating the MAPK pathway. This narrative review provides a comprehensive account of the Nf1 involvement in heart development and congenital cardiovascular diseases in terms of epidemiology and potential mechanisms. RAS signaling may contribute to congenital heart disease independently or in cooperation with other signaling pathways. Efficient management of both NF1 and cardiovascular disease patients would benefit from further research into these issues.
