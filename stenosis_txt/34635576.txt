Title: Evaluation of low gradient severe aortic stenosis: should we change our outlook in the analysis of clinical data?

Abstract: Nowadays, technological progress has equipped clinicians with new useful devices for the collection, analysis and presentation of data. As a consequence, many diseases and pathological conditions have been studied in a more detailed way, sometimes with remarkable results. In fact, they are not always validated by the old physiological models. In this respect, we present the case of low gradient severe aortic stenosis, a condition characterised by a small aortic valve area and a low-pressure gradient. According to the mathematical and physical assumptions these readings are contradictory whereas the Doppler-echocardiography shows clearly the existence of such a situation. In this work, we have described the physiological base of this phenomenon and discussed the limitations of the technology used. In this work, we are going to analyse some conditions commonly observed in daily clinical practice in order to prompt a critical outlook in both clinicians and technicians about the instrumentations used and the methods applied.
