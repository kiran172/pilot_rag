Title: [Review of studies on the biomechanical modelling of the coupling effect between stent degradation and blood vessel remodeling].

Abstract: The dynamic coupling of stent degradation and vessel remodeling can influence not only the structural morphology and material property of stent and vessel, but also the development of in-stent restenosis. The research achievements of biomechanical modelling and analysis of stent degradation and vessel remodeling were reviewed; several noteworthy research perspectives were addressed, a stent-vessel coupling model was developed based on stent damage function and vessel growth function, and then concepts of matching ratio and risk factor were established so as to evaluate the treatment effect of stent intervention, which may lay the scientific foundation for the structure design, mechanical analysis and clinical application of biodegradable stent.
