Title: Applications of Platelet Concentrates (PCs) in Regenerative Onco-Urology: A Systematic Review of Literature.

Abstract: Objective: To assess the effectiveness of Platelet Concentrates (PCs) in the contest of Hemorrhagic, Actinic, and Radiation Cystitis, plus Urethral Obstruction or Stenosis. Eligibility criteria: Open article in English or Italian regarding in situ applications of PCs for the selected pathologies. Information sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and ELSEVIER. Risk of bias: High (and discussed). Methods for synthesis of results: Selection of relevant contents, resumed by digital tools, checked by authors and used throughout the manuscript. Included studies: 13 screened articles + 7 personal sources + 37 "extra" articles. Synthesis of results: Pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrated substantial symptom relief, mucosal restoration, and improved growth factor levels, reducing recurrence rates and complications. However, preparation protocols and results varied among studies. Limitations of evidence: Frequent low-quality studies with mall sample size, plus heterogeneous experimental setups and nomenclature/preparations. Interpretation: PCs demonstrate promise due to their bioactive components, enhancing tissue repair and reducing inflammation with no significant adverse events. Despite positive outcomes in pre-clinical and clinical studies, variability in preparation protocols and small sample sizes, together with inconsistent results, highlight the need for high-quality research to validate PCs' clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
