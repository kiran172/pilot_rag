Title: [Classification of cicatricial tracheal stenosis].

Abstract: Currently, a single classification of cicatricial tracheal stenosis is absent in national and world surgical practice. This issue is actual considering anatomical variability of tracheal structure in people with different constitutional features and previous complications. The proposed classification ensures individualized approach in surgical treatment of patients with cicatricial tracheal stenosis considering anatomical features in a particular patient.
