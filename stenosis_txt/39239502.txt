Title: Efficacy of endoscopic decompression surgery for treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The overall aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of endoscopic decompression for outcomes in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort, single-institution study of n = 139 patients from 2019 to 2022 who underwent endoscopic decompression for LSS. The primary outcome was improvement of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) between baseline and 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: In the present sample (n = 139) the average age was 57.6 years (SD = 17.4, with even distribution of men (49%) vs. women (51%). In patients with LSS, lumbar disc herniation was the most common diagnosis in 49 patients followed by lumbar radiculopathy in 25 patients. Lumbar radicular pain was the 3rd most common diagnosis in 21 patients with all other diagnosis listed in Table S1. There was a significant improvement (i.e., decrease) in ODI following endoscopic decompression (mean change: -8.3, 95% CI: -9.4, -7.2, P &lt; 0.001, Fig. 1). Prior lumbar spine surgery (P = 0.048), BMI (P = 0.053), and age (P = 0.022) were associated with changes in ODI. Nearly half (47%) of the sample had prior lumbar spine surgery. Those with prior lumbar spine surgery (-7.5, 95% CI: -8.3, -6.6) showed less improvement than those without prior lumbar spine surgery (-9.1, 95% CI: -10.9, -7.2, Fig. 2). For BMI, 23% had normal BMI while 24% were overweight and 53% were obese. Patients with normal BMI (-10.3, 95% CI: -13.4, -7.2) showed greater improvements compared to overweight (-7.9, 95% CI: -9.4, -6.4) and obese (-7.6, 95% CI: -9.0, -6.3, Fig. 3) patients. Patients under 40 years old (-10.2, 95% CI: -13.6, -6.8) showed greater improvements in ODI compared to those 40 years and older (-7.8, 95% CI: -8.6, -6.8, Fig. 4).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, endoscopic decompression was associated with reduced disability. Patients with no prior lumbar spine surgery, normal BMI, and who were under 40 years old showed greater improvements.
