Title: Clinical efficacy of modified Kamikawa anastomosis in patients with laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: With the increasing incidence of proximal gastric cancer, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy has been applied. However, reflux esophagitis often occurs after traditional esophagogastric anastomosis. In order to solve this problem, several methods of digestive tract reconstruction have emerged, but the most satisfying method remains to be discussed. Therefore, we modified traditional Kamikawa anastomosis to investigate the appropriate digestive tract reconstruction in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.
AIM: To discuss the clinical efficacy of modified Kamikawa anastomosis in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.
METHODS: A retrospective case series was adopted. Clinicopathological data were collected from 26 patients who underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy and modified Kamikawa anastomosis at our hospital from January 2020 to September 2022. The operation conditions, postoperative recovery, postoperative complications, and follow-up data were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: All the patients were successfully operated on without conversion to laparotomy. The duration of operation and digestive tract reconstruction were 203.500 (150-224) min and 87.500 (73-111) min, respectively. The intraoperative amount of bleeding was 20.500 mL ± 0.696 mL. The time of postoperative first flatus, the first postoperative fluid intake, and the postoperative length of stay were 2 (1-3) d, 4 (3-5) d, and 9 (8-10) d, respectively. All the patients were followed up for 12-23 months. The body mass index at 6 and 12 months after surgery were 22.577 kg/m2 ± 3.098 kg/m2 and 22.594 kg/m2 ± 3.207 kg/m2, respectively. The nutrition risk screening 2002 score, the patient-generated subjective global assessment score, and the gastroesophageal reflux disease scale score were good at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Reflux esophagitis and anastomotic stenosis were not observed in any of the patients during their 12-month postoperative gastroscopy or upper gastrointestinal tract visits. All the patients exhibited no tumor recurrence or metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The modified Kamikawa anastomosis is safe and feasible for laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy and has good antireflux effects and nutritional status.
