Title: Aortic Stenosis Patients With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Caution Recommended With Renal Failure During Hospitalization.

Abstract: Objective Our study aimed to assess the risk of in-patient mortality due to renal failure and other comorbidities in aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using a Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS, January 2010 to December 2014) from the United States and included 33,325 patients with a primary diagnosis of AS. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) for in-hospital mortality in AS by comorbidities including renal failure. Results The prevalence of renal failure in AS patients is 29.2%, and a higher proportion were males (60.1%) and non-white (14.1%). Major loss of function (96.6%) and in-hospital mortality (5.1%) were also proportionally higher in prevalence. Female patients (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.20-1.51) had higher odds of in-patient mortality in AS patients. Race was a non-significant predictor for mortality risk. Patients with comorbid coagulopathy (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.79-2.27) and heart failure (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.39-1.89) have increased mortality in AS inpatients. After controlling confounders, renal failure was significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.28-1.61) in AS patients. Conclusion Renal failure was prevalent in AS patients and was an independent factor that increases the risk of in-hospital mortality by 43%. Due to worse outcomes, more studies are required to evaluate risk-benefit ratio and strategies to improve health-related quality of life in post-TAVR patients with renal failure, and optimally decrease inpatient mortality.
