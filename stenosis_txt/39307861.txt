Title: Multi-modality artificial intelligence-based transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy detection in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a frequent concomitant condition in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), yet it often remains undetected. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate artificial intelligence-based models developed based on preprocedural and routinely collected data to detect ATTR-CM in patients with severe AS planned for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: In this prospective, single-center study, consecutive patients with AS were screened with [99mTc]-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid ([99mTc]-DPD) for the presence of ATTR-CM. Clinical, laboratory, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, invasive measurements, 4-dimensional cardiac CT (4D-CCT) strain data, and CT-radiomic features were used for machine learning modeling of ATTR-CM detection and for outcome prediction. Feature selection and classifier algorithms were applied in single- and multi-modality classification scenarios. We split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) samples. Performance was assessed using various metrics across 100 random seeds.
RESULTS: Out of 263 patients with severe AS (57% males, age 83 ± 4.6years) enrolled, ATTR-CM was confirmed in 27 (10.3%). The lowest performances for detection of concomitant ATTR-CM were observed in invasive measurements and ECG data with area under the curve (AUC) < 0.68. Individual clinical, laboratory, interventional imaging, and CT-radiomics-based features showed moderate performances (AUC 0.70-0.76, sensitivity 0.79-0.82, specificity 0.63-0.72), echocardiography demonstrated good performance (AUC 0.79, sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.78), and 4D-CT-strain showed the highest performance (AUC 0.85, sensitivity 0.90, specificity 0.74). The multi-modality model (AUC 0.84, sensitivity 0.87, specificity 0.76) did not outperform the model performance based on 4D-CT-strain only data (p-value > 0.05). The multi-modality model adequately discriminated low and high-risk individuals for all-cause mortality at a mean follow-up of 13 months.
CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence-based models using collected pre-TAVI evaluation data can effectively detect ATTR-CM in patients with severe AS, offering an alternative diagnostic strategy to scintigraphy and myocardial biopsy.
