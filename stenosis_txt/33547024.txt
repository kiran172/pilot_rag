Title: Impact of Baseline and Newly Acquired Conduction Disorders on Need for Permanent Pacemakers With 3 Consecutive Generations of Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Heart Valves.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We aimed to compare conduction dynamics and need for permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) after CoreValve, Evolut R and PRO (transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)).
METHODS: Patients were stratified based on conduction at baseline; Cohort A had normal conduction, Cohort B had conduction abnormalities including atrioventricular (AV)-block, fascicular block or complete bundle branch block. Three different dynamic QRS-patterns were defined: stable QRS-duration, transient QRS-prolongation and persistent QRS-prolongation. We performed multivariable regression analysis to estimate the effect of the three separate transcatheter heart valves (THV's) on need for PPI at 30 days.
RESULTS: TAVR was performed with CoreValve (N = 113), Evolut R (N = 157) or Evolut PRO (N = 92). Conduction dynamics were similar between the different THVs. Overall, Evolut R and PRO showed a tendency towards less PPI compared to CoreValve (17% vs. 19% vs. 27%, P = 0.08), which was driven by a lower PPI rate in Cohort A (6% vs. 11% vs. 25%, P = 0.002). Need for PPI was restricted to patients with persistent QRS-prolongation in Cohort A (26/106) but did not correlate with conduction dynamics in Cohort B. In multivariable logistic regression analysis the use of Evolut R (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.78, P = 0.008) and PRO (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.91, P-value = 0.028) were independently associated with less need for PPI.
CONCLUSION: The newer generations Evolut R and PRO were associated with less PPI compared to CoreValve. Acquired persistent conduction abnormalities predicted PPI after TAVR only in patients with normal conduction at baseline. Our findings may help identify eligible patients for early discharge after Evolut R/PRO TAVR.
