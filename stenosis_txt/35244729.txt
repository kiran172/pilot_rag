Title: [Morphological and functional diagnostics of coronary artery disease by computed tomography].

Abstract: Computed tomography coronary angiography (cCTA) is a safe option for the noninvasive exclusion of significant coronary stenoses in patients with a low or moderate pretest probability for coronary artery disease (CAD). Furthermore, it also allows functional and morphological assessment of coronary stenoses. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndrome published in 2019 have strengthened the importance of cCTA in this context and for this reason it has experienced a considerable upgrade. The determination of the Agatston score is a clinically established method for quantifying coronary calcification and influences the initiation of drug treatment. With technologies, such as the introduction of electrocardiography (ECG)-controlled dose modulation and iterative image reconstruction, cCTA can be performed with high image quality and low radiation exposure. Anatomic imaging of coronary stenoses alone is currently being augmented by innovative techniques, such as myocardial CT perfusion imaging or CT-fractional flow reserve (FFR) but the clinical value of these methods merits further investigation. The cCTA could therefore develop into a gatekeeper with respect to the indications for invasive coronary diagnostics and interventions.
