Title: Case review and imaging: Treatment of central venous catheter associated fibrin sheath and chronic thrombus with the ClotTriever system.

Abstract: Fibrin sheath formation is a leading culprit of central venous catheter malfunction. The complete removal of fibrin sheaths is an essential component of maintaining catheter patency, preventing future restenosis, and decreasing the risk of bloodborne infections. Treatment of fibrin sheaths includes pharmacologic therapy, balloon angioplasty, catheter exchange, and mechanical stripping. In this article 3 cases are reviewed, 2 patients had long-term hemodialysis catheter malfunction and 1 had complications related to a chest port. On imaging, superior vena cava stenosis, occlusion, and/or filling defect were identified for all patients, as well as findings suggesting the presence of fibrin sheath. Description of these cases detail a new technique for fibrin sheath removal utilizing the ClotTriever System (Inari Medical, Irvine, CA), which is a mechanical thrombectomy device used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. This technique allowed for complete removal of the fibrin sheath via a minimally invasive interventional procedure which did not require access through the central venous catheter lumen.
