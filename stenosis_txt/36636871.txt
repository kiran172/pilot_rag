Title: [Resistant hypertension: integrated strategies between pharmacological treatment and renal denervation].

Abstract: The achievement of adequate blood pressure (BP) control and the management of resistant hypertension still represent two burning "unmet needs" in the field of cardiovascular diseases, thus originating a continuous search for more efficacious pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies including radiofrequency and ultrasound renal denervation (RDN). The most recent guidelines recommend a combination therapy of two or more antihypertensive agents, preferably in a single-pill formulation, as first-line strategy to achieve an effective and early BP control also improving adherence to prescribed treatments. In the last few years several sham-controlled trials have confirmed both the BP-lowering efficacy and safety of RDN in a broad range of patients with hypertension, showing a significant reduction of office and ambulatory BP levels without a relevant increase of procedure-related adverse events such as renal artery stenosis and worsening renal function. These results have been recently confirmed by the analyses of 3-year follow-up data. According to these findings, RDN may represent a useful tool in addition to pharmacological treatment with more compelling indications for patients with resistant hypertension, those who are non-adherent or intolerant to multiple antihypertensive drugs or express a preference to undergo RDN. Further studies are necessary to explore the efficacy of RDN on prevention of hypertension-mediated organ damage and reduction of major cardiovascular events.
