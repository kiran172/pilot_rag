Title: Clinical and prognostic incremental value of FFRCT in screening of patients with obstructive coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) -derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) is recommended to evaluate the functional consequences of obstructive coronary artery disease (OCAD). Real-world incremental impacts of FFR<sub>CT</sub> use still remains under debate.
METHODS: 1601 patients with suspected OCAD on CCTA (&gt;50 ​% stenosis), including 808 (50.5 ​%) patients evaluated by FFR<sub>CT</sub>, were included from a 2013-2021 registry. Propensity adjusted impacts of FFR<sub>CT</sub> use on rates of invasive coronary angiography (ICA), myocardial revascularization (MR) and post MR major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were reported, including a sensitivity analysis in severe OCAD (&gt;70 ​% stenosis) (n ​= ​450). Accuracy of numerical and comprehensive FFR<sub>CT</sub> interpretations in selection of patients requiring a MR were also compared.
RESULTS: 1160 (72,5 ​%) ICA, 559 (34.9 ​%) MR and 137 (24.5 ​%) post MR MACE occurred at 4.7 ​± ​1.9 years. FFR<sub>CT</sub> use was independently associated with decreased rate of ICA and MR (OR: 0.66; 95 ​% CI 0.53-0.83, p ​&lt; ​0.001 and OR: 0.71; 95 ​% CI 0.58-0.88, p ​&lt; ​0.01, respectively). Compared to the numerical interpretation, the FFR<sub>CT</sub> comprehensive assessment increased the ratio of MR per ICA (61.7 ​% vs 50.1 ​%, p ​&lt; ​0.01) and was more accurate in selection of patients requiring MR. FFR<sub>CT</sub> reduced post MR MACE (OR: 0.64; 95 ​% CI 0.43-0.96, p ​&lt; ​0.05). All these associations were no longer observed in severe OCAD.
CONCLUSION: Implementing FFR<sub>CT</sub> in OCAD patients reduces ICA use, improves selection of patients requiring MR and reduces post MR MACE. However, these incremental values of FFRCT were no longer observed in severe OCAD.
