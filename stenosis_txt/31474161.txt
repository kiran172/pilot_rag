Title: A study protocol of vaginal laser therapy in gynecological cancer survivors.

Abstract: Objectives: Sexual dysfunction and radiation cystitis are common adverse events following radiotherapy for gynecological cancer (GC). This study aims to assess the efficacy of intravaginal CO<sub>2</sub> laser on GC survivors with dyspareunia following pelvic radiation and/or brachytherapy.Methods: This is the study protocol of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. All participants will receive five therapies (active or placebo) at monthly intervals. Outcomes will include a 10-cm visual analog scale measuring dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and other symptom intensity, 3-day voiding diary, Day-to Day Impact of Vaginal Aging questionnaire, Female Sexual Function Index, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire cervical cancer module, Urogenital Distress Inventory short form, King's Health Questionnaire, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire short form/female lower urinary tract symptoms, patient perception of improvement, sexual satisfaction of male partners, vaginal maturation value, and Vaginal Health Index. Differences between groups will be assessed at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12â€‰months following the five laser therapies.Results: As this is a study protocol, the study is ongoing with an expected end of recruitment and analysis date of 2021.Conclusion: Pelvic radiotherapy for GC increases the 5-year survival rate but with a negative impact on women's quality of life due to sexual dysfunction and radiation cystitis onset. With this study, CO<sub>2</sub> laser therapy will be evaluated for the first time in GC survivors treated with radiotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03714581.
