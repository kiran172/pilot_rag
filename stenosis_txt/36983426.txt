Title: One-Lung Ventilation during Rigid Bronchoscopy Using a Single-Lumen Endotracheal Tube: A Descriptive, Retrospective Single-Center Study.

Abstract: Using one-lung ventilation (OLV) through a single-lumen endotracheal tube (SLT) in the untreated lung during rigid bronchoscopy (RB) and jet ventilation, high oxygenation can be guaranteed, whilst procedures requiring thermal energy in the other lung are still able to be used. This pilot study aimed to examine the bronchoscopy-associated risks and feasibility of OLV using an SLT during RB in patients with malignant airway stenosis. All consecutive adult patients with endobronchial malignant lesions receiving OLV during RB from 1 January 2017 to 12 May 2021 were included. We assessed perioperative complications in 25 RBs requiring OLV. Bleeding grades 1, 2, and 3 complicated the procedure in two (8%), five (20%), and five (20%) patients, respectively. The median saturation of peripheral oxygen remained at 94% (p = 0.09), whilst the median oxygen supply did not increase significantly from 0 L/min to 2 L/min (p = 0.10) within three days after the bronchoscopy. The 30-day survival rate of the patients was 79.1% (95% CI 58.4-91.1%), all of whom reported an improvement in subjective well-being after the bronchoscopy. OLV using an SLT during RB could be a new treatment approach for endobronchial ablative procedures without increasing bronchoscopy-associated risks, allowing concurrent high-energy treatments.
