Title: A case report of a coronary myocardial bridge with impaired full-cycle ratio during dobutamine challenge.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A myocardial bridge (MB) is a coronary variant in which an epicardial coronary artery tunnels through the myocardial band. Although MBs have been reported to cause ischaemia, physiological assessment of an MB has not been fully established.
CASE SUMMARY: We encountered a case with exertional chest pain who underwent coronary angiography showing an MB at the mid-left anterior descending artery with systolic compression. Optical coherence tomography showed an MB defined as a homogeneous intermediate intensity surrounding the epicardial artery. The full-cycle ratio, defined as the lowest ratio of distal coronary pressure (P<sub>d</sub> ) to aortic pressure (P<sub>a</sub> ) during the entire cardiac cycle, measured 0.89 at rest and 0.73 with intravenous dobutamine of 20 µg/kg/min with a distinctive waveform pattern (early diastolic P<sub>d</sub> drop) during a dobutamine challenge. Metoprolol succinate dosage was increased. The patient has been free from chest pain for 7 months after the discharge.
DISCUSSION: Optical coherence tomography may contribute to anatomical detections of MBs. Because a systolic compression of the MB and release of the vascular lumen during early diastole leads to an early steep pressure loss, early diastolic P<sub>d</sub> drop should be one of the specific haemodynamic characteristics of MBs. On the other hand, in a severe atherosclerotic stenosis, P<sub>d</sub> drop is typically observed in late diastole, which could be differentiated from that of MBs. Because full-cycle ratio reflects the whole cardiac cycle including early diastole, this might be more useful than other physiological indices for detection of MB-related ischaemia induced by a dobutamine challenge.
