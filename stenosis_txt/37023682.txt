Title: [Impact of smoking on the presence of diabetic cardiomyopathy].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of coronary disease and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. The main objective of our work is to study the correlation of left atrial volume index with coronary disease in type 2 diabetics.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, analytical, single-center study with prospective recruitment of 330 type 2 diabetic patients carried out at the Constantine Regional Military University Hospital over a period of 03 years (2016-2018) among which 18.8% (62 patients) are smokers. Early cardiac involvement represented by diastolic dysfunction was assessed by two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. Data were analyzed using Epi info 7.2.1.0 software to study the impact of smoking on the presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
RESULTS: The average age of our cohort is 52.7 ± 8.4 years, an average of 7.1 ± 1.3% of glycated hemoglobin, an average of 5.3 ± 4.3 years of diabetes duration, a sex ratio to 1.01. 34.8% of patients had left atrial volume index ≥ 34 ml/m2. The prevalence of coronary disease is 27.0%. In multivariate analysis; left atrial volume index is significantly correlated with coronary stenosis (OR = 1.75, 95% CI [1.60 - 2.05], p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cardiomyopathy is high in type 2 diabetes and smoking is significantly correlated with the presence of this diabetic cardiomyopathy.
