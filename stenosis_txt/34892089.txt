Title: Automated Cerebral Vessel Segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Intracranial Atherosclerotic Diseases.

Abstract: Time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography is a non-invasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of intracranial atherosclerotic diseases (ICAD). Evaluation of the degree of the stenosis and status of posterior and anterior communicating arteries to supply enough blood flow to the distal arteries is very critical, which requires accurate evaluation of arteries. Recently, deep-learning methods have been firmly established as a robust tool in medical image segmentation, which has been resulted in developing multiple customized algorithms. For instance, BRAVE-NET, a context-based successor of U-Net-has shown promising results in MRA cerebrovascular segmentation. Another widely used context-based 3D CNN-DeepMedic-has been shown to outperform U-Net in cerebrovascular segmentation of 3D digital subtraction angiography. In this study, we aim to train and compare the two state-of-the-art deep-learning networks, BRAVE-NET and DeepMedic, for automated and reliable brain vessel segmentation from TOF-MRA images in ICAD patients. Using specially labeled data-labeled on TOF MRA and corrected on high-resolution black-blood MRI, of 51 patients with ICAD due to severe stenosis, we trained and tested both models. On an independent test dataset of 11 cases, DeepMedic slightly outperformed BRAVE-NET in terms of DSC (0.905±0.012 vs 0.893±0.015, p: 0.539) and 95HD (0.754±0.223 vs 1.768±0.609, p: 0.134), and significantly outperformed BRAVE-NET in terms of Recall (0.940±0.023 vs 0.855±0.030, p: 0.036). Qualitative assessment confirmed the superiority of DeepMedic in capturing the small and distal arteries. While BRAVE-NET consistently reported higher precision, DeepMedic generally overpredicted and could better visualize the smaller and distal arteries. In future studies, ensemble models that can leverage best of both should be developed and tested on larger datasets.Clinical Relevance- This study helps elevate the state-of-the-art for brain vessel segmentation from non-invasive MRA, which could accelerate the translation of vessel status-based biomarkers into the clinical setting.
