Title: Relationship of Atherosclerotic Plaque Structure with the History of COVID-19 in Patients Undergoing Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography.

Abstract: Although there is no sign of reinfection, individuals who have a history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may experience prolonged chest discomfort and shortness of breath on exertion. This study aimed to examine the relationship between atherosclerotic coronary plaque structure and COVID-19. This retrospective cohort comprised 1269 consecutive patients who had coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) between July 2020 and April 2021. The type of atherosclerotic plaque was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the severity of coronary stenosis as determined via the Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) classification and the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. To reveal the relationship between the history of COVID-19 and the extent and severity of CAD, propensity score analysis and further multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. The median age of the study population was 52 years, with 53.5% being male. COVID-19 was present in 337 individuals. The median duration from COVID-19 diagnosis to CCTA extraction was 245 days. The presence of atherosclerotic soft plaque (OR: 2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32-3.11, P = 0.001), mixed plaque (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.39-4.43, P = 0.001), and high-risk plaque (OR: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.98-3.84, P < 0.001) was shown to be linked with the history of COVID-19 on the conditional multivariate regression analysis of the propensity-matched population. However, no statistically significant association was found between the history of COVID-19 and the severity of coronary stenosis based on CAD-RADS and CAC score. We found that the history of COVID-19 might be associated with coronary atherosclerosis assessed via CCTA.
