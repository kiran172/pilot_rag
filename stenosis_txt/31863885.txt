Title: Effect of Unilateral Carotid Artery Stenting on Cognitive Function in Patients with Severe Bilateral Stenosis.

Abstract: CASE DESCRIPTION: An 82-year-old man with dementia, gait disturbance, and a small cerebral infarction owing to severe bilateral carotid artery stenosis was successfully treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS). Preoperative cerebral vascular reactivity was reduced in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. We performed CAS to treat right internal carotid artery stenosis. Following CAS, cerebral vascular reactivity showed an increase in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Memory, fluency, and attention also showed improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the potential benefit of single-stage CAS for cognitive function in severe bilateral carotid artery stenosis without hyperperfusion syndrome.
