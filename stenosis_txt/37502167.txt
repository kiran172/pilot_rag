Title: Successful Retrieval of the Distal Anti-embolic Device after Carotid Stenting Using the Balloon Bridge Technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: During carotid artery stenting (CAS), retrieval of the distal umbrella portion of the anti-embolic device (AED) could be difficult. Herein, we report a case of left CAS managed with balloon angioplasty and stent placement with successful retrieval of the umbrella portion of the AED using the balloon bridge technique after failure of retrieval with the standard technique.
CASE PRESENTATION: After successful revascularization of the asymptomatic severe carotid bulb stenosis in a 62-year-old woman, we could not pass the re-sheathing catheter over the deployed stent because of the ledge effect between the guidewire of the AED and the stent mesh. However, using the balloon bridge technique, which helped minimize the ledge effect, we could advance the guiding catheter beyond the stented segment over the partially inflated balloon. The umbrella portion of the AED could be easily retrieved through the guiding catheter without complications.
CONCLUSION: During CAS, the balloon bridge technique could be used to retrieve the AED after failure of retrieval with the standard techniques.
