Title: [Analysis of emergency venous sinus stenting in the treatment of acute visual impairment caused by idiopathic cranial hypertension].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of emergency venous sinus stenting in the treatment of acute visual impairment caused by idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study design was used to retrospectively analyze 38 patients undergoing venous sinus stenting in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2013 to October 2019. A total of 9 patients who had sudden short-term vision loss met the inclusion criteria. Routine visual field and fundus examination were performed. The venous sinus stenosis (CVSS) was confirmed by MR venography or DSA. The pressure gradient at both ends of CVSS was ≥10 mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). All patients were treated with emergency venous sinus stenting. Six-month follow-up data were collected for comparison, evaluation of the therapeutic effect, and observation of adverse reactions. Results: All 9 patients were successfully treated with venous sinus stent. The pressure gradient at the distal and proximal ends of the stenosis after stent implantation decreased to (2.3±1.2) mmHg. After 6 months of follow-up, the papilledema was significantly improved or disappeared in all patients. The average grade of papilledema decreased from 2.44±0.73 before operation to 0.56±0.53 after treatment (t=6.314, P&lt;0.001). The visual acuity of 9 patients recovered to the pre-onset level or improved significantly after 6 months. The average baseline value of preoperative visual acuity (logMAR) was 0.12±0.11, which increased to 0.74±0.13 on average 6 months after operation (t=-10.827, P&lt;0.001). No recurrence of symptoms or serious adverse reactions occurred in all patients during the follow-up period. Conclusion: For patients with acute visual impairment caused by idiopathic cranial hypertension, emergency venous sinus stenting is a relatively safe and effective treatment that can effectively improve visual acuity.
