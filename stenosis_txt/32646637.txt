Title: Performance of the CoreValve Evolut R and PRO in Severely Calcified Anatomy: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The CoreValve Evolut R and PRO (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) are among the newest-generation of self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices and show excellent results. Treating patients with severely calcified (SC) native aortic valve anatomy may be challenging because of the increased risk of periprocedural complications. This study investigated the performance of Evolut R and PRO in this special patient subset.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR with the CoreValve Evolut R or PRO (n=381) from September 2015 to March 2018 were divided by aortic valve calcification extent. Patients with SC aortic valve anatomy (n=98; men, >2,062 and women, >1,377 Agatston units) were compared with those with non-severely calcified (NCS) aortic valve anatomy after 1:2 propensity score matching. Outcomes were evaluated according to the updated valve academic research consortium criteria.
RESULTS: Patients with SC anatomy were older (83 years vs 80 years, p&lt;0.001) and had a smaller aortic valve area (0.63 cm2 vs 0.70 cm2, p=0.028). Pre-dilatation was more often performed (30.6% vs 15.8%, p=0.003) and a permanent pacemaker implantation was more often necessary (32.9% vs 8.8%, p&lt;0.001) in the SC group. None/mild aortic regurgitation (AR) was evenly distributed (SC, 96.9% vs NCS, 99.5%, p=0.109); moderate AR was present in 3.1% of SC patients and in 0.5% of NSC patients. Severe AR was not observed.
CONCLUSION: The CoreValve Evolut R and PRO showed good clinical safety profiles and excellent haemodynamic results in patients with SC anatomy and who more often required permanent pacemaker implantation.
