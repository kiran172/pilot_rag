Title: Visualization of the Thebesian veins during coronary angiography in a 57-year-old woman.

Abstract: A 57-year-old woman was hospitalized due to a type 2 respiratory failure. Electrocardiogram at admission showed inverted T waves in leads V2-V4. Coronary angiogram was performed showing no relevant stenosis. However, this exam allowed visualization of the Thebesian veins outlining the left ventricle.
