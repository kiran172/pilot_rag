Title: Pulmonary vein stenosis presenting as massive hemoptysis, treated with pulmonary veins angioplasty.

Abstract: Two patients with history of cardiac ablation presented with massive hemoptysis secondary to pulmonary vein stenosis. They underwent successful pulmonary vein angioplasty and stenting. Although the second patient ended up having a lobectomy, the successful opening of the Left Superior Pulmonary Vein helped sparing the superior lobe and lingula.
