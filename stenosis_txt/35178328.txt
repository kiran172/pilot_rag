Title: Primary Gastrointestinal Follicular Lymphoma Presenting With Bowel Stenosis.

Abstract: Primary follicular lymphomas of the small bowel generally present with small whitish nodules and masses or polyp-like lesions; cases with other morphologies are extremely rare. We experienced a case of primary follicular lymphoma that presented with small bowel stenosis. The lesion needed to be differentiated from other causes, such as bowel tuberculosis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related ulcers, Crohn's disease, small bowel ischemia, trauma, and idiopathic bowel stenosis, but endoscopic biopsies did not result in a definite diagnosis. Therefore, the lesion was surgically resected and, consequently, a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma of the small bowel was finally made. We report the characteristics and macroscopic findings of follicular lymphoma of the small bowel along with a review of relevant literature.
