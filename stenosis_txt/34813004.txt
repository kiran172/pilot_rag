Title: Tracheal stenosis following mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection without history of tracheal intubation: a case report.

Abstract: Laryngotracheal stenosis is a major side effect of intubation in patients with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). However, no study has since reported tracheal stenosis in patients with COVID-19 without a history of tracheal intubation. The current study reports a 77-year-old male patient with the COVID-19 infection but without a history of tracheal intubation diagnosed with distal tracheal stenosis. Tracheal stenosis was successfully treated with rigid bronchoscopy. This study reported the first case of tracheal stenosis due to viral tracheitis associated with COVID-19 infection. However, further studies are required to investigate this speculation.
