Title: Sub-satisfactory recanalization of severe middle cerebral artery stenoses can significantly improve hemodynamics.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of sub-satisfactory stent recanalization on hemodynamic stresses for severe stenoses of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) M 1 segment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe stenoses of the MCA M1 segment treated with endovascular stent angioplasty were retrospectively enrolled. Three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography before and after stenting was performed; the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of hemodynamic stresses at the stenosis and normal segments proximal and distal to the stenoses was analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with severe stenosis at the MCA M1 segment were enrolled, with the stenosis length ranging from 5.1 to 12.8 mm (mean 9 ± 3.3 mm). Stent angioplasty was successful in all (100%) the patients. The angiography immediately after stenting demonstrated a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in MCA stenosis after comparison with before stenting (31.4 ±12.5% vs. 87.5 ± 9.6%), with residual stenosis of 15-30% (mean 22.4 ± 3.5%). Before stenting, the total pressure was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.0001), while the WSS, velocity, and vorticity were all significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.0001) at the normal arterial segment proximal to the stenosis, and the total pressure, WSS, velocity, and vorticity were all significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.0001) at the normal arterial segment distal to the stenosis compared with those at the stenosis. After sub-satisfactory stenting recanalization, all the hemodynamic stresses proximal or distal to the stenosis and at the perforator root were improved compared with those before stenting and were similar to those after virtual stenosis removal.
CONCLUSION: Sub-satisfactory recanalization of severe MCA stenoses can significantly improve the hemodynamic status for cerebral perfusion at the stenoses.
