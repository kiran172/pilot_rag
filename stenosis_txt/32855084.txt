Title: MitraClip Treatment for Severe Mitral Regurgitation Due to Chordae Rupture Following Impella CP Support in a Patient With Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: We report the case of an 85-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis who underwent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention with Impella CP support. Unfortunately, the device caused mitral chordae tendineae rupture leading to severe mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent a staged fully percutaneous treatment with transcatheter aortic valve replacement followed by elective Mitraclip therapy. Echocardiographic monitoring is of paramount importance during Impella insertion and removal in order to avoid and deal with mitral damage. Mitraclip therapy is a feasible rescue therapy for severe mitral regurgitation due to chordae rupture in patients at high risk for surgery.
