Title: Diagnostic accuracy of subendocardial vs. transmural myocardial perfusion defect for the detection of in-stent restenosis or progression of coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The ADVANTAGE study demonstrated in a cohort of stented patients a diagnostic accuracy of stress myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) significantly higher than that of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) for the detection of in-stent restenosis (ISR) or CAD progression vs. quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). This is a pre-defined subanalysis of the ADVANTAGE aimed at assessing the difference in terms of diagnostic accuracy vs. QCA of a subendocardial vs. a transmural perfusion defect using static stress CTP.
METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients who previously underwent coronary stenting and were referred for QCA. All patients underwent stress CTP and rest CTP ​+ ​CCTA. The diagnostic accuracy of CCTA and CTP were evaluated in territory-based and patient-based analyses. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of "subendocardial" perfusion defect, defined as hypo-enhancement encompassing >25% but <50% of the transmural myocardial thickness within a specific coronary territory vs. "transmural" perfusion defect, defined as hypo-enhancement encompassing >50% of the transmural thickness.
RESULTS: In 150 patients (132 men, mean age 65.1 ​± ​9.1 years), the diagnostic accuracy of subendocardial vs. transmural perfusion defect in a vessel-based analysis was 93.5% vs. 87.7%, respectively (p ​< ​0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of subendocardial vs. transmural defect were 87.9% vs. 46.9% (p ​< ​0.001) and 94.9% vs. 97.9% (p ​= ​0.004), respectively. In a patient-based analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of the subendocardial vs. transmural approach was 86.6% vs. 68% (p ​< ​0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that detection of a subendocardial perfusion defect as compared to a transmural defect is significantly more accurate to identify coronary territories with ISR or CAD progression.
