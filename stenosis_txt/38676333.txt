Title: Comparison of Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction Techniques on Mid-Term Pulmonic Valve Fate.

Abstract: Introduction: The pulmonic valve-sparing technique (PVS) is an emerging approach of right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) correction aimed at reducing the incidence of pulmonic regurgitation (PR) and the need for subsequent reintervention. This study aims to compare the long-term occurrence of moderate to severe PR/stenosis (PR/PS) between three different approaches. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 173 patients who underwent TOF correction at Chiang Mai University hospital between January 2006 and December 2016. The patients were divided into three groups: transannular patch (TAP; n = 88, 50.9%), monocusp insertion (MCI; n = 40, 23.1%), and PVS (n = 45, 26%). The study assessed freedom from moderate to severe PR/PS. Results: The median overall follow-up time was 79.8 months (interquartile range: 50.7-115.5 months. The PVS exhibited larger PV Z-score (-2.6 ± 2.3 mm, P &lt; .001), with predominantly tricuspid morphology (64.4%). The PVS had significantly shorter median ventilator time, intensive care unit stay, hospital stay, and longer median follow-up time. Postoperative moderate-severe PR was lower in the PVS group (P &lt; .001), with no significant difference in PS (P = .356) and complications among the groups. Freedom from moderate-severe PR/PS was longer in the MCI group (2.8, 0.2-42.3 months vs 30.9, 0.2-50.9 months, respectively). Multivariable analysis showed TAP and MCI had a higher risk of developing moderate-severe PR (hazard ratio [HR] 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.13 vs HR 1.41; 95%CI 0.59-3.38) but lower risk of moderate-severe PS (HR 0.14; 95%CI 0.02-0.9 vs HR 0.39; 95%CI 0.05-3.19). Conclusion: Pulmonic valve-sparing reconstruction showed promise in preventing late moderate-severe PR in patients with favorable PV anatomy. However, it should be noted that this technique is associated with a higher incidence of PS.
