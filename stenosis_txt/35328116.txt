Title: Associations between Patient Report of Pain and Intervertebral Foramina Changes Visible on Axial-Loaded Lumbar Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Abstract: The intervertebral foramen may influence spinal nerve roots and, therefore, be related to the corresponding dermatomal pain. In vivo evaluation of the intervertebral foramen-dermatome relationship is essential for understanding low back pain (LBP) pathophysiology. The study aimed to correlate the lumbar MRI unloaded-loaded foraminal area changes with dermatomal pain in the patient's pain drawings. Dynamic changes of the dermatomal pain distribution related to the intervertebral foramen area changes between quantitative conventional supine MRI (unloaded MRI) and axial-loading MRI (alMRI) were analyzed. The MRI axial-loading intervertebral foramen area changes were observed, and the most significant effect of reducing the foraminal area (-6.9%) was reported at levels of L2-L3. The incidence of pain in the dermatomes increases linearly with the spine level, from 15.6% at L1 to 63.3% at L5 on the right and from 18.9% at L1 to 76.7% at L5 on the left. No statistically significant effect of changes in the intervertebral foramen area on the odds of pain along the respective dermatomes was confirmed. Changes in the foraminal area were observed between the unloaded and loaded phases, but differences in area changes between foramen assigned to painful dermatomes and foramen assigned to non-painful dermatomes were not significant.
