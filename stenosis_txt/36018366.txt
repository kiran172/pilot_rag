Title: Posterior urethral stenosis: a comparative review of the guidelines.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to provide a thorough comparative review of the available guidelines on the diagnosis, management, and follow-up for patients with posterior urethral stenosis by the American Urologic Association (2016), Société Internationale d'Urologie (2010), and European Urologic Association (2022).
METHODS: The AUA, SIU, and EAU guidelines were evaluated for recommendations on the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of posterior urethral stenosis. We also included the EAU and AUA urologic trauma guidelines for the trauma-related stenosis. The level or strength of recommendations is included in case of disparity between the guidelines.
RESULTS: The three guidelines align considerably in recommendations provided for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with posterior urethral stenosis. SIU and EAU emphasize the role of repeat endoscopic treatment in guidelines compared to AUA.
CONCLUSION: The preferred method to repair bulbo-membranous stricture/stenosis following radiation therapy remains an area of active interest, focusing on continence preservation. Additionally, there may be a role for advanced endoscopic treatments with or without adjunct therapies to manage even obliterated stenoses.
