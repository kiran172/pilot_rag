Title: 3D Stent Reconstruction Using CMCT: A Novel Method to Assess Stent Expansion.

Abstract: Stent underexpansion in calcified coronary stenosis is an important predictor of major short- and long-term adverse cardiovascular events. In this case, we describe a novel method for assessing stent expansion using 3-dimensional stent reconstruction with C-arm motion compensated computed tomography.
