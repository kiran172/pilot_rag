Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation in Asians: TAVR for aortic regurgitation in Asians.

Abstract: AIMS: Although surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is currently the recommended intervention for patients with native AR without aortic stenosis, a significant proportion of Asian patients undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which has not been studied fully for safety and outcomes. This systematic review aims to examine the characteristics and outcomes of Asian patients with pure native aortic regurgitation (AR) undergoing TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials, observational studies and case reports publishedÂ  from inception to 2 April 2020, involving patients of Asian ethnicity with pure native aortic regurgitation who had undergone TAVR. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes including all major complications. Five studies (n=274 patients) and eight case reports were included. Device success was reported in 94.9% of the patients, the all-cause mortality rate was 4.4%, 2.5% were converted to SAVR, 1.7% had post-operative paravalvular leak and 6.7% required permanent pacemaker implantation.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR has demonstrated acceptable safety and efficacy in Asian patients with pure AR displaying low mortality rates and few adverse outcomes.
