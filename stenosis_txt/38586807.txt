Title: Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery Stroke Due to a Severe Right Vertebral Artery Stenosis With a Left Cervical Internal Carotid Artery Dissection: What's Next?

Abstract: Guidelines for the treatment and management of ischemic strokes triggered by stenosis versus dissection are well established. However, the presence of both entities in the same patient, although rare, poses challenges for short- and long-term treatment. Here, we describe the case of a 55-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a 72-hour history of headache, dizziness, unbalanced gait, nausea, and two episodes of vomiting. Stroke was initially suspected, but the computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no hemorrhage. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed right inferior cerebellar acute ischemia in the territory of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), with smaller foci of early acute infarcts in the bilateral inferior cerebellum. Furthermore, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and CT angiography revealed right vertebral artery stenosis and left cervical internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD). This clinical report describes a rare case of stroke secondary to vertebral artery stenosis with concomitant carotid artery dissection. The treatment course and evolution are presented.
