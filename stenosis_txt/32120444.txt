Title: [Thoracic Central Venous Occlusive Disease and Haemodialysis Access].

Abstract: Benign central venous thoracic occlusion is a frequent issue in haemodialysis patients. Symptomatic stenosis affects quality of life and can cause dysfunction of arteriovenous access or make it impossible to implant a haemodialysis catheter. Common risk factors for the development of the occlusions are central venous catheters and cardiac rhythm devices. The gold standard for diagnosis is venous angiography. Treatment of asymptomatic lesions can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided. The primary method of treatment for symptomatic patients is endovascular therapy. Repeat balloon angioplasty is a standard therapy. In case of elastic recoiling or early recurrence, placement of bare metal stent or stent graft could be considered. Surgical options should be preserved only for refractory cases. Further randomised trials are needed to prove the efficacy of new devices, such as dedicated venous stents and drug coated balloons.
