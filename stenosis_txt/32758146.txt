Title: Retrospective study of the differential diagnosis between cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis and small bowel Crohn's disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Being a rare disease, cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis (CMUSE) is easily misdiagnosed as small bowel Crohn's disease (SBCD).
AIMS: This study was aimed to compare clinical features of CMUSE to SBCD.
METHODS: Fourteen patients with CMUSE and 61 patients with SBCD were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Hematochezia was more frequent in CMUSE patients (10, 71.4% vs 23, 37.7%, P = 0.022), while diarrhea was more common in SBCD patients (23, 37.7% vs 0, 0.0%, P = 0.015). More patients with CMUSE developed intestinal stenosis than with SBCD (14, 100% vs 37, 60.7%, P = 0.011). 30 (50.0%) SBCD patients and none CMUSE patients had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate level (P = 0.001). Extra-enteric findings found by computed tomography enterography were significantly more prevalent in SBCD patients than in CMUSE patients (25,71.4% vs 3,25%, P = 0.013). Longitudinal ulcers found by endoscopy were more common in SBCD patients (16, 37.2% vs 0, 0.0%, P = 0.041), while circumferential ulcers were more common in CMUSE patients (6, 54.6% vs 8, 18.6%, P = 0.041). All ulcers observed in CMUSE patients were within mucosal and submucosal layers, but 8 (44.4%) SBCD patients had deep ulcers that reached beyond submucosal layers (P = 0.003). Ulcers were located at strictures in 9 (90.0%) CMUSE patients but only in 1 (5.6%) SBCD patient (P = 0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels, radiologic, endoscopic and pathologic features help to distinguish CMUSE from SBCD.
