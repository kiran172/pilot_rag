Title: Relation of hyperemic response during fractional flow reserve measurement to coronary flow reserve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary flow reserve (CFR) represents entire coronary compensatory capacity, while fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a standard to evaluate functional severity of epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD). ΔFFR, a decrease in a ratio of mean distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure (Pd/Pa) at rest to FFR, is conceptually associated with coronary microvascular function. This study aimed to evaluate the relation of ΔFFR to CFR in patients with stable CAD.
METHODS: We performed resting Pd/Pa and FFR measurements in a total of 309 vessels with intermediate coronary artery stenosis in 242 patients. ΔFFR was defined as (resting Pd/Pa - FFR), and pressure bounded-CFR was calculated to estimate low CFR. Vessels were divided as the low CFR and non-low CFR groups.
RESULTS: Of 309 vessels, low CFR was observed in 101 (32.7 %). While FFR values were similar (0.78 ± 0.11 vs. 0.78 ± 0.09, p = 0.84), resting Pd/Pa (0.85 ± 0.08 vs. 0.93 ± 0.04, p < 0.001) and ΔFFR (0.07 ± 0.06 vs. 0.15 ± 0.06, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the low CFR group than in the non-low CFR group. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that ΔFFR was predictive for low CFR (area under the curve 0.84, best cut-off value 0.08, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified lower ΔFFR, the left anterior descending coronary artery, and lower hemoglobin and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels as factors associated with low CFR.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stable CAD, lower ΔFFR was significantly associated with low CFR in intermediate coronary stenosis in patients with stable CAD. ΔFFR may be a simple, practical, and useful surrogate to identify patients with impaired CFR.
