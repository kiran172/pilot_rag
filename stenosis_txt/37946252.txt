Title: Case report: hunting the hidden: surgical treatment of chronic silent thrombus in the left ventricle in a young alcoholic patient with myocardial bridging.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A silent left ventricular thrombus is dangerous. The current standard anticoagulation therapy was ineffective in our case or similar, and the outcome was poor.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old man with a silent left ventricular thrombus was detected incidentally by transthoracic echocardiography. After admission, anti-coagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin therapy was carried out. The CAG revealed 70% systolic stenosis in the middle of the right coronary artery along with myocardial bridging. Unfortunately, an acute left temporal embolism emerged 5Â days later, then the patient was transferred to the neurology department for further treatment. One month later, the patient underwent left ventricular thrombectomy, ventricular aneurysm resection, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was discharged uneventfully after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment should be a priority for patients with giant or hypermobile left ventricular thrombus or recurrent systemic emboli.
