Title: Choice of imaging to evaluate carotid stenosis and guide management.

Abstract: Carotid artery disease is a cause of ischemic stroke and is associated with cognitive decline. Besides the evaluation of the degree of stenosis, it is also crucial to assess the morphology of the atherosclerotic plaque, for a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and to make the best decision for the patient. On top of noninvasive duplex ultrasound (DUS) and invasive digital subtraction angiography (DSA), compute tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are often used effectively as noninvasive imaging tools to study carotid stenoses. This review describes the fundamental characteristics of carotid artery plaques, and how they can be best evaluated with currently available imaging methods.
