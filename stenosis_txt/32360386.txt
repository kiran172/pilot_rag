Title: Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Severe Aortic Stenosis: A New Hope for Treatment.

Abstract: Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is an autosomal dominant, rare, fatal pediatric segmental premature aging disease. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases constitute the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients with the syndrome and severe aortic valve stenosis have been described in the literature, and for all of them a strategy of conservative management has been followed. We describe the first successful treatment of a 23-year-old Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome patient with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
