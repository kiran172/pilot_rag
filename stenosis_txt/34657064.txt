Title: [A Case of Remnant Gastric Necrosis after Laparoscopy-Assisted Distal Gastrectomy].

Abstract: A 77-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, angina pectoris, and internal carotid artery stenosis underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, D2 lymphadenectomy, and Billroth â…  reconstruction for advanced gastric cancer. Hematologic examination revealed severe anemia on postoperative day 2, and abdominal CT scan detected contrast media leakage into the remnant gastric lumen. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed mucosal necrosis and ulceration of a large range. The patient recovered with conservative treatment and was discharged on postoperative day 18. Endoscopic balloon dilation was required to improve anastomotic stenosis after discharge, after which the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. The stomach is resistant to ischemic changes because of the microvascular networks in the stomach wall; thus, gastric remnant necrosis after gastrectomy is rare. However, for patients with arterial sclerosis, such as in this case, physicians must consider the range of gastrectomy and reconstruction methods.
