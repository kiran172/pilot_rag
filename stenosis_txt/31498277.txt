Title: Prognostic Factors for Drop Foot Due to Lumbar Degenerative Diseases: The Impact of Surgical Timing on Postoperative Recovery.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical series.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic factors for the improvement of drop foot caused by degenerative lumbar disease after surgery.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Drop foot may be caused by lumbar spinal diseases and may affect daily life. There are limited data regarding predictors of drop foot, especially surgical timing.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 87 patients with drop foot. Prognostic factors and precise timing of surgery affecting drop foot improvement were examined by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Forty patients (46.0%) recovered from drop foot after surgery. Age [odds ratio (OR)=0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-0.98; P=0.01], preoperative anterior tibialis muscle strength (OR=12.0; 95% CI, 2.41-59.9; P=0.002), and duration of drop foot before surgery (OR=3.59; 95% CI, 1.09-11.8; P=0.04) were significant prognostic factors. Two months was the most appropriate cutoff for surgery after appearance of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Age, preoperative tibialis anterior muscle strength, and duration of drop foot were statistically significant prognostic factors of recovery from drop foot. Surgery within 2 months after the onset of drop foot may improve postoperative outcome.
