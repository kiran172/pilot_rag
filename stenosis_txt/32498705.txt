Title: Posterior cerebral artery stroke by reverse flow embolism in thoracic outlet syndrome - a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome is a rare condition characterized by a subclavian artery pathology associated with a bone abnormality. It is rarely associated with thromboembolic stroke. The mechanism of cerebral embolism associated with thoracic outlet syndrome have rarely been demonstrated. We present here a fully studied case with a high probability of reverse flow embolism.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old man with a known arterial thoracic outlet syndrome presented with a right cerebral posterior artery brain infarction. An ultrasound examination depicted the compression of the right subclavian artery in the scalene defile with a post stenotic aneurysm and the presence of a floating thrombus in this aneurysm. There was a reverse flow during diastole in this aneurysm. Anticoagulation was carried out with the disappearance of the floating thrombus with no new clinical or brain MRI event. Corrective surgery of this thoracic outlet syndrome was performed one month after stroke.
CONCLUSION: Very few cases of stroke in arterial thoracic outlet syndrome have been described with thorough dynamic vascular imaging. To our knowledge, this is the fourth reported case that advocates for a reverse flow embolism mechanism in stroke associated with thoracic outlet syndrome, and the first to realize an extensive ultrasound and doppler workup.
