Title: Evaluation of Clinical Findings with MRI Venography in Patients with Idiopatic Intracranial Hypertension.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical data and Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV) findings together in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study between January 2009 and February 2021, conventional MRI and MRV examinations were performed on 30 patients who were admitted to the neurology service of Erciyes University Medical Faculty with the pre-diagnosis of IIH, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was measured in these patients to confirm the diagnosis of IIH. Transverse Sinus Stenosis Ratio (TS SR), Superior Sagittal Sinus (SSS) diameter, Sinus Rectus (SR) diameter, Stenosis Segment Length (SSL) were studied.
RESULTS: High CSF pressure was detected in 22 of 30 patients with IIH pre-diagnosis. CSF pressure was normal in 8 cases. TS SR was compared in all groups, right TS SR 0.63 ± 0.16, Left TS SR 0.55 ± 0.16 in the patient group with IIH, right TS SR 0.55 ±0.16 in the CSF pressure normal patient group, Right TS SR 0.28 ± 0.07 Left TS SR 0.31 ± 0.07 in the control group Right TS SR It was 0.28 ± 0.09, Sol TS SR was 0.30 ± 0.07.
CONCLUSION: Before LP, the cranial venous system must be monitored. TS SR and CSF pressure are directly proportional. The stenosis rate is important for IIH rather than SSL.
