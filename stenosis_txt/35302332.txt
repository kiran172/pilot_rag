Title: ROSS SURGERY: OUR EXPERIENCE.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: At Santa Marta Hospital, Ross Surgery was performed for the first time in 1999. Twenty years later, we feel it is desirable to evaluate the mid and long-term results of our experience, as well as estimate the future of this procedure.
METHODS: Between March 1999 and June 2016, 23 Ross procedures were performed at our institution. We did a retrospective analysis of the patientsÂ´ data, results of the surgery, complications, freedom from reoperation and mortality.
RESULTS: The majority (36,4%) of the patients had aortic stenosis, 22,7% had aortic regurgitation and 27,3% had aortic stenosis and regurgitation. Sub-valvular stenosis was present in 13,6% of patients. The mean follow-up is 15 years. The overall mortality was 9%, without early mortality. In our series, 83% of the patients are free from reoperation. Eighty percent (n=16) of the survivors are in NYHA class I, with the remaining 20% (n=4) in class II.
CONCLUSION: Ross surgery has strict indications and in this group of patients the advantages are undeniable and the outcomes, according to our results (with 83% of patients free from reoperation, at a mean follow-up of 15 years), are positive and encouraging.
