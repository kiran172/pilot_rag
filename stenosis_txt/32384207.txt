Title: Timely surgical intervention for ureteric complications ensures adequate graft function in renal transplantation: a 10-year review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ureteric complications can cause significant morbidity in renal and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. This 10-year review identified transplant patients with ureteric complications necessitating surgical intervention in an Australian tertiary centre.
METHODS: The hospital records were scrutinized in detail to identify all patients who underwent renal or SPK transplantation from 1 June 2009 to 31 May 2019 with subsequent surgical management of ureteric complications. A case series of patients with ureteric complications was generated and findings were analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 893 renal and SPK transplants were performed over the 10-year period. Ten of these (1.12%; seven renal and three SPK) had ureteric complications. All were managed surgically. Five of the 10 had ureteric leaks (0.56%); three had ureteric strictures (0.34%), one had ureteric obstruction from extraluminal compression (0.11%) and one had both leak and stricture (0.11%). All 10 patients underwent ureteric reimplantation. Two patients required more than one operation for their ureteric complication. No graft loss or surgical mortality occurred. All 10 patients currently have functioning kidney transplants and none require maintenance dialysis.
CONCLUSION: We report a low rate (1.12%) of ureteric complications in our renal and SPK transplants. Our standard practice of definitive correction by ureteric reimplantation is proving successful. The authors confirm that appropriate surgery is a viable and durable option in renal transplant patients with excellent graft outcomes.
