Title: Diagnostic Role of Incidental Premature Contractions During Doppler Echocardiography.

Abstract: Cardiac sonographers often perceive premature beats as a limiting factor during echocardiography because they alter filling and contractility, and loops recorded during or after a premature contraction are often discarded. Here we present 2 cases in which the incidental occurrence of premature beats on Doppler echocardiography contributed to the diagnosis. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
