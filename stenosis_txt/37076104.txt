Title: Urgent endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid occlusion is associated with a high mortality.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Interventions for carotid occlusions undertaken are undertaken and the outcomes are poorly defined. We sought to study patients undergoing urgent carotid revascularization for symptomatic occlusions.
METHODS: The Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database was queried from 2003 to 2020 to identify patients with carotid occlusions undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Only symptomatic patients undergoing urgent interventions within 24 hours of presentation were included. Patients were identified based on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. This cohort was compared with symptomatic patients undergoing urgent intervention for severe stenosis (≥80%). The primary end points were perioperative stroke, death, myocardial infarction (MI) and composite outcomes as defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting guidelines. Patient characteristics were analyzed to determine predictors of perioperative mortality and neurological events.
RESULTS: We identified 390 patients who underwent urgent CEA for symptomatic occlusions. The mean age was 67.4 ± 10.2 years (range, 39-90 years). The cohort was predominantly male (60%) with associated risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension (87.4%), diabetes (34.4%), coronary artery disease (21.6%), and current smoking (38.7%). This population had high use of medications, including statins (78.6%), P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors (32.0%), aspirin (77.9%), and renin-angiotensin inhibitors (43.7%) preoperatively. When compared with patients undergoing urgent endarterectomy for severe stenosis (≥80%), those with symptomatic occlusion were well-matched with regard to risk factors, but the severe stenosis cohort seemed to be managed better medically and less likely to present with cortical stroke symptoms. Perioperative outcomes were significantly worse for the carotid occlusion cohort, primarily driven by higher perioperative mortality (2.8% vs 0.9%; P &lt; .001). The composite end point of stroke/death/MI was also significantly worse in the occlusion cohort (7.7% vs 4.9%; P = .014). On multivariate analysis, carotid occlusion was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio, 3.028; 95% confidence interval, 1.362-6.730; P = .007) and composite outcome of stroke, death, or MI (odds ratio, 1.790; 95% confidence interval, 1.135-2.822; P = .012).
CONCLUSIONS: Revascularization for symptomatic carotid occlusion constitutes approximately 2% of carotid interventions captured in the Vascular Quality Initiative, affirming the rarity of this undertaking. These patients have acceptable rates of perioperative neurological events, but are at an elevated risk of overall perioperative adverse events, primarily driven by higher mortality, compared with those with severe stenosis. Carotid occlusion seems to be the most significant risk factor for the composite end point of perioperative stroke, death, or MI. Although intervention for a symptomatic carotid occlusion may be performed with acceptable rate of perioperative complications, judicious patient selection is warranted in this high-risk cohort.
