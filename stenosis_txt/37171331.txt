Title: Endoscopic pancreatic duct stenting combined with 3D laparoscopic pancreatic tumor resection: Three case reports.

Abstract: RATIONALE: This study explored the safety and feasibility of 3D laparoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound techniques, which made minimally invasive pancreatic surgery more precise and detailed.
PATIENT CONCERN: Case 1 was a 51-year-old man with a primary complaint of pancreatic tumor. Case 2 was a 60-year-old woman with complaints of tinnitus for 1 week. Case 3 was a 21-year-old woman with complaints of epigastric pain and abdominal distension for 1 day.
DIAGNOSIS: Case 1 and Case 2 were diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and Case 3 was diagnosed with an infected solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas.
INTERVENTIONS: All 3 patients underwent laparoscopic pancreatic surgery in our hospital.
OUTCOMES: All cases received the same perioperative management and no localized stenosis or dilatation of the pancreatic duct was found during follow-up.
LESSONS: With the development of minimally invasive surgery and the application of 3D laparoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound technology, pancreatic tumors that are tightly adhered to the main pancreatic duct can successfully be removed using 3D laparoscopic operation.
