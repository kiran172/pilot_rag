Title: Contrasting Cases of HIV Vasculopathy Associated Fusiform Aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) vasculopathy encompasses the development of aneurysms, stenosis and vessel occlusions. Intracranial fusiform aneurysms in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) were originally described in children; however, HIV-associated aneurysms are increasingly recognized in adults. Purpose: We present two cases to highlight the spectrum of severity and outline instructive clinical courses.
RESULTS: Case one is a 52-year-old woman with HIV, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)-defining progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and an 18 years course of cerebral aneurysms, aneurysm thrombosis and the development of right middle cerebral artery (MCA) moyamoya pattern collaterals. Case two is a 55-year-old man with AIDS-defining cerebral toxoplasmosis, complicated by IRIS and anterior and posterior circulation fusiform aneurysm formation. Conclusions: The combination of both fusiform abnormalities and Moyamoya, discussed in our first case has not been previously described. In comparison, our second case actually demonstrated improvement in vasculopathy after nine-months of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence.
