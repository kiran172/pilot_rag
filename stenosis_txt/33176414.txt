Title: Non-discogenic low back pain treated with oxygen-ozone: outcome in selected applications.

Abstract: Low back pain and sciatica are highly debilitating conditions affecting all socioeconomic groups at an increasingly early age. They are caused by different often concomitant spinal disorders: disc or facet joint disease, spondylolysis (with or without listhesis), vertebral body and interapophyseal arthrosis, spinal stenosis, radicular and synovial cysts and, more rarely, infections and primary or metastatic cancer. Treatment of low back pain and/or sciatica requires an accurate diagnosis based on thorough history-taking and physical examination followed by appropriate imaging tests, namely computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance scans in addition to standard and morphodynamics X-rays of the spine. In recent years, several reports have demonstrated the utility of oxygen-ozone therapy in reducing the size of herniated discs. The present study reports on the outcome of oxygen-ozone treatment in 576 patients with non-discogenic low back pain caused by degenerative disease of the posterior vertebral compartment (facet synovitis, Baastrup syndrome, spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis, facet degeneration).
