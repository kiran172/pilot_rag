Title: Laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy with bladder flap for benign ureteral stenosis: our initial experience.

Abstract: To present our experience with laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy with bladder flap (LUCBF) for treating benign ureteral stenosis and evaluate its feasibility and efficacy. The clinical data of 27 patients with benign ureteral stenosis who underwent LUCBF were retrospectively analyzed. After identification and excision of the ureteral stenosis segment, the healthy ureteral stump was dissected and incised longitudinally. A U-shaped or spiral bladder flap was harvested from the anterolateral bladder wall for ureteroplasty. All patients underwent LUCBF successfully, including 14 patients were combined with psoas hitch technique, between 90 and 220 min (median, 155 min). The median length of ureteral defect was 6 cm (range, 5-17 cm). The median blood loss was 40 ml (20-150 ml). The median indwelling time of double-J stent was 8 weeks (range, 4-8 weeks). Five patients (10.6%) suffered postoperative complications during the follow-up period (range, 12-48 months), including fever, hematuria, urinary tract infection and recurrent stenosis. The success rate was 96.3% (26/27). Patients with long ureter defects had longer operative time and more blood loss than short ureter defects. LUCBF was a safe and feasible technique for benign ureteral stenosis. Long ureter defect was related to longer operative time and more blood loss.
