Title: Eosinophilic Granulomatosis With Polyangiitis: An Unusual Case of Pediatric Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: Systemic disease is an uncommon cause of subglottic stenosis (SGS). We report a case of severe SGS due to underlying eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in a child presenting with isolated stridor. EGPA is a rare systemic vasculitis with very limited cases reported in the pediatric population. While surgical intervention was required given the degree of stenosis in this case, medical management of the underlying systemic disease process is critical when there is clinical suspicion of SGS in the context of systemic vasculitis.
