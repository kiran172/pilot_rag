Title: Laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy for malignant stenosis as a part of multimodal therapy: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy (LDJ) has become the standard surgical procedure for superior mesenteric artery syndrome due to its sufficient outcome in terms of safety and symptom relief. However, there are only a few reports about LDJ for malignant stenosis and its indication remains uncertain.
CASE SUMMARY: A 77-year-old woman with a history of pancreatic cancer (PC) treated with distal pancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the transverse colon 7 mo ago was admitted for recurrent vomiting. Imaging upon admission revealed marked distention of the duodenum and a tumor around the duodenojejunal flexure. She was diagnosed with malignant stenosis caused by local recurrence of PC. LDJ was performed with an uneventful postoperative course, followed by chemotherapy which gave her 10 mo overall survival.
CONCLUSION: We think that LDJ is a valuable method for unresectable malignant stenosis around the duodenojejunal flexure as a part of multimodal therapy.
