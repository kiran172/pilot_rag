Title: The Mitral/Aortic Flow Velocity Integral Ratio in Mitral Regurgitation.

Abstract: The development of echocardiography was driven, in part, by a need to diagnose mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing finger fracture commissurotomy in the 1950s. Decades later, color Doppler became the cornerstone for noninvasive evaluation of mitral regurgitation. The authors present 2 cases of calcific mitral stenosis in which reliance on color Doppler in transthoracic echocardiography resulted in erroneous conclusions as to the severity of coexisting mitral regurgitation. The possible application of the Mitral to Aortic Flow Velocity Integral Ratio in such cases as a possible adjunct to grading mitral regurgitation is also discussed.
