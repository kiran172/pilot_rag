Title: Common Calcified Femoral Artery Rupture After Intravascular Lithotripsy for TAVR Implantation.

Abstract: We describe a case with unfavorable calcified femoral access in which the implantation of a 34-mm self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve was possible after intravascular lithotripsy. Although the aortic valve was successfully implanted, we observed a severe vascular complication requiring the implantation of a covered stent of the femoral artery. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
