Title: Surgical glue-induced left main trunk stenosis removed by directional coronary atherectomy.

Abstract: A 55-year-old man underwent aortic repair for acute aortic dissection. The pseudolumen of the Valsalva sinus was reapproximated with BioGlue by placing a sponge inside of it to prevent the BioGlue from entering. Postoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed stenosis of the left main trunk. Directional coronary atherectomy was performed; complete release of the stenosis was achieved. Various fragments retrieved from the left main trunk were pathologically consistent with BioGlue. When we reapproximated the dissected aortic wall, inserting a sponge into the aorta did not prevent the surgical glue from entering. Directional coronary atherectomy was a good therapeutic option to treat glue-induced coronary artery stenosis.
