Title: Malignant character of an ossified posterior longitudinal ligament in a hyperflexion injury: A case report.

Abstract: The present study reports the case of a 50-year-old obese male with ankylosing spondylitis, Scheuermann's kyphosis. The patient was asymptomatic concerning the ectopic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) at the cervical spine; he developed quadriparesis and respiratory insufficiency following minor head trauma. Even though trauma to the cervical spine in patients with OPLL is common, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an extensive osteophyte with a lethal outcome after syncope. In rare occasions, it may be present with syncope and potentially lethal outcomes, particularly when precipitated by trauma. Therefore, the management of OPLL with significant canal stenosis should not be unnecessarily delayed.
