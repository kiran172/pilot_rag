Title: Successful balloon angioplasty in a cat with unilateral left pulmonary artery branch stenosis.

Abstract: A 9-month-old intact male Ragdoll cat was presented for evaluation of a left-sided systolic murmur that was first auscultated during examination for a newly developed cough. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a narrowed left pulmonary artery and an increase in flow velocities at the level of the narrowing, consistent with left pulmonary artery branch stenosis. The right pulmonary artery appeared normal. Balloon angioplasty was performed and successfully reduced pressure gradient across the stenosis. The patient continues to do well 14 months after the procedure.
