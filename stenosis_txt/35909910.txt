Title: Portal Vein Stenting for Jejunal Variceal Bleeding after Recurrence of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: A 73-year-old woman with portal vein stenosis caused by tumor recurrence after pancreatoduodenectomy was treated with stent placement without embolization of the jejunal varix. Anticoagulation therapy using heparin followed by rivaroxaban was administered after the procedure. She continued to receive systemic chemotherapy as an outpatient. Neither restenosis nor stent thrombosis was observed after 7 months. Based on the presented case and literature review, portal vein stenting is an effective treatment option for jejunal variceal bleeding caused by malignant portal venous stricture after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Antithrombotic therapy following portal venous stenting is required to prevent stent thrombosis in the majority of cases, although it has a risk of inducing recurrent variceal bleeding. Adjunctive jejunal variceal embolization can possibly be omitted in selected cases to obtain sufficient portal-SMV flow reconstruction.
