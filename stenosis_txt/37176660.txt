Title: Lipoprotein(a) As a Risk Factor in a Cohort of Hospitalised Cardiovascular Patients: A Retrospective Clinical Routine Data Analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a well-recognised risk factor for ischemic heart disease (IHD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (AVS).
METHODS: A retrospective observational study of Lp(a) levels (mg/dL) in patients hospitalised for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in our clinical routine was performed. The Lp(a)-associated risk of hospitalisation for IHD, AVS, and concomitant IHD/AVS versus other non-ischemic CVDs (oCVD group) was assessed by means of logistic regression.
RESULTS: In total of 11,767 adult patients, the association with Lp(a) was strongest in the IHD/AVS group (eβ = 1.010, p &lt; 0.001), followed by the IHD (eβ = 1.008, p &lt; 0.001) and AVS group (eβ = 1.004, p &lt; 0.001). With increasing Lp(a) levels, the risk of IHD hospitalisation was higher compared with oCVD in women across all ages and in men aged ≤75 years. The risk of AVS hospitalisation was higher only in women aged ≤75 years (eβ = 1.010 in age &lt; 60 years, eβ = 1.005 in age 60-75 years, p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The Lp(a)-associated risk was highest for concomitant IHD/AVS hospitalisations. The differential impact of sex and age was most pronounced in the AVS group with an increased risk only in women aged ≤75 years.
