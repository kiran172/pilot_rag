Title: Early surgery or conservative management for asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: Meta-analysis of RECOVERY and AVATAR.

Abstract: The standard practice for management for asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis with a normal left ventricular systolic function is conservative management with a few exceptions. This practice is challenged by two recent randomized controlled trials (RCT). All the prior data is observational. We performed a meta-analysis of these 2 RCTs to determine if early surgical aortic valve replacement in this patient population is beneficial compared with the standard conservative therapy.
