Title: Risk factors associated with urethral stricture recurrence after end-to-end urethroplasty and buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: (1) Assess risk factors associated with urethral stricture recurrence (USR). (2) Assess urethral stricture recurrence after end-to-end urethroplasty (EE) and buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty (BMG).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 29 males with urethral stricture who underwent either an end-to-end urethroplasty or a buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty were included in this study and followed for 18 months. The association between risk factors and stricture recurrence was assessed.
RESULTS: Overall mean patient age was 51.69 ± 14.22 years, time to recurrence was 3 months (IQR: 1-6.25), and stricture length was 2.57 ± 1.30 cm. Important risk factors for USR were stricture length ⩾ 2 cm (p = 0.024), older age (p = 0.042), BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 (p = 0.021), Q<sub>max</sub> after catheter removal &lt;15 ml/s (χ2 = 14.87 p ⩽ &lt;0.001) and previous urethral procedures adjusted for re-do BMG urethroplasty (χ2 = 6.10, p = 0.021). End-to-end urethroplasty showed less USR than BMG, however, these differences were not statistically significant (41.6% vs 22.2%, respectively, p ⩾ 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Stricture length, age, BMI, and previous urethral procedures predict USR, furthermore, an initial Q<sub>max</sub> after catheter removal is an objective measure predictive of USR. There's no difference in USR rate between BMG and EE urethroplasties.
