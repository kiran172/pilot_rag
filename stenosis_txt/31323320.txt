Title: Perioperative Hemodynamic Changes in the Thoracic Aorta in Patients With Aortic Valve Stenosis: A Prospective Serial 4D-Flow MRI Study.

Abstract: This study investigated hemodynamic changes in the thoracic aorta and aortic arch branches before and after aortic valve replacement (AVR) by 4D-flow MRI in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS). Thoracic 4D-flow MRI was performed in 10 AS patients before and after AVR (mean 27 ± 1.9 days). Fifteen aortic planes and 3 aortic arch branches planes were set to evaluate the mean volume flow rate in each plane during a cardiac cycle and the angle between the main flow direction in a specified plane and the axial direction of the aorta. We also focused on the distribution and magnitude of helicity density to evaluate the flow complexity. A significant increase in the volume flow rate after AVR was found in the ascending aorta (before 59.2 ± 8.7 mL/s vs after 77.3 ± 6.2 mL/s, P < 0.05) and the aortic arch branches (before 26.5 ± 2.8 mL/s vs after 35.8 ± 3.3 mL/s, P < 0.001). The flow angle significantly decreased in the ascending aorta (before 39.2 ± 2.7 degree vs after 25.2 ± 1.7°, P < 0.0001) and the arch aorta (before 19.3 ± 2.0 degree vs after 13.4 ± 0.9°, P < 0.001). The volume flow rate in the ascending aorta and the arch branches increased within 1 month after AVR, showing an increased blood supply to the upper body, including to the brain. The postoperative change was accompanied with an increased blood flow in the ascending aorta and a decreased flow complexity proximal to the arch branches.
