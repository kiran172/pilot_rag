Title: Iliac vein pathology and short-term stenting outcomes in a South-East Asian population: A single-centre experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Current literature regarding iliofemoral intervention and stenting is mostly based on Western populations. We present our experience of iliofemoral stenting for chronic venous disease within a South-East Asian population.
METHODS: This is a single-centre retrospective review of a prospectively collected registry. Seventy-one patients with 105 limbs underwent iliac vein IVUS and stenting between 2016 and 2019. All patients underwent pre-procedure ultrasound venous scan and MRI venogram. Pre- and post-operative CEAP classification, Villalta score and Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), technical results, stent patency rates and complication rates are documented.
RESULTS: Seventy-six per cent of the cases are non-thrombotic iliac vein lesion, and 68% of patients have C4 to C6 disease. Ten percentage of patients had acute thrombosis on presentation. There was 100% technical success. A 6- and 7-point reduction in the mean VCSS and Villalta score, respectively, were noted post-stenting (baseline of 10 points and P < 0.001 in both categories). Post-stenting ulcer healing rate was 91% at 6 and 12 months. One-year ulcer recurrence and cellulites recurrence were at 8% and 7%, respectively. One unplanned 30-day readmission (not related to procedure) and no 30-day mortality were noted. Bleeding complication from anticoagulation was 3%. There was 10% in-stent non-flow limiting stenosis on surveillance. One-year primary patency was 91%, and secondary patency was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Within our series, iliofemoral stenting has 100% technical success, with statistically significant reduction in VCSS and Villalta score, good wound healing rates, low ulcer and cellulites recurrence and good primary and secondary patency rates at 1 year.
