Title: Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential: an Expanding Genetic Cause of Cardiovascular Disease.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a novel cardiovascular risk factor that develops as aging hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) acquire somatic mutations which confer a clonal survival advantage in their progeny. These cells confer increased leukemogenic risk but confer a greater absolute risk of cardiovascular disease-which appears to be mediated through altered inflammatory pathways. Here we review the evidence the risk of cardiovascular disease conferred by CHIP. We also review the evidence regarding risk factors associated with CHIP.
RECENT FINDINGS: The most recent evidence suggests that CHIP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk beyond atherosclerosis, which has been established in multiple studies, but also in heart failure and aortic valve stenosis. Additionally, the list of conditions associated with CHIP continues to grow including germline genetics, smoking, cancer therapies, radiation exposure, premature menopause, and unhealthy diet. CHIP is a cardiovascular risk factor of increasingly recognized importance, and new data continues to emerge about the risks it confers, which will need more prospective validation. Although risk factors for CHIP are being identified, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which CHIP develops, which requires further study.
