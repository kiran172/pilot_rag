Title: Tracheal Resection for Post-intubation/Post-tracheostomy Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Post-intubation and post-tracheostomy tracheal stenoses are relatively uncommon common complications of prolonged intubation. Patients with tracheal stenosis usually present with stridor and dyspnea once a significant portion of their airway is compromised. Tracheal resection and reconstruction offer durable treatment options for these patients with minimal risk once initial endoscopic treatment has failed.
