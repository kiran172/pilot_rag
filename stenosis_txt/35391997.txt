Title: Clinically induced hypothermia with cardiopulmonary support in a high-risk patient undergoing carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: Contralateral carotid occlusion increases the risk of stroke by hypoperfusion in patients undergoing carotid surgery. We present the case of a high-risk patient with crescendo cerebral ischemic events, for whom clinically induced hypothermia controlled by cardiopulmonary bypass was applied as a protective measure during carotid endarterectomy.
