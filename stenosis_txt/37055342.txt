Title: Robot-assisted pyeloplasty: How to deal with anatomic variants? A step-by-step video presentation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Pyeloplasty (open or Robot-assisted) is the gold standard of a symptomatic UPJ stenosis. Sometimes anatomic variants make the procedure challenging. This video describes a step-by-step approach in three settings: a crossing blood vessel and two different presentations of incomplete duplicated system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Under general anesthesia, patient positioned in lateral decubitus, three trocars are placed. After mobilization of the colon, the Gerota's fascia is opened, and the renal pelvis is dissected off the surrounding structures. Ureter and obstructed pyelum were subsequently identified, mobilized, and hinged on a traction stitch. The pyelum and ureter are divided and spatulated according to the Anderson-Hynes technique; anastomosis is achieved. In variants, the drainage is one of the challenging steps, needing custom-made drainage of both moieties. Correct positioning of the drainage is confirmed with reflux of methylene blue from the bladder.
RESULTS: JJ stent was removed 6 weeks postoperatively in surgical day-clinic, additional drainage was removed 1 week after surgery in the outpatient clinic. All three children remain asymptomatic with over a year of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: A step-by-step plan for pyeloplasty in case of anatomic variants is presented with a video demonstrating a robot-assisted approach in duplicated systems. Moiety drainage can be challenging.
