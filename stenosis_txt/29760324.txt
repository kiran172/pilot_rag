Title: Endoconduit for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Access challenges are sometimes encountered in patients who require transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Transapical (TA) access is a well-established alternative, but it is more invasive than the standard transfemoral (TF) access techniques. We adopted the iliac endoconduit technique to perform TF TAVI in a patient with small-caliber, heavily calcified iliac arteries. This technique could provide an adequate access route for TAVI that is minimally invasive, even for patients with prohibitory iliac anatomy.
