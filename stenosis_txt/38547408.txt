Title: Oesophageal fluoroscopy in adults-when and why?

Abstract: Oesophageal fluoroscopy is a radiological procedure that uses dynamic recording of the swallowing process to evaluate morphology and function simultaneously, a characteristic not found in other clinical tests. It enables a comprehensive evaluation of the entire upper gastrointestinal tract, from the oropharynx to oesophagogastric bolus transport. The number of fluoroscopies of the oesophagus and the oropharynx has increased in recent decades, while the overall use of gastrointestinal fluoroscopic examinations has declined. Radiologists performing fluoroscopies need a good understanding of the appropriate clinical questions and the methodological advantages and limitations to adjust the examination to the patient's symptoms and clinical situation. This review provides an overview of the indications for oesophageal fluoroscopy and the various pathologies it can identify, ranging from motility disorders to structural abnormalities and assessment in the pre- and postoperative care. The strengths and weaknesses of this modality and its future role within different clinical scenarios in the adult population are discussed. We conclude that oesophageal fluoroscopy remains a valuable tool in diagnostic radiology for the evaluation of oesophageal disorders.
