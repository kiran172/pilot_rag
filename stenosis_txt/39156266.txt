Title: Elucidating the Neuropsychiatric Phenomena of Antiphospholipid Syndrome in a 31-Year-Old Female.

Abstract: We present an unusual case of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in a 31-year-old female patient exhibiting neuropsychiatric manifestations, followed by a subsequent thromboembolic stroke. APS is characterized by antiphospholipid antibodies leading to a prothrombotic state and an increased risk of thrombotic events. While the neurological involvement in APS typically presents with thrombotic events, antiphospholipid antibodies may also directly interact with neural tissue, causing immediate pathogenic effects that disrupt normal function. Neuropsychiatric manifestations in APS are rare but have been documented previously, including cases of psychosis and hallucinations. The timely recognition of APS in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms is crucial for appropriate management and the prevention of further complications. The reported patient displayed aggressive, bizarre, and erratic behavior upon admission to the psychiatric unit, followed by the development of right-sided facial droop and weakness. Imaging studies revealed stenosis and partial occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA), and a repeat scan showed a known left MCA territory infarct with increasing hypodensity in specific brain regions. Notably, the patient exhibited multiple purpuric ecchymoses on bilateral upper extremities, raising suspicion of a hypercoagulable state. Laboratory investigations detected elevated levels of anticardiolipin IgG and beta-2 glycoprotein 1 IgG, along with a positive antinuclear antibody. The presence of a patent foramen ovale was also confirmed through echocardiography. This case emphasizes the importance of early APS recognition in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms, facilitating appropriate intervention and improved outcomes. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms connecting APS to neuropsychiatric manifestations, enabling enhanced understanding and refined management of this intricate condition.
