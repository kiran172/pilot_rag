Title: Comparison of the clinical effectiveness of hepaticojejunostomy and self-expanding metal stents for bypassing the bile ducts in patients with unresectable pancreatic head cancer complicated by obstructive jaundice.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Aim: To improve treatment outcomes of patients with unresectable pancreatic head cancer complicated by obstructive jaundice by improving the tactics and techniques of surgical interventions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and Methods: Depending on the treatment tactics, patients were randomised to the main group (53 people) or the comparison group (54 people). The results of correction of obstructive jaundice by Roux-en-Y end to side hepaticojejunostomy (main group) and common bile duct prosthetics with self-expanding metal stents (comparison group) were compared.
RESULTS: Results: The use of self-expanding metal stents for internal drainage of the biliary system compared to hepaticojejunostomy operations reduced the incidence of postoperative complications by 29.9% (χ2=13.7, 95% CI 14.38-44.08, p=0.0002) and mortality by 7.5% (χ2=4.16, 95% CI -0.05-17.79, p=0.04). Within 8-10 months after biliary stenting, 11.1% (6/54) of patients developed recurrent jaundice and cholangitis, and another 7.4% (4/54) of patients developed duodenal stenosis with a tumour. These complications led to repeated hospitalisation and biliary restentation in 4 (7.4%) cases, and duodenal stenting by self-expanding metal stents in 4 (7.4%) patients.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The choice of biliodigestive shunting method should be selected depending on the expected survival time of patients. If the prognosis of survival is up to 8 months, it is advisable to perform prosthetics of the common bile duct with self-expanding metal stents, if more than 8 months, it is advisable to perform hepaticojejunal anastomosis with prophylactic gastrojejunal anastomosis.
