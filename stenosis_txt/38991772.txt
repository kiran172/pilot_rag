Title: MCA Parallel Anatomic Scanning MR Imaging-Guided Recanalization of a Chronic Occluded MCA by Endovascular Treatment.

Abstract: Basi-parallel anatomic scanning has been widely used for assessing the vascular morphology of vertebral basilar arteries. Previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy in evaluating the morphology of the MCA, which we refer to as MCA parallel anatomic scanning MR imaging (MCPAS). In this study, we present our experience with the application of MCPAS in patients with MCA occlusion. Endovascular treatment was performed on the patients with intact MCA morphology visible in on MCPAS, with no intracranial hemorrhage, occlusion, or other complications observed. No severe stenosis or re-occlusion was observed at the 12-month postoperative follow-up. In conclusion, MCPAS is an effective method for assessing the outer contour of an occlusive MCA. Endovascular treatment can be considered a safe and efficient option for patients who show a favorable MCA through MCPAS assessment.
