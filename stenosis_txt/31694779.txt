Title: Ischemic stroke caused by giant cell arteritis associated with pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common vasculitis in patients older than 50â€¯years, and it is occasionally a cause of ischemic stroke. GCA as a paraneoplastic manifestation has been rarely described. We describe a 77-year-old man with a sudden onset of dizziness, vomiting, and gait disturbances. Following imaging studies, a diagnosis of bulbar ischemic stroke with left vertebral artery stenosis was made. Based on a history of polymyalgia rheumatica, on laboratory tests, and brain digital subtraction angiography, a diagnosis of GCA was advanced and the patient underwent high-dose steroidal therapy. After a total body 18-FGD PET imaging, a pulmonary adenocarcinoma was found. Vertebral artery involvement is a rare but important occurrence in GCA as it carries a high mortality rate, and may require a vigorous therapeutic approach. The association of lung cancer and GCA is infrequent, and the relationship between malignancy and GCA remains unclear. Whereas the search for a malignancy in the setting of a GCA is not routinely performed, the use of total body PET when a large vessel vasculitis is suspected may provide useful information on disease and help recognize occult neoplasms.
