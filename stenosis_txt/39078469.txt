Title: Aortic valve thrombosis in nephrotic syndrome: a case report.

Abstract: We report a rare case of aortic valve thrombosis in a 55-year-old man. He had reduced urine output and generalized edema four days before admission. He felt sick and had chest pain on the day of admission. Severe hypoalbuminemia and massive proteinuria were present, and a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome was made. An electrocardiogram showed findings suspicious for acute myocardial infarction, and emergency catheterization was performed. However, no coronary artery stenosis or occlusion was found at that time. A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT scan and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a thrombus in the aortic valve. The thrombus nearly occluded the left coronary artery. Emergency surgery was performed to remove the thrombus. His postoperative course was stable, but nephrotic syndrome persisted. A renal biopsy diagnosed minimal change disease. Treatment with 50Â mg/day of prednisolone induced remission, and he was discharged on day 43. There were no aortic valve abnormalities. Nephrotic syndrome was considered the main contributor to thrombus formation. Aortic valve thrombosis associated with nephrotic syndrome is a very rare but potentially fatal condition that requires attention.
