Title: Imaging Challenges in the Diagnosis of Anatomical Variations of the Supra-Aortic Vessels: A Case Report and Review of Literature.

Abstract: A 73-year-old woman was referred to our Cardiology Department due to recurrent headaches and dizziness. She had a history of hypertension of 10 years. In the territorial hospital, left internal carotid artery significant stenosis was suspected. Neurological examination and laboratory tests were normal. A neck vascular ultrasound was performed, showing a low bifurcation of the left common carotid artery (CCA) and a hypoplastic left internal carotid artery (ICA) with a sinuous path at the cervical level. Therefore, a computed tomographic (CT) angiography examination of the head and neck vessels was performed. The images confirmed the presence of a hypoplastic left ICA, anatomic variation in the left CCA, and also showed that the left vertebral artery (VA) was stemming directly from the aortic arch, exhibiting a kinking trajectory.
