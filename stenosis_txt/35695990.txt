Title: Indications and timing of revision spine surgery in adults after adolescent surgery for idiopathic scoliosis.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
PURPOSE: To characterize the indications and timing of revision spine surgery in adulthood after adolescent surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Previous studies have shown that revision usually occurs within 3 months or more than 5 years after the index operation. It is not clear what the indications for and timeline to revision surgery are in these patients during adulthood.
METHODS: 421 patients with idiopathic scoliosis were seen as adults over a 15-year period. 81 patients who had scoliosis surgery prior to age 18 were identified. This cohort was studied for indications and time from index to revision operation. Their clinical presentation and a description of their revision operation was also documented.
RESULTS: Of the 81 patients, 18 (22.2%) had a revision surgery as an adult. Indications for revision in order of prevalence were implant malposition, subjacent segment degeneration and stenosis, pseudoarthrosis, delayed deep wound infection, spondylolisthesis, and symptomatic implants. Revisions were indicated generally within 15 years or more than 30 years after the initial operation.
CONCLUSIONS: The timeline for revision spine surgery in idiopathic scoliosis was bimodal, with revisions occurring within 15 years or over 30 years after the initial operation. Implant malposition and subjacent segment degeneration were the most prevalent indications for adulthood revision.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic-IV.
