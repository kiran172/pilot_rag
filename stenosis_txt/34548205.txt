Title: Renal-Resistive Index for Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury in the Setting of Aortic Insufficiency.

Abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common postoperative complication after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Although early recognition and management of AKI may reduce the burden of renal disease, reliance on serum creatinine accumulation to confidently diagnose it leads to a significant and important delay (up to 48 hours). Hence, a search for earlier AKI biomarkers is warranted. The renal-resistive index (RRI) is a promising early AKI biomarker that reflects intrarenal arterial pulsatility as reflected by the peak systolic and end-diastolic blood velocities divided by the peak systolic velocity. During cardiac surgery, post-CPB elevation of RRI is correlated with renal injury. The RRI is influenced by intrarenal and extrarenal factors, as well as different hemodynamic states. Understanding its limitations may increase its usefulness as an early AKI biomarker. For example, tachycardia or aortic stenosis typically results in a lower RRI, whereas bradycardia or increased systemic pulse pressure (as seen with aortic insufficiency) are associated with a higher RRI, unrelated to any intrarenal effects. In this E-Challenge, the authors present two cases in which the RRI was used to evaluate a patient's risk of developing AKI.
