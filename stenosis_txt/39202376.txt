Title: Cardiac Phenotype and Gene Mutations in RASopathies.

Abstract: Cardiac involvement is a major feature of RASopathies, a group of phenotypically overlapping syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes encoding components of the RAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway. In particular, Noonan syndrome (NS) is associated with a wide spectrum of cardiac pathologies ranging from congenital heart disease (CHD), present in approximately 80% of patients, to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), observed in approximately 20% of patients. Genotype-cardiac phenotype correlations are frequently described, and they are useful indicators in predicting the prognosis concerning cardiac disease over the lifetime. The aim of this review is to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cardiac diseases associated particularly with NS, and to discuss the main morphological and clinical characteristics of the two most frequent cardiac disorders, namely pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) and HCM. We will also report the genotype-phenotype correlation and its implications for prognosis and treatment. Knowing the molecular mechanisms responsible for the genotype-phenotype correlation is key to developing possible targeted therapies. We will briefly address the first experiences of targeted HCM treatment using RAS/MAPK pathway inhibitors.
