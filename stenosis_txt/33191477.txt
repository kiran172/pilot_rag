Title: A case of eosinophilic cholangiopathy mimicking cholangiocarcinoma.

Abstract: Eosinophilic cholangiopathy is an uncommon etiology of biliary stenosis, which is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish eosinophilic cholangiopathy from other causes of obstructive cholangiopathy before pathologic confirmation. We report a case of eosinophilic cholangiopathy. A 30-year-old male patient complained of right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed distended gallbladder and multifocal bile duct strictures with diffuse wall thickening. His bilirubin level increased continuously even after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis and pathology of resected gallbladder revealed marked eosinophilic infiltration with no malignant component. His pain improved after cholecystectomy and multifocal bile duct strictures with wall thickening were rapidly improved after steroid therapy.
