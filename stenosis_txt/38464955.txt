Title: Management of acute airway compromise secondary to cricoid chondroma.

Abstract: The presentation of acute and rapidly deteriorating airway pathology can be a highly challenging situation for any hospital team. Cricoid chondromas are a challenging and potentially unfamiliar airway pathology requiring the combined expertise of anaesthetists, ear, nose and throat surgeons and a wider peri-operative team familiar with managing airway emergencies. Airway lesions which cause rigid and fixed stenosis require careful management and present additional challenges compared to soft tissue lesions. An important consideration in fixed airway stenosis is the external diameter of tracheal tubes compared to the diameter of the airway at its narrowest point. These are challenging cases to manage and a multi-disciplinary approach to the safe management of unfamiliar and critical airway pathology should be adopted.
