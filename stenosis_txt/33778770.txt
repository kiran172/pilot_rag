Title: The role of pericytes in hyperemia-induced capillary de-recruitment following stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The microvascular capillary network is ensheathed by cells called pericytes - a heterogeneous population of mural cells derived from multiple lineages. Pericytes play a multifaceted role in the body, including in vascular structure and permeability, regulation of local blood flow, immune and wound healing functions, induction of angiogenesis, and generation of various progenitor cells. Here, we consider the role of pericytes in capillary de-recruitment, a pathophysiologic phenomenon that is observed following hyperemic stimuli in the presence of a stenosis and attenuates the hyperemic response.
RECENT FINDINGS: We discuss recent observations that conclusively demonstrate pericytes to be the cellular structures that contract in response to hyperemic stimuli when an upstream arterial stenosis is present. This response constricts capillaries, which is likely aimed at maintaining capillary hydrostatic pressure, an important factor in tissue homeostasis. Nonetheless, the ensuing attenuation of the hyperemic response can lead to a decrease in energy supply and negatively impact tissue health.
SUMMARY: Therapeutics aimed at preventing pericyte-mediated capillary de-recruitment may prove beneficial in conditions such as coronary stenosis and peripheral arterial disease by reducing restriction in hyperemic flow. Identification of the pericyte subtypes involved in this de-recruitment and the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating this process will greatly assist this purpose.
