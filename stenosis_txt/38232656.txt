Title: Broncho-esophageal fistula: When surgery and endoscopy fail, consider physiological lung exclusion.

Abstract: We discuss the case of an esophageal cancer patient treated by chemo and radiotherapy complicated by an esophageal stenosis and an iatrogenic broncho-esophageal fistula. This latter was managed with multiple palliative stenting procedures and colonic surgical bypass. Despite a long disease free survival but decreased quality of life and frailty, we came to the proposal of an extremely unusual form of treatment - physiological lung exclusion, with clinical benefit and so far without any drawbacks related to the procedure.
