Title: Statin suppresses the development of excessive intimal proliferation in a Kawasaki disease mouse model.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease (KD) causes vascular injury and lifelong remodeling. Excessive intimal proliferation has been observed, resulting in coronary artery lesions (CALs). However, the mechanisms underlying vascular remodeling in CAL and statin treatment have not been comprehensively elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of statins on vascular remodeling using a KD mouse model. Candida albicans water-soluble substance (CAWS) was intraperitoneally injected in 5-week-old male apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice. They were categorized as follows (n = 4): control, CAWS, CAWS+statin, and late-statin groups. The mice were euthanized at 6 or 10 weeks after injection. Statins (atorvastatin) were initiated after CAWS injection, except for the late-statin group, for which statins were internally administered 6 weeks after injection. Elastica van Gieson staining and immunostaining were performed for evaluation. Statins substantially suppressed the marked neointimal hyperplasia induced by CAWS. Additionally, CAWS induced TGFβ receptor II and MAC-2 expression around the coronary arteries, which was suppressed by the statins. KD-like vasculitis might promote the formation of aneurysm by destroying elastic laminae and inducing vascular stenosis by neointimal proliferation. The anti-inflammatory effects of statins might inhibit neointimal proliferation. Therefore, statin therapy might be effective in adult patients with KD with CAL by inhibiting vascular remodeling.
