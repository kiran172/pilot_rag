Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis-We Need a Well-Designed Randomized Control Trial.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic stenosis is a common pathology, typically seen in patients a decade younger than those with tricuspid valves. Surgical aortic valve replacement has been the mainstay treatment for bicuspid disease, especially considering the prevalence of concomitant aortic aneurysmal pathology. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has shown equivalent results in bicuspid compared to tricuspid pathology in highly selected patient populations in single-arm registries and observational studies. For older patients with favorable bicuspid pathology, TAVR is reasonable. However, as younger patients with longer life expectancy are now being treated with TAVR, what is "best" is a question only answered by a well-designed randomized controlled trial. Herein, we describe the current evidence for treating bicuspid aortic stenosis and provide a framework for future trials. Yet, the question of equipoise remains, and who will we enroll?
