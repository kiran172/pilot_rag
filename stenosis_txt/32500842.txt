Title: Physical components of frailty in predicting mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study investigates physical, nutritional and psychological components of frailty in predicting postoperative mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: A single centre retrospective observational study was conducted from July 2015 until January 2019. Psychological, nutritional and physical components of frailty were measured. Sarcopenia was defined as having both gait speed and grip strength under the threshold. The primary endpoint was the cumulative all-cause 1-year mortality. Secondary endpoint was 30 days all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were included. The primary endpoint was observed in 18 patients (14.4%). Five patients died within the first 30 days (4.0%). None of the frailty tests were correlated with early mortality. However, at one year, the nutritional components albumin and Mini Nutritional Assessment - short form (MNA-SF) and the physical components gait speed, chair stand test, TUG, SPPB, EFT and sarcopenia were associated with increased mortality after TAVI. A significant difference in mortality was present if stratified for MNA-SF (log-rank p = .008), sarcopenia (log-rank p &lt; .001), SPPB (log-rank p = .003) and EFT score (log-rank p &lt; .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mainly nutritional and physical components of frailty were associated with 1-year mortality after TAVI.
