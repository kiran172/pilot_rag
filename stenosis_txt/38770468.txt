Title: First Experience With the Utility of ReMAP (Repeatable Microcatheter Access Port) in Portal Vein Stenting.

Abstract: Portal vein stenting is a treatment option for portal hypertension caused by extrahepatic portal vein obstruction or stenosis. However, limited pathways to approach the portal vein are available, hindering re-intervention in the portal vein. Portal vein puncture through the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt route is less invasive and considered suitable for portal vein stenting. Furthermore, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting facilitates repeat approaches to the portal vein. However, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt stent is not recommended unless necessary because of adverse events, and cannot be retrieved, once placed. Herein, we report on a novel approach using the repeatable microcatheter access port: ReMAPâ„¢ (Toray, Tokyo, Japan), a central vein port into which a 2.9 Fr catheter can be inserted. We used it for a repeat approach to the portal vein with only one puncture and without placing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt stent.
