Title: Rapid development of an iatrogenic aortic dissection following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) represents a catheter-based and minimally invasive replacement of the aortic valve. TAVI is considered to be a relatively safe procedure and has evolved to a standard procedure in inoperable and high-risk patients with aortic stenosis. We present a case of an octogenarian who died in hospital less than a day after an initially satisfactory TAVI. Cardiologists suspected a combination of cardiogenic and hemorrhagic shock as the cause of death. Autopsy showed rupture of an extensive aortic dissection, which had developed within 24Â h after the procedure. The cause of death was eventually defined as internal bleeding due to a rapid two-stage vascular process. The manner of death was considered accidental because an iatrogenic vessel injury beyond the aortic arch was causative for the death. This unusual case highlights the potential for rare, but fatal, complications within the scope of cardiac catheterizations, such as TAVI. Additionally, our findings suggest that these complications need to be recognized in the diagnostic process and management of post-interventional complications.
