Title: Impact of coronary bifurcation angle on computed tomography derived fractional flow reserve in coronary vessels with no apparent coronary artery disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT) derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) decreases from the proximal to the distal part due to a variety of factors. The energy loss due to the bifurcation angle may potentially contribute to a progressive decline in FFR<sub>CT</sub>. However, the association of the bifurcation angle with FFR<sub>CT</sub> is still not entirely understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of various bifurcation angles on FFR<sub>CT</sub> decline below the clinically crucial relevance of 0.80 in vessels with no apparent coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: A total of 83 patients who underwent both CT angiography including FFR<sub>CT</sub> and invasive coronary angiography, exhibiting no apparent CAD were evaluated. ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> was defined as the change in FFR<sub>CT</sub> from the proximal to the distal in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCX). The bifurcation angle was calculated from three-dimensional volume rendered images. Vessel morphology and plaque characteristics were also assessed.
RESULTS: ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> significantly correlated with the bifurcation angle (LAD angle, r = 0.35, p = 0.001; LCX angle, r = 0.26, p = 0.02) and vessel length (LAD angle, r = 0.30, p = 0.005; LCX angle, r = 0.49, p &lt; 0.0001). In LAD, vessel length was the strongest predictor for distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> of ≤ 0.80 (β-coefficient = 0.55, p = 0.0003), immediately followed by the bifurcation angle (β-coefficient = 0.24, p = 0.02). The bifurcation angle was a good predictor for a distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 (LAD angle, cut-off 31.0°, AUC 0.70, sensitivity 74%, specificity 68%; LCX angle, cut-off 52.6°, AUC 0.86, sensitivity 88%, specificity 85%).
CONCLUSIONS: In vessels with no apparent CAD, vessel length was the most influential factor on FFR<sub>CT</sub>, directly followed by the bifurcation angle.
KEY POINTS: • Both LAD and LCX bifurcation angles are factors influencing FFR <sub>CT</sub>. • Bifurcation angle is one of the predictors of a distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> of ≤ 0.80 and an optimal cut-off value of 31.0° for the LAD and 52.6° for the LCX. • Bifurcation angle should be taken into consideration when interpreting numerical values of FFR<sub>CT</sub>.
