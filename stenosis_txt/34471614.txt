Title: Balloon dilation laryngoplasty for acquired subglottic stenosis at a tertiary center in India.

Abstract: To evaluate outcomes of balloon dilation laryngoplasty for laryngeal stenosis. It is a retrospective study done at Civil Hospital Ahmedabad from Feb 2017 to Jan 2019. All patients treated with laryngeal balloon dilation with acquired subglotticstenosis with normal vocal cord mobility. Stenosis severity, Measured using the Cotton and Meyer classification, and McCaffery grading system. A total of 10 patients of acquired subglotticstenosis ranging in age from 16-64Â y (5 [50%] with grade II stenos is, 3 [30%] with grade I stenosis, and 2 [9%] with grade IIIstenos is) were included. A total of 10 balloon dilation laryngoplasties were performed, and 9 (90%) were deemed successful. Four of the 5 patients undergoing primary dilation (90%) had successful outcomes, and in the other 1 [10%], outcomes were unsuccessful and required either laryngotracheal reconstruction or tracheotomy. Five balloon dilations were performed as a secondary procedure after recent open surgery; all of the procedures (100%) were successful, and thus surgical revision was avoided. After balloon dilatation,among 7 tracheostomised patients, 6 patient got decannulated. Balloon dilation laryngoplasty is an efficient and safe technique for the treatment of both primary and secondary acquired laryngotrachealstenosis. Minimal intervention with maximum results.
