Title: The use of overlapping self-expandable covered stents in the management of long-segment tracheobronchomalacia: A case report.

Abstract: Tracheomalacia is a condition where the tracheal wall is abnormally soft and prone to collapse during increased respiratory efforts. Airway malacia can manifest as segmental conditions like laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia, or as diffuse conditions such as tracheobronchomalacia (TBM). Unlike long-segment congenital tracheal stenosis, where surgery may be the preferred treatment, the management of long-segment TBM remains controversial.
