Title: Comparison of nasojejunal nutrition and intravenous nutrition supplementation in patients with upper gastrointestinal tract strictures and analysis of risk factors for malnutrition.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of nasojejunal and intravenous nutrition in supplementing nutrition for patients with upper gastrointestinal (GI) strictures and analyzes the risk factors associated with malnutrition to provide references for clinical nutrition strategies. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 71 patients with upper GI strictures caused by esophageal and gastric cancers, who received nutritional support from January 2015 to January 2023. Out of these, 53 patients had complete baseline and follow-up data. We collected general clinical and perioperative data for comparison of the efficacy between nasojejunal nutrition and intravenous nutrition. Risk factors for malnutrition were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Malnutrition occurred in 24.53% (13/53) of the patients with upper GI strictures. The incidence of malnutrition was 6.06% (2/33) in the nasojejunal nutrition group compared to 55.00% (11/20) in the intravenous nutrition group, with a statistically significant difference (P < .001). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses identified diabetes (P < .001), initial blood K (P = .011), pathological staging (P < .001), and pathological grading (P < .001) as risk factors for malnutrition in patients with upper GI strictures. Diabetes (P = .028), initial blood K (P = .018), and pathological staging (P = .011) were found to be independent risk factors. Nasojejunal nutrition results in a lower incidence of malnutrition compared to intravenous nutrition in patients with upper GI strictures. Diabetes, initial blood K, pathological staging, and pathological grading are risk factors for malnutrition, with diabetes, initial blood K, and pathological staging serving as independent risk factors.
