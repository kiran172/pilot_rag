Title: Potential anatomical determinants of retrograde menstruation: a comprehensive narrative review.

Abstract: A century ago, Sampson identified three uterine anatomical structures that may determine the amount of retrograde menstruation and the likelihood of the development of endometriosis: the cervix, the intramural portion of the fallopian tubes, and the myometrium. Critical appraisal was undertaken of data published over the last 40 years on the potential effect of the characteristics of these three anatomical variables on the risk of endometriosis. There is some evidence to support the pathogenic role of the diameter of the cervical canal, stenosis of internal or external orifices, and stiffness of cervical tissue. One study showed a significant association between the morphology of the intramural tubal tract and the frequency of endometriosis. A large body of evidence points to abnormalities of the myometrial structure as the anatomical aberration most consistently associated with endometriosis. These abnormalities have largely been interpreted as signs of early-onset adenomyosis, which may precede endometriosis and even lead to its development by increasing the amount of retrograde menstruation. Future research should aim to verify whether a positive relationship exists between the substantially increased number of ovulatory menses occurring in the decade following menarche, the development of anatomical myometrial abnormalities, changes in the amount of retrograde menstruation over time, and the risk of endometriosis.
