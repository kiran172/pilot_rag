Title: Ustekinumab is effective against ulcerative colitis with intestinal stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Intestinal stricture and obstruction are rare complications of ulcerative colitis (UC). Currently, there are only a few studies on the treatment of UC with intestinal stenosis, however there are no reports on the treatment of UC with benign intestinal stenosis with ustekinumab (UST).
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 22-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to a 3-year history of recurrent bloody mucous in stool with intermittent abdominal pain and distension developed in the past month. She was steroid-dependent and had developed a secondary loss of response to infliximab.
DIAGNOSES: She was diagnosed with UC combined with incomplete intestinal obstruction due to stenosis. The stricture had a mixed pattern with both inflammatory and fibrotic components, with the former covering a larger section of the intestine.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient was given UST for 56 weeks.
OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms subsided after treatment with UST. The ulcers healed, and the stenosis was reduced.
LESSONS: UST is effective against UC with benign intestinal stenosis. It is thought that UST inhibits the production of transforming growth factor-Î² and interleukin-17, leading to the suppression of myofibroblast proliferation, ultimately alleviating intestinal stenosis.
