Title: JAK-inhibitor Tofacitinib in Severe Laryngeal Sarcoidosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory, non-caseating granulomatous multisystem disease associated with JAK-STAT (Janus kinases-signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins) pathway activation. We present a patient with severe multi-systemic sarcoidosis who showed marked improvement with tofacitinib with regards to pulmonary, cutaneous, nasal and laryngeal disease. Tofacitinib prevented critical laryngeal stenosis from progressing to tracheostomy, induced regression of cutaneous lesions and improved pulmonary function in this steroid-resistant and immunosuppressive intolerant case. This case report supports further the role of JAK-inhibitors in the treatment of systemic sarcoidosis. Laryngoscope, 2024.
