Title: Quantification of subclinical plaque characteristics and perivascular fat using coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) among individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: People infected with human immunodeficiency virus (PIWH) have a higher risk of cardiovascular events. This study was designed to compare the differences in plaque characteristics and perivascular fat between subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in PIWH and healthy controls (HC) by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). We also assessed the associations between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a total of 158 PIWH and 79 controls. CCTA was used to evaluate coronary artery plaque prevalence, coronary stenosis severity, plaque composition, plaque volume, and perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI). Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between the prevalence of coronary artery plaque and HIV-related clinical indicators.
RESULTS: There was no difference in total coronary artery plaque prevalence between PIWH and controls (44.3% vs. 32.9%; P=0.09), but the prevalence of noncalcified plaque was significantly higher in PIWH compared with the controls (33.5% vs. 16.5%; P=0.006). After adjustment for age, sex, statin use, and family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the prevalence of noncalcified plaque remained 2 times higher in PIWH [odds ratio (OR), 2.082; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.007-4.304; P=0.048]. The perivascular FAI measured around the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was higher in PIWH (-71.4±5.7 vs. -73.5±7.0; P=0.03) compared with that of the controls. The intra-group analyses of PIWH suggested that the decrease in nadir CD4+ T-cell count was associated with the increased prevalence of noncalcified plaque (OR, 4.139; 95% CI: 1.312-13.060; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: PIWH have a higher risk of developing noncalcified plaque and greater perivascular fat. In addition, the increased noncalcified plaque prevalence in PIWH may be associated with the immunodeficiency caused by HIV.
