Title: Classification of severe aortic stenosis and outcomes after aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Aortic valve calcium scoring by cardiac computed tomographic (CT) has been recommended as an alternative to classify the AS (aortic stenosis) severity, but it is unclear that whether CT findings would have additional value to discriminate significant AS subtypes including high gradient severe AS, classic low-flow, low gradient (LF-LG) AS, paradoxical LF-LG AS, and moderate AS. In this study, we examined the preoperative clinical and cardiac CT findings of different subtypes of AS in patients with surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and evaluated the subtype classification as a factor affecting post-surgical outcomes. This study included 511 (66.9 ± 8.8 years, 55% men) consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent surgical AVR. Aortic valve area (AVA) was obtained by echocardiography (AVA<sub>echo</sub>) and by CT (AVA<sub>CT</sub>) using each modalities measurement of the left ventricular outflow tract. Patients with AS were classified as (1) high-gradient severe (n = 438), (2) classic LF-LG (n = 18), and (3) paradoxical LF-LG (n = 55) based on echocardiography. In all patients, 455 (89.0%) patients were categorized as severe AS according to the AVA<sub>CT</sub>. However, 56 patients were re-classified as moderate AS (43 [9.8%] high-gradient severe AS, 5 [27.8%] classic LF-LG AS, and 8 [14.5%] paradoxical LF-LG AS) by AVA<sub>CT</sub>. The classic LF-LG AS group presented larger AVA<sub>CT</sub> and aortic annulus than those in high-gradient severe AS group and one third of them had AVA<sub>CT</sub> ≥ 1.2 cm2. After multivariable adjustment, old age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04, P = 0.049), high B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (HR, 1.005; P &lt; 0.001), preoperative atrial fibrillation (HR, 2.75; P = 0.003), classic LF-LG AS (HR, 5.53, P = 0.004), and small aortic annulus on CT (HR, 0.57; P = 0.002) were independently associated with major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) after surgical AVR.
