Title: Delayed Remote Intracerebral Hemorrhage after Wingspan Stenting for Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis Following the On-Label Usage Guidelines.

Abstract: Remote intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is defined as an ICH that occurs at a distant site from the treated lesion and is a considerable post-neurointerventional complication. Because such a life-threatening complication should not be neglected, we report our experience with delayed remote ICH in a patient with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) treated by Wingspan stenting following on-label usage guidelines. A middle-aged person suffered a lobar-type subcortical hemorrhage on the left temporal lobe 22 days after Wingspan stenting in the left internal carotid artery. The present case seemed to correspond with a previous report in which remote ICH tended to occur as an ipsilateral lobar-type hemorrhage in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysm on the internal carotid artery undergoing treatment with stents or flow diverters. Delayed remote ICH should be considered as a potential risk of using a Wingspan stent covering the carotid siphon for ICAS.
