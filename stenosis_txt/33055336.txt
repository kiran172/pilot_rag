Title: MODERN METHODS OF PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF COMPLICATIONS OF CERVICAL ESOPHAGO-ORGAN ANASTOMOSIS AT ESOPHAGOPLASTY.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim: To improve the results of operative treatment of esophageal strictures by decreasing the rate of failure and stricture of cervical esophago-organ anastomoses.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: There were 45 patients with post-burn corrosive gullet strictures, 17 patients with postoperative corrosive strictures, 10 patients with peptic strictures secondary to reflux-esophagitis, 42 patients with esophageal cancer strictures. The patients were divided into two groups: the comparison group - 55 persons and the main group - 59 persons. Patients of comparison group underwent surgical treatment of esophageal strictures according to classic protocols and standards. In the main group of patients we applied proposed diagnostic algorithm with prediction of complication risk and the designed method of esophago-organ anastomosis formation.
RESULTS: Results: The results of operative treatment in patients with esophageal strictures showed the development of early postoperative complications in 59 individuals (51.75 %). In the postoperative period six patients died: four - in the comparison group and two - in the main group. Failure of cervical esophago-organ anastomosis and esophageal strictures occurred in 7 patients (11.86 %) of main group and 20 patients (36.36 %) of the comparison group (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Application of method predicting the risk of complications of cervical anastomosis, treatment program and instrumental method of formation anastomosis resulted in reduced incidence of failure and strictures of esophago-organ anastomosis from 36.36 % to 11.86 % (p<0.05); decreased time of hospitalization - from 28.2 ± 1.1 to 21.5 ± 0.5 bed-days (p<0.001), postoperative period - from 20.5 ± 1.1 to 16.1 ± 0.7 bed-days (p<0.01); decreased postoperative mortality - from 7.27 % to 3.39 %.
