Title: Approaches to reconstruction of inferior vena cava by ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation in 114 patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is most commonly found in retrohepatic inferior vena cava (RHIVC). Ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation (ELRA) can better realize the radical resection of end-stage hepatic AE with severely compromised hepatocaval confluences, and reconstruction of the affected vessels. Currently, there is a scarcity of information regarding RHIVC reconstruction in ELRA.
AIM: To propose reasonable RHICV reconstruction strategies for ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation.
METHODS: We retrospectively summarized the clinical data of 114 patients diagnosed with hepatic AE who treated by ELRA in our department. A total of 114 patients were divided into three groups according to the different reconstruction methods of RHIVC: Group A with original RHIVC being repaired and reconstructed (n = 64), group B with RHIVC being replaced (n = 43), and group C with RHIVC being resected without reconstruction (n = 7). The clinical data of patients, including the operation time, anhepatic phase, intraoperative blood loss, complications and postoperative hospital stay, were analyzed and the patients were routinely followed up. The normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as means ± SD, whereas the abnormally distributed ones were expressed as median and analyzed by analysis of variance. Survival curve was plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: All patients were routinely followed up for a median duration of 52 (range, 12-125) mo. The 30 d mortality rate was 7.0% (8/114) and 7 patients died within 90 d. Among all subjects, the inferior vena cava (IVC)-related complication rates were 17.5% (11/63) in group A and 16.3% (7/43) in group B. IVC stenosis was found in 12 patients (10.5%), whereas thrombus was formed in 6 patients (5.3%). Twenty-two patients had grade III or higher complications, with the complication rates being 17.2%, 16.3%, and 57.1% in the three groups. The average postoperative hospital stay in the three groups was 32.3 ± 19.8, 26.7 ± 18.2, and 51.3 ± 29.4 d (P = 0.03), respectively.
CONCLUSION: ELRA can be considered a safe and feasible option for end-stage hepatic AE patients with RHIVC infiltration. The RHIVC reconstruction methods should be selected appropriately depending on the defect degree of AE lesions in IVC lumen. The RHIVC resection without any reconstruction method should be considered with caution.
