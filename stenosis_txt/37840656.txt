Title: Placenta Accreta Spectrum with Ureteral Invasion due to Progression of Cesarean Scar Pregnancy.

Abstract: Expectant management is not recommended for cesarean scar pregnancies because they are often associated with placenta accreta, cesarean hysterectomy, and massive life-threatening hemorrhages during delivery. Herein, we report a case of placenta accreta spectrum with ureteral invasion due to the progression of a cesarean scar pregnancy. Case. A 41-year-old woman, with a history of three cesarean sections and two miscarriages, was referred to our hospital at 25 weeks of gestation with a diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum and bladder invasion. Although the gestational sac was located anterior to the lower uterine segment, a cesarean-scar pregnancy was not diagnosed. A cesarean hysterectomy was performed at 31 weeks of gestation with the placement of an aortic balloon. The placenta was found to adhere to the ureter with more than the expected parenchymal tissue displacement (FIGO Classification 3b). The ureter was not obstructed and was preserved by leaving the placenta slightly on the ureteral side. Postoperatively, a ureteral stent was placed because of the ureteral stricture in the area where the placenta had adhered. Two months after surgery, the ureteral stent was removed after observing an improvement in stenosis. An adherent placenta due to continued cesarean scar pregnancy should be managed by assuming placental invasion beyond the parenchyma into the ureter.
