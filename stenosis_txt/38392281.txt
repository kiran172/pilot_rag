Title: The Effect of Sleep Quality on Coronary Lesion Severity and Prognosis in the Young Acute Coronary Syndrome Population.

Abstract: This study aimed to explore the effect of long-term (≥1 year) sleep quality on coronary lesion complexity and cardiovascular prognosis in young acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. We consecutively recruited young patients aged from 18 to 44 years old with first-episode ACS and significant epicardial stenosis on coronary angiography from January 2016 to January 2017. Coronary lesion complexity was evaluated based on SYNTAX scores. Long-term sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (PSQI ≤ 5 and PSQI &gt; 5 groups). The primary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). A total of 466 young ACS patients (93.13% male; median age, 41 years) were included. Poor sleepers (PSQI &gt; 5) had higher SYNTAX scores. After adjusting for confounders, PSQI scores (continuous variables, OR: 1.264; 95%CI: 1.166-1.371; p &lt; 0.001) and PSQI grade (binary variable, OR: 3.864; 95%CI: 2.313-6.394; p = 0.001) were significantly associated with an increased risk of complex coronary lesions. During a median follow-up of 74 months, long-term poor sleep quality (PSQI &gt; 5) was significantly associated with an increased risk of MACEs (HR: 4.266; 95%CI: 2.274-8.001; p &lt; 0.001). Long-term poor sleep quality was a risk factor for complex coronary lesions and has adverse effects on cardiovascular prognosis in the young ACS population.
