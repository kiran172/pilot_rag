Title: Clinical Outcome of Extraanatomic Bypass for Midaortic Syndrome Caused by Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We investigated long-term outcomes and cardiac function after extraanatomic bypass surgery for Takayasu arteritis and midaortic syndrome.
METHODS: Between 2007 and 2016, 14 patients underwent extraanatomic bypass for Takayasu arteritis. Median age was 56.6 years. Median systolic pressure gradient in the stenotic lesion was 79 mm Hg. Nine patients underwent bypass surgery from the ascending aorta to the infrarenal aorta, 2 from the ascending aorta to the distal descending thoracic aorta, 1 from the ascending aorta to the supraceliac abdominal aorta, 1 from the descending thoracic aorta to the infrarenal abdominal aorta, and 1 from the descending thoracic aorta to the descending thoracic aorta. Five underwent additional 6 peripheral bypass procedures, and 6 underwent concomitant heart surgery.
RESULTS: There were no early deaths. Median hospital stay was 10.5 days. Median follow-up duration was 36.3 months, and late death occurred in 2 patients. One died at 1 year postoperatively because of an infection due to pancreatic injury and mediastinitis. The other was lost to follow-up, and death was confirmed through the national insurance database. No anastomotic site stenosis or aneurysmal change occurred. The number of antihypertensive medications was reduced significantly in all but 1 patient, and organ ischemia symptoms, including dizziness, visual disturbance, and claudication, improved in all patients. Interventricular septal diameter and left ventricular mass index decreased significantly. Serum creatinine level also decreased. Overall estimated 5-year survival was 79% ± 13%.
CONCLUSIONS: Extraanatomic bypass for Takayasu arteritis is safe and effective and can be useful for left ventricular unloading and reduction of organ ischemia.
