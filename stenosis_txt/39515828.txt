Title: Anterograde placement of drug-coated balloon for ureteroileal anastomosis stricture.

Abstract: We describe a case of ureteral stricture after radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder. The patient presented 4 months after laparoscopic radical cystectomy with intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder, with fever and left lower back pain.Laboratory analysis showed leucocytosis and elevated C reactive protein and creatine levels. CT scan showed left hydronephrosis and slow excretion of the intravenous contrast medium with a narrowing at the left ureteroileal anastomosis.A nephrostomy was placed and, 6 weeks later, the anterograde placement of a drug-coated balloon with paclitaxel was placed. Inflation to rated burst pressure occurred for 3-5 min, the drug-coated balloon was removed and a new nephrostomy tube was placed without ureteral stent placement. We performed a kidney ultrasound 30 days after the drug-coated balloon placement with the nephrostomy tube closed showing no left hydronephrosis and the nephrostomy tube was removed.
