Title: The effect of a smaller spacer in the PASCAL Ace on residual mitral valve orifice area.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (M-TEER) is an established treatment for functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) associated with a risk of creating iatrogenic stenosis.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of the P10 and its larger spacer compared to the narrower Ace and its smaller spacer on reduction of mitral valve orifice area (MVOA) during M-TEER.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing M-TEER for treatment of severe FMR were screened retrospectively. Patients with a single PASCAL device implantation within the central segments of the MV leaflets, non-complex anatomy, and baseline MVOA ≥ 3.5cm2 were selected. Intraprocedural transesophageal echocardiography was used to compare MVOA reduction with 3D multiplanar reconstruction and direct planimetry. Device selection did not follow a prespecified MVOA threshold.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients (81.0 years, IQR {74.3-85.0}) were included. In 32 patients, the P10 was implanted (44.4%). MR severity (p = 0.66), MR reduction (p = 0.73), and body surface area (p = 0.56) were comparable. Baseline MVOA tended to be smaller in P10 patients with the larger spacer (5.0 ± 1.1 vs. 5.4 ± 1.3cm2, p = 0.18), however, residual MVOA was larger in these patients (2.7 ± 0.7 vs. 2.3 ± 0.6cm2, p = 0.03). Accordingly, relative MVOA reduction was significantly less in P10 patients (- 45.9 ± 7.6 vs. - 56.3 ± 7.0%, p &lt; 0.01). Indirect annuloplasty was more pronounced in Ace patients whereas mean transmitral gradients were similar.
CONCLUSION: In FMR patients with non-complex anatomy, the larger spacer of the P10 maintains greater MVOA with similar MR reduction. Hence, the use of the PASCAL Ace device in patients with small MVOAs might correlate with a risk of both clinically relevant orifice reduction and even iatrogenic stenosis.
