Title: The role of echocardiography in the management of structural valve degeneration of transcatheter valves.

Abstract: Transcatheter valve implantation in patients with aortic stenosis has evolved as an acceptable alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in a subset of patients at excessively high risk from surgery. The structural valve degeneration (SVD) is a known phenomenon in catheter-based valves too, which was hitherto seen with surgical bioprosthetic valves. Echocardiography plays a pivotal role not only in early detection but also in the management of SVD of Transcatheter valves. The goal of this report is to agglomerate our experience of an unusual case of SVD of a catheter-based valve implanted inside the bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valve apparatus and its management with aortic and mitral valve replacement with mechanical valve prosthesis.
