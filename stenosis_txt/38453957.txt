Title: Alkaptonuria.

Abstract: Alkaptonuria is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by the deficiency of homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity. The consequent homogentisic acid (HGA) accumulation in body fluids and tissues leads to a multisystemic and highly debilitating disease whose main features are dark urine, ochronosis (HGA-derived pigment in collagen-rich connective tissues), and a painful and severe form of osteoarthropathy. Other clinical manifestations are extremely variable and include kidney and prostate stones, aortic stenosis, bone fractures, and tendon, ligament and/or muscle ruptures. As an autosomal recessive disorder, alkaptonuria affects men and women equally. Debilitating symptoms appear around the third decade of life, but a proper and timely diagnosis is often delayed due to their non-specific nature and a lack of knowledge among physicians. In later stages, patients' quality of life might be seriously compromised and further complicated by comorbidities. Thus, appropriate management of alkaptonuria requires a multidisciplinary approach, and periodic clinical evaluation is advised to monitor disease progression, complications and/or comorbidities, and to enable prompt intervention. Treatment options are patient-tailored and include a combination of medications, physical therapy and surgery. Current basic and clinical research focuses on improving patient management and developing innovative therapies and implementing precision medicine strategies.
