Title: Trends and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease: Insights From the National Readmissions Database.

Abstract: Due to shared risk factors, many patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) also have concomitant peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The readmission rates and long term clinical outcomes of these patients following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in a large sample has not been well defined. The National Readmissions Database (NRD) (2015-2019) was used to identify patients undergoing TAVI. TAVI in patients with PAD was compared with those without PAD using a propensity score matched (PSM) analysis to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of net adverse clinical events (NACE), and its components. A total of 189,216 patients were identified, of which 14,925 patients (7386 with PAD, 7539 without PAD) were selected for adjusted analysis. Using PSM, patients with PAD undergoing TAVI had significantly higher in-hospital adjusted odds of NACE (aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.36-1.88), and mortality (aOR 4.10, 95% CI 2.88-5.83). However, rates of other in-hospital peri procedural complications (stroke, major bleeding, paravalvular leak, cardiogenic shock) were not significantly different. There was no significant difference in the incidence of NACE, mortality, or other complications between the 2 groups at 30- and 180 days follow-up. Patients with PAD undergoing TAVI have an increased risk of mortality and NACE during the periprocedural period. However, following discharge, there was no statistically significant difference in 30 days and 6 month outcomes of TAVI in this population compared to those without significant PAD.
