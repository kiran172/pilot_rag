Title: Acute myocardial infarction with no chest pain following a Trimeresurus stejnegeri snakebite: a case report.

Abstract: A 74-year-old female was bitten by a Trimeresurus stejnegeri, which is an unusual but dangerous type of snakebite. After the snakebite, the patient developed oedema, pain and numbness in the injured limb, and acute myocardial infarction, but no chest pain. The patient received base treatment, including anti-venom serum, statins and wound cleaning. After treatment, the pain in the injured limb disappeared and the swelling decreased. The patient underwent a coronary angiogram the next day, and severe stenosis of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was found. She was given coronary stent implantation. After surgery, she was treated with anticoagulants, and antiplatelet medication and was discharged from the hospital on the sixth day after the condition improved. This case report of myocardial infarction-related snake envenomation aims to increase the awareness that snakebites may cause AMI and therefore, multidisciplinary management particularly from emergency physicians and cardiologists may be necessary.
