Title: Pulmonary artery stenting in cancer patients: A single-center experience.

Abstract: Endovascular stenting of the pulmonary artery treats arterial stenosis from pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart defects, or post-transplant stricture. Patients with malignant extrinsic pulmonary arterial compression, secondary to large mediastinal or pulmonary masses, often present with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and right ventricular failure. Conventional therapies like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are often slow and fail to promptly resolve acute symptoms. Balloon angioplasty and stenting have been explored as a rapid treatment to alleviate symptoms of external pulmonary artery compression. Despite its potential, the adoption of this procedure is limited due to risks like stent misplacement, migration, cardiac arrhythmias, and arterial rupture. This paper presents 3 cases of pulmonary angiography and stenting performed for malignant extrinsic pulmonary artery compression. These cases aim to demonstrate the feasibility of pulmonary artery stenting, encouraging its consideration as a palliative option for symptomatic patients with this condition.
