Title: Beware of the commissure - transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a rare anomaly of the left main coronary.

Abstract: Anomalies of the coronary ostia are a potential challenge to the interventionalist. Commissural alignment has recently been introduced as concept for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to avoid potential coronary obstruction and to facilitate future coronary re-access. Here, we report a case of TAVR in a patient with a rare anomaly of the left coronary artery (LCA)-ostium, originating from the commissure between left- and noncoronary sinus, illustrating a potential pitfall for contemporary TAVR-implantation protocols and discuss the final choice of prosthesis suiting the demands of this distinct anatomical variance.
