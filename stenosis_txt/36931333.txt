Title: Transcatheter vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes Among Solid Organ Transplant Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: The safety and clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) among patients with solid organ transplants is not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of TAVR and SAVR among patients with a history of solid organ transplantation. We performed a systematic literature search of databases for relevant articles from inception until May 1st, 2022. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) were pooled using a random-effect model, and a P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 3240 studies were identified of which 3 studies with a total of 2960 patients were included in the final analysis. For solid organ transplants patients, the odds of in-hospital mortality (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71, P < 0.001), 30-day mortality (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35-0.74, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35-0.59, P < 0.001), and bleeding (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.27-0.46, P < 0.001) were significantly lower in patients undergoing TAVR compared to SAVR. In contrast, the odds of pacemaker implantation (OR 2.60, 95% CI 0.36-18.90, P = 0.34), postprocedural stroke (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-1.03, P = 0.06) were similar between both groups of patients. Length of hospital stay was significantly lower in TAVR compared to SAVR patients (SMD -0.82, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.70, P < 0.001). In solid organ transplant patients, TAVR appeared to be a safe procedure with fewer postprocedure complications, shorter length of hospital stay, and lower in hospital mortality compared with SAVR.
