Title: Full-endoscopic spine surgery for radiculopathy after osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: a case report.

Abstract: Full-endoscopic spine surgery (FESS) is a suitable treatment for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and foraminal stenosis. Here, we describe the usefulness of FESS for treating radiculopathy after osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Between October 2018 and April 2019, three female patients (mean age, 81.7 years) with radiculopathy after OVCFs underwent FESS. Decompression of the corresponding nerve root was achieved using several FESS techniques, including foraminoplasty, discectomy, and removal of osteophyte or cement leakage. The mean operative time was 60.7 min. Preoperative and postoperative statuses were evaluated using numerical rating scale (NRS) scores. The mean pre- and postoperative NRS scores were 9 and 2.3, respectively. We observed no postoperative complications. Our results demonstrate that FESS is a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment for radiculopathy after OVCFs, with the potential to be an alternative to vertebroplasty, balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), or lumbar interbody fusion.
