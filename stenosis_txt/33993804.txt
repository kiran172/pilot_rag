Title: The role of stents in hemodialysis vascular access.

Abstract: Vascular access is the Achilles' heel of dialysis therapy among patient with end stage kidney disease. The development of neointimal hyperplasia and subsequent stenosis is common in vascular access and is associated with significant morbidity. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using balloon inflation was the standard therapy of these lesions. However, the balloon-based approaches were associated with poor vascular access patency rate necessitating new inventions. It is within this context that different types of stents were developed in order to improve the overall dialysis vascular access functionality. In this article, we review the available literature regarding the use of stents in treating dialysis vascular access stenotic lesions. Further, we review the major clinical trials of stent use in different anatomic locations and in different clinical scenarios.
