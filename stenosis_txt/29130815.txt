Title: Aspergillus Infection in an Immunocompetent Host With Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Supravalvular aortic stenosis is the rarest form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Aspergillus endocarditis is also rare and generally reported in immunocompromised hosts. Here we present a case of an immunocompetent patient with supravalvular aortic stenosis complicated by aortic mycotic pseudoaneurysm due to invasive aspergillosis.
