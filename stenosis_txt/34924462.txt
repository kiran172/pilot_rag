Title: Benign Duodenal Stenosis Caused by Huge Mesenteric Hematoma Conservatively Improved with Long-term Use of Double Elementary Diet Tube.

Abstract: Mesenteric hematoma is an uncommon condition caused by focal bleeding in the mesenteric vessels. Hematomas are related to trauma, pancreatitis, arteriopathy, and the use of antithrombotic agents. Although hematomas cause intestinal stenosis by compressing the adjacent small bowel, duodenal stenosis due to hematoma is rare. Therefore, the treatment indications for cases of hematoma with stenosis have not been established. We herein report a case with a large mesenteric hematoma that caused duodenal stenosis by compressing the third portion of the duodenum. Stenosis was successfully ameliorated after long-term use of a double elementary diet tube.
