Title: Endovascular management of aortoiliac artery occlusive disease with pseudo-stenosis of the external iliac artery.

Abstract: In recent years, endovascular treatment has become the first-line revascularisation method for aortoiliac artery occlusive disease. Rarely, aortoiliac artery occlusive disease may be associated with stenosis of the external iliac artery (EIA) that suggested pseudo-stenosis. We describe a case of aortoiliac artery occlusive disease with EIA stenosis without calcification or atheroma. Stent grafts were inserted from the abdominal aorta to the bilateral common iliac arteries. Pre-operative computed tomography and intravascular ultrasound findings confirmed the absence of calcification or atheroma in both EIA, suggesting that the EIA had developed pseudo-stenosis. Following endovascular treatment, the EIA diameter recovered only with balloon dilation after inflow improvement. Consideration is necessary when placing an easy stent graft in the narrow EIA during endovascular treatment for aortoiliac artery occlusive disease with EIA stenosis to avoid a potential stent graft diameter mismatch.
