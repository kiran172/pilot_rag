Title: Primary aldosteronism presenting as embolic myocardial infarction.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Primary aldosteronism is now recognized as the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Increasing evidence has demonstrated increased cardiovascular events in primary aldosteronism patients. Heart failure and atrial fibrillation are the most common cardiovascular complications occurring in these patients, and a few cases of coronary artery disease have been reported. Herein, we report a rare case of primary aldosteronism in a patient who presented with myocardial infarction associated with coronary embolism.
CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because ofÂ chest pain. ST-segment elevation was observed on an electrocardiogram. Although no significant stenosis was observed, embolization of the far distal left anterior descending artery was noticed on angiography. Blood test results revealed hypokalemia and increased aldosterone-renin ratio. Abdominal computed tomography revealed an adenoma in the left adrenal gland. After adrenalectomy, the serum potassium level normalized, and blood pressure was well controlled.
CONCLUSION: Primary aldosteronism must be considered in patients who have had various cardiovascular diseases, including embolisms and situations in which the discrimination of secondary hypertension is necessary.
