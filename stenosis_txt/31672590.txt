Title: Impact of Temporary Protective Ileostomy on Intestinal Function and Quality of Life after a 2-Year Follow-up in Patients Who Underwent Colorectal Segmental Resection for Endometriosis.

Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare 2-year follow-up intestinal function and quality of life (QoL) between women with temporary protective ileostomy (PI) and recanalization and women without PI after colorectal segmental resection for deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE).
DESIGN: Prospective observational exploratory study.
SETTING: Tertiary level referral center for minimally invasive gynecologic surgery.
PATIENTS: Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection and PI because of DIE between January 2015 and January 2018; an equal number of women without PI were matched according to age and anamnestic findings to serve as controls.
INTERVENTIONS: Realization of a PI or immediate recanalization in patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were considered for the analyses: 18 in the PI group and 18 in the non-PI group. Baseline intestinal function and QoL were evaluated using 2 validated questionnaires. The main reasons for ileostomy were colpotomy (66.7%), ultralow bowel anastomosis (27.8%), concomitant ureteroneocystostomy, and positive Michelin test result (5.6%). The mean interval between first and second surgery in the PI group was 3.7 ± 1.7 months. Perioperative severe complications included 1 stenosis of colorectal anastomosis in 1 woman in the PI group and 1 perianastomotic abscess in the non-PI group; overall the complications were comparable between the 2 groups. At the 2-year follow-up from recanalization, bowel function and QoL improved from baseline, with no statistical differences between the groups (Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom delta: 5.9 ± 9.3 in the PI group vs 7.7 ± 10.2 in the non-PI group, p = .6; Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index delta: 16.0 ± 27.5 vs 19.2 ± 24.7, p = .7).
CONCLUSION: Temporary PI after colorectal resection for DIE does not seem to influence patients' bowel function and QoL at a median follow-up from recanalization at 2 years.
