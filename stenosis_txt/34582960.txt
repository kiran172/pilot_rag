Title: The role and therapeutic potential of exosomes in ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke is a disease caused by insufficient blood and oxygen supply to the brain, which is mainly due to intracranial arterial stenosis and middle cerebral artery occlusion. Exosomes play an important role in cerebral ischemia. Nucleic acid substances such as miRNA, circRNA, lncRNA in exosomes can play communication roles and improve cerebral ischemia by regulating the development and regeneration of the nervous system, remodeling of blood vessels and inhibiting neuroinflammation. Furthermore, exosomes modulate stroke through various mechanisms, including improving neural communication, promoting the development of neuronal cells and myelin synapses, neurovascular unit remodeling and maintaining homeostasis of the nervous system. At the same time, exosomes are also a good carrier of bioactive substances, which can be modified and targeted to the lesion site. Here, we review the roles of exosomes in cerebral ischemia, and discuss the possible mechanisms and potentials of modification of exosomes for targeting stroke, providing a new idea for the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemia.
