Title: A case of venous overload choroidopathy in the setting of superior vena cava syndrome.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report a case of overload venous choroidopathy in a patient with superior vena cava syndrome.
OBSERVATIONS: A patient presented with episcleral vessel dilation, bilateral subretinal fluid accumulations in the maculae and unilateral serous choroidal detachment. He had a medical history of kidney transplantation and was on chronic corticosteroids. Separately he had also experienced recurrent bilateral innominate vein occlusion and superior vena cava stenosis, consistent with a diagnosis of superior vena cava syndrome. His presentation was further complicated by a retinal vein occlusion in the left eye which was treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal injections. The bilateral subretinal fluid accumulations responded well to photodynamic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: We report a constellation of findings including venous overload choroidopathy and retinal vein occlusion as ocular manifestations of superior vena cava syndrome. The pathophysiologic changes leading to these findings could aid in the understanding of these related conditions.
