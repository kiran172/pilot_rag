Title: Perioperative and Anesthetic Considerations in Pediatric Valvar and Subvalvar Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in children with congenital heart disease. This review specifically considers the perioperative features of valvar (VAS) and subvalvar AS (subAS) in the pediatric patient. Although VAS and subAS share some clinical features and diagnostic approaches, they are distinct clinical entities with separate therapeutic options, which range from transcatheter intervention to surgical repair. We detail the pathophysiology of AS and highlight the range of treatment strategies with a focus on anesthetic considerations for the care of these patients before, during, and after intervention.
