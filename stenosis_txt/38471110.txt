Title: Biodegradable polydioxanone stents: histologic and structural effects in an experimental model of tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the biologic impact of polydioxanone (PDO) stenting in an animal model of inflammatory tracheal stenosis (TS). Additionally, to compare these results with those obtained in the same model without a stent and after placing one PDO stent in a healthy trachea.
METHODS: 40 adult NZ rabbits were distributed into 3 groups: Group A, 8 animals with a healthy trachea and a PDO stent; group B, 17 rabbits with a TS and no stent; and group C, 15 animals with TS and a PDO stent. Histopathological studies included Masson's trichrome staining for submucosal fibrosis and Safranin O to assess structural integrity of cartilage. Morphometric analyses were performed in the 3 groups.
RESULTS: Stent placement was successful in every case. Histological studies did not show a significant increase in tracheal wall collagen area and cartilage structure was not modified in those rabbits with a PDO stent, even in a TS scenario. Stent implantation permitted recovery of normal tracheal lumen levels in the TS model.
CONCLUSIONS: PDO stenting in the normal trachea and in a model of TS neither caused increase in the collagen matrix nor modification of the cartilaginous support. Additionally, radial force exhibited by PDO stents was effective in restoring normal tracheal lumen when placed in a stenotic lesion. These findings suggest that they may be safe and useful in the setting of an acquired TS.
