Title: [A Case of Ampullary Carcinoma with Celiac Axis Stenosis That Underwent Pancreaticoduodenectomy and Arterial Reconstruction].

Abstract: A 72-year-old male patient presented with obstructive jaundice and was diagnosed with ampullary carcinoma. Contrast- enhanced computed tomography(CT)showed stenosis of the common hepatic artery and dilatation of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade(PDA)due to celiac axis stenosis(CAS)at the origin, suggesting that hepatic artery blood flow was supplied from the superior mesenteric artery via the PDA. Since calcification of the arterial wall was observed at the origin of the celiac artery(CA), the cause of the CAS was diagnosed as atherosclerotic. An intraoperative gastroduodenal artery(GDA) clamp test showed no obvious decrease in hepatic arterial blood flow. However, because of concerns about the postoperative patency of the CA, an inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery-GDA bypass using the left great saphenous vein and subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. When pancreaticoduodenectomy is performed in patients with atherosclerotic CAS, this arterial reconstruction method can be considered as an option.
