Title: Outcome comparison of different approaches to aortic root aneurysm.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment of aortic root aneurysm remains challenging for both cardiac surgeons and cardiologists.
AIMS: This study aimed to assess and compare the long-term outcomes of different approaches to aortic root replacement (ARR).
METHODS: All elective patients operated for aortic root aneurysm with or without aortic regurgitation at our institution over a 10-year period were included. We excluded patients with any degree of aortic stenosis and with active endocarditis. We assessed mortality, freedom from reoperation, freedom from aortic valve regurgitation, and the rate of hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications.
RESULTS: Two hundred and four patients underwent elective aortic root replacement: 107 (53%) valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR), 35 (17%) mechanical Bentall procedure (MB), and 62 (30%) Bio-Bentall procedure (BB). Early mortality for VSARR, BB, and MB group was 2.8%, 4.8%, and 0%, respectively (P = 0.40). Estimated 5-year survival was: 90.2% vs. 78.4% vs. 94.2%, respectively (P = 0.12), 5-year freedom from reoperation: 97.8%, 96.6%, and 96.8%, respectively (P = 0.99). Estimat-ed 5-year freedom from complications was: 94.2%, 83.1% and 57.3% in the VSARR, BB and MB group, respectively (P <0.001). On last follow-up echocardiography, 90.5%, 98.4%, and 97.1% (P = 0.08) of patients were free from aortic regurgitation grade 2 or higher. The median (IQR) aortic valve peak gradient was 9 (6-12) mm Hg, 12 (10-18) mm Hg and 16 (14-22) mm Hg, respectively (P <0.001). Complications were predicted by mechanical Bentall (hazard ratio, 6.70 [2.54-17.63]; P <0.001).
CONCLUSION: With the same mortality, freedom from reoperation, and a minimal late complication rate in comparison with mechanical Bentall and Bio-Bentall, VSARR might be the preferred approach to aortic root aneurysm.
