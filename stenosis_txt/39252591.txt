Title: Impact of commissural alignment on the hemodynamic performance of supra-annular self-expandable transcatheter aortic valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic impact of commissural alignment (CA) with self-expandable transcatheter aortic valves (TAVR) has not been investigated yet.
AIMS: To determine hemodynamic impact of CA with self-expandable TAVR.
METHODS: Multicentric ambispective study comparing patients who underwent self-expandable TAVR in seven centers with the Evolut Pro/Pro+ (EP) (Medtronic) and Acurate neo2 (AN2) (Boston Scientific) with and without CA strategies. The degree of commissural misalignment (CMA) was assessed by computed tomography/angiography and 1-year transvalvular gradients/regurgitation evaluated by echocardiography. A matched comparison according to annular dimensions/eccentricity, prosthesis size/type, and baseline left ventricular function and gradients was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 557 patients, mean age 80.7 ± 6.6 years, 61.4% men, and STS score of 4.3 ± 3.1% were analyzed. A CA technique was attempted in 215 patients (38.6%), including 113 patients with AN2 and 102 patients with EP. None/mild CMA was found in 158 (73.5% vs. 43.6% if no CA attempted, p < 0.001) with no differences between devices (AN2:75.2%; EP:71.6%, p = 0.545). Patients with moderate/severe CMA had a greater aortic peak gradient (22.3 ± 8.7 vs. 19.7 ± 8.5, p = 0.001), significantly greater progression of both peak (p = 0.002) and mean gradients (p = 0.001) after matching, and higher rate of central aortic regurgitation (1.2% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.005) at 1-year, but not a greater proportion of patients with mean gradient ≥ 10 mmHg.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of CA strategies significantly reduced the rate of CMA for the self-expandable TAVR devices ACN2 and EP which was associated to lower transvalvular gradients and intra-prosthetic regurgitation progression at 1-year although no criteria of structural deterioration were met at this follow up.
