Title: Transcarotid Revascularization Results in Patients Over 70 Years of Age.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy is associated with fewer procedure-related strokes than transfemoral carotid artery stenting in older populations, based on the results from previous quality randomized controlled studies. Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is a hybrid procedure completed in the setting of cerebral flow reversal to deploy a stent, making it an appealing choice for older patients. This study was completed to elicit any age-related differences in outcomes after undergoing TCAR in patients 70 years of age and older.
METHODS: A retrospective review was completed of a dual institutional database between December 2015 and April 2022 to capture demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative results. The geriatric cohort was defined at a cutoff of 70 years. Univariate statistical testing between groups were completed with Student's T-test or Fisher's exact test at an α of .05 for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
RESULTS: 851 procedures were captured for statistical analysis. With age cutoff of 70 years, we generated 567 geriatric (78.4 ± 5.7 years) and 284 young (63.2 ± 5.7 years) patients. The older patients tended to have more baseline illness, as measured by a higher rate Charlson Comorbidity Index (4.4 ± 2.2 vs 6.0 ± 2.1, P < .01). Younger patients tended to be actively smoking (42.3% vs 17.6%, P < .01). Intraoperative variables were grossly similar by age, including blood loss (43.0 ± 45.0 vs 45.7 ± 50.3 mLs, P = .45), reverse flow time (9.0 ± 7.4 vs 9.0 ± 6.7 mins, P = .98), and technical success (98.9% vs 98.6%, P = .76). While we observed an increased rate of stroke in the older patients, this did not reach statistical significance (1.4% vs 2.6%, P = .33). There were no differences between age groups with respect to myocardial infarction (0% vs .5%, P = .55) and death (1.1% vs 1.1%, P > .99) in the 30-day perioperative period.
CONCLUSION: We found that TCAR was not associated with age-related increases in adverse outcomes and can be considered a viable option when treating carotid artery stenosis in patients older than 70 years of age.
