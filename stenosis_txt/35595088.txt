Title: Midterm Follow-up of the Transatrial-to-Left Ventricle Cannulation for Acute Type A Dissection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is still controversial as to which cannulation strategy for acute type A aortic dissection (AAD) is optimal. Antegrade perfusion to diminish further organ malperfusion and ischemia is preferable.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 420 patients who underwent AAD surgery from January 2001 to December 2020. Group A included 229 patients with a transatrial cannulation; group B included 191 patients with all other additionally used cannulation sites. A retrospective analysis was conducted at 30 days and according to clinical outcome and midterm mortality. Risk factors for probability of death were analyzed by multifactorial logistic regression.
RESULTS: The calculated risk scores and demographic preoperative variables were comparable except for hyperlipoproteinemia (P = .011) and redo operation in group B (P < .001) and more pericardial tamponade in group A (P = .006). In addition, fewer patients with postoperative new onset of renal failure were observed in group A (P = .039), although new onset of dialysis was not different between the groups (P = .878). Patients in group A were discharged from the hospital significantly earlier (P = .004). Nevertheless, although significantly more total arch surgery was performed in group A, shorter operation times (P < .001) and lower transfusion rates were observed in group A. Patients' follow-up after a median time of 3.6 (0.6-7.6) years showed no difference in 30-day, 1-year, and long-term mortality. Multivariate logistic regression revealed aortic valve stenosis (P = .041), coronary artery bypass graft surgical procedures (P = .014), preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation (P < .001), and length of surgery (P = .032) as the strongest risk factors for mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Transatrial cannulation for AAD operation was safe and successfully performed under emergent conditions. Although no benefit in mortality was achieved, clinical benefits of shorter operation times, less transfusion, better kidney preservation, and earlier discharge of the patient were observed.
