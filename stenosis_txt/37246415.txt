Title: Tracheal Transection After Prolonged Intubation and Tracheostomy: A Case Report.

Abstract: Tracheal transection is a rare, life-threatening complication after tracheal injury. Most commonly, tracheal transection presents after blunt trauma, but iatrogenic tracheal transection after tracheotomy has not been well described. Here, we present a case without a history of trauma that presented with signs of symptoms of tracheal stenosis. She was taken to the operating room for tracheal resection and anastomosis and was incidentally found to have a complete tracheal transection intraoperatively.
