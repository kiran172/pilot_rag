Title: [Perioperative serious complications in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a single-center experience].

Abstract: Objective: To observe the incidence of perioperative severe complications in aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR), and to explore the influence of the accumulated experience of the operators on the incidence of complications. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study. Patients with AS who underwent TAVR from May 2016 to November 2020 in General Hospital of Northern Theater Command were included. The occurrence of severe complications during perioperative period was recorded. Severe complications included all-cause death, surgical transfer to thoracotomy, coronary artery occlusion, peripheral vascular approach complications, severe cerebrovascular events, moderate or above perivalvular leakage, valve displacement (implanted valve middle valve), pacemaker implantation, etc. In order to observe the influence of the accumulated experience of the operators on the occurrence of postoperative complications, the complications in each stage of the patients were counted and the bar chart was drawn with interval of every 30 patients. Results: A total of 119 patients were included, including 64 males and 55 females, the mean age was (73.9Â±6.9) years. The valve implantation was unsuccessful in 3 out of 119 patients (2.5%). There were 39 cases of severe complications during perioperative period, including 1 death (0.8%), 2 cases of thoracotomy (1.7%), 2 cases of coronary artery occlusion (1.7%), 8 cases of peripheral vascular approach complications (6.7%), and 1 case of new severe cerebrovascular event (0.8%), 3 cases of moderate or higher perivalvular leakage (2.5%), 8 cases of valve displacement leads to midvalvular implantation (6.7%), 14 cases of permanent pacemaker implantation due to new atrioventricular block (11.8%). The bar chart showed that the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation and in-valve implantation did not significantly decrease with the accumulation of experience, while the incidence of other complications showed a decreasing trend after 30 cases. Conclusions: Most serious complications occurred in the early stage of TAVR in our center. The incidence of all cause death, coronary artery occlusion and peripheral vascular approach complications in the perioperative period post TAVR could be reduced in the TAVR center in the learning stage through the accumulation of procedure-related experience, but the incidence of pacemaker placement and the implanted valve within the valve dose not significantly decrease over time.
