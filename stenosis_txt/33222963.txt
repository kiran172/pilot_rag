Title: Coflex interspinous process dynamic stabilization for lumbar spinal stenosis: Long-term follow-up.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of Coflex dynamic stabilization device in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.
METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of 73 patients undergoing Coflex dynamic stabilization surgery from July 2008 to June 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had a minimum of 8 years of follow-up. Clinical data were used to assess the clinical efficacy, and radiographic parameters were measured for evaluation of ASD.
RESULTS: 56 Patients were followed up for 107.6 ± 13.3 months. The visual analogue scale of pain (VAS), Owestry disability index (ODI) and Japanese Orthopedic Association Scores (JOA) improved significantly after surgery. At 6 months after surgery and the last follow-up, lumbar range of motion (ROM) was significantly lower than that before surgery (P < 0.001). ROM was slightly increased at the last follow-up compared with that 6 months after operation (P > 0.05). ROM of adjacent segments increased at 6 months and at the last follow-up compared with that before surgery (P > 0.05). At 6 months after surgery, intervertebral space height (ISH) and intervertebral foramen height (IFH) of implanted segment was significantly higher than that before surgery (P < 0.05). At the last follow-up, there was a decrease in ISH and IFH (P > 0.05). During the follow-up period, a total of 11 patients (19.6%) experienced complications and 6 patients (10.7%) underwent secondary surgery.
CONCLUSION: Coflex interspinous process dynamic stabilization is effective in the long-term treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis, the ISH and IFH of implanted segment could be increased in a short period of time.
