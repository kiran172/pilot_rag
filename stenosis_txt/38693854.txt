Title: Improved therapeutic effects on vascular intimal hyperplasia by mesenchymal stem cells expressing MIR155HG that function as a ceRNA for microRNA-205.

Abstract: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is an effective treatment for coronary heart disease, with vascular transplantation as the key procedure. Intimal hyperplasia (IH) gradually leads to vascular stenosis, seriously affecting the curative effect of CABG. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were used to alleviate IH, but the effect was not satisfactory. This work aimed to investigate whether lncRNA MIR155HG could improve the efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of IH and to elucidate the role of the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). The effect of MIR155HG on MSCs function was investigated, while the proteins involved were assessed. IH was detected by HE and Van Gieson staining. miRNAs as the target of lncRNA were selected by bioinformatics analysis. qRT-PCR and dual-luciferase reporter assay were performed to verify the binding sites of lncRNA-miRNA. The apoptosis, Elisa and tube formation assay revealed the effect of ceRNA on the endothelial protection of MIR155HG-MSCs. We observed that MIR155HG improved the effect of MSCs on IH by promoting viability and migration. MIR155HG worked as a sponge for miR-205. MIR155HG/miR-205 significantly improved the function of MSCs, avoiding apoptosis and inducing angiogenesis. The improved therapeutic effects of MSCs on IH might be due to the ceRNA role of MIR155HG/miR-205.
