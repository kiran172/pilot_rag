Title: Duodenal stenosis due to small lymphocele after para-aortic lymphadenectomy: A case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We present an unusual case of a small para-aortic lymphocele causing duodenal stenosis after lymphadenectomy and discuss its treatment.
CASE REPORT: Our case involved a 57-year-old woman with endometrial cancer who underwent surgery, including para-aortic lymphadenectomy. On postoperative day 7, projectile vomiting occurred. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a small lymphocele in the dorsal duodenum, causing duodenal stenosis. Transpercutaneous and transduodenal puncture or surgical procedures were difficult because the cyst was too small. Per endoscopic and gastrointestinal series findings on the postoperative day 22, a liquid diet was presumed to be able to pass through the narrow portion. Hence, concentrated liquid food was administered orally; no vomiting occurred. At 2 months postoperatively, CT showed no lymphocele.
CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment involving waiting for spontaneous lymphocele reduction with a concentrated fluid diet may be considered in such cases if fluid passage is confirmed with endoscopy and gastrointestinal series.
