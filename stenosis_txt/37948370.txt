Title: An Illustrative Review of the Pathomechanisms of Symptomatic Developmental Venous Anomalies.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Symptomatic developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are rare. Here, we illustrate the varied clinicoradiologic profiles of symptomatic DVAs and contemplate the mechanisms that render these (allegedly) benign entities symptomatic supported by a review of literature.
METHODS: Institutional databases were searched to identify cases of symptomatic DVAs. Clinical and imaging (angiographic and cross-sectional) data of 9 cases with 11 neurovascular symptoms consequent to inflow/outflow perturbations and mechanical obstruction that manifested because of the strategic topography of underlying DVAs were analyzed. A review of the existing literature on DVAs in agreement with our case series was performed on publications retrieved from the PubMed database.
RESULTS: Symptoms secondary to venous hypertension arising from flow-related perturbations were broadly divided into those arising from restricted outflow and increased inflow. Restricted outflow occurred because of collector vein stenosis (n = 2) and collector vein/DVA thrombosis (n = 3), whereas the latter pathomechanism was initiated by arterialized/transitional DVAs (n = 2). A mechanical/obstructive pathomechanism culminating in moderate supratentorial ventriculomegaly was noted in 1 case. One patient was given a diagnosis of hemorrhage associated with a cavernoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Awareness and contextualization of potential flow-related perturbations and mechanical insults that render DVAs symptomatic aid in accurate diagnosis, management, and prognostication.
