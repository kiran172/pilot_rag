Title: A Case of Wellens Syndrome in a 30-Year-Old Woman From Sub-Saharan Africa: A Perplexing Clinical Entity With Invaluable Lessons.

Abstract: With an estimated contribution of up to 6% of all acute coronary events, young adults are experiencing an escalating burden and mortality attributable to coronary artery disease (CAD) worldwide. Wellens syndrome, a preinfarction clinical entity with distinctive electrocardiographic (ECG) features and high propensity for extensive anterior wall infarctions, affects about 15% of unstable angina subpopulation. We report challenges and lessons learnt from the first ever documented case of Wellens syndrome in Tanzania. A 30-year-old female of African descent was referred to us from an upcountry zonal referral hospital for etiological determination of chest pain and expert management. Her medical history was unremarkable, and she had no apparent risk factors for CAD. She presented with a 7-day history of ongoing sharp central chest pain that was radiating to the neck and jaws and relieved momentarily by morphine. She had stable vitals with an unremarkable systemic examination; however, a 12-lead ECG revealed deeply inverted T-waves on leads V2 through V4. Based on our extensive history and physical examination we came up with a diagnosis of type B Wellens syndrome with impending anterior wall myocardial infarction. She underwent cardiac catheterization that revealed a nonthrombogenic severe subocclusive (>95%) mid left anterior descending artery stenosis. Subsequently, angioplasty was performed successfully with a resolute integrity stent, and TIMI III flow was achieved. To conclude, despite its relative frequency, physicians' awareness of Wellens syndrome pathognomonic ECG features is of paramount importance to curb its attributable morbidity and mortality.
