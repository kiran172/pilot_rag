Title: [Anomalous origin of right coronary artery from pulmonary artery associated to left main coronary stenosis].

Abstract: We describe herein a case of a 16 years-old female patient referred to our department for further exploration of a chest pain. Color Doppler echocardiography revealed an abnormal flow at the level of the pulmonary artery. Exercise testing was abnormal leading to further imaging including computed cardiac tomography followed by coronary angiography which showed anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) associated with mid shaft left main stenosis. We discuss this uncommon association and therapeutic options.
