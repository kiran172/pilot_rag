Title: Prevalence of moderate-severe aortic stenosis in patients with cardiac amyloidosis in a referral center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is currently the most common valvular disease, with an estimated prevalence of over 4% in octogenarians.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS) in patients with wild type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt). Also, describe the clinical features, echocardiographic characteristics and clinical evolution.
METHOD: Retrospective cohort of patients with diagnosis of ATTRwt, belonging to Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires Institutional Amyloidosis Registry, from 30/11/2007 to 31/05/2021. Patients follow up was carried out through the institution clinical history. The prevalence of moderate-severe AE was estimated and presented as a percentage with its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The characteristics were compared by groups according to whether or not they had moderate-severe AS.
RESULTS: 104 patients with ATTRwt were included. Median follow up was 476 days [interquartile range: 192-749]. Moderate-severe AS prevalence at the ATTRwt time of diagnosis was 10.5% (n = 11; 95% CI: 5-18%). The median age of patients with AS moderate-severe at the time of diagnosis of ATTRwt was 86 years [78-91] and the male sex predominated (82%). Most of the patients had a history of heart failure (n = 8) and atrial fibrillation (n = 8) prior to the diagnosis of ATTRwt. Most of the patients were subclassified as low flow low gradient severe AS group (n = 7). Four patients underwent some intervention on the aortic valve. During follow-up, 5 patients (46%) were hospitalized for decompensated heart failure and 4 (36%) died.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the coexistence of both pathologies had a similar prevalence as reported in the international literature. It was an elderly population with a high percentage of atrial fibrillation and history of heart failure. Most of the patients presented with severe AS with low flow low gradient.
