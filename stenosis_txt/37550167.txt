Title: Cognitive effects of carotid revascularization in octogenarians.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is the epitome of cerebrovascular diseases, causing a significant economic burden on our health care system. Growing evidence has indicated the benefits of carotid interventions in patients with severe carotid atherosclerosis. However, the neurocognitive outcome of carotid revascularization in octogenarians is not clearly understood. We aim to evaluate postintervention cognitive changes in seniors older than 80 years.
METHODS: We prospectively recruited 170 patients undergoing carotid interventions. Neurocognitive testing was performed preoperatively and at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Episodic memory was assessed with Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Other executive functions and language measures were also evaluated at individual time points. Raw test scores were converted to z-scores or scaled scores adjusted for age and education. The sample was divided into 2 groups based on age: octogenarian (â‰¥80 years) and nonoctogenarian (<80 years old). Postoperative cognitive scores were compared to baseline within each subcohort.
RESULTS: A total of 23 subjects (13%) were octogenarians, and 147 (87%) were younger than 80 years. Younger patients demonstrated significant cognitive improvements up to 12 months postop compared to the baseline. However, octogenarians exhibited a lack of improvement in verbal memory, measures of executive function, and language at all 3 postintervention time points.
CONCLUSION: Carotid interventions improve cognitive functions in younger patients with carotid occlusive atherosclerosis. However, no cognitive benefits were seen in male seniors older than 80 years. Further investigations are warranted to better understand the postinterventional cognitive changes in octogenarians.
