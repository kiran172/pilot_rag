Title: OCT Guidance in Bifurcation Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: Coronary bifurcation is defined by the European Bifurcation Consensus as a coronary artery stenosis adjacent to the origin of a significant side branch. Its anatomy is composed of 3 different segments: proximal main vessel, distal main vessel and side branch. Coronary artery bifurcation lesions are encountered in approximately 15-20% of all percutaneous coronary interventions and constitute a complex subgroup of lesions characterized by lower procedural success rates and higher rates of adverse outcomes. In recent years, a growing focus in the European and Japanese bifurcation club meetings has been the emerging role of intravascular imaging, in guiding successful bifurcation percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). In this review we will present the main ways optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to improve outcomes during bifurcation PCI.
