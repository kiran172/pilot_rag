Title: Quality of life of patients operated for lumbar stenosis at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.

Abstract: Introduction: Several studies have been conducted in many African countries on lumbar stenosis but none on the quality of life of patients after surgery. We conducted this study to evaluate the quality of life of patients following surgery indicated for lumbar stenosis.Methods: A cross-sectional study from January 2010 to December 2015 in the neurosurgery department of the Yaoundé Central Hospital. We included all patients operated for lumbar stenosis, whose post-operative follow-up was at least of one year. Sampling was consecutive using operating room registries and archives of the neurosurgery department. We used the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to evaluate patient's quality of life.Results: We recruited 52 patients. The mean age was 58.13 years. Pre-operatively, 67.3% of patients presented with severe pain (mean VAS of 8.9). At 3 months, 59.6% presented with moderate pain (mean VAS = 4.75). At six months following surgery, 92.3% of patients had mild pain (mean VAS = 2.92). At one year, all patients had only mild pain (mean VAS = 1.05). Pre-operatively, 67.30% of patients presented with severe walking disability; the mean ODI was 77.88% and a third were bedridden. Three months after surgery 61.50% presented with moderate disability and the mean ODI was 38.17%. Six months following surgery, 48.10% of patients presented with moderate disability and 42.30% presented with a mild disability (the mean ODI was 24.80%). At one year, 82% of patients presented with mild disability and the mean ODI was 12.67%.Conclusion: Surgery improved the physical condition of patients.
