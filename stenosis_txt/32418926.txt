Title: Secondary Carina and Lobar Bronchi Stenting in Patients with Advanced Lung Cancer: Is It Worth the Effort? A Clinical Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The lobar airway stenting remains an endoscopic procedure not well standardized in patients with locally advanced lung cancer disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate technical feasibility, clinical outcome, and complications of different stents in patients with malignant lesions involving lobar bronchi, primary and secondary carina.
METHODS: Between November 2008 and October 2013, we retrospectively analyzed 146 patients with benign and malignant tracheobronchial stenosis who underwent airway stent insertion below main carina and main bronchi.
RESULTS: In all, 170 airway stenting procedures were performed on 146 patients. In all, 51 of them with malignant peripheral airway stenosis underwent stents placement below main carina. In all but one patient, the deployment of stents was successful with improvement of symptoms. The chest radiograph after the procedure detected the lung re-expansion in 29 of 51 patients. The mean follow-up duration was 123 days Â± 157. Complications observed included stent migration, tumor overgrowth, infections, granulation tissue formation, and obstruction due to tenacious secretions. Longer survival was observed in patients who received additional treatment after airway stenting compared to those who did not (p <0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of lobar bronchi and primary or secondary carina is technically feasible, effective, and acceptably safe.
