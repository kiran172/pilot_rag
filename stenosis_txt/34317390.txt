Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy for Treatment of Severely Calcified Mesenteric Stenosis.

Abstract: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is an emerging approach for modification of calcified atherosclerotic plaque. We report 2Â cases of IVL used for calcific mesenteric stenosis, one in de novo superior mesenteric artery stenosis and another in celiac artery in-stent restenosis. In both cases, IVL was used successfully, reducing stenosis without any complications. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
