Title: Neurocysticercosis: An Uncommon Cause of Acute Supratentorial Hydrocephalus.

Abstract: We report a 29-year-old woman with acute supratentorial hydrocephalus due to intraventricular neurocysticercosis (NC). Aqueductal stenosis due to web formation and a free floating intraventricular cyst with scolex were pathognomonic and led to the diagnosis of NC. Worldwide, NC is the most important parasitic infection of the central nervous system but is very uncommon in non-endemic regions. Intraventricular abnormalities occur in approximately 30% of the patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the diagnostic work-up and in guiding intervention. Teaching Point: Brain magnetic resonance imaging in intraventricular neurocysticercosis is pathognomonic and essential in guiding treatment.
