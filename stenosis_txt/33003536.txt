Title: Feasibility Study of Precise Balloon Catheter Tracking and Visualization with Fast Photoacoustic Microscopy.

Abstract: Correct guiding of the catheter is a critical issue in almost all balloon catheter applications, including arterial stenosis expansion, coronary arterial diseases, and gastrointestinal tracking. To achieve safe and precise guiding of the balloon catheter, a novel imaging method with high-resolution, sufficient depth of penetration, and real-time display is required. Here, we present a new balloon catheter guiding method using fast photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) technique for precise balloon catheter tracking and visualization as a feasibility study. We implemented ex vivo and in vivo experiments with three different medium conditions of balloon catheter: no air, air, and water. Acquired cross-sectional, maximum amplitude projection (MAP), and volumetric 3D PAM images demonstrated its capability as a new imaging guiding tool for balloon catheter tracking and visualization.
