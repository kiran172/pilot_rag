Title: Aortic valve chordae tendineae: A rare cause of aortic stenosis.

Abstract: We describe a rare case of severe low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis due to a calcified aortic valve chordae tendineae. The chordae was captured on cardiac computed tomography (CT) using advanced 3-dimensional image reconstruction to reveal the fibrous strand tethering the non-coronary cusp to the left ventricular outflow tract, rendering it functionally immobile. This is one of the first reported cases of severe aortic stenosis from an aortic valve chordae tendineae which highlights the utility of advanced image processing techniques in cardiac CT.
