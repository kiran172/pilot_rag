Title: Kihon checklist is useful for predicting outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Frailty is a major risk factor for death and disability following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The Kihon checklist (KCL) is a simple self-reporting yes/no survey consisting of 25 questions and is used as a screening tool to identify frailty in the primary care setting. No clinical studies have focused on frailty calculated by the KCL in the TAVI cohort. We investigated the 3-year prognostic impact of frailty evaluated by the KCL in patients who underwent TAVI.
METHODS: This single-center prospective observational study included 280 consecutive patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI and evaluated pre-procedural physical performance focused on frailty at our institution. We assessed all patients' frailty by the KCL before TAVI, as described previously. We set the primary endpoint as the 3-year all-cause mortality after TAVI.
RESULTS: The median patient age was 84 years (interquartile range, 81-87 years), and 31.1% were men. In the receiver operating characteristics curve, there were no significant differences between the KCL and Cardiovascular Health Study frailty index [area under the curve (AUC) 0.625 versus 0.628; p=0.93), KCL and Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (AUC 0.625 versus 0.542; p=0.15), and KCL and Short Physical Performance Battery (AUC 0.625 versus 0.612; p=0.91). The first and second tertiles of the total KCL score were 8 and 12, respectively. The multivariate Cox regression model indicated that the total KCL score [hazard ratio (HR), 1.104; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.034-1.179; p=0.003], presence of diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.993; CI, 1.055-3.766; p=0.03), and presence of liver disease (HR, 3.007; CI, 1.067-8.477; p=0.04) were independently associated with 3-year all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The KCL is a simple and useful tool for evaluating frailty status and predicting 3-year all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.
