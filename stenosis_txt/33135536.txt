Title: Which repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation modality affects vasomotor reactivity in healthy subjects and how long does it last?

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of low and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on hypoxia-induced changes in bilateral cerebrovascular reserve up to 24 h in the same individuals.
METHODS: Right-handed ten healthy male individuals participated in the study. All participants had neither drug therapy nor a concomitant disease and none of them had a variation in the circle of Willis, intracranial stenosis, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm which may have an impact on transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) examination and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) recording.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the breath-holding index (BHI) between before and after 0, 15, 30 min after 1 Hz repetitive stimulation (p &lt; 0.05). When applying 5 Hz repetitive stimulation there was no difference before and after BHI values (p &gt; 0.05). There were no differences in bilateral, ipsilateral, or contralateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) after low or high-frequency rTMS application (p &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The main result of the study was that low-frequency rTMS reduced vasomotor reactivity (VMR) for the very first 30 min and then this effect disappears. And the high-frequency rTMS did not affect VMR at all.
SIGNIFICANCE: The effect of rTMS on VMR may continue up to 30 min but then return to the baseline and can be used safely.
