Title: Trends in Percutaneous Balloon Mitral Valvuloplasty Complications for Mitral Stenosis in the United States (the National Inpatient Sample [2008 to 2018]).

Abstract: The epidemiology of mitral stenosis (MS) continues to evolve in the United States. Although the incidence of rheumatic MS has decreased in high-income countries, there is a paucity of data surrounding trends in percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV), the current first-line management strategy. This study aimed to identify contemporary trends in PBMV in the United States. Hospitalizations for adults (≥18 years) with MS who underwent PBMV were identified from the National Inpatient Sample from 2008 to 2018. Baseline co-morbidities and outcomes over the study period were determined using Poisson regression. There were 3,980 weighted PBMV cases, 70% of which were women. PBMV hospitalizations decreased from 603 in 2008 to 210 in 2018 (p &lt;0.001). From 2008 to 2018, the age at hospitalization was unchanged in both female and male patients. In contrast, the Charlson Co-morbidity Index increased in both. Baseline heart failure (39% to 64%), hypertension (38% to 43%), and diabetes mellitus (17% to 26%) all substantially increased over the study period. In-hospital mortality occurred in 2% of female and 5% of male patients and was unchanged from 2008 to 2018. Vascular complications (12%) and acute kidney injury (10%) were the most frequent postprocedural complications during the 11-year study period. A composite of mortality or any postprocedural complication did not vary by gender (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.72). In conclusion, the use of PBMV significantly decreased from 2008 to 2018, and patients with MS who underwent PBMV over this period had an increased burden of co-morbidities, elevated postprocedural complication rate, and no change in in-hospital mortality.
