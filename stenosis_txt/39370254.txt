Title: Critical Limb Threatening Ischemia Due to Severe Polyarteritis Nodosa-A Case Report.

Abstract: A delayed diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa may lead to critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). A 74-year-old woman presented with left-foot pain and was treated with oral vasodilators and antiplatelet agents. However, the distal ischemia progressed to CLTI, including gangrene of the fingers and toes, and bilateral foot dropping appeared because of peroneal nerve paralysis. Angiography of the extremities revealed obstruction and stenosis of medium-sized arteries. Based on the progressive distal gangrene, mononeuropathy multiplex, and pathological findings of necrotic vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa was diagnosed, and the patient's condition improved. A biopsy and neurological examination are essential for the appropriate diagnosis of PAN and immediate treatment.
