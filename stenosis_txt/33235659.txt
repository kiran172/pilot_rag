Title: Otoendoscope combined with ablation electrodes for treatment of benign tracheal stenosis caused by granulation tissue hyperplasia after tracheotomy.

Abstract: Benign tracheal stenosis mainly appears due to tracheotomy, tuberculosis, trauma, benign tumor, or ventilation. With the increase in the number of tracheotomies and the prolongation of the life span of patients after incision, the long-term complications after tracheotomy gradually increase, among which intratracheal granulation hyperplasia is a more serious complication. The present case describes a 59-year-old male with granulation tissue hyperplasia induced by tracheotomy. He underwent tracheal resection to remove the granulation tissue and he remained well after the follow-up. Even though the endoscopic intervention and tracheal resection are readily accessible, they usually quite challenging. Here we summarize the present details on this condition.
