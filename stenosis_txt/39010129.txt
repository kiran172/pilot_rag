Title: Intracranial vasculopathy: an important organ damage in young adult patients with late-onset Pompe disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is mainly characterized by progressive limb-girdle muscle weakness and respiratory impairment, whereas stroke and cerebrovascular abnormalities have been insufficiently studied in LOPD. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and pattern of intracranial artery and brain parenchyma abnormalities in LOPD patients.
RESULTS: Neuroimaging data from 30 Chinese adult LOPD patients were collected from our center. Seven patients (7/30) had acute cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed artery abnormalities in 23 patients (23/30). Dilative arteriopathy was found in 19 patients (19/30), with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia found in 17 patients and dilatation of the anterior circulation arteries found in 8 patients. The maximum diameter of the basilar artery was correlated with disease duration (p < 0.05). In addition, aneurysms (7/30) and fenestrations (3/30) were discovered. There were 14 patients with arterial stenosis (14/30), and both anterior and posterior circulation involvement occurred in 9 patients (9/14). Stenosis and dilative arteriopathy simultaneously occurred in 10 patients (10/30). White matter hyperintensities were present in 13 patients (13/28). Microbleeds, predominantly located in the cerebellum and brainstem, were detected in 7 patients (7/22) via susceptibility-weighted imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial vasculopathy involving both large arteries and small vessels is an important organ damage in LOPD patients. LOPD should be considered a key differential diagnosis in young adults with cryptogenic stroke, and a series of imaging evaluations of the brain and intracranial blood vessels is recommended as a routine workup in adult LOPD patients.
