Title: Two Cases With Recurrent Challenges: Unraveling the Complexity of Heyde Syndrome With Rebleeding.

Abstract: Heyde syndrome is characterized by the association between aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding. This report examines two cases of Heyde syndrome in elderly females who experience bleeding recurrence within months following aortic valve replacement (AVR). The discussion highlights the controversies surrounding the optimal management of Heyde syndrome, particularly in the context of AVR type (surgical vs. transcatheter) and postoperative complications. The report underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach to Heyde syndrome management and the importance of individualized treatment strategies considering patient-specific factors such as lesion location and postoperative complications.
