Title: Benchmarking utilization, length of stay, and complications following minimally invasive repair of major congenital anomalies.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Infants with newborn congenital anomalies are increasingly undergoing minimally invasive surgical (MIS) repair. Currently available data on outcomes are limited. This study provides national estimates for length of stay and 30-day complications following MIS for congenital anomalies.
METHODS: Using the ACS-NSQIP Pediatric (2013-2018), a retrospective analysis of MIS for congenital anomalies was performed. MIS repairs for the following diagnoses were included: pyloric stenosis (PS), congenital lung lesion (LL), mediastinal mass (MM), congenital malrotation (CM), anorectal malformation (ARM), Hirschsprung's disease (HD), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), biliary atresia/choledochal cyst (HB), and intestinal atresia (IA). Postoperative LOS (pLOS) and complication rates were examined using multivariable analysis for risk factors after categorizing surgeries by complexity of care related to congenital anomaly: Simple (PS), Complex Group 1 (LL, MM, CM, and ARM), and Complex Group 2 (HD, CDH, TEF, HB, and IA).
RESULTS: Across 10 anomalies, 8,326 repairs were performed using an MIS approach. Procedure-specific median postoperative LOS (75th-percentile, 90th-percentile) for PS was 1Â day (1, 3); LL was 3 (4, 7); MM was 2 (3, 5); CM was 4 (7, 14); ARM was 3 (5, 8); HD was 5 (8, 12); CDH was 8 (18, 31); HB was 5 (8, 12); TEF was 20 (31, 53); and IA was 17 (25, 40). The overall surgical complication rates (95% CI) were: PS, 5.1% (4.7%-5.6%); LL, 14.2% (12.3-16.4); MM, 8.4% (6.4-11.0); CM, 14.6% (11.9-17.9); ARM, 12.0% (7.1-19.5); HD, 22.1% (19.5-25.0); CDH, 21.1% (17.1-25.6); HB, 20.6% (13.7-29.7); TEF, 36% (27.5-45.5); and IA, 28.6% (19.3-40.1). Risk factors for increased pLOS and complications varied by procedure category and included patient-level and admission characteristics.
CONCLUSION: This study provides national benchmarks and risk factors for expected postoperative LOS and 30-day complications following MIS for congenital anomalies.
