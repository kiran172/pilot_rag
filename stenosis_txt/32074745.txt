Title: [Effect of partial cricotracheal resection and extended cricotracheal resection for severe laryngotracheal stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To assess the outcomes of partial cricotracheal resection (CTR) and extended cricotracheal resection (ECTR) for severe laryngotracheal stenosis. Methods: From November 2009 to September 2017, 18 patients underwent CTR and ECTR at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Tangdu Hospital, Air Force Medical University for severe laryngotracheal stenosis were reviewed retrospectively. There were 12-male and 6-female patients, with the age ranged from 4 to 56 years (median 25 years). The causes were postintubation in 11 cases, cervical trauma in 4, idiopathic in 3. The stenosis located in subglottic and tracheal (n=12), glottic and subglottic and tracheal (n=3), subglottic (n=2), and glottic and subglottic (n=1). Two patients had concurrent unilateral vocal cord palsy.One patient had undergone previous endoscopic balloon dilation and 8 patients had previous laryngotracheal reconstruction. The stenosis was graded according to modified Myer-Cotton classification as follows: Ⅲb (n=1), Ⅲc(n=1), Ⅳa (n=2), Ⅳb (n=12), Ⅳc (n=2). The surgical outcomes and complications were recorded. Results: Among 18 patients,11 of the 12 patients undergoing CTR were decannulated. Five of the 6 patients undergoing ECTR were decannulated. Resected airway length ranged from 1.5 to 4.0 cm (median 2.8 cm). Surgical complications included infection of incision wound in 2 cases, anastomotic granulation in 2, cervical subcutaneous emphysema in 1, aspiration in 1, and unilateral arytenoid prolapse in 1. No recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or tracheoesophageal fistula occurred. The median follow up was 11 months. Conclusions: CTR is efficient for severe subglottic and upper tracheal stenosis while ECTR is efficient for subglottic stenosis extended to the glottis. Both procedures also provide a salvage therapy for patients with previous failed treatments.
