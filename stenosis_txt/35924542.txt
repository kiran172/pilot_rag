Title: Surgical Complications Affecting the Early and Late Survival Rates after Lung Transplantation.

Abstract: Since the first lung transplantation in humans was performed in 1963, patient selection, standardized procurement, and surgical techniques have been developed and established for this procedure. However, despite these developments, surgical complications continue to be important factors influencing patient morbidity and mortality, and efforts should be made to decrease morbidity and improve survival rates by understanding, rapidly detecting, and appropriately treating surgical complications.
