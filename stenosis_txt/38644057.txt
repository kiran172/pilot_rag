Title: Pericarotid Adipose Tissue is Associated with Circulatory Markers of Inflammation and Carotid Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Perivascular adipose tissue plays roles in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between pericarotid fat density (PFD) and circulatory inflammatory indicators, internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, and vulnerable carotid plaques. We retrospectively screened 498 consecutive patients who underwent both computed tomography angiography of the neck between January 2017 and December 2020. The PFD, ICA stenosis, and vulnerable carotid plaques were analyzed using established approaches. Laboratory data including C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic immune inflammation index (SII) were recorded. PFD was positively correlated with CRP, NLR, PLR, and SII, and negatively correlated with LMR. A higher PFD was independently associated with extracranial ICA stenosis (1.179 [1.003-1.387], P = .040) and vulnerable carotid plaques (1.046 [1.021-1.072], P = .001) after adjusting for systemic inflammatory indicators. These findings suggested higher PFD is independently associated with circulating inflammatory indicators, extracranial ICA stenosis, and vulnerable carotid plaque.
