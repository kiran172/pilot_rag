Title: Nonfasting Triglyceride as an Independent Predictor of Carotid Restenosis After Carotid Endarterectomy or Carotid Artery Stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Nonfasting serum triglyceride (TG) level is attracting more and more attention as an atherosclerosis-promoting factor. However, no study has investigated the relationships between nonfasting TG levels and carotid restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS). This study was conducted to investigate if nonfasting TG levels can be used to assess a risk for carotid restenosis after CEA or CAS.
METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study. We reviewed 201 consecutive primary carotid artery revascularization procedures (39 CEAs and 162 CASs), which were performed from 2008 to 2018 for 179 patients (163 men and 16 women) with atherosclerotic carotid stenosis, and were followed up for at least 1 year. Clinical variables including nonfasting lipid profiles and findings of magnetic resonance plaque imaging were compared between groups with and without postprocedural carotid restenosis (â‰¥50% stenosis on ultrasonography).
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 1413 days, 24 of 201 carotid stenosis procedures (11.9%) suffered restenosis after successful revascularization procedures. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that nonfasting TG level was the only independent risk factor of postprocedural restenosis. The receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that a cutoff value of nonfasting TG to discriminate postprocedural carotid restenosis was 127.5 mg/dL, which was much lower than the upper limit of normal.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that nonfasting TG level may be a useful marker to predict carotid restenosis after CEA or CAS, and could be a new therapeutic target to prevent carotid restenosis after revascularization procedures.
