Title: Immature Surfactant Protein B Increases in the Serum of Patients with Calcific Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Valvular disease is a complex pathological condition that impacts countless individuals around the globe. Due to limited treatments, it is crucial to understand its mechanisms to identify new targets. Valve disease may result in pulmonary venous hypertension, which is linked to compromised functioning of the alveolar and capillary membranes and hindered gas exchange. Nonetheless, the correlation between surfactant proteins (SPs) and valve disease remains unexplored. A total of 44 patients were enrolled in this study, with 36 undergoing aortic valve replacement and 8 needing a second aortic valve substitution due to bioprosthetic valve degeneration. Ten healthy subjects were also included. The results showed that patients who underwent both the first valve replacement and the second surgery had significantly higher levels of immature SP-B (proSP-B) compared to control subjects. The levels of the extra-lung collectin SP-D were higher in patients who needed a second surgery due to bioprosthetic valve degeneration, while SP-A levels remained unchanged. The research also showed that there was no reciprocal relationship between inflammation and SP-D as the levels of inflammatory mediators did not differ between groups. The present study demonstrates that circulating proSP-B serves as a reliable marker of alveolar-capillary membrane damage in patients with valvular heart disease.
