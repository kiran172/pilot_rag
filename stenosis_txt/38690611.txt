Title: Undiagnosed rheumatic carditis causing sudden death in a young adult: A case report and review.

Abstract: Acute rheumatic fever-related acquired heart disease in children and young adults is a worldwide issue, but it poses a serious public health threat in developing nations like India. We present a case report of a young adult who collapsed suddenly during a routine walk and was declared dead in an emergency ward on arrival. There was no significant past medical history. On autopsy, massive cardiomegaly and a "butter and bread" appearance of the pericardium, along with findings suggestive of mitral stenosis and aortic regurgitation, raised suspicion about rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic carditis was confirmed by a microscopic examination that showed Aschoff bodies in the left ventricle, mitral valve and interventricular septum, in addition to uncommon Anitschkow cells in the left ventricle. A sudden death due to undiagnosed rheumatic carditis causing such massive cardiomegaly is rare. This case highlights the need to keep rheumatic carditis as a cause of sudden death.
