Abstract: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) of symptomatic atrial fibrillation is an effective method of maintaining sinus rhythm. Radiofrequency ablation and cryotechnology have been used for this purpose for many years. One disadvantage of these methods is the risk of serious complications such as pulmonary vein stenosis, phrenic nerve palsy and atrio-oesophageal fistula. Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) is a promising ablation modality for treatment of atrial fibrillation. This technique employs a train of high amplitude electrical pulses with short duration that ablate myocardium with minimal effect on surrounding tissues. 100 patients underwent PFA at the Capio Arrhythmia Center Stockholm. All pulmonary veins could be identified successfully and isolation could be achieved without difficulty. No serious complication during ablation and observation time after the procedure occurred. Our experience with PFA shows that PVI with this technique in symptomatic atrial fibrillation is a safe and effective method.
