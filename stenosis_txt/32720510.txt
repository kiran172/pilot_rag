Title: Outcomes in Patients Fully Covered With Coronary Artery Aneurysm and Stenosis Lesion by Second Generation Drug-Eluting Stents After 1 Year.

Abstract: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) fully covering a coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) and stenosis lesion. Patients (n = 33) with CAA and stenosis lesion (&gt;60%) were enrolled between January 2014 and December 2017. Baseline characteristics and biochemical variables were recorded during hospital admission. Changes in CAA resolution (the reduction on CAA size), minimal lumen diameter (MLD), and diameter stenosis (DS) were determined before, just after, and 1 year after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). After DES implantation, MLD and DS after PCI were improved compared with those before PCI (P &lt; .01). Also, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction blood flow was significantly enhanced after PCI (P &lt; .01). One year after PCI, maximal CAA diameter in patients with CAA and stenosis lesion was significantly reduced compared with those just after PCI (P &lt; .01). Meanwhile, CAA resolution ratio in these patients were more than those just after PCI (P &lt; .01). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction about CAA length in these patients (P &lt; .01). Last, there were no clinical events (including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization) in the study. Second-generation DES implantation fully covering CAA and stenosis lesion was safe and effective.
