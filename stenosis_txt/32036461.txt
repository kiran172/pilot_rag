Title: Analysis of the impact of EEA stapler size on risk of anastomotic complications in colorectal anastomosis: does size matter?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Colorectal anastomotic complications are dreaded and dramatically affect outcomes. Causes are multifactorial, with the size of the end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler a modifiable factor and potential target for risk reduction. Our goal was to examine the impact of the EEA stapler size on the risk of anastomotic complications in left-sided colorectal resections.
METHODS: A prospective divisional database was reviewed for consecutive elective left-sided resections with a colorectal anastomosis using an EEA stapler from January 2013 May 2018 inclusive. Patients were stratified into 25-29 mm or 30-33 mm cohorts. Patient and disease demographics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. The main outcome measures were the rate and factors associated with anastomotic complications.
RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-three cases were evaluated, 185 ( 39.1%) were in the 25-29 mm group and 288 (60.9%) in the 30-33 mm group. Patients were comparable in demographics and operative variables. More males were anastomosed with the 30-33 mm than with the 25-29 mm stapler (57.6% vs 28.6%, p < 0.01). Significantly more patients developed an anastomotic stricture with the 25-29 mm than with the 30-33 mm staplers (7.1% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.007). There was no significant difference in leak rates or reoperation/interventions between groups. On logistic regression, neither gender, operative indication nor approach were associated with anastomotic leak, readmission, or reoperation/intervention. Stapler size remained significantly associated with stricture (p = 0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: The 25-29 mm EEA staplers were associated with an increased rate of anastomotic stricture compared to 30-33 mm staplers in left-sided colorectal anastomoses. As stapler size is a simple process measure that is easily modifyable, this is a potential target for improving anastomotic complication rates. Further controlled trials may help assess the impact of stapler size on improving patient and quality outcomes.
