Title: Stroke and Noninfective Native Valvular Disease.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Embolic stroke of undetermined source is a challenging clinical entity. While less common than atrial fibrillation and endocarditis, many noninfective heart valve lesions have been associated with stroke and may be considered as culprits for cerebral infarcts when other more common causes are excluded. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of noninfective valvular diseases that are commonly associated with stroke.
RECENT FINDINGS: Calcific debris from degenerating aortic and mitral valves may embolize to the cerebral vasculature causing small- or large-vessel ischemia. Thrombus which may be adherent to calcified valvular structures or left-sided cardiac tumors may also embolize resulting in stroke. Tumors themselves, most commonly myxomas and papillary fibroelastomas, may fragment and travel to the cerebral vasculature. Despite this broad differential, many types of valve diseases are highly comorbid with atrial fibrillation and vascular atheromatous disease. Thus, a high index of suspicion for more common causes of stroke is needed, especially given that treatment for valvular lesions typically involves cardiac surgery whereas secondary prevention of stroke due to occult atrial fibrillation is readily accomplished with anticoagulation.
