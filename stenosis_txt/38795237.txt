Title: Impact of commissural versus coronary alignment on risk of coronary obstruction following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with commissural alignment aims to limit the risk of coronary occlusion and maintain good coronary access. However, due to coronary origin eccentricity within the coronary cusp, coronary-commissural overlap (CCO) may still occur. TAVI using coronary alignment, rather than commissural alignment, may further improve coronary access. To compare rates of CCO after TAVI using commissural versus coronary alignment methodology. Cardiac CT scans from 102 patients with severe (tricuspid) aortic stenosis referred for TAVI were analysed. Native cusp asymmetry and coronary eccentricity were defined and used to simulate TAVI using commissural versus coronary alignment. Rates of optimal coronary alignment (< 10° from cusp centre) and severe misalignment (< 15° from coronary-commissural overlap) were compared. Additionally, the impact of valve misalignment during implantation was assessed. The native right coronary artery (RCA) origin was 15.8° (9.5 to 24°) closer to the right coronary cusp/non-coronary cusp (RCC-NCC) commissure than the centre of the right coronary cusp. The native left coronary artery (LCA) origin was 4.5° (0 to 11.5°) closer to the left coronary cusp/non-coronary cusp (LCC-NCC) commissure than the centre of the left coronary cusp (p < 0.01). Compared to commissural alignment, coronary alignment doubled the proportion of optimally-aligned RCAs (62/102 [60.8%] vs. 31/102 [30.4%]; p < 0.001), without a significant change in optimal LCA alignment (62/102 [60.8% vs. 74/102 [72.6%]; p = 0.07). There were no cases of severe misalignment with either strategy. Simulating 15° of valve misalignment resulted in severe RCA compromise risk in 7/102 (6.9%) of commissural alignment cases, compared to none using coronary alignment. Fluoroscopic projection was similar with both approaches. Coronary alignment resulted in a 2-fold increase of optimal TAVI positioning relative to the RCA ostium when compared to commissural alignment without impacting the LCA. Use of coronary alignment rather than commissural alignment may improve coronary access after TAVI and is less sensitive to valve rotational error, particularly for the right coronary artery.
