Title: Laser Atherectomy and Restenting of the Superficial Femoral Artery Using GORE VIABAHN Endoprosthesis Following Failure of Both Bare-Metal Stenting and Surgical Revascularization.

Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects more than 230 million adults worldwide. Revascularization via angioplasty is a common method to manage stenosis in the superficial femoral artery (SFA). In-stent restenosis, however, is a common complication in endovascular interventions, especially in the SFA. Here, we present a case that involves recanalization of the SFA in a patient with a previously occluded stent and failed surgical revascularization. This patient initially presented with an occluded SFA which was stented. Four years later, the stent was reoccluded and surgical endarterectomy of the artery was performed with partial removal of the stent. Ten years later, the SFA is again occluded. Recanalization of the SFA using laser atherectomy and restenting of the occluded stent with GORE VIABAHN endoprosthesis was performed successfully. The combination of such methods is a suitable way to manage chronic lesions and minimize restenosis in patients with PAD.
