Title: Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon versus Plain Balloon Angioplasty for Dysfunctional Autogenous Radiocephalic Arteriovenous Fistulas: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report the mid-term results of a single-center randomized controlled trial comparing drug-coated balloon angioplasty (DBA) and plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) for the treatment of dysfunctional radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (RCAVFs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 39 patients (mean age, 62.2 years; 21 males, 18 females) with RCAVFs failing due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis were randomly assigned to undergo either both DBA and PBA (n = 20, DBA group) or PBA alone (n = 19, PBA group) between June 2016 and June 2018. Primary endpoints were technical and clinical success and target lesion primary patency (TLPP); secondary outcomes were target lesion secondary patency (TLSP) and complication rates. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator.
RESULTS: Demographic data and baseline clinical characteristics were comparable between the groups. Technical and clinical success rates were 100% in both groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in the mean duration of TLPP (DBA group: 26.7 ± 3.6 months; PBA group: 27.0 ± 3.8 months; p = 0.902) and TLSP (DBA group: 37.3 ± 2.6 months; PBA group: 40.4 ± 1.5 months; p = 0.585). No procedural or post-procedural complications were identified.
CONCLUSION: Paclitaxel-coated balloon use did not significantly improve TLPP or TLSP in the treatment of juxta-anastomotic stenosis of dysfunctional RCAVFs.
