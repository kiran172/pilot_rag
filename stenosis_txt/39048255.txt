Title: Association Between Aortic Wall Thrombus and Thromboembolic Events After Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Thromboembolic events, particularly strokes, remain a major complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Embolic protection devices have failed to show significant clinical benefit in large randomized clinical trials. Aortic wall thrombus (AWT) is often observed on multidetector computed tomography during TAVR work-up, but its prognostic significance is uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the association between the presence of AWT and the incidence of thromboembolic outcomes in patients undergoing transfemoral (TF) TAVR for severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients who underwent TF TAVR for severe aortic stenosis between January 2011 and April 2022. A dedicated scale (range: 0-10) was qualitatively used to assess AWT. The primary outcome was a composite of procedural thromboembolic events defined as ischemic stroke, blue toe syndrome, bowel ischemia, or other solid organ infarction. The secondary endpoints were ischemic strokes and procedural death.
RESULTS: Of the 641 patients included, severe AWT (score ≥8) was identified in 73 (11.4%). The presence of severe AWT was strongly associated with an increase in the primary outcome (OR: 8.48; 95% CI: 3.36-21.40; P < 0.001). This relationship persisted following multivariable analysis, which adjusted for comorbidities and procedural characteristics. The presence of severe AWT was also found to be associated with an increased incidence of stroke and procedural death (OR: 5.66; 95% CI: 2.00-15.30; P = 0.002 and OR: 4.66; 95% CI: 1.80-11.30; P = 0.002, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of severe AWT on preprocedural multidetector computed tomography is strongly associated with thromboembolic complications including stroke and mortality after TF TAVR.
