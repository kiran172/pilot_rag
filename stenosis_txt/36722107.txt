Title: [Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Multivalvular Heart Disease].

Abstract: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Multivalvular Heart Disease Abstract. The prevalence of multivaluvular heart disease is high in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The most common combination is aortic valve stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation, followed by the combination of AS with a tricuspid regurgitation or mitral stenosis. Grading of multivalvular disease is challenging and can quickly lead to underestimation of the disease stage. Therefore, a profound knowledge of pathophysiologic interactions is essential, and the patient should always undergo multimodal evaluation. After a successful TAVI intervention, secondary heart valve defects may improve, deteriorate, or remain unchanged. Due to the still sparse scientific data in this field, the role of the heart team remains central to provide the patient with an individually adapted therapy plan.
