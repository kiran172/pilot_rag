Title: Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication: How I Do It?

Abstract: Surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) aims to control patients' symptoms, improve patients' quality of life, and prevent GERD-related complications (bleeding, esophageal stenosis, Barrett's esophagus, and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma). A careful patient selection and a properly executed operation are key for the success of the procedure. We aimed to describe the operative technique of a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, stressing the critical surgical steps we believe should be respected to obtain good surgical outcomes.
