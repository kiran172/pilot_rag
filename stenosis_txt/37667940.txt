Title: Predictive performance of CHA2DS2-VASc-HS score and Framingham risk scores for coronary disease severity in ischemic heart disease patients with invasive coronary angiography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the predictive performance and compatibility of CHA2DS2-VASc-HS scores and Framingham risk scores (FRS) in patients with coronary angiography. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis study enrolled 98 patients with ischemic heart disease who were indicated for invasive coronary angiography. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using the cut-off values of the ROC curve. The Gensini score was used to evaluate the correlation. RESULTS: The cut-off value of the Congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex category - hyperlipidemia, smoking (CHA2DS2-VASc-HS) score was 2.5, and for FRS, it was 14.5. The area under the curve (95% CI) for the CHA2DS2-VASc-HS score and FRS were 0.76 (0.66, 0.85) and 0.80 (0.71, 0.85), respectively. For every 1-point increase in the CHA2DS2-VASc-HS score, the Gensini score increased by 0.44 (r = 0.56; R2 = 0.19, Beta = 0.44, p < 0.01), and the number of stenosis coronary branches increased by 0.55 (r = 0.56; R2 = 0.30, Beta = 0.55, p < 0.01). For every 10-point increase in FRS, the Gensini score increased by 3.8 (r = 0.57; R2 = 0.14, Beta = 0.38, p < 0.01), and the number of stenosis coronary branches increased by 5 (r = 0.53; R2 = 0.25, Beta = 0.5, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a high predictive performance of coronary artery injury using the CHA2DS2-VASc-HS score and Framingham risk scores. These scores could be applied in predicting ischemic heart disease in non-symptomatic cases where invasive coronary angiography is not indicated.
