Title: Outcome and toxicity of chemoradiation using volumetric modulated arc therapy followed by 3D image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer: Vietnam National Cancer Hospital experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and 3D image-guided brachytherapy (3D-IGBT) have recently been introduced in Vietnam for the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. This study aims to assess the outcomes and toxicities of chemoradiation using VMAT followed by 3D-IGBT in Vietnamese cervical cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective interventional study on 72 patients with 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB3-IIIC2 disease who underwent concurrent chemoradiation using VMAT, followed by 3D-IGBT according to EMBRACE-II protocol. Primary endpoints were locoregional control; secondary endpoints were systemic control and toxicity.
RESULTS: Median body volume received 43 Gy was 1589.1 cm3 (range 1214.8-2574.8). Median high-risk clinical target volume (CTV-HR) was 18.8 cm3 (range 8.6-61.2) with a median dose to 90% (D90) of CTV-HR of 90.6 Gy (range 86.8-99.6). Mean doses to 2cc (D2cc) of bladder, rectum, and sigmoid were 75.8, 55.2, and 62.1 Gy, respectively. At median 19-month follow-up (range 12-25), locoregional control and systemic control were 95.8% and 81.9%, respectively. Systemic control was the lowest in N2 disease (54.5%). Grade ≥ 3 acute toxicities were less than 10%, except neutropenia (31.9%). Extended-field radiation increased significantly nausea, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. No grade ≥ 3 proctitis or cystitis; 8.3% had grade 3 vaginal stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: VMAT-based chemoradiation therapy followed by 3D-IGBT achieved high locoregional control with manageable toxicities in locally advanced cervical cancer. Systemic control correlated with disease stage.
