Title: Comparison the Diameter of the Urethral Meatus Before and After Circumcision and Evaluation of Urethral Stenosis.

Abstract: Objectives. This study focused on assessing the diameter of the meatus before and after circumcision to evaluate meatal stenosis. Methods. In this cross-sectional study, boys who met the inclusion criteria, their demographic parameters, and meatus diameter were recorded. Thirty days after circumcision, complications were evaluated meatus diameter was measured again and their information was analyzed by SPSS 26 software. Results. Four hundred boys were studied, and it was found that 41 cases (10.3%) developed meatal stenosis after circumcision, with 85% having a pre-circumcision meatus diameter of 4 mm or less. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation (P &lt; .05) between smaller pre-circumcision meatus diameter and postoperative meatal stenosis. Conclusions. The study concludes that a smaller meatus diameter before circumcision significantly increases the risk of postoperative tightness. It suggests prophylactic measures like meatus dilatation or applying topical ointment for those at high risk (meatus diameter ≤ 4 mm) to prevent or mitigate postoperative meatal stenosis.
