Title: Effects of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Frailty and Quality of Life.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective alternative to surgical valve replacement in high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. Although measures of frailty have been used to attempt to predict outcomes in this population, few studies have demonstrated changes in these measures.
METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study of 171 patients undergoing TAVI, of whom 44 had maximal follow-up of 1 month and 50 had maximal follow-up of 1 year. Quality of life was assessed using the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living questionnaire, and patient perception of overall well-being. Frailty was measured using the 10-m walk test and handgrip strength testing.
RESULTS: In the overall cohort, participants demonstrated improvements in quality of life metrics, but deterioration in 10-m walk test and handgrip at 1 month. These trends continued at 1 year. However, patients in the lowest quintile of handgrip and 10-m walk test demonstrated a trend of improvements in these metrics during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in quality of life after TAVI, no improvements in frailty were observed in patients at 1 year.
