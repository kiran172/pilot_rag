Title: A Modified Anastomosis Technique for Esophagojejunostomy after Laparoscopy-Assisted Total Gastrectomy: A Single Team Preliminary Experience.

Abstract: RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the cRY group and pRY group regarding age, sex, BMI, neoadjuvant therapy, preoperative comorbidities, history of laparotomy, ASA score, tumor location, pathological stage, total operative time, incision length, blood loss, time-to-first flatus, time-to-first soft diet, and postoperative hospital stays. The proportions of patients who received a 21â€‰mm stapler were higher in the cRY group (7/44) than that in the pRY group (0/68) (P = 0.003). 7 anastomotic complications were reported (6 in the cRY group versus 1 in pRY group; P = 0.028) of which five (83.3%) in the cRY were anastomotic stenosis versus none in the pRY group (P = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: The application of pant-shaped anastomosis for esophagojejunostomy after LTG is a safe and feasible procedure and has an advantage when the jejunum diameter is small.
