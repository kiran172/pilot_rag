Title: Clinical Predictors of Coronary Artery Ectasia.

Abstract: Coronary artery ectasia (CAE) is defined as abnormal dilation of a coronary artery ≥1.5 times the normal segment. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical predictors of CAE. This was a prospective analysis performed on 6465 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Patients were divided based on the presence or absence of CAE and compared for angiographic characteristics and clinical risk factors. The prevalence of CAE was 7%, CAE associated with coronary artery stenosis was 5.4%, and isolated CAE was 1.6%. The mean age of presentation in CAE patients was 60 years, with male predominance (83.8%) and stable angina was the most common presentation. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) (51.7%) was the most commonly involved vessel, with diffuse ectasia more commonly seen in right coronary artery and discrete ectasia in LAD. Type 4 CAE was the most common type (92.4%). Hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, and obesity were found in 62.4%, 35.3%, 45.3%, 54.9%, and 23.3%, respectively in CAE patients, with significant association with smoking (Odds Ratio = 3.06). The prevalence of CAE was 7% and was frequently associated with atherosclerotic coronary disease. Smoking was a significant predisposing factor for CAE.
