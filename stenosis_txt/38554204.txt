Title: A new etiology of nontraumatic C0-C1-C2-Complex instability - abnormality of musculus rectus capitis posterior minor: a case report.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study presents an abnormality of the musculus rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPmi) as a new etiological factor for nontraumatic sagittal plane instability in the C0-C1-C2-complex, with a focus on identifying the absence or atrophy of RCPmi on both sides.
METHODS: A 36-year-old male patient presented with recurring neck pain (VAS 8/10) and tingling paresthesia in the entire left hand over a six-month period, without significant neurological deficits. Radiated arm pain was not reported. Imaging examinations revealed sagittal plane instability in the C0-C1-C2-complex, spinal canal stenosis (SCS), and myelopathy at the C1 level. Subsequently, a dorsal C0-1 reposition and fusion with laminectomy were performed.
RESULTS: The congenital absence or atrophy of RCPmi, leading to the lack of cephalad-rearward traction on the C1-tuberculum-posterius, induced a developmental failure of the C1 posterior arch. Consequently, the oblate-shaped C1 posterior arch lost support from the underlying C2 posterior arch and the necessary cephalad-rearward traction throughout the patient's 36-year life. This gradual loss of support and traction caused the C1 posterior arch to shift gradually to the anterior side of the C2 posterior arch, resulting in a rotational subluxation centered on the C0/1 joints in the sagittal plane. Ultimately, this led to SCS and myelopathy. Traumatic factors were ruled out from birth to the present, and typical degenerative changes were not found in the upper cervical spine, neck muscles, and ligaments.
CONCLUSION: In this case, we not only report the atrophy or absence of RCPmi as a new etiological factor for nontraumatic sagittal plane instability in the C0-C1-C2-complex but also discovered a new function of RCPmi. The cephalad-rearward traction exerted by RCPmi on the C1 posterior arch is essential for the development of a normal C1 anterior-posterior diameter.
