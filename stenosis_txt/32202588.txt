Title: A giant aneurysm of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the setting of Behcet's disease.

Abstract: Behcet's disease is a chronic inflammatory syndrome that can affect arteries and veins of all sizes and is an unusual cause of myocardial infarction. We report a case of a 42-year-old male with no cardiovascular risk factors who was referred to our department for a spontaneously resolving anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Clinical and biological investigations revealed a high probability for Behcet's disease. The coronary angiogram showed severe left main artery stenosis with a huge coronary aneurysm of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, which was treated by aneurysm resection and coronary artery bypass grafting. Inflammatory arteritis should be considered in young patients with low cardiovascular risk presenting with acute coronary syndrome.
