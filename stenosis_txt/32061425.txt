Title: Early Surgical Management of Bronchial Dehiscence After Single-Lung Transplantation: A Case Report.

Abstract: Anastomotic airway complications after lung transplantation affect up to 20% of patients. Bronchial stenosis is the most frequent complication, while dehiscence of bronchial anastomosis is a rarely seen complication, with report incidences between 1% and 10%. Despite its low incidence, dehiscence of bronchial anastomoses remains a disastrous complication in the posttransplantation period without a well-established management protocol. We present a challenging case of complete bronchial dehiscence after unilateral lung transplantation in a patient with interstitial lung fibrosis (ILF) that occurred on postoperative day 10. The dehiscence was diagnosed early and the patient's status was stable for repeat thoracotomy, therefore, an early surgical approach was preferable to conservative management or bronchoscopy. Aggressive early surgical management in a stable patient allows for complete debridement with removal of the detritus that impedes correct anastomosis healing and permits the removal of microbial vegetations with successful results.
