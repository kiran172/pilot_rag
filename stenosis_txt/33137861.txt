Title: [The clinical characteristics of 89 cases of non-tuberculous mycobacterium pulmonary disease complicated with tracheobronchial lesions].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics of non-tuberculous mycobacterium(NTM) pulmonary disease complicated with tracheobronchial lesions. Methods: From January 2014 to December 2018, there were 1 006 patients who were admitted to Guangzhou Chest Hospital for the first time and received examination by bronchoscopy. A total of 89 patients with complete data were selected, including 40 males and 49 females, aged 20 to 85 years, with 46 patients (52%) aged 60 years or older. The clinical symptoms and signs of the patients were analyzed with chest imaging, bronchoscopy and pathological examination results. Comparisons between groups were made by Chi-square test and t test. Results: The number of patients with NTM complicated with tracheobronchial lesions accounted for 8.9%(89/1 006) of those hospitalized with NTM and received bronchoscopy during the same period. Clinical symptoms included cough and sputum (89/89), different degrees of hemoptysis or blood sputum (52/89), and shortness of breath (50/89). Chest CT showed that 72 cases (72/89, 81%) had lung lesions involving more than 3 lung fields, and 83 cases (93%) had bronchiectasis and 63 cases (63/89, 71%) with cavities. Pulmonary atelectasis was shown in 45 cases (45/89, 51%). By bronchoscopy, 39 cases (39/89, 44%) were diagnosed as tuberculous lesions involving bilateral upper bronchi, while lesions of the right lower bronchus was found in 27 cases (27/89, 30%).The percentage of patients with multilobar bronchial involvement was 50.6%(45/89). The morphological characteristics of the bronchial lesions included scar stenosis or atresia in 63 cases (63/89, 71%), hyperemia and edema in 46 cases (46/89, 52%), and multiple types of lesions in 48 cases (48/89, 54%). Conclusions: Patients with NTM lung disease complicated with tracheobronchial inflammatory lesions did not have specific manifestations clinically. Lung lesions are extensive, often accompanied by bronchiectasis and cavity formation. Endoscopic changes were mostly manifested as multilobar tracheobronchial involvement characterized by scar stenosis, congestion and edema, mainly involving bilateral upper bronchi and the right lower bronchus.
