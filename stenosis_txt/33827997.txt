Title: Impact of H-Type Hypertension on Intraplaque Neovascularization Assessed by Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound.

Abstract: AIM: H-type hypertension is connected with carotid atherosclerotic plaques and stroke, whereas neovascularization is a dominant contributor to plaque vulnerability. However, the correlation between H-type hypertension and plaque vulnerability remains unclear. This study aims to explore the influence of H-type hypertension on intraplaque neovascularization (IPN).
METHODS: We enrolled 235 patients with carotid plaques into the investigation and classified them into four groups: H-type hypertension group, simple hypertension group, isolated hyperhomocysteinemia group, and control group. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was performed on them and IPN was evaluated using semi-quantitative visual grading: grade 1 (no microbubbles or microbubbles limited to the adventitial side and/or shoulder of plaque) and, grade 2 (diffused microbubbles within plaque or microbubbles enter plaque core). To analyze the correlation between H-type hypertension and the degree of plaque enhancement, logistic regression was used.
RESULTS: Compared with those with CEUS grade 1 plaques, those with CEUS grade 2 plaques had higher frequency of ischemic stroke (29.0% vs. 45.1%, P＜0.05), hypertension (41.0% vs. 56.3%, P＜0.05), and H-type hypertension (18.0% vs. 29.6%, P＜0.05). No significant differences existed in plaque morphology, plaque echogenicity, and the severity of carotid artery stenosis between the degree of plaque enhancement (all P＞0.05). H-type hypertension (multivariate-adjusted OR: 3.036, 95% CI: 1.258-7.329) was independently connected with the degree of plaque enhancement even after adjusting for other covariates.
CONCLUSION: H-type hypertension is expressly connected with the degree of plaque enhancement and may facilitate plaque vulnerability. Our findings may offer a new insight for treating vulnerable plaque, lowering blood pressure, and lowering homocysteine equally crucial.
