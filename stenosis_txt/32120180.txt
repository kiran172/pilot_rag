Title: Serum complement C1q level is associated with acute coronary syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The complement system plays an important role in the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Complement C1q is an important initial component of the classical complement pathway and closely related to many chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis (AS). We aimed to determine whether there was association between serum complement C1q and the severity of coronary stenosis.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 320 patients who underwent coronary arteriography (CAG) were stratified into non-ACS group (control group, n = 74), unstable angina group (UA group, n = 197) and acute myocardial infarction group (AMI group, n = 49) according to the severity of coronary stenosis and clinical manifestations. The severity of coronary stenosis was represented in Gensini score, and serum complement C1q level was compared using immunity transmission turbidity among three groups.
RESULTS: The level of complement C1q in AMI group was lower significantly than control group and UA group (P < 0.05), but there was no correlation between serum complement C1q and Gensini score (β=-0.086, P = 0.125). In nitrate-taking patients, serum complement C1q had a negative association with Gensini score (r=-0.275, P = 0.001), and in non-smokers, there was also a negative correlation (β=-0.159, P = 0.036). After calibrating smoking, drinking or statins, the serum complement C1q levels of control group, UA group and AMI group decreased in sequence (P <  0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the decreasing of serum complement C1q was an unfavorable factor for acute myocardial infarction (OR=0.984, 95 %CI=0.972∼0.997, P = 0.015) and for ACS (OR=0.984, 95 %CI=0.971∼0.984, P = 0.025) in drinking patients. Regrettably, ROC curve suggested that the accuracy in diagnosing coronary atherosclerotic heart disease by serum complement C1q was low (AUC=0.568, 95 %CI= 0.492-0.644, P = 0.076, sensitivity 73.6 %, specificity 58.1 %).
CONCLUSION: Serum complement C1q in ACS patients, in particular AMI patients, showed lower level. This finding suggests further decrease of complement C1q level in ACS patients may be a contributory factor to instability or rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Combined with other clinical indicators, it can be helpful to predict the risk and severity of coronary stenosis.
