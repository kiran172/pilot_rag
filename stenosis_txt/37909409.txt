Title: Adult congenital heart disease care in a municipal public health system.

Abstract: Specialty care is associated with improved outcomes for adults with adult CHD and must be extended to the underserved. A retrospective cohort study was performed to describe the provision of care to adult CHD patients in America's largest municipal public health system including patient demographics, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and adherence to guideline-recommended surveillance. We identified 229 adult CHD patients aged >18 years through electronic medical records. The most common diagnoses were atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and valvular pulmonary stenosis. In total, 65% had moderate or greater anatomic complexity. A large number of patients were uninsured (45%), non-white (96%), and non-English speaking (44%). One hundred forty-six patients (64%) presented with unrepaired primary defects. Fifty eight patients underwent primary repair during the study period; 48 of those repairs were surgical and 10 were transcatheter. Collaboration with an affiliated Comprehensive Care Center was utilised for 28% of patients. A high proportion of patients received adult CHD speciality visits (78%), echocardiograms (66%), and electrocardiograms (56%) at the guideline-recommended frequency throughout the study period. There was no significant difference in the rate of adherence to guideline-recommended surveillance based on insurance status, race/ethnicity, or primary language status. The proportion of patients who had guideline-recommended adult CHD visits, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms was significantly lower for those with more advanced physiological stages. These results can inform the provision of adult CHD care in other public health system settings.
