Title: Surgical and Endovascular Management of Extracranial Carotid Artery Aneurysms, Outcomes From the American College of Surgeons, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAA) are rare and consequentially understudied; yet multiple management strategies for ECAA have been pursued. The goal of this study was to compare rates of stroke and cardiac events following surgical or endovascular management of ECAA utilizing the American College of Surgeons, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP).
METHODS: The ACS-NSQIP database was queried for patients with both selected procedure codes and diagnostic codes specific for ECAA. 139 patients, 0.2% of carotid procedures, were located within ACS-NSQIP from 2013-2017.
RESULTS: The endovascular group (n = 19) had a higher proportion of emergency procedures than the open surgical group (n = 120). Post-operative strokes in the endovascular group (n = 3, 15.8%) were not significantly higher than the open surgical group (n = 5, 4.2%; P = 0.078). One cardiac event (0.7%) in the cohort occurred in the surgical group.
DISCUSSION: This study provides insight into trends in national management of ECAA. Post-operative stroke rates trended higher with endovascular approaches, perhaps due to traumatic presentation as this group had a higher proportion of emergency procedures. Additionally, this study suggests patients with ECAA may have less cardiac burden than their peers with carotid stenosis.
