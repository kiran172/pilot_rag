Title: Pro-angiogenic cytokine features of left ventricular remodeling in patients with bicuspid aortic valve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is prone to promote left ventricular remodeling (LVR), which is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Although the association between angiogenic activity and LVR has been established, pro-angiogenic cytokine features and potential biomarker candidates for LVR in patients with BAV remain to be clarified.
METHODS: From November 2018 to May 2019, patients with BAV diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography at our institution were included. LVR was diagnosed on the basis of echocardiographic calculations of relative wall thickness (RWT) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). A multiplex ELISA array was used to measure the plasma levels of 60 angiogenesis-related cytokines.
RESULTS: Among 103 patients with BAV, 71 were categorized into the LVR group and 32 into the normal left ventricular (LV) geometry group. BAV patients with LVR demonstrated increased LVMI, elevated prevalence of moderate to severe aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, and decreased LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Plasma levels of angiopoietin-1 were elevated in BAV patients with or without LVR compared with healthy controls (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively), and were negatively correlated with RWT (r = -0.222, P = 0.027). Plasma levels of angiopoietin-2 were elevated in the LVR group (P = 0.001) compared with the normal LV geometry group, and were negatively correlated with LVEF (r = -0.330, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Decreased angiogenesis plays a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of LVR in patients with BAV. Disturbance in the pro- and anti-angiogenesis equilibrium in BAV patients with LVR may reflect the aggravation of endothelial injury and dysfunction.
