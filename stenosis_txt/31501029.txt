Title: Predictors and outcomes of heart failure after transcatheter aortic valve implantation using a self-expanding prosthesis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the incidence, predictors and prognostic impact of acute heart failure (AHF) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using a self-expanding prosthesis.
METHODS: From November 2008 to June 2017, all consecutive patients undergoing TAVI in our center were prospectively included in our TAVI registry. The predictive effect of AHF on all-cause mortality following the TAVI procedure was analyzed using Cox regression models.
RESULTS: A total of 399 patients underwent TAVI with a mean age of 82.4 ± 5.8 years, of which 213 (53.4%) were women. During follow-up (27.0 ± 24.1 months), 29.8% (n = 119) were admitted due to AHF, which represents a cumulative incidence function of 13.2% (95%CI, 11.1%-15.8%). At the end of follow-up, 150 patients (37.59%) had died. Those who developed AHF showed a significantly higher mortality rate (52.1% vs 31.4%; HR, 1.84; 95%; CI, 1.14-2.97; P = .012). Independent predictors of AHF after TAVI were a past history of heart failure (P = .019) and high Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (P = .004). We found that nutritional risk index and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were strongly correlated with outcomes in the AHF group.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI was associated with a high incidence of clinical AHF. Those who developed AHF had higher mortality. Pre-TAVI AHF and high Society of Thoracic Surgeons score were the only independent predictors of AHF in our cohort. A low nutritional risk index and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were independent markers of mortality in the AHF group.
