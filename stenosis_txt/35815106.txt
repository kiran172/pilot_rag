Title: Severe Hemophilia A and Moyamoya Syndrome in a 19-Year-Old Boy Caused by Xq28 Microdeletion.

Abstract: Severe hemophilia A and moyamoya (SHAM) syndrome is a rare condition that combines hemophilia A and moyamoya disease (MMD) due to an Xq28 microdeletion encompassing the F8 and BRCC3 genes. Here, we report the case of a 19-year-old male patient with hemophilia A and hypogonadism that presented with right-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed an ischemic lesion in the left lobe and stenosis of both middle cerebral arteries with a concomitant thick vascular network, compatible with moyamoya disease. Next-generation sequence revealed a large Xq28 deletion compatible with SHAM syndrome. The patient was treated with acetylsalicylic acid and neurosurgical intervention was scheduled. Our patient is one of the few cases reported in the literature with Xq28 microdeletion encompassing the F8, hemophilia A causative gene, and BRCC3, responsible for MMD, presenting with a compound phenotype that included neurological manifestations and hypogonadism. In conclusion, diagnosis of MMD should be considered in any male, young patient with symptoms of ischemic stroke with no obvious explanation, and especially in patients with known hemophilia, since a relationship between the two conditions has been documented.
