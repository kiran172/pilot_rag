Title: Percutaneous removal and replacement of a novel percutaneous interspinous device.

Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study is to explain the technique used for removing and replacing a novel percutaneous interspinous device (PID).Procedure: Three male patients, with a mean age of 66 years (range 62-72), were included in the study due to displacement (N = 2) or misplacement (N = 1) of the novel PID. This occurred after a mean of 23.3 ± 10.5 days from the initial placement (range 13-34) at the L4-L5 level (N = 1) and L3-L4 level (N = 2). Following the removal of the PID, four new devices were implanted.Conclusion: The novel PID can be safely removed either immediately after its placement during the procedure or after a certain period of days or months from its implantation. The removal procedure can be performed percutaneously under imaging guidance, by closing the four retractable wings, using the same instrumentation as utilized during the initial implantation.
