Title: An Unlucky Four-Leaf Clover Stenosis With a Single Coronary Artery.

Abstract: The recognition of quadricuspid aortic valve has clinical significance as it leads to aortic valve dysfunction. Due to its frequent association with other congenital cardiac abnormalities, such as abnormally located coronary ostia, preoperative diagnosis is crucial. We present the case of a unique association of quadricuspid aortic valve stenosis with a single coronary artery.
