Title: Carotid artery stenting for stenosis after carotid artery replacement: An illustrative case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are few reports on the treatment of carotid artery stenosis after arterial vessel replacement. We report and discuss an illustrative case of carotid artery stenting (CAS) performed for stenosis after carotid artery replacement.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A woman in her 20s experienced injury to the right carotid artery during an operation for removal of a carotid body tumor 6 years before presentation. The right common carotid artery and internal carotid artery were replaced with an artificial vessel graft at that time. Intraluminal stenosis in the graft was not identified 3 years after surgery; however, 4 years after surgery, stenosis was recognized at the non-anastomotic site inside the artificial vessel graft. Subsequently, antiplatelet therapy was initiated. The stenosis was noted to progress gradually in follow-up appointments. Therefore, we decided to intervene because of the patient's young age and the risk of long-term hemodynamic stress. Angiography revealed pseudo-occlusion in the artificial vessel. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed for stenosis with distal protection; subsequently, CAS was performed. The patient was discharged without neurological deficits 4 days after the operation, and no apparent restenosis was observed as of the 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Stenosis after cervical artery replacement can be safely treated with CAS. Inflation pressure and stent should be selected according to the pathology of the stenosis.
