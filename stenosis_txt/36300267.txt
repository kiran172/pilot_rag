Title: Coronary Revascularization in Patients With Cardiac Sequelae of Kawasaki Disease at a Single Center.

Abstract: Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a self-limited vasculitis that mainly affects infants and preschool-age children, characterized by coronary aneurysms and/or stenoses that may lead to the occurrence of ischemia, heart attack, and sudden death. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and surgical results of pediatric patients with KD and cardiac sequelae who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods: A retrospective study was carried out. Patients with a diagnosis of KD and cardiac sequelae who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting from January 1, 2004, through March 31, 2021, were included: preoperative characteristics and conditions. Results: Ten patients were included, with a mean age of 6.4 ± 3.7 years; 80% males. Seven (70%) had the compromise of 2 coronary arteries, the most affected being the left anterior descendent artery (36.9%) with aneurysm and the right coronary artery (36.8%) with stenosis. 40% had preoperative moderate-to-severe ventricular dysfunction. The graft most frequently used was the right internal thoracic artery (47.6%), and the most frequent coronary bypass target vessel was the left anterior descending artery (38.1%). There was no early mortality or deaths during follow-up; 90% remained in functional class I. Among the cohort as a group, there was an overall improvement in postoperative ventricular function (P = .03). This persisted, being unchanged at subsequent follow-up (P = .95). Conclusions: Coronary artery bypass grafting is an appropriate treatment option for children with cardiac sequelae of KD, with excellent surgical results. Furthermore, this surgical procedure avoids the deterioration of left ventricular function in pediatric age.
