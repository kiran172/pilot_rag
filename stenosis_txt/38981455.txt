Title: North American Fetal Therapy Network: Maternal Outcomes in Fetal Aqueductal Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Fetal aqueductal stenosis (AS) affects approximately 1:1,000 pregnancies. Obstruction of cerebral spinal fluid circulation occurs at the aqueduct of Sylvius, leading to progressive hydrocephalus and macrocephaly, which often necessitates cesarean section (CS). The purpose of this study was to describe maternal outcomes associated with fetal AS.
METHODS: This study is conducted through the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet). Subjects with a prenatal diagnosis of severe fetal central nervous system ventriculomegaly were recruited and followed longitudinally. Maternal events around the delivery of fetuses with AS were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven subjects with fetal AS confirmed by neonatal neuroimaging were analyzed. The average gestational age at delivery was 36.7 weeks. Overall, 86% were delivered by CS, and 62% of these were elective. Ninety-one percent of CSs were performed through a Pfannenstiel abdominal incision. A classical uterine incision was required in 13% of cesarean deliveries. The peripartum complication rate was 27%.
CONCLUSION: Women carrying a fetus with AS were at risk for preterm birth, cesarean delivery, a classical uterine incision, and peripartum complications. These data highlight the maternal morbidity associated with fetal AS and the potential benefit of in utero therapy not only for neonatal outcomes but also for maternal outcomes.
