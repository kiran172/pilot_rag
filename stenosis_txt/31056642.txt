Title: Lesion characteristics and prognosis of acute coronary syndrome without angiographically significant coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: AIMS: While patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presenting with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) are at high risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, detailed lesion characteristics are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the lesion characteristics and prognosis of ACS with non-obstructive CAD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study consisted of 82 consecutive ACS patients without obstructive CAD who underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT). Based on the presence of high-risk lesions (HL) in the culprit artery, we classified the patients into two groups: HL group and non-high-risk lesions (NHL) group. A systematic clinical follow-up was performed at our outpatient clinic for up to 24 months. Our endpoint was recurrence of ACS with obstructive CAD. OCT revealed that 42 (51.2%) of 82 patients had hidden HL in the culprit artery, including ruptured plaque (15.9%), calcified nodule (11.0%), spontaneous coronary artery dissection (8.5%), lone thrombus (8.5%), thin-cap fibroatheroma (6.1%), and plaque erosion (1.2%). During angiography, 5 (11.9%) HL patients complained of chest pain without ST elevation. Patients in the HL group had poorer prognoses than those in the other groups (P = 0.040).
CONCLUSION: Hidden high-risk lesions accompany ACS patients without obstructive CAD, resulting in poorer outcomes. Vascular injury itself might provoke acute chest pain.
