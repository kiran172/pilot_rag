Title: A magnetic resonance imaging-based morphometric analysis of bilateral L1-L5 oblique lumbar interbody fusion corridor: feasibility of safe surgical approach and influencing factors.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
PURPOSE: To investigate the size and local anatomy of the right and the left-sided oblique corridors between L1-L5 levels and identify the potential impact of increasing age and sex on corridor size.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) was introduced by Silvestre and his colleagues as a solution to the approach-related complications associated with anterior lumbar interbody fusion and lateral lumbar interbody fusion. Limited data were available describing the local anatomy and morphology of this approach.
METHODS: Imaging data of 300 patients (150 males and 150 females) who underwent 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the lumbar spine at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, New Delhi, India between January 2023 and January 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. The cohort was stratified into six age groups (21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and >70 years) with 25 patients in each age group for both sexes. T2 weighted axial MRI images were analyzed from the L1-L5 level at the mid-disc level to calculate the corridor size. The local anatomical differences were recorded.
RESULTS: At L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 levels, the mean corridor sizes in males were 17.48, 15.50, 13.41, and 9.32 mm on the left side, and 11.48, 7.12, 4.34, and 1.64 mm on the right side, respectively. The corresponding mean corridor sizes in females were 10.34, 12.94, 12.64, and 7.22 mm on the left side and 2.66, 3.52, 3.69, and 1.64 mm on the right side, respectively. For both sides, the corridor size was significantly affected by sex, increased with age, and decreased at the lower lumbar disc levels.
CONCLUSIONS: A left-sided OLIF approach is more feasible for both sexes. The right-sided approach is less likely to be performed effectively.
