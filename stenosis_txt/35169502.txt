Title: A case of carotid web: Cause of stroke in healthy and young patients.

Abstract: Carotid webs are important, often undiagnosed causes of cryptogenic and recurrent strokes. CT angiography and digital subtraction angiography adequately demonstrate webs as linear filling defects in the carotid bulb. However, findings are overlooked unless viewed in optimal planes and easily misdiagnosed as dissection flaps or atheromatous plaques, altering management and outcome. A case of unilateral carotid web is presented, detected during imaging in a young lady presenting with hemiparesis without other risk factors for stroke.
