Title: Echocardiographic and Clinical Follow-up After Aortic Valve Neocuspidization Using Autologous Pericardium.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Mid-term data from a single centre showed the safety and durability of aortic valve neocuspidization using autologous pericardium (OZAKI procedure). Since validation data from other centres are missing, aim of this study was to analyze echocardiographic and clinical results of our first patients that were operated with the OZAKI technique.
METHODS: Thirty-five patients (24 males, median (IQR) age 72.0 (59.0, 76.0) years) with aortic stenosis (AS; n = 10), aortic insufficiency (AR; n = 13) or a combination of both (AS/AR; n = 12), underwent aortic valve neocuspidization in our institution between September 2015 and May 2017. Echocardiographic follow-up was performed using a standardized examination protocol.
RESULTS: Clinical follow-up was completed in 97% of the patients. Median (IQR) follow-up time was 645 (430, 813) days. Mortality rate was 9% (n = 1: aspiration pneumonia; n = 1: unknown; n = 1: anaphylactic shock), and the reoperation rate was 3% (n = 1: endocarditis). No pacemaker implantation was necessary after isolated OZAKI procedures. Echocardiographic follow-up was performed in 83% of the patients (n = 29; median (IQR) time 664 (497, 815) days). Median (IQR) mean and peak gradients were 6 (5,9) mmHg and 12 (8, 17) mmHg. Moderate aortic regurgitation was seen in 2 patients (7%). No severe aortic regurgitation or moderate or severe aortic stenosis occurred within the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: The OZAKI procedure is reliable and reoperation due to structural valve deterioration nil within a median 645 days follow-up period. The low rate of moderate aortic regurgitation will be surveilled very closely. Further studies are required to evaluate the significance of this procedure in aortic valve surgery.
