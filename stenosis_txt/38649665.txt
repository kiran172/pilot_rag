Title: Emergency department imaging utilization post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement: single institution 7-year experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aims to highlight presentations, acute findings and imaging phenotypes of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) within 30 days of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with aortic valve disease who underwent a TAVR between Jan 2015 and Nov 2021 at a large academic medical center was completed. From an initial 1271 patients, 146 were included based on their presentation to the ED within 30 days post-TAVR procedure. Patient data, including ED presentation details and imaging results, were recorded and de-identified.
RESULTS: Of the 146 post-TAVR patients, there were 168 ED visits within 30 days. The median time to ED after TAVR was 12 days. Respiratory symptoms were the most common complaint (27%). Neurological (23%) and cardiovascular symptoms (18%) followed. Cross-sectional imaging was conducted 250 times across visits, with an average of 1.7 scans per patient. CTs were most frequently used, followed by ultrasounds, especially echocardiograms and duplex extremity vasculature ultrasounds. 30.1% of patients had acute findings from imaging. Specific findings included heart failure (5.5%), access site complications (5.5%), pneumonia (5.5%), intracranial pathologies (3.4% for strokes and 0.7% for hematoma), and pleural effusion (3.4%). Echocardiograms and CTA chest were most associated with significant acute findings.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the vital role of early and accurate imaging in post-TAVR patients within 30 days post-procedure. As transcatheter approaches rise in popularity, emergency radiologists become instrumental in diagnosing common post-procedural presentations. Continued research is essential to devise post-discharge strategies to curtail readmissions and related costs. Proper imaging ensures prompt, effective care, enhancing overall patient outcomes.
