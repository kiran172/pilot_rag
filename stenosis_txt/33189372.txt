Title: Usefulness of intestinal ultrasound in inflammatory bowel disease.

Abstract: Imaging techniques play a fundamental role in the initial diagnosis and follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease. Intestinal ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity in patients with suspected Crohn's disease and in the detection of inflammatory activity. This technique enables the early diagnosis of intra-abdominal complications such as stenosis, fistulas, and abscesses. It has also proven useful in monitoring the response to treatment and in detecting postsurgical recurrence. Technical improvements in ultrasound scanners, technological advances such as ultrasound contrast agents and elastography, and above all increased experience have increased the role of ultrasound in the evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract. The features that make ultrasound especially attractive include its wide availability, its noninvasiveness and lack of ionizing radiation, its low cost, and its good reproducibility, which is important because it is easy to repeat the study and the study is well tolerated during follow-up. This review summarizes the role of intestinal ultrasound in the detection and follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease.
