Title: CT Image Feature Diagnosis on the Basis of Deep Learning Algorithm for Preoperative Patients and Complications of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: This work was aimed to explore the role of CT angiography information provided by deep learning algorithm in the diagnosis and complications of the disease focusing on congenital aortic valve disease and severe aortic valve stenosis. 120 patients who underwent ultrasound cardiography for aortic stenosis and underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in hospital were selected as the research objects. Patients received CT examination of deep learning algorithm within one week. The measurement methods were long and short diameter method, area method, and perimeter method. The deep learning algorithm was used to measure the long and short diameter, area, and perimeter of the target area before CT image processing. The results showed that the average diameter of long and short diameter measurement was 95% CI (0.84, 0.92), the average diameter of perimeter measurement was 95% CI (0.68, 0.87), and the average diameter of area measurement was 95% CI (0.72, 0.91). Among the 52 patients, 35 cases were hypertension (67%), 13 cases were diabetes (25%), 6 cases were chronic renal insufficiency (Cr > 2 mg/dL) (11%) (2 cases were treated with hemodialysis, 3.8%), 11 patients had chronic pulmonary disease (21%), 9 patients had cerebrovascular disease (17.3%) and atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Deep learning can achieve excellent results in CT image processing, and it was of great significance for the diagnosis of TAVI patients, improving the success rate of treatment and the prognosis of patients.
