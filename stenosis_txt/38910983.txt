Title: A Unique Presentation of Vertebral Body Osteochondroma of Sixth Cervical Spine Causing Myelopathic Symptoms: Management with En bloc Excision and Cervical Fusion.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Vertebral body osteochondroma presenting with myelopathic symptoms is exceptionally rare entity of spinal osteochondroma which arises from the posterior surface of vertebral body and leading to spinal canal stenosis and cord compression. Early definitive diagnosis and subsequent successful treatment is necessary in such cases to prevent life threatening complications.
CASE REPORT: In this context, we report a case of a 20-years old female presented with mechanical neck pain, unsteady gait, giddiness with neurological deficit for the past 3 months. An MRI of the cervical spine revealed a mass growing from the posterior aspect of the C6 vertebral body and extending toward the vertebral canal, causing marked spinal cord compression.
CONCLUSION: The following case report not only describes the rare presentations of vertebral body osteochondroma but also emphasizes on surgical management by en bloc resection of tumor and anterior cervical fusion, resulting in a favorable outcome without any recurrence.
