Title: Thoracic Aorta Perforation Treated Conservatively After TAVR in a Patient With Extremely Tortuous Aorta.

Abstract: Aortic perforation is a rare complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement associated with grim outcomes. Tortuous and calcified aortas increase the risk of aortic trauma and perforation. We report a case in which, despite massive thoracic bleeding, avoidance of thoracic aortic surgery resulted in clinical recovery. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
