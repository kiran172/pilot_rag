Title: Positive blood pressure response may predict the recovery of renal function after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may ameliorate renal function and increase blood pressure (BP). We aimed to investigate the association between increased BP and improved renal function (IRF) after TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 176 patients who had undergone TAVI were evaluated retrospectively. BP records that were taken 24 h before and 72 h after TAVI were reviewed. Pre-procedural, post-procedural 48 h, and the first month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels were noted. IRF was accepted as a ≥ 10% increase in eGFR. The predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI) development at 48 h and IRF at 1 month were investigated. The association between mortality and BP response was assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were included in this study after exclusion as defined in the methodology. Mean age was 78.1 ± 7,1 and 51.6% were female. AKI occurred in 25.5% of patients and baseline eGFR and male gender were found as independent predictors for AKI development. IRF was observed in 16% at 48 h and 31.8% of patients at 1-month follow-up. Positive BP response was seen in 42% of patients. Pre-procedural chronic kidney disease, positive BP response, and an early increase in eGFR emerged as independent predictors of IRF at the first month. The patients with positive BP response were found to have decreased mortality at 710 days follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Positive BP response after TAVI is related to improved survival and renal functions. The beneficial effect of TAVI on renal function may be precisely evaluated at 1st month rather than 48 h.
