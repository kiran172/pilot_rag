Title: Endoscopic posterior cricoid split with costal cartilage graft placement in patients under one year of age.

Abstract: Endoscopic posterior cricoid split and costal rib graft placement (EPCSCG) is an important tool in enlarging the glottic and subglottic airway, both of which can be disproportionally affected in the small airways of neonates and early infants. We present a series of 8 patients under the age of one who successfully underwent EPCSCG, with 7/8 patients avoiding tracheostomy entirely. Of these patients, the indication for EPCSCG was isolated bilateral vocal fold immobility (6/8), bilateral vocal fold immobility with subglottic stenosis (1/8), and isolated subglottic stenosis (1/8). EPCSCG can be safely applied to select patients less than one year of age.
