Title: The MRI of Lumbar Vertebral Canal in Low Back Pain: A Cross-Sectional Study.

Abstract: Background The imaging of the lumbar canal is an important aspect of low back pain (LBP) management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has gained widespread acceptance for the evaluation of spine anatomy. Objective The objective of the study is to compare the MRI findings of the anteroposterior diameter, transverse diameter, and thecal sac area of the lumbar vertebral canal in symptomatic low back pain patients to that of patients without low back pain. Methods The cross-sectional study included 200 subjects of which 100 subjects (49 males and 51 females) were symptomatic cases of low back pain and 100 subjects (53 males and 47 females) had no symptoms of low back pain and were enrolled as controls. The MRI scans were studied for the anteroposterior diameter, transverse diameter, and thecal sac area of the lumbar vertebral canal. Results In our study, the anteroposterior diameter of the lumbar vertebral canal among cases was found to have a mean of 14.42, 14.09, 13.44, 13.63, and 13.79 with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.25, 1.32, 1.75, 1.75, and 2.65 at L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5 levels, respectively. The anteroposterior diameter of the lumbar vertebral canal among controls was found to have a mean of 15.26, 15.16, 14.71, 14.68, and 15.28 with an SD of 1.60, 1.67, 1.30, 1.36, and 1.97 at L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5 levels, respectively. The difference in anteroposterior diameters of the lumbar vertebral canal was found to be statistically significant at each level, between cases and controls. The transverse diameter of the vertebral canal was found to be smaller in cases as compared to controls with a statistically significant difference at each of the levels studied. The thecal sac area of the vertebral canal was found to be less in subjects with low back pain at each of the vertebral levels studied. Conclusion The study results provide insight into the lumbar vertebral parameters in the study population and give comparative data among the symptomatic low back pain patients and control subjects without low back pain. The MRI reflected decreased anteroposterior diameter, transverse diameter, and thecal sac area of the lumbar vertebral canal among symptomatic low back pain patients.
