Title: Color Doppler ultrasound evaluation of arteriovenous grafts for hemodialysis.

Abstract: Although arteriovenous fistula (AVF) continues to be the vascular access of choice for the hemodialysis, arteriovenous graft (AVG) can be the best choice in certain categories of patients and could have several advantages over AVF in a "patient centered approach" to vascular access. In the clinical management of prosthetic fistulas, color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) is the imaging method of choice for identifying stenosis and other AVG complications. In this review, besides highlighting the pivotal role of CDU in the diagnosis of AVG complications, we will underline the key role that ultrasound can play in identifying those stenosis most likely to cause AVG thrombosis. Furthermore, we will emphasize the support that CDU can play in distinguishing the different types of grafts and prosthetic devices such as stent-grafts, in identifying AVG with lower survival, CDU utilities and limitations in the evaluation of freshly-implanted grafts, the different sites available for AVG volume flow measurement and their use based on the configuration of the prosthesis, the time interval elapsed from the surgical intervention and the integrity of the prosthetic walls.
