Title: Valvular and Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of valvular and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUND: AF has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes after TAVR. However, the differential impact of valvular as opposed to nonvalvular AF has not been investigated.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of a prospective registry, valvular AF was defined as AF in the setting of concomitant mitral stenosis or the presence of a mitral valve prosthesis. The presence of mitral stenosis was determined by pre-procedural echocardiography. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death or disabling stroke at 1 year after TAVR.
RESULTS: Among 1,472 patients undergoing TAVR between August 2007 and June 2018, AF was recorded in 465 patients (31.6%) and categorized as nonvalvular in 376 (25.5%) and valvular in 89 (6.0%). AF scores including HAS-BLED, CHADS<sub>2</sub>, and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc were comparable between patients with nonvalvular and valvular AF. The primary endpoint occurred in 9.3% of patients with no AF, in 14.5% of patients with nonvalvular AF (hazard ratio: 1.57; 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 2.20; p = 0.009), and in 24.2% of patients with valvular AF (hazard ratio: 2.75; 95% confidence interval: 1.71 to 4.41; p &lt; 0.001). Valvular AF conferred an increased risk for cardiovascular death or disabling stroke compared with nonvalvular AF (hazard ratio: 1.77; 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 2.94; p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of valvular AF in patients undergoing TAVR increased the risk for cardiovascular death or disabling stroke compared with both no AF and nonvalvular AF. (SWISS TAVI Registry; NCT01368250).
