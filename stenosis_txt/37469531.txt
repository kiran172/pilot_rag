Title: Accura balloon dilatation catheter for percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty among adult patients-its protean use.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (PBPV) is the treatment of choice for hemodynamically significant pulmonary stenosis (PS). Currently, the Tyshak balloon is preferred but requires multiple dilatations because of its instability across the valve leading to a watermelon seeding effect. Accura balloon (Vascular Concept, UK) offers an advantage in its self-positioning configuration, variable diameter, and rapid inflation-deflation sequence which shortens the procedural time and valve injury.
METHOD: 43 patients with severe pulmonary valve stenosis underwent PBPV using an Accura balloon at LPS Institute of Cardiology, GSVM Medical College, Kanpur, UP, India from March 2018 to February 2022. The procedure was carried out using the standard technique but the metallic straightener was removed when the catheter reached the right atrium to facilitate its delivery across the pulmonary valve. Patients were followed up by 2D echo at 24 hours and 6 months.
RESULT: Successful BPV was done in all 43 patients [with mean age 21.9 (range 18-41); 31 males and 12 females] among which 5 patients had dysplastic valves. The mean diameter of the annulus was 18.5 (range 15-21) mm. Immediate hemodynamic improvement was observed in 38 patients (88%) as peak systolic gradient reduced from 84±13 to 22±12 mmHg (P<0.005) while 5 patients (12%) had <50% reduction of resting gradient, though it came down significantly at 6 months. Fluoroscopy and procedural time were 5.2±1.9 min and 22.6±3.4 min respectively. Major complications (death, cardiac perforation, tamponade, tricuspid regurgitation, requirement of blood transfusion) were none. Minor complications (transient hypotension, ventricular premature contraction, transient bradycardia) were reported in all patients. Accura balloon being bulky were delivered over left atrial and super stiff Amplatz wire in 36 and 7 patients respectively.
CONCLUSION: PBPV using Accura balloon is safe and effective for both stenosed and dysplastic valves. In a few patients, maximal effect will be observed over a period of 6 months.
