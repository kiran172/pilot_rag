Title: Sequential Percutaneous Approach for Severe Mitral and Aortic Regurgitation.

Abstract: Percutaneous approach for valvular heart disease is accepted as a safe and feasible strategy to treat patients considered at high surgical risk with aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Additionally, the growing experience led to the increasing use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in several indications, such as in pure aortic regurgitation. The authors present the case of a 72-year-old woman with prohibitive surgical risk due to several comorbidities, including a chronic arterial dissection from the right carotid artery to the femoral arteries bilaterally that presented with signs and symptoms of heart failure, having a transthoracic echocardiography that showed severe functional mitral and aortic regurgitation. Combined percutaneous intervention for multivalvular disease in this clinical scenario is challenging, and the reported experience is still scarce and limited to inoperable patients.
