Title: Study of the Relationship Between Ultrasound Strain Indices and Cognitive Decline for Vulnerable Carotid Plaque.

Abstract: A relationship between ultrasound strain indices in carotid plaque to cognitive domains of executive and language function are studied in 42 symptomatic and 34 asymptomatic patients. The mean and standard deviation of the percentage stenosis were 72.10 ± 15.19 and 77.41 ± 11.20 for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients respectively. Pearson's correlation between axial, lateral and shear strain indices versus executive and language composite scores was performed.. A significant inverse correlation for both executive and language function for symptomatic patients to strain indices was found. On the other hand, for asymptomatic patients only executive function was inversely correlated with the corresponding strain indices. Our hypothesis that microemboli from vulnerable plaque and possible 'silent strokes' may be responsible for decline in executive function for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients'. Strokes and transient ischemic attacks may be responsible for further cognitive decline in language function for symptomatic patients.
