Title: Transcatheter Mitral Valve-In-Valve Implantation: An Option for Failed Bioprosthetic Mitral Valve Stenosis During Pregnancy.

Abstract: A pregnant woman presented with symptomatic bioprosthetic mitral valve stenosis. We discuss the difficulties of decision making in this particular situation where two lives are at stake, the fetus's and the mother's, questioning whether transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation can be an effective and safe option for this challenging condition. (LevelÂ of Difficulty: Advanced.).
