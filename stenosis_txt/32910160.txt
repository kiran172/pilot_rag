Title: One-stage off pump combined transapical aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta endografting.

Abstract: An 84-year-old patient was referred for severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis and focal chronic dissection of the ascending aorta. After multidisciplinary discussion, the patient was scheduled for combined transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement and ascending aorta stent-grafting. The procedure was performed with a balloon aortic valvuloplasty followed by a custom-made stent graft implantation into the ascending aorta and then by balloon-expandable transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The patient had an uneventful hospital stay. In conclusion, in selected high-risk patients, transapical combined ascending aorta stent-grafting and transcatheter aortic valve replacement are feasible and safe.
