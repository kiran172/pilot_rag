Title: Safety and efficacy of an integrated endovascular treatment strategy for early hepatic artery occlusion after liver transplantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepatic artery occlusion (HAO) after liver transplantation (LT) is typically comprised of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) and stenosis (HAS), both of which are severe complications that coexist and interdependent. This study aimed to evaluate an integrated endovascular treatment (EVT) strategy for the resolution of early HAO and identify the risk factors associated with early HAO as well as the procedural challenge encountered in the treatment strategy.
METHODS: Consecutive orthotopic LT recipients (n = 366) who underwent transplantation between June 2017 and December 2018 were retrospectively investigated. EVT was performed using an integrated strategy that involved thrombolytic therapy, shunt artery embolization plus vasodilator therapy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and/or stent placement. Simple EVT was defined as the clinical resolution of HAO by one round of EVT with thrombolytic therapy and/or shunt artery embolization plus vasodilator therapy. Otherwise, it was defined as complex EVT.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (median age 52 years) underwent EVT for early HAO that occurred within 30 days post-LT. The median interval from LT to EVT was 7 (6-16) days. Revascularization time (OR = 1.027; 95% CI: 1.005-1.050; P = 0.018) and the need for conduit (OR = 3.558; 95% CI: 1.241-10.203, P = 0.018) were independent predictors for early HAO. HAT was diagnosed in eight patients, and four out of those presented with concomitant HAS. We achieved 100% technical success and recanalization by performing simple EVT in 19 patients (3 HAT+/HAS- and 16 HAT-/HAS+) and by performing complex EVT in seven patients (1 HAT+/HAS-, 4 HAT+/HAS+, and 2 HAT-/HAS+), without major complications. The primary assisted patency rates at 1, 6, and 12 months were all 100%. The cumulative overall survival rates at 1, 6, and 12 months were 88.5%, 88.5%, and 80.8%, respectively. Autologous transfusion < 600 mL (94.74% vs. 42.86%, P = 0.010) and interrupted suture for hepatic artery anastomosis (78.95% vs. 14.29%, P = 0.005) were more prevalent in simple EVT.
CONCLUSIONS: The integrated EVT strategy was a feasible approach providing effective resolution with excellent safety for early HAO after LT. Appropriate autologous transfusion and interrupted suture technique helped simplify EVT.
