Title: Atherosclerotic renovascular disease and cardiovascular risk: new concepts.

Abstract: Renal vascular hypertension (RVHT) is one of the most common secondary forms of hypertension. It is estimated that 1% to 5% of all cases of hypertension can be attributed to RVHT. RVHT is generally caused by progressive stenosis of the renal artery most often due to atherosclerosis, and less often caused by fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) can lead to the development of resistant hypertension and can also cause progressive impairment of renal function. ARAS can also result in serious cardiac complications, such as flash pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure. Most patients with ARAS are characterized by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. The disease progression is associated with an increase in left ventricular mass index and cardiac dilatation. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease is recognized as a relevant risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Studies published so far documented ARAS as a predictor of higher cardiovascular risk and showed that mortality after incidental ARAS diagnosis is much higher than that observed in the general population. Proper recognition of the patients with ARAS who would benefit from interventional treatment is crucial, particularly for identification of patients with true resistant hypertension, flash pulmonary edema, and progressive impairment of renal function.
