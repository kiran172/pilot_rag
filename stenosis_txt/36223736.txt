Title: Safety of Apixaban Monotherapy for Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation-Related Acute Stroke with Intra-/Extracranial Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether apixaban is safe for the prevention of further adverse events in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients with intra-/extracranial artery stenosis (Stenosis group) compared with acute large vessel occlusion without intra-/extracranial artery stenosis (No stenosis group). We also examined whether combination therapy using apixaban and antiplatelet is safe.
METHODS: ALVO (Apixaban on clinical outcome of patients with Large Vessel Occlusion [LVO] or stenosis) was a historical and prospective multicenter registry at 38 centers in Japan. Patients with NVAF and acute LVO or stenosis who received apixaban within 14 days after onset were included. We conducted the post hoc analysis using the ALVO dataset. We compared patients with stenosis versus those without stenosis in terms of the primary outcome, which was defined as a composite of all-cause death, major bleeding events, and ischemic events 365 days after onset.
RESULTS: Of the 662 patients, 54 (8.2%) patients were classified into the Stenosis group, and 104 patients of the total (16%) reached the primary outcome. The cumulative incidence of primary outcome was not significantly different between the No stenosis and the Stenosis groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-2.4; p = 0.52). Even after adjustment for predictive clinical variates, no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the No stenosis and the Stenosis groups was shown (adjusted HR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.59-2.5; p = 0.60). Fifty patients (7.6%) used an antiplatelet with apixaban. Among the Stenosis group patients, the cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was significantly higher among patients treated with an antiplatelet and apixaban (HR 3.5, 95% CI: 1.0-12; p = 0.048).
CONCLUSION: Apixaban monotherapy appears safe for the prevention of further adverse events in the Stenosis group patients similar to the No stenosis group patients. Concomitant use of an antiplatelet might not be favorable in patients with stenosis.
