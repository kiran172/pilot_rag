Title: Y-incision Aortic Root Enlargement With Modified Aortotomy Upsizing the Annulus by 5 Valve Sizes.

Abstract: A very small aortic root and annulus (â‰¤17 mm) needs extensive aortic annular enlargement in adult patients. This report describes a technique that enlarged the aortic annulus by 5 valve sizes from 16 to 17 mm to size 27 bovine pericardial valve, as well as a modification of the aortotomy with the roof technique to make the aortotomy closure easier and more hemostatic while enlarging the sinotubular junction and proximal ascending aorta effectively for future valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
