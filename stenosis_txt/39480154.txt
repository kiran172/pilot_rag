Title: Inflammatory back pain as an unusual manifestation of Takayasu arteritis: a case report.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis and spondyloarthritis are two rheumatological diseases whose co-existence is well-documented in the literature. Data on the presence of inflammatory back pain in Takayasu arteritis without a diagnosis of spondyloarthritis, however, is scarce. Here, we present a 33-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency department with acute-onset chest pain associated with left carotidynia, carotid bruit, and left arm claudication, normal electrocardiogram and computed tomography angiographic features suggesting Takayasu arteritis, including stenosis and occlusion of the aorta and its branches. Two years prior, he had undergone a clinical work-up for an inflammatory back pain accompanied by alternating buttocks pain, morning stiffness lasting more than half an hour, and heel pain. HLA-B27 status and magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints were both negative. He was prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was placed on adalimumab 40 mg SC every two weeks but had to switch to etanercept two months before his emergency admission due to supply issues. Oral prednisolone was initiated at a dose of 60 mg/day with symptomatic improvement in both his inflammatory back pain and his chest pain, but he had to be switched to methotrexate and infliximab due to steroid side effects. Inflammatory aortitis should be considered as a possibility during the assessment of inflammatory back pain to mitigate the risks of delayed diagnosis.
