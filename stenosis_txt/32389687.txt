Title: Unintended Consequences: Perils of Renal Revascularization for Severe Hypertension.

Abstract: Revascularization of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis may cure hypertension, but paradoxically, improvement in systemic blood pressure in response to successful revascularization may precipitate ischemia in other organs affected by previously silent atherosclerotic disease. We describe bowel ischemia secondary to preexisting celiac artery stenosis after revascularisation. Prior knowledge of multivessel disease facilitated prompt diagnosis and management of this condition.
