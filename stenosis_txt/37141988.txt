Title: Clinical Outcomes of Percutaneous Fontan Stenting in Adults.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fontan pathway stenosis is a well-known complication after palliation. Percutaneous stenting is effective for angiographic/hemodynamic relief of Fontan obstruction, but its clinical impact in adults remains unknown.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of 26 adults undergoing percutaneous stenting for Fontan obstruction from 2014 to 2022. Procedural details, functional capacity, and liver parameters were reviewed at baseline and during follow-up.
RESULTS: Median age was 22.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 19-28.8 y); 69% were male. After stenting, Fontan gradient significantly decreased (2.0 ± 1.9 vs 0 [IQR 0-1] mm Hg; P &lt; 0.005), and minimal Fontan diameter increased (11.3 ± 2.9 vs 19.3 [IQR 17-20] mm; P &lt; 0.001). One patient developed acute kidney injury periprocedurally. During a follow-up of 2.1 years (IQR 0.6-3.7 y), 1 patient had thrombosis of the Fontan stent and 2 underwent elective Fontan re-stenting. New York Heart Association functional class improved in 50% of symptomatic patients. Changes in functional aerobic capacity on exercise testing were directly related to pre-stenting Fontan gradient (n = 7; r = 0.80; P = 0.03) and inversely related to pre-stenting minimal Fontan diameter (r = -0.79; P = 0.02). Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 150 109/L) was present in 42.3% of patients before and in 32% after the procedure (P = 0.08); splenomegaly (spleen size &gt; 13 cm) was present in 58.3% and 58.8% (P = 0.57), respectively. Liver fibrosis (aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index and Fibrosis-4) scores were unchanged after the procedure compared with baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous stenting in adults is safe and effective in relieving Fontan obstruction, resulting in subjective improvement in functional capacity in some. A subset of patients demonstrated improvement in markers of portal hypertension, suggesting that Fontan stenting could improve Fontan-associated liver disease in select individuals.
