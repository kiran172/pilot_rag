Title: [Safety and efficacy of yellow zebra guide wire exchange system in the treatment of complete upper digestive stenosis].

Abstract: To investigate the efficacy and safety of yellow zebra guide wire exchange system in the treatment of complete upper digestive stenosis. To analyze the success rate and adverse events, a retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with complete digestive stenosis in Zhongda Hospital Affiliated to Southeast University from May 2019 to April 2023 and the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from August 2011 to March 2015. A total of 41 patients were included, including 25 males and 16 females, aged (65Â±12) years (28-94 years). Among them, 40 patients were successfully inserted with yellow zebra guide wire and underwent endoscopic treatment using the outer tube replacement with hard steel wire, with 97.6% (40/41) effective rate. Eleven patients (27.5%) were accompanied by varying degrees of retrosternal pain, without complications such as bleeding or perforation.
