Title: Aortic valve neocuspidization using the Ozaki technique: A meta-analysis of reconstructed patient-level data.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve neocuspidization using the Ozaki technique has shown promising results both in adults and children.
METHODS: A systematic search of the PubMed and Cochrane databases was performed up to November 13, 2021. Individual patient data were reconstructed and analyzed from the Kaplan-Meier curves of all eligible studies for time-to-event outcomes.
RESULTS: We included a total of 22 studies reporting on 1,891 patients that underwent Ozaki reconstruction. Mean age at the time of surgery was 43.2 ± 24.5 years (65 ± 12.3 years for adult patients and 12.3 ± 3.8 years for pediatric patients). The most common indication was aortic stenosis (46.4%, 95% CI 34.1-58.6). Mean cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass duration were 106.8 ± 24.8 minutes and 135.2 ± 35.1 minutes, respectively. Permanent pacemaker was implanted in 0.7% (95% CI 0.4-1.2) of the patients. At discharge, mean effective orifice area was 2.1 ± 0.5 cm2/m2. At latest follow-up, peak gradient was 15.7 ± 7.4 mm Hg and only 0.25% (95% CI 0-2.3) had moderate aortic insufficiency. In-hospital mortality was 0.7% (95% CI 0.1-1.7). Late mortality was 1.9% during a mean follow-up of 38.1 ± 23.8 months. One-year, 3-year, and 5-year freedom from reoperation rates were 98.0 %, 97.0 % and 96.5%, respectively. More than half of the reoperations were due to infective endocarditis (51.5%, 95% CI 18.3-84.0). In our cohort, the risk of endocarditis per patient per year was 0.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: The midterm outcomes of the Ozaki procedure are excellent in terms of hemodynamics, survival, and freedom from reoperation. Acquiring long-term follow-up will help solidify this technique in the cardiac surgery armamentarium.
