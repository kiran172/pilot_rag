Title: Impact of pulmonary hypertension on short-term outcomes in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In patients with left heart disease and severe aortic stenosis (AS), pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common comorbidity and predictor of poor prognosis. Untreated AS aggravates PH leading to an increased right ventricular afterload and, in line to right ventricular dysfunction. The surgical benefit of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in elderly patients with severe AS and PH could be limited due to the multiple comorbidities and poor outcomes. Therefore, we purposed to investigate the impact of PH on short-term outcomes in patients with moderate to severe AS who underwent surgical AVR in our heart center.
METHODS: In this study we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 99 patients with severe secondary post-capillary PH who underwent surgical AVR (AVR + PH group) at our heart center between 2010 and 2021 with a regard to perioperative outcomes. In order to investigate the impact of PH on short-term outcomes, the control group of 99 patients without pulmonary hypertension who underwent surgical AVR (AVR group) at our heart center with similar risk profile was accordingly analyzed regarding pre-, intra- and postoperative data.
RESULTS: Atrial fibrillation occurred significantly more often (p = .013) in patients who suffered from PH undergoing AVR. In addition, the risk for cardiac surgery (EUROSCORE II) was significantly higher (p &lt; .001) in the above-mentioned group. Likewise, cardiopulmonary bypass time (p = .018), aortic cross-clamp time (p = .008) and average operation time (p = .009) were significantly longer in the AVR + PH group. Furthermore, the in-hospital survival rate was significantly higher (p = .044) in the AVR group compared to the AVR + PH group. Moreover, the dialysis rate was significantly higher (p &lt; .001) postoperatively in patients who suffered PH compared to the patients without PH undergoing AVR.
CONCLUSION: In our study, patients with severe PH and severe symptomatic AS who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement showed adverse short-term outcomes compared to patients without PH.
