Title: Clinical Outcomes of the Portico Transcatheter Aortic Valve Delivered via Alternative Access: 30-Day and 1-Year Results of the Portico ALT Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to report the 30-day and 1-year outcomes and performance from the Portico Alternative Access study to obtain CE approval of the alternative access delivery system.
METHODS: The Portico Alternative Access study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, investigational study (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT03056573) describing 45 patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AS) treated with the self-expanding Portico device using subclavian/axillary access.
RESULTS: Forty-five subjects (81.7 ± 5.9 years; 57.8% female; Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, 5.4 ± 4.7%) with severe, symptomatic AS had a Portico bioprosthetic aortic valve implantation attempt via axillary/subclavian access. Implantation was successful in 97.8% of subjects. At 30 days, the rate of major vascular complications at the subclavian/axillary access site was 4.4%. All-cause mortality was 2.2% at 30 days and 4.4% at 1 year.
CONCLUSION: The Portico transcatheter aortic valve can be safely delivered by axillary or subclavian access with high implant success rate and low complication rates.
