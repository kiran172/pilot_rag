Title: Tracheal A-Frame Deformities Following Airway Reconstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Airway reconstruction for subglottic and tracheal stenosis is often successful in achieving tracheostomy decannulation and improving airway symptoms. However, one common reason for late failure is development of a tracheal A-frame deformity, which can necessitate additional surgery. Although knowledge of this deformity exists, the incidence and risk factors have not been reported. This study seeks to determine the incidence of A-frame following airway reconstruction and define factors that correlate with development of this deformity.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: Patients under 21 years of age undergoing open airway reconstruction at our institution between January 2005-December 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, comorbidities, airway history/reconstruction type, and follow-up airway findings were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to examine time to A-frame repair.
RESULTS: Two hundred patients underwent airway reconstruction and 69 (34.5%) developed an A-frame deformity. History of tracheostomy was the most significant contributor to A-frame development (P < .0001). Double- versus single-stage procedures were not associated with increased odds of A-frame development (P = .94), however, patients undergoing resection procedures as opposed to laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) with cartilage grafts had a significantly lower chance of developing this deformity (P = .004). Of the patients with an A-frame, 27 (39%) required further surgical intervention.
CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of patients undergoing airway reconstruction developed a tracheal A-frame deformity, with a significantly higher rate among patients with a history of tracheostomy and those undergoing LTR. Patients should be followed long term to assess for the development of an A-frame.
