Title: Early Hemodynamic Recovery after a Successful Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Cardiogenic Shock Secondary to Severe Bicuspid Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Pulmonary edema secondary to severe aortic stenosis is an emergency condition that carries a high risk of mortality and is resistant to treatment using standard heart failure therapies. We present here a patient with severe aortic stenosis, complicated by poor left ventricular function and cardiogenic shock, who has immediate hemodynamic recovery after successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures. This case presentation highlights the efficacy of using the TAVI procedure in the management of severe aortic stenosis complicated by acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock with immediate improvement of hemodynamic parameters more effectively sooner after the procedure.
