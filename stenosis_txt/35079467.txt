Title: Planned Four-stage Transforaminal Full-endoscopic Lumbar Decompression under Local Anesthesia in a Patient with Severe Comorbidity.

Abstract: A 74-year-old man presented with symptoms of intermittent claudication. A diagnosis of lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS) at L3/4 and L4/5 was made based on the clinical and radiological findings. Bilateral lateral recess stenosis was detected at both these levels on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and on computed tomography (CT) scans obtained after myelography. Four nerve roots were impinged bilaterally at L4 and L5. The initial plan was to perform conventional laminectomy at L3/4 and L4/5 under general anesthesia. However, the neurologists pointed out that the patient had comorbidities of parkinsonism and severe carotid artery stenosis, meaning that an increase or decrease in blood pressure during general anesthesia could cause a stroke. Therefore, we changed the surgical plan to four-stage full-endoscopic ventral facetectomy at L3/4 and L4/5 bilaterally under local anesthesia. There were no surgery-related complications after any of the four operations. The patient's symptoms improved after the final operation and the modified MacNab criteria indicated a good clinical outcome. Full-endoscopic lumbar decompression surgery under local anesthesia may be effective in elderly patients who are in poor general health.
