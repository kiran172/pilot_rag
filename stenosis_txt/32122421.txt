Title: The use of modified Silastic nasal splints as frontal sinus stents: a technical note.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic frontal sinus surgery is frequently complicated by post-operative stenosis and obstruction of the frontal sinus outflow tract, resulting in recurrent disease. Frontal sinus stents may help prevent re-occlusion of the frontal neo-ostia.
OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a simple and cost-effective approach to frontal sinus stenting using modified Silastic nasal splints.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The current technique provides an effective, reliable and inexpensive method for achieving post-operative frontal sinus outflow tract patency.
