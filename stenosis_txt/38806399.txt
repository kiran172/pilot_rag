Title: Tracheal metallic hybrid stent removal via tracheostomy: an unconventional approach.

Abstract: Increasing use of tracheal expandable metallic hybrid stents will lead to common encounters with these devices in emergency airway management. The presence of these stents qualifies any patient as a challenge when an emergency tracheostomy is needed. We report an unorthodox technique of tracheostomy with concomitant removal of tracheal stent, without any major complications. Although the combined approach with bronchoscopy and tracheostomy has been reported in similar cases, we present a safe procedure when rigid bronchoscopy is not available.
