Title: A Protocol for Carotid Artery Stenting in COVID Times. A Single Canadian Centre Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in huge disruption to healthcare delivery worldwide. There is a need to balance the urgent needs of the neurovascular patient population with the desire to preserve critical inpatient hospital capacity. It is incumbent on neurointerventionalists to advocate for their patients to minimise future disability. Patients still require semiurgent carotid revascularisation after ischaemic embolic events. We present a review of a novel protocol for expediting patient flow through the carotid stenting process, in accordance with government directives to minimise nonessential inpatient admissions, ensure its efficacy, and evaluate its safety. We also evaluate the literature regarding complications with attention to the timing of these related to the procedure.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 45 consecutive carotid stenting cases performed at London Health Sciences Centre between March 2020 and March 2021 for symptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis utilising a default same-day discharge policy was performed. Complications were plotted as a function of time.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients underwent carotid artery stenting with same-day discharge and 21 patients underwent stenting with an overnight inpatient stay. A single stent occlusion occurred 27 h post stenting.
CONCLUSION: Simple modification of protocol for symptomatic carotid artery stenting during the COVID-19 outbreak with radial access as first approach appears to provide safe, efficacious care.
