Title: Technical and clinical success after venous sinus stenting for treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension using a novel guide catheter for access: Case series and initial multi-center experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Venous sinus stenting is a well established alternative to cerebrospinal fluid diversion for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with associated venous sinus stenosis. During this procedure, distal guide catheter placement within the venous sinuses may be desirable to facilitate stent delivery. We report our initial experience using the TracStar LDP™ (Imperative Care, Campbell, USA, 0.088-inch inner diameter) as the guide catheter for intracranial access during venous sinus stenting.
METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective chart review of a prospectively maintained IRB-approved database was performed. Consecutive patients who underwent venous sinus stenting from 1/1/2020-9/6/2021 for IIH were included. Patient characteristics, procedural details, TracStar distal reach, outcomes, and complications were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were included. The mean age was 33.8 years and 93.1% of patients were female. Visual changes prompted evaluation in 86.2% of patients. Stent placement was successful in all patients. The TracStar LDP catheter was advanced to the location of stent placement in 97.9% of cases in which it was attempted. The large 0.088-inch inner diameter lumen enabled compatibility with all desired stent sizes ranging from six to 10 millimeters. Gradient pressure across transverse sinus stenosis dropped from an average of 19.5 mmHg pre-procedure to 1.7 mmHg post-stent placement (p < 0.001). Clinical improvement was achieved in 87.9% (51/58) of patients. There were no catheter-related complications.
CONCLUSION: The TracStar LDP is a safe and effective access platform for reaching treatment locations in patients who present with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and who are candidates for venous sinus stent placement.
