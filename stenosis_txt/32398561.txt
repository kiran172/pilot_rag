Title: EsoFLIP for esophageal dilation: proposed advantages.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The EsoFLIP integrates impedance planimetry technology into a dilator balloon capable of dilating from diameters between 10 and 30â€Šmm via controlled volumetric distension while providing real-time visualization and objective measurement during the dilation procedure, potentially negating the need for fluoroscopy. This review aims to describe the use and application of EsoFLIP and the potential advantages this novel technology may afford.
RECENT FINDINGS: Small pilot and retrospective studies demonstrate EsoFLIP feasibility and safety, but larger studies are needed to understand its impact on clinical outcomes.
SUMMARY: EsoFLIP is an appealing new technology that offers advantages in therapeutic dilation of the lower esophageal sphincter in achalasia or of esophageal strictures because of previous surgery, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or radiation.
