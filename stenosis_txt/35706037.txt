Title: Fluoroscopy-guided trans-urethral exchange of double-J ureteral stents.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For patients with malignant ureteral obstruction or stricture who require long-term internal drainage, plastic double-J stents (DJ stents) represent the mainstay of therapeutic strategies. DJ stents should be replaced at least once every 6 months to avoid infection or obstruction. Although DJ stents are generally replaced under cystoscopy, successful fluoroscopy-guided retrograde replacement of DJ stents in the interventional suite has been described in the literature.
METHODS: Between April 2004 and May 2020, we exchanged 143 DJ stents in 19 male and 22 female patients under fluoroscopic guidance using Nelaton catheters, snare catheters, and 8F DJ stents. All procedures were performed with patients under sedation and local anesthesia. There were 39 patients with malignant ureteral obstruction and two patients with benign ureteral strictures. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Technical success, clinical success, complications, procedure time, and mean interval between two procedures were retrospectively reviewed, and the factors affecting the success rate of the procedure were analyzed.
RESULTS: Obstruction was detected at the abdominal ureter in 4 patients, pelvic ureter in 29 patients, and intravesical ureter in 8 patients. Twenty-six patients underwent two or more sessions of the procedures, whereas 15 patients underwent single-session procedures. Total 34 outpatient-based procedures and 109 inpatient-based procedures were performed. Technical success and clinical success were achieved in 94.4% (135/143) and 93.3% (126/135) procedures, respectively. Mean procedure time was 21.5 min (range 9-192 min). Mean procedure interval was 101.8 days (range 5-306 days). Technical success was negatively affected by male sex and obstruction at the pelvic ureter and was positively affected by previous successful exchange. Left-sided ureteral stent placement and old age negatively influenced clinical success. Septic shock occurred in one patient and was treated with antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: Fluoroscopy-guided trans-urethral exchange of DJ stents is an effective and less painful procedure.
