Title: Development of Cushing Syndrome After Serial In-office Subglottic Steroid Injections.

Abstract: In-office subglottic intralesional steroid injections (SILSI) have gained popularity as an adjunct to operating room dilation in the treatment of subglottic stenosis. They are generally thought to have a low risk profile for development of systemic side effects. Here, we present a case of a 55 year old woman who developed symptoms of Cushing syndrome after receiving SILSI, including weight gain, striae, dorsal hump and alopecia. This case illustrates that despite the localized nature of SILSI, there is still a risk of developing systemic effects as a result of the treatment. Laryngoscope, 132:942-943, 2022.
