Title: Rotablation in the Very Elderly - Safer than We Think?

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Calcified coronary artery stenosis remains a challenge for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). Calcium modification is facilitated by rotablation and is used in 1-3% of cases. Data on rotablation in patients ≥80 years is limited and perceived to be high risk. We compared PCI with rotablation and outcomes between patients ≥80 years and those <80 years.
METHODS/MATERIALS: Retrospective analysis was performed of consecutive patients who underwent rotablation and PCI from 3 United Kingdom (UK) PCI Centres (2014-2017). In-hospital outcomes (composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, death, emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery, vascular damage, coronary perforation, advanced AV-block, bleeding and renal impairment) and 30 day mortality risk score was compared between groups.
RESULTS: 213 patients were included. 33.3% (n = 71) were ≥80 years. Baseline and angiographic characteristics were similar in the two groups. Older patients were more likely to present with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (≥80 years 53.5% vs. 33.8% in <80 years, p = 0.006) and had increased hospital stay (≥80 years 2.8 days (±6.0) vs. 1.3 days (±1.9) <80 years, p = 0.009). Majority of PCI were performed through radial access (≥80 years 91.5% vs. 88.0% <80 years, p = 0.43). In-hospital composite outcomes were similar between the groups (≥80 years 5.6% vs. 4.9% <80 years, p = 1.0). The 30-day mortality risk score demonstrated a higher average risk of 2.5% in ≥80 years versus under 1% risk in <80 years (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that outcomes after rotablation in the very elderly are similar to younger patients despite being high risk and presenting with ACS.
