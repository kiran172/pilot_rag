Title: Surgical Management of Complex Aortic Valve Disease in Young Adults: Repair, Replacement, and Future Alternatives.

Abstract: The ideal aortic valve substitute in young adults remains unknown. Prosthetic valves are associated with a suboptimal survival and carry a significant risk of valve-related complications in young patients, mainly reinterventions with tissue valves and, thromboembolic events and major bleeding with mechanical prostheses. The Ross procedure is the only substitute that restores a survival curve similar to that of a matched general population, and permits a normal life without functional limitations. Though the risk of reintervention is the Achilles' heel of this procedure, it is very low in patients with aortic stenosis and can be mitigated in patients with aortic regurgitation by tailored surgical techniques. Finally, the Ozaki procedure and the transcatheter aortic valve implantation are seen by many as future alternatives but lack evidence and long-term follow-up in this specific patient population.
