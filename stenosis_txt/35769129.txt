Title: Calicovesicostomy surgery in the patient with ureteral rupture.

Abstract: Transurethral lithotripsy (TUL) surgery, which is used to crush ureteral stones, can have complications, including bleeding, infection, ureteral stenosis, ureteral rupture, and ureteral avulsion. In this study, we present a 45-year-old woman who was referred, due to a right ureteral rupture during transurethral lithotripsy surgery. At first, the patient underwent ureteroneocystostomy surgery by a combination of boari flap and psoas hitch techniques. Due to the obstruction and necrosis at the anastomosis site, the patient underwent calicovesicostomy surgery.
