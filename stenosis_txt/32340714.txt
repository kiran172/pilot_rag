Title: Additive Value of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and C-Reactive Protein Level Assessment for Prediction of 2-year Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Available prediction models are inaccurate in elderly who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of present study was to analyze the separate and combined prognostic values of baseline HDL-C and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients treated successfully with TAVI who had complete 2-year follow-up. We analyzed 334 patients treated with TAVI from 01/2010 to 07/2017 who had measurements of HDL-C and CRP on admission or during qualification for the procedure. Baseline HDL-C ≤46 mg/dl (areas under the curve [AUC] = 0.657) and CRP ≥0.20 mg/dl (AUC = 0.634) were predictive of 2-year mortality. After stratification with both cutoffs, patients with low HDL-C and concomitant high CRP most often had LVEF ≤50% and were high risk as per EuroSCORE II. Those with isolated CRP elevation had the lowest frequency of LVEF ≤50%, but more sarcopenia (based on psoas muscle area). After adjustment in the multivariate analysis for other identified predictors including EuroSCORE II and statin therapy, isolated HDL-C ≤46 mg/dl (identified in 40 patients) and isolated CRP ≥0.20 mg/dl (n = 109) were both independent predictors of 2-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.92 and HR = 2.42, respectively) compared with patients with both markers within established cutoffs (n = 105) who had the lowest 2-year mortality (9.5%). Patients with both markers exceeding cutoffs (n = 80) had the highest risk (HR = 4.53) with 2-year mortality of 42.5%. High CRP was associated with increased mortality within the first year of follow-up, whereas low HDL-C increased mortality in the second year. The combination of both markers with EuroSCORE II enhanced mortality prediction (AUC = 0.697). In conclusion, low baseline HDL-C and high CRP jointly contribute to the prediction of increased all-cause mortality after TAVI.
