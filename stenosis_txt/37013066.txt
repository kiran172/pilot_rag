Title: Transcarotid artery revascularization in blunt carotid injury.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) with flow reversal has substantially changed the management of carotid artery stenosis, enabling an endovascular approach with a periprocedural stroke rate as low as or lower than that of open carotid surgery. The use of TCAR for blunt carotid artery injury has not yet been described.
METHODS: A review of the use of TCAR for blunt carotid artery injury was performed at a single center from October 2020 to August 2021. The patient demographics, mechanism of injury, and outcomes were collected and compared.
RESULTS: Ten carotid stents were placed via TCAR in eight patients for hemodynamically significant blunt carotid artery injuries. No periprocedural neurologic events occurred, and all stents remained patent during short-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: TCAR is feasible and safe in the management of significant blunt carotid artery injuries. More data are needed regarding the long-term outcomes and ideal surveillance intervals.
