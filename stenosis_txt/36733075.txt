Title: [Reasonable Surgery for Sigmoid Colon Cancer with Asymptomatic Celiac Artery Stenosis and Superior Mesenteric Artery Stenosis-A Case Report].

Abstract: A 79-year-old woman was diagnosed with cT2N0M0, cStage â…  sigmoid colon cancer. Preoperative staging computed tomography(CT)incidentally revealed severe stenosis of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. A collateral blood channel communicating between the inferior mesenteric artery and the celiac artery region was well developed. Therefore, a sigmoidectomy with D1 lymph node dissection was performed to preserve this collateral blood channel as a surgery for sigmoid colon cancer. There are few reports on surgical procedures for patients with simultaneous stenosis of multiple major abdominal arteries. In addition, there are no consensus about the optimal surgical procedure and extent of lymph node dissection for colorectal cancer with well-developed collateral vessels that should be preserved. Preoperative three-dimensional CT angiography(3D-CTA)and intraoperative blood-flow assessment using Indocyanine Green help risk management of multi- organ ischemia due to misidentification and injury of collateral arteries. It is important to keep oncological validity as well as risk management. We report a case of sigmoid colon cancer with asymptomatic stenosis of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.
