Title: Early re-replacement after mitral valve replacement using the chimney technique in a child: a case report.

Abstract: Mitral valve replacement for small pediatric patients is technically difficult because of the small annulus and requires some technical ideas. The chimney technique is useful for supra-annular mitral valve replacement. We describe a paediatric case of early re-replacement owing to pannus formation after mitral valve replacement using the chimney technique.
