Title: Endothelin-1 gene and endothelin receptor A gene polymorphisms in severe pulmonary hypertension associated with rheumatic mitral valve disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) gene polymorphisms are implicated in pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.
METHODS: We studied ET-1 (Lys198Asn and 3A/4A) and endothelin receptor A (ET<sub>A</sub>) gene (His323His) polymorphisms in 123 subjects with pulmonary hypertension associated with rheumatic mitral valve disease (PH-MVD) and 123 healthy controls.
RESULTS: The mutant homozygous Asn/Asn genotype in Lys198Asn and T/T genotype in His323His polymorphism was more prevalent in the PH-MVD group. Presence of Asn/Asn genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk (odds ratio 3.9).
CONCLUSIONS: ET-1 and ET<sub>A</sub> gene polymorphisms are prevalent in the PH-MVD group suggesting that they may predispose to the development of PH.
