Title: Homocysteine concentration in coronary artery disease and severity of coronary lesions.

Abstract: Our previous study reckons that the impact of the rs1801133 variant of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) on coronary artery disease (CAD) is possibly mediated by cardiometabolic disorder. This study is performed to verify this hypothesis. Four hundred and thirty CAD patients and 216 CAD-free individuals were enrolled in this case-control study. The rs1801133 variant was genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Severity of coronary lesions was evaluated by number of stenotic coronary vessels and extent of coronary stenosis. The rs1801133 T allele significantly increased homocysteine levels in patients with CAD and CAD-free individuals. Individuals with the T allele of rs1801133 had an increased risk of developing CAD. In contrast, individuals with the TT genotype of rs1801133 were at high risk of multiple vessel lesions. The carriers of CT genotype had higher levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and lower levels of apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) than those with CC genotype in male patients with CAD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and precision-recall (PR) curve indicated that hyperhomocysteinemia was sensitive to predict the severity of CAD. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that homocysteine, rs1801133, age, smoking, weight, body mass index (BMI), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], and hs-CRP were independent risk factors for CAD. The increased risk of CAD and severity of coronary lesions associated with rs1801133 in the Chinese Han population were attributed, at least partly, to high homocysteine levels. Hyperhomocysteinemia had a high predictive value for severe CAD or multiple vessel lesions.
