Title: 2024 Consensus Statement on Coronary Stenosis and Plaque Evaluation in CT Angiography From the Asian Society of Cardiovascular Imaging-Practical Tutorial (ASCI-PT).

Abstract: The Asian Society of Cardiovascular Imaging-Practical Tutorial (ASCI-PT) is an instructional initiative of the ASCI School designed to enhance educational standards. In 2021, the ASCI-PT was convened with the goal of formulating a consensus statement on the assessment of coronary stenosis and coronary plaque using coronary CT angiography (CCTA). Nineteen experts from four countries conducted thorough reviews of current guidelines and deliberated on eight key issues to refine the process and improve the clarity of reporting CCTA findings. The experts engaged in both online and on-site sessions to establish a unified agreement. This document presents a summary of the ASCI-PT 2021 deliberations and offers a comprehensive consensus statement on the evaluation of coronary stenosis and coronary plaque in CCTA.
