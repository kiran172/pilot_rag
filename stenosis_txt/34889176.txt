Title: First experiences with Myval Transcatheter Heart Valve System in the treatment of severe pulmonary regurgitation in native right ventricular outflow tract and conduit dysfunction.

Abstract: The rate of morbidity and mortality related to pulmonary regurgitation and pulmonary stenosis are big concerns after the surgery for CHD. Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation has been established as a less invasive technique compared to surgery with promising results according to long-term follow-up of the patients. There are only two approved valve options for percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation until now, which are Melody (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn, USA) and Sapien (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Ca, USA). Both valves have limitations and do not cover entire patient population. Therefore, the cardiologists need more options to improve outcomes with fewer complications in a such promising area. Herein, we present a case series applying for pulmonary position in conduits and native right ventricular outflow tract of a new transcatheter valve system Myval Â® which is designed for transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures. This is the first patient series in which the use of Myvalv in dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tracts is described, after surgical repair of CHD.
