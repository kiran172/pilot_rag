Title: Does Presenting Facility and Race Impact Outcomes and Management of Pyloric Stenosis?

Abstract: Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS) is a common surgical disease in infants. Traditionally, patients present with projectile emesis and severe dehydration with metabolic alkalosis. We looked to assess if patients presenting as a transfer vs directly to our facility as well as race affected patients' initial presentation and outcomes. We performed a retrospective analysis of 131 patients who presented to with a diagnosis of HPS from 2015 to 2021 assessing how transfer status and patient race affected presenting electrolyte levels and length of stay (LOS). We found no statistically significant difference in patients' presenting electrolyte levels and hospital LOS based on transfer status or patient race. We believe this reflects availability and widespread utility of ultrasound. We suggest that this could be used as a model for standardizing care to equalize outcomes in other pediatric diseases which currently show large disparities in care based on race and geographical location.
