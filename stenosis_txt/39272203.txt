Title: Single-branched stent-graft with on-table fenestration for the management of zone 2 landing TEVAR with an isolated left vertebral artery: a pilot study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is challenging to simultaneously conduct total endovascular repair and reconstruct the left subclavian artery (LSA) and isolated left vertebral artery (ILVA) in patients who had an ILVA and required zone 2 anchoring. This pilot study reported the initial application experience of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) with a proximal zone 2 landing for aortic arch reconstruction in patients with ILVA.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective consecutive single-center case series analysis, which involved four patients with ILVA who required zone 2 anchoring and received TEVAR combined with a single-branched stent graft and concomitant on-table fenestration between March 2021 and December 2022.
RESULTS: The postoperative follow-up period was 6-27 months, and no postoperative deaths or other primary complications occurred. There were no signs of a stroke or spinal cord ischemia, as well as no chest or back pain. The postoperative computed tomography angiography showed unobstructed ILVA and LSA, no stent stenosis and displacement, and no signs of endoleak.
CONCLUSION: The outcome suggested that this technique might be a feasible, safe, and alternative treatment for such patients. Further studies with larger samples and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm our findings.
