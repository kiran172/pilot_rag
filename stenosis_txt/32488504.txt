Title: Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices and the Aortic Valve: Interactions, Issues, and Surgical Therapy.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Concomitant valve disease is common in patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation. In this review, we characterize the epidemiology and management of aortic valve disease following CF-LVAD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Studies suggest that 20-40% of patients have mild or greater aortic insufficiency (AI) at baseline and that AI progresses following CF-LVAD implantation. AI, either pre-existing or de novo, can have deleterious effects on LVAD efficacy and clinical outcomes. Surgical methods to correct AI in patients supported with CF-LVAD include central oversewing of the aortic valve, complete closure of the aortic valve, patch closure of the ventriculo-aortic junction, or aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthesis. Transcatheter options have recently emerged as feasible modalities to address AI. CF-LVADs contribute to the progression of aortic insufficiency (AI) and its development de novo. Prompt recognition, assessment, and treatment are important. Aortic valve repairs and replacements, now including TAVR, are the primary surgical methods to correct AI.
