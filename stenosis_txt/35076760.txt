Title: Evaluation of intracranial artery stenosis using time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography: new wine in an old bottle.

Abstract: • TOF MRA is very important in the evaluation of cerebrovascular stenosis, and a novel evaluation system can further enhance its strengths.• This evaluation system is more accurate based on the fact that cerebral vascular stenosis alters hemodynamics and leads to different imaging presentations.
