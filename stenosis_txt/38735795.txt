Title: Off-label use of Lumen-apposing metal stents for treatment of short benign biliary strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic stenting is the mainstay of treatment for benign biliary strictures. There is a not-negligible rate of recurrence and stent migration. Lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) have a unique design with short length, large diameter and wide flanges which make them less prone to migration.
AIMS: To describe the intraluminal use of LAMS to treat short benign biliary strictures.
METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent bi-flanged LAMS placement for benign biliary strictures, in approximately 6 years, were retrospectively included. Primary outcomes were technical and clinical success; secondary outcomes were number of endoscopic procedures, adverse events evaluation and stricture recurrence during follow-up.
RESULTS: Seventy patients (35 male, mean age 67) were enrolled; bilio-enteric anastomotic stricture was the most common etiology. Technical and clinical success were 100 % and 85.7 %, respectively. Patients with post-surgical stricture had a higher success rate than patients with non-surgical stricture or with bilio-enteric anastomotic stricture (90.4 %, 86.3 % and 81.4 %, respectively). Adverse events were 12/70 (17.1 %): stent migration was the most frequent (8/70, 11.4 %). Stricture recurrence was found in 10/54 patients (18.5 %).
CONCLUSION: LAMS placement could be safe and effective treatment for short benign biliary strictures in patients in which a significant caliber disproportion between stricture and the duct above was revealed.
