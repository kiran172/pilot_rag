Title: Is serum Osteopontin a predictor of carotid atherosclerosis severity among prevalent hemodialysis patients?

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients are among the highest population risk for accelerated atherosclerosis. Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein that is increased in chronic kidney disease that may play a role in vascular remodelling and intimal proliferation.
AIM: To assess the relation between OPN levels and severity of carotid atherosclerosis among prevalent HD patients.
METHODS: Eighty chronic HD patients underwent serum OPN levels assessment and were further classified into 3 subgroups according to the OPN tertiles' levels; sub-group 1 (lower tertile) subgroup 2 (middle tertile) and sub-group 3 (upper tertile), together with the carotid duplex and Transthoracic Doppler Echocardiography examination.
RESULTS: The mean carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was 0.89Â±0.14mm. Out of the studied group, 50 (62.5%) patients had atheromatous plaques and 15 patients (18.8%). had significant stenosis. The 3rd group with the upper OPN tertile (78-270ng/dl) had the highest incidence of atherosclerosis. A significant correlation between the OPN levels and the CIMT (r=0.533, p=0.001). OPN values detect atherosclerosis with diagnostic sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 69%, positive predictive value (PPV) 73%, negative predictive value (NPV) 65% with area under the curve (AUC) 0.804 (95% CI: 0.711-0.897). Serum OPN detect carotid stenosis with sensitivity of 66%, specificity of 81%, PPV 45%, NPV 91% with AUC=0.769 and detect the presence of carotid atheroma with sensitivity 70%, specificity 66.67%, PPV 77.8%, NPV 57.1% and AUC=0.767 (p-value<0.001). Moreover, serum levels of OPN were significantly positively correlated with grade of diastolic dysfunction (r=0.312, p=0.005), E/A ratio (r=0.293, p=0.008) and inversely correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (r=-0.304, p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum Osteopontin is of clinical value as a predictor biomarker of the severity of carotid atherosclerosis, presence of atheroma and carotid stenosis with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in chronic hemodialysis patients. Increased Osteopontin level is associated with left ventricular diastolic and systolic dysfunction in those patients.
