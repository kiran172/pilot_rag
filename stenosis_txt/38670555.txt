Title: Safety and Effectiveness of Abre Self-Expanding Venous Stent for Treatment of Superior Vena Cava Syndrome.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that results from partial or complete SVC obstruction. Endovascular SVC stenting is an effective treatment for SVC syndrome with rapid clinical efficacy and low risk of complications. In this study, we assess the technical and clinical outcomes of a cohort of patients with SVC syndrome treated with the AbreTM self-expanding venous stent (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
METHODS: An institutional database was used to retrospectively identify patients with SVC syndrome treated with AbreTM venous self-expanding stent placement between 2021-2023. Patient demographic data, technical outcomes, treatment effectiveness, and adverse events were obtained from the electronic medical record. Nineteen patients (mean age 58.6) were included in the study. Thirteen interventions were performed for malignant compression of the SVC, 5 for central venous catheter-related SVC stenosis, and 1 for HD fistula-related SVC stenosis refractory to angioplasty.
RESULTS: Primary patency was achieved in 93% of patients (17/19). Two patients (7%) required re-intervention with thrombolysis and angioplasty within 30 days post-stenting. Mean duration of clinical and imaging follow-up were 228.7 ± 52.7 and 258.7 ± 62.1 days, respectively. All patients with clinical follow-up experienced significant improvement in clinical symptoms post-intervention. No stent related complications were identified post-intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SVC syndrome with the AbreTM self-expanding venous stent has high rates of technical and clinical success. No complications related to stent placement were identified in this study.
