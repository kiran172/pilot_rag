Title: Atypical Presentation of Tertiary Syphilis.

Abstract: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection characterized by multiple stages. Cardiovascular involvement is a manifestation of tertiary syphilis, occurring between 10 and 40 years after the primary infection. The authors present a case of atypical presentation of tertiary syphilis in a 49-year-old male patient who was admitted to the hospital with bilateral transient loss of vision. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging revealed thoracic aortitis with carotid occlusion, coronary artery stenosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and multiple intracardiac thrombi. A postmortem autopsy revealed positive laboratory results for syphilis, which was corroborated by medical autopsy findings of syphilitic aortitis.
