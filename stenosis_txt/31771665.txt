Title: Epidemiological analysis of neonatal CHD near Petrochemical Complex.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence, types, and characteristics of CHD in all live births delivered in Jinshan Hospital from 1 January, 2016 to 31 December, 2017, and to analyse the correlation between CHD and the distance between maternal residence and Shanghai Petrochemical Complex.
METHODS: All live births, delivered in Jinshan Hospital in 2016 and 2017, have received CHD screening and neonatal follow-up after delivery. For those both positive for CHD screening and negative for CHD screening but with heart murmur found during physical examination on neonatal follow-up after delivery, echocardiography was performed to confirm CHD diagnosis. All maternal residential addresses have been grouped for analysis according to the distance between maternal residence and Shanghai Petrochemical Complex.
RESULTS: There were 5544 live births in total, and a total of 79 children with CHD were confirmed by CHD screening and echocardiography, of which the types of diseases with high incidence, in descending order of incidence, are atrial septal defect (48/79), ventricular septal defect (25/79), patent ductus arteriosus (21/79), and pulmonary artery stenosis (9/79). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of CHD among the groups divided by the distance between maternal residence and Shanghai Petrochemical Complex. The incidence of neonatal CHD near Shanghai Petrochemical Complex is 1.42%.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the children with CHD can be screened out through CHD screening and physical examination in neonatal period and early infancy stage. The distance between maternal residence and Shanghai Petrochemical Complex has no significant direct effect on the incidence of CHD in neonates near Shanghai Petrochemical Complex.
