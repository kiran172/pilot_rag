Title: A Retrospective Observational Study to Evaluate Adjacent Segmental Degenerative Change with the Dynesys-Transition-Optima Instrumentation System.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the impact of hybrid dynamic stabilization using the Dynesys-Transition-Optima (DTO) system on adjacent segment disease (ASD) in lumbar spinal stenosis patients with spondylolisthesis.
METHODS: From 2012 to 2020, 115 patients underwent DTO stabilization at a single center by a single neurosurgeon. After exclusions for lack of specific stabilization and incomplete data, 31 patients were analyzed. Follow-up was conducted at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively, assessing disc height, listhesis distance, and angular motion changes at L2-L3, L3-L4, and L5-S1.
RESULTS: L3-L4 segment (the index level), demonstrated a delayed increase in listhesis distance, contrasting with earlier changes in other segments. At two years, L3-L4 exhibited less increase in listhesis distance and less disc height reduction compared to L2-L3 and L5-S1. Notably, the L3-L4 segment showed a significant reduction in angular motion change over two years.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, while ASD was not significantly prevented, the study indicates minor and delayed degeneration at the index level. The L3-L4 segment experienced reduced angular change in motion, suggesting a potential benefit of DTO in stabilizing this specific segment.
