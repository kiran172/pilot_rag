Title: Arachnoid Granulation Causing Unilateral Pulsatile Tinnitus Treated With Dural Venous Sinus Stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Large arachnoid granulations that protrude into dural venous sinuses and partially obstruct outflow are an underappreciated etiology of pulsatile tinnitus (PT). Endovascular dural venous sinus stenting is thought to diminish turbulent venous outflow and may relieve obstruction caused by arachnoid granulations.
METHODS: Four patients at two institutions were evaluated for unilateral PT. Magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography revealed moderate-to-severe stenoses from large arachnoid granulations within the implicated transverse sinus. All patients underwent venous manometry and endovascular sinus stenting.
RESULTS: All patients experienced immediate and complete remission of their PT. Stenoses were relieved by a mean of 93% by Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease criteria. There were no procedural or periprocedural complications. All patients continued to report complete symptom resolution at a mean of 8-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: PT from arachnoid granulations are an underappreciated pathomechanism. Endovascular dural venous sinus stenting is an effective intervention for treating unilateral PT secondary to large arachnoid granulation.
