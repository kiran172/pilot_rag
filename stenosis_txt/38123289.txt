Title: Interventional Radiology Approaches for Managing Postpancreatic Transplant Complications and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in metabolic disturbances and long-term complications. While subcutaneous insulin remains the primary approach for achieving normoglycemia, pancreatic transplantation has emerged as an effective intervention for long-standing T1DM, providing insulin independence and normalized glycosylated hemoglobin levels. However, complications associated with pancreatic transplantation are frequent, necessitating thorough evaluation using diverse imaging modalities. This manuscript presents an overview of complications encountered with pancreatic transplantation, including vascular complications such as arterial and venous graft thrombosis, vessel stenosis, pseudoaneurysm, arterio-enteric fistula, and arteriovenous malformations. Additionally, the manuscript discusses other associated complications such as pancreatitis, pseudocyst formation, fistulas, pseudo-thrombosis of the iliac vein, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, and fluid collections. The integration of various imaging modalities plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing these complications, with interventional radiologists assuming a vital role in employing image-guided procedures. Moreover, the manuscript explores pancreatic islet cell transplantation as a promising cellular-based therapy for T1DM, offering stable long-term glycemic control and decreased reliance on exogenous insulin in a significant proportion of recipients. This minimally invasive procedure involves the image-guided transcatheter infusion of islet cells obtained from deceased donors into the recipient's liver. The importance of interventional radiologists in managing complications related to pancreatic transplantation is underscored, with endovascular or image-guided approaches being utilized to address the diverse spectrum of encountered complications. Furthermore, the potential of islet cell transplantation as a minimally invasive alternative to traditional pancreatic transplantation is emphasized, as it offers the prospect of preventing many associated complications.
