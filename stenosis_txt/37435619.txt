Title: Transverse Venous Sinus Stenosis in Patients With Nasal Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak and Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous nasal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are frequently linked to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The objectives of our study were: (1) to determine the rate of transverse venous sinus stenosis (TVSS) in patients with spontaneous nasal CSF leak and in patients with IIH without CSF (controls), and (2) to study the correlation between spontaneous nasal CSF leak and brain imaging features.
STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter retrospective case-control study.
SETTING: Six French tertiary hospitals.
METHODS: Patients with spontaneous nasal CSF leaks and patients with IIH without nasal CSF leaks (controls) were included. The transverse venous sinus patency was analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging to identify possible stenosis or hypoplasia.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with spontaneous nasal CSF leaks and 32 controls were included. TVSS was significantly more frequent in patients with spontaneous nasal CSF leaks than in controls (p = .029). Univariate analysis indicated that TVSS (odds ratio, OR: 4.2; 95% confidence interval, CI [1.352-14.915]; p = .017) and arachnoid granulations (OR: 3; 95% CI [1.065-8.994]; p = .042) were risk factors for spontaneous nasal CSF leak. In multivariate analysis, TVSS and arachnoid granulations were independent risk factors of nasal CSF leak (OR: 5.577, 95% CI [1.485-25.837], p = .016; and OR: 4.35, 95% CI [1.234-17.756], p = .029, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This multicenter case-control study shows that TVSS is an independent risk factor for CSF leak in patients with IIH. Stenosis management by interventional radiology may be proposed postoperatively to increase the success of IIH surgical treatment or preoperatively to reduce the need for surgery.
