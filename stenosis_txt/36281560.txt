Title: The Effect of Cervical and Lumbar Decompression Surgery for Spinal Stenosis on Erectile Dysfunction.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of erectile dysfunction and evaluate the effects of decompressive surgery on erectile dysfunction in cervical spinal stenosis and lumbar canal stenosis patients.
METHODS: This observational, prospective analysis enrolled patients aged 18-80 with cervical spinal stenosis and/or lumbar canal stenosis that underwent respective decompressive surgery. The IIEF-5 questionnaire was administered preoperatively, and at 6- and 12-months postoperatively to assess erectile dysfunction severity. The EPIC database was queried to determine any postoperative complications and document prominent erectile dysfunction risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 79 patients included in the analysis, 42 (53.2%) completed the IIEF-5 at 6 months, and 62 (78.5%) completed it at 12 months. Eighteen had cervical stenosis only, 54 had lumbar stenosis only, and 7 had both. 72% (18/25) of cervical stenosis patients and 83.6% (51/61) of lumbar stenosis patients had erectile dysfunction preoperatively according to IIEF-5 responses. The average preoperative IIEF-5 score indicated significant presence of erectile dysfunction for both the cervical and lumbar stenosis groups. No significant differences were identified in IIEF-5 score deltas from pre- to both postoperative periods. The presence of erectile dysfunction in both the cervical and lumbar stenosis groups was not significantly associated with the presence of any documented risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest no significant improvement in overall erectile function postoperatively for patients with preoperative erectile dysfunction. This is important to address during patient counseling for decompression surgery candidates with cervical spinal stenosis and/or lumbar canal stenosis to manage expectations.
