Title: Association of aortic valve calcium with dementia and stroke: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Calcific aortic valve disease is associated with increased thrombin formation, platelet activation, decreased fibrinolysis, and subclinical brain infarcts. We examined the long-term association of aortic valve calcification (AVC) with newly diagnosed dementia and incident stroke in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).
METHODS: AVC was measured using non-contrast cardiac CT at Visit 1. We examined AVC as a continuous (log-transformed) and categorical variable (0, 1-99, 100-299, ≥300). Newly diagnosed dementia was adjudicated using International Classification of Disease codes. Stroke was adjudicated from medical records. We calculated absolute event rates (per 1000 person-years) and multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards ratios (HR).
RESULTS: Overall, 6812 participants had AVC quantified with a mean age of 62.1 years old, 52.9 % were women, and the median 10-year estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk was 13.5 %. Participants with AVC >0 were older and less likely to be women compared to those with AVC=0. Over a median 16-year follow-up, there were 535 cases of dementia and 376 cases of stroke. The absolute risk of newly diagnosed dementia increased in a stepwise pattern with higher AVC scores, and stroke increased in a logarithmic pattern. In multivariable analyses, AVC was significantly associated with newly diagnosed dementia as a log-transformed continuous variable (HR 1.09; 95 % CI 1.04-1.14) and persons with AVC ≥300 had nearly a two-fold higher risk (HR 1.77; 95 % CI 1.14-2.76) compared to those with AVC=0. AVC was associated with an increased risk of stroke after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, but not after adjustment for ASCVD risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: After multivariable adjustment, AVC >0 was significantly associated with an increased risk of newly diagnosed dementia, but not incident stroke. This suggests that AVC may be an important risk factor for the long-term risk of dementia beyond traditional ASCVD risk factors.
