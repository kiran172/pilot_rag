Title: Emerging transcatheter heart valve technologies for severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the standard of care for selected patients with severe aortic stenosis, irrespective of the surgical risk. Over the last two decades of TAVI practice, multiple limitations were identified. In addition, the extension of TAVI into a wider patient spectrum created new challenges.
AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of emerging transcatheter heart valves (THVs) beyond the approved contemporary THVs for the treatment of aortic stenosis.
EXPERT OPINION: The incidence of degenerative aortic stenosis is expected to increase with more aging of the population. Therefore, TAVI needs to meet this increase in the number of patients indicated for aortic valve replacement alongside a wide and complex anatomical variability. An increasing number of Aortic THVs are available in the market. This includes upgraded iterations of contemporary devices and innovative devices developed by emerging manufacturers. The new devices aim for the reduction or elimination of undesirable outcomes like paravalvular leakage and conduction disturbances requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. Alternatively, emerging THVs should provide feasibility regarding yet unproven TAVI indications like Bicuspid aortic valve, aortic regurgitation, or very large anatomy. Furthermore, some of the emerging THVs are designed to tackle the long-term durability issue of biological valves.
