Title: Case report: Synergetic effect of ischaemia and increased vagal tone inducing ventricular fibrillation in a patient with Brugada syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome (BS) is a hereditary channelopathy associated with syncope, malignant ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. Right ventricular ischaemia and BS have similar underlying substrates precipitating ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VF).
CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old woman with BS and a stenosis on the proximal right coronary artery received several subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks due to VF during an episode of extreme nausea with vomiting.
DISCUSSION: This case report emphasizes on the synergetic effect of mild ischaemia and increased vagal tone on the substrate responsible for BS to create pathophysiological changes precipitating VF.
