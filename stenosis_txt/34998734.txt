Title: Surgical Explantation of a Lotus Transcatheter Aortic Valve.

Abstract: The Lotus (Boston Scientific) valve stood out from alternative transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) valves because of its ability to recapture and redeploy if initial placement was unsatisfactory. With the exponential rise in TAVR, there have been numerous reports of TAVR valve explantation. A 79-year-old man with nonrheumatic aortic valve stenosis who had undergone TAVR with a Lotus valve 12 months earlier presented for surgical excision for early valve failure. The Food and Drug Administration stated that already implanted Lotus valves are not a safety issue; however, cases of valve degeneration will occur, necessitating future valve explantation.
