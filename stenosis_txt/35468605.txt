Title: Ureteral Stenosis and Fistula after Kidney Transplantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Ureteral complications after kidney transplantation are frequent and may have a negative impact on morbidity and graft function. Treatment modalities include conservative, endourological, and surgical techniques, with variable outcomes. The purpose of this study was to report the incidence, characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of ureteral complications at our center.
METHODS: Retrospective study of kidney transplants performed at our unit between 2015 and 2020, analyzing incidence, characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of ureteral stenoses and fistulas.
RESULTS: Of 648 kidney transplants, we present 3.24% stenosis and 2.16% ureteral fistulas, with a mean time from transplantation of 101.4 and 24.4 days, respectively. Primary treatment was open surgical repair in 52.4% stenosis and 100% fistulas, with a success rate of 90.9% and 71.4%, respectively. Anterograde balloon dilatations were performed in 33.3% of stenosis with 40% success. Three patients required surgery as a secondary approach with 100% success. Major complications (Clavien-Dindo III) were observed in 18.5% following surgical repair. After a mean follow-up of 31.1 ± 20.9 months, we observe 88.6% of functioning grafts. We found no significant differences in graft survival between patients with or without ureteral complications (p 0.948).
CONCLUSION: Surgical repair of ureteral complications offers satisfactory results with low associated morbidity. Endourological techniques are less effective and should be reserved for selected cases. With adequate management, there is no impact on graft survival.
