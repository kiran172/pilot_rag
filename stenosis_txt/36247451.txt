Title: Case report: Sudden cardiorespiratory collapse in a healthy male after coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination at a vaccination center.

Abstract: Since 2020, new vaccines were developed to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccination is important in preventing mortality and achieving herd immunity. However, due to vast vaccination, fatal adverse events could be seen. We report a case of a previously healthy, young male who had a cardiopulmonary arrest 2 min after receiving the Oxford- AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) COVID-19 vaccination. After targeted temperature management, a coronary angiogram was performed after neurological recovery and showed severe stenosis at the proximal left anterior descending artery. Stenting was done and he was discharge. No similar case of sudden cardiorespiratory collapse immediately after COVID-19 vaccination has been reported. Our patient did not have any effort-related angina or dyspnea on exertion before this event. The sudden cardiorespiratory collapse was probably related to underlying coronary artery disease, complicated with a vasovagal event. We stress the importance of coronary angiography in out of hospital cardiac arrest patients after neurological recovery. In the era of COVID-19 vaccination, even though fatal adverse events following immunization are rare, heightened awareness of severe side effects needing medical attention is very important.
