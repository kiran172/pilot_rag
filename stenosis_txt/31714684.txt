Title: Outcome of patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting and severe calcific aortic stenosis receiving transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on early safety at 30 days and 1-year mortality in patients receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUND: The use of TAVR in patients with previous CABG suffering from severe aortic stenosis has increased in the last years.
METHODS: Consecutive TAVR patients were stratified according to previous CABG versus no previous cardiac surgery (control). All-cause 1-year mortality and early safety at 30 days were evaluated.
RESULTS: In the unmatched cohort and compared to control (n = 2,364), CABG (n = 260) were younger, more often male and suffered more often from comorbidities leading to an increased STS-score (p < .001). The rate of early safety events at 30 days was comparable between CABG and control (21.2% vs. 24.6%, p = .22) with a higher mortality in CABG (9.6% vs. 5.3%, p = .005). All-cause 1-year mortality was higher in CABG compared to controls (HR 1.51 [95%-CI 1.15-1.97], p = .003). Applying Cox regression analysis, both 30-day (HR 1.57 [95%-CI 0.97-2.53], p = .067) and all-cause 1-year mortality (HR 1.24 [95%-CI 0.91-1.70], p = .174) were not significantly different between groups. After propensity-score matching, the rate of early safety events at 30 days was lower in CABG compared to controls (21.6% vs. 31.7%, p = .02). Thirty-day (9.1% vs. 7.7%, p = .596) and all-cause 1-year mortality (24.0% vs. 23.1%, p = .520, HR 1.14 [95%-CI 0.77-1.69], p = .520) were not different between groups.
CONCLUSION: In patients receiving TAVR, previous CABG was not associated with an increase in periprocedural complications and all-cause 1-year mortality when adjusted for other comorbidities.
