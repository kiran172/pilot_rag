Title: Two simple modifications can potentially change the future of proximal hypospadias surgery. Our series and a review of the literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To draw a hint towards two simple modifications that could potentially decrease the complication rate.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: It was a single center, single operator and retrospective study. All patients with severe hypospadias operated according to koyanagi with or without modifications were presented. The surgical technique was described. Complications like fistula, stenosis, dehiscence and urethral diverticulum were studied.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Nineteen patients were included and presented in a chronological manner. The first four patients were operated according to the original koyanagi technique. The next 15 patients were operated according to koyanagi and the urethroplasty was covered by a tunica vaginalis flap. In 10 of them, glanduloplasty was done primarily and in the last 5 patients, glanduloplasty was done as a secondary procedure. The complication rates were 100% in the original koyanagi group, and 0% in the subset were glanduoplasty was deferred.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematically covering the urethroplasty with a tunica vaginalis flap and deferring the glanuloplasty might ameliorate the results of the koyanagi technique.
