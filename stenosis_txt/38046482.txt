Title: Management of Brachioradial Pruritus With Cervical Epidural Steroid Injection: A Case Report.

Abstract: Brachioradial pruritus (BRP) is a neuropathic dysesthesia described as itching over the dorsolateral forearm.Â The etiology of BRP has not been fully identified but is hypothesized to be multifactorial, including sun exposure and cervical spine disease. Management of BRP is challenging, and conservative measures often fail to provide notable improvement. We present a case of a 71-year-old woman with BRP refractory to topical and oral treatment, with radiographic evidence of cervical spinal canal and neuroforaminal stenosis. Two rounds of cervical epidural steroid injections (CESI) were performed at the C6-C7 epidural space resulting in a marked improvement of symptoms. With this case report, we would like to add to the current scientific knowledge of BRP management and the potential utilization of CESIs to provide symptomatic relief to patients suffering from refractory pruritus.
