Title: Left cervical and circumflex aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery arising from a Kommerell diverticulum: A rare vascular ring.

Abstract: We report a rare case of vascular ring due to a left cervical circumflex aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery arising from a Kommerell diverticulum. This is a very rare case of vascular ring in a newborn with stridor and stenosis of the left pulmonary artery. A cardiac catheterization and an angio-computed tomography scan were helpful to clarify the diagnosis. The surgical correction was performed with division of the arterial duct, reimplantation of the right subclavian artery, aortic and tracheal suspension, and pulmonary arterial plasty. The patient was asymptomatic at discharge and 1-year follow-up.
