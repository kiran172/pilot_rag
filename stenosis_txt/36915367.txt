Title: A Half-Century Dialysis Survivor: Clinical and Autopsy Findings.

Abstract: A man in his 20s initiated intermittent peritoneal dialysis in the late 1960s. He subsequently transitioned to hemodialysis and survived for more than 50 years, spanning low-flux and high-flux hemodialysis eras. He underwent surgery for cervical and lumbar spinal canal stenosis after 30 and 35 years, respectively, and both surgeries revealed similar degrees of severe amyloid deposition. At autopsy, significant improvement was seen in lumbar amyloid deposition. During the previous 25 years, serum β2 microglobulin levels had decreased from 40 mg/L and been maintained at 20 mg/L. This case indicates that advances in dialysis therapy aimed at lowering β2 microglobulin concentrations have reduced highly deposited amyloid.
