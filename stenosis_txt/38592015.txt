Title: Fubuki XF Long Sheath guide catheter use in neuroendovascular procedures: Institutional experience in 60 cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment devices require compatible guide catheters to navigate complex vessels and anatomy. The Fubuki XF Long Sheath guide catheter (Fubuki XF) was developed with a 0.090-inch internal diameter with hydrophilic coating, an atraumatic rounded tip, and enhanced trackability and support with gradual shaft transition zones.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively maintained database of neuroendovascular patients treated using Fubuki XF at our center (July 2022─May 2023). Baseline/procedural characteristics were collected. Outcomes of interest included technical success (procedure completion with Fubuki XF without alternative guide catheter use) and peri-procedural complications.
RESULTS: This study included 60 patients (43.3% [26/60] female; mean age: 69.6 ± 9.7) presenting with stenosis (45.0% [27/60]), unruptured aneurysms (31.7% [19/60]), ruptured aneurysm (1.7% [1/60]), arteriovenous fistula (5.0% [3/60]), arteriovenous malformation (3.3% [2/60]), chronic subdural hematoma (3.3% [2/60]), stroke/emboli (6.7% [4/60]), vasospasm (1.7% [1/60]), or carotid web (5.0% [1/60]). Fubuki XF was used to deliver endovascular treatment devices for stenting (43.3% [26/60]), flow diversion (23.3% [14/60]), embolization (11.7% [7/60]), coiling (10.0% [6/60]), balloon angioplasty (10.0% [6/60]), and mechanical thrombectomy (1.7% [1/60]). The Fubuki XF tip was placed in the internal carotid artery in 38.3% (23/60) of cases. Technical success was achieved in all cases. One V1 non-flow-limiting dissection (not related to Fubuki XF) and one failed closure occurred (1.7% [1/60] each). No iatrogenic strokes or intraprocedural ruptures occurred.
CONCLUSION: We used Fubuki XF to safely and effectively deliver a variety of compatible neuroendovascular devices. Fubuki XF was stable in all cases and locations, and there were no device-related complications or dissections.
