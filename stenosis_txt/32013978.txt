Title: Short-term outcomes of laparoscopic intersphincteric resection with intraoperative radiotherapy using low-energy X-rays for primary locally advanced low rectal cancer: a single center experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Even with the augmentative application of anal-preservation surgery in low rectal cancer, the role and indications of laparoscopic intersphincteric resection (Lap ISR) are still under debate, especially for T3 or node-positive (T3N0M0, T1-3N+M0) cancer, mainly due to the oncological safety and functional outcomes. INTRABEAM (Carl Zeiss, Germany) intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) using low-energy X-rays features in accurate irradiation, less exposure, and reduced complications. Taking advantages of Lap ISR and INTRABEAM IORT, this innovative approach aims to increase the probability of the anal preservation with acceptable postoperative outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From December 2015 to August 2019, we retrospectively analyzed the short-term outcomes of 12 patients evaluated preoperatively with T3 or node-positive (T3N0M0, T1-3N+M0) primary locally advanced low rectal cancer. They all had received Lap ISR and INTRABEAM IORT with a dose of 16-18 Gy applied by an applicator through the anus (natural orifice). Then, with no pre- or postoperative radiotherapy given, the patients were suggested to receive 6-8 cycles of the XELOX chemotherapy regimen (oxaliplatin, 130 mg/m2 and capecitabine, 1000 mg/m2).
RESULTS: All patients achieved R0 resection. The median radiation time was 27 min and 15 s, and the mean radiative dose was 17.3 Gy (range 16-18 Gy). The median follow-up time was 18.5 months (range 3-45 months). Two patients experienced local recurrence. Two male patients experienced anastomotic stenosis. Furthermore, one of them experienced perianal abscess and the other one experienced pulmonary metastasis after refusing to receive chemotherapy. One female patient with internal anal sphincter invasion experienced distant metastases to the liver and gluteus maximus muscle 35 months after IORT. No acute radiation injuries or symptoms were observed. Although they experienced a reduction in anal function, every patient was satisfied with the postoperative outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients evaluated preoperatively with T3 or node-positive (T3N0M0, T1-3N+M0) primary locally advanced low rectal cancer, Lap ISR with INTRABEAM IORT may be a safe and feasible approach for anal preservation without compromising oncological outcomes.
