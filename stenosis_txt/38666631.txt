Title: Association Between Acquired Punctal Stenosis and Ocular Surface Disease: the Egg and the Chicken Story.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study explores the relationship between acquired punctal stenosis (PS) and ocular surface disease (OSD), assessing causal mechanisms and clinical impacts, utilizing a combination of a comprehensive literature review and a detailed analysis of a patient cohort from a tertiary care center.
METHODS: Data from 213 PS patients at Sheba Medical Center were retrospectively analyzed, evaluating various OSD symptoms and treatment effectiveness through standardized clinical assessments and statistical tests.
RESULTS: Predominantly older and female, many patients exhibited bilateral PS. OSD symptoms were found in 35.2% of all patients. Treatments like punctoplasty with stents significantly alleviated symptoms. Significant associations between treatment modalities and symptom improvement were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: PS and OSD have acomplex, bidirectional relationship that complicates treatment outcomes. This study underscores the need for thorough diagnostic approaches and personalized treatments to improve PS management. Further research is essential to deepen understanding of PS-OSD interactions and develop effective therapies.
