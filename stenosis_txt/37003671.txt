Title: Novel PET Applications and Radiotracers for Imaging Cardiovascular Pathophysiology.

Abstract: PET allows the assessment of cardiovascular pathophysiology across a wide range of cardiovascular conditions. By imaging processes directly involved in disease progression and adverse events, such as inflammation and developing calcifications (microcalcifications), PET can not only enhance our understanding of cardiovascular disease, but also, as shown for 18F-sodium fluoride, has the potential to predict hard endpoints. In this review, the recent advances in disease activity assessment with cardiovascular PET, which provide hope that this promising technology could be leveraged in the clinical setting, shall be discussed.
