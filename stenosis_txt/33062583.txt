Title: Brown tumor complicating end-stage kidney disease.

Abstract: Longstanding, severe hyperparathyroidism (HPT) can lead to the formation of "brown tumors". A brown tumor is a radiolucent bone lesion that is locally destructive; it is not a neoplasm, but rather a stromal mass consisting of fibrous tissue, poorly mineralized woven bone, and supporting vasculature. These tumors are a rare complication of advanced primary or secondary HPT. We present a young female with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis with uncontrolled secondary HPT (SHPT). The patient presented with progressive lower extremity weakness and back pain. CT imaging showed multiple lytic bone lesions involving several ribs and the spine. Subsequent MRI imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine confirmed expansile bone lesions consistent with brown tumors. One mass protruded into the spinal canal causing severe stenosis at T3 with underlying cord edema. The other lesion at T12 caused only moderate spinal canal stenosis. Our patient underwent urgent neurosurgical resection of the tumor at T3 followed by subtotal parathyroidectomy (PTX).
