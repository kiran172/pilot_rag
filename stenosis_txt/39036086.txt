Title: Tissue-engineered tracheal implants: Advancements, challenges, and clinical considerations.

Abstract: Restoration of extensive tracheal damage remains a significant challenge in respiratory medicine, particularly in instances stemming from conditions like infection, congenital anomalies, or stenosis. The trachea, an essential element of the lower respiratory tract, constitutes a fibrocartilaginous tube spanning approximately 10-12 cm in length. It is characterized by 18 ± 2 tracheal cartilages distributed anterolaterally with the dynamic trachealis muscle located posteriorly. While tracheotomy is a common approach for patients with short-length defects, situations requiring replacement arise when the extent of lesion exceeds 1/2 of the length in adults (or 1/3 in children). Tissue engineering (TE) holds promise in developing biocompatible airway grafts for addressing challenges in tracheal regeneration. Despite the potential, the extensive clinical application of tissue-engineered tracheal substitutes encounters obstacles, including insufficient revascularization, inadequate re-epithelialization, suboptimal mechanical properties, and insufficient durability. These limitations have led to limited success in implementing tissue-engineered tracheal implants in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of historical attempts and lessons learned in the field of tracheal TE, contextualizing the clinical prerequisites and vital criteria for effective tracheal grafts. The manufacturing approaches employed in TE, along with the clinical application of both tissue-engineered and non-tissue-engineered approaches for tracheal reconstruction, are discussed in detail. By offering a holistic view on TE substitutes and their implications for the clinical management of long-segment tracheal lesions, this review aims to contribute to the understanding and advancement of strategies in this critical area of respiratory medicine.
