Title: Carotid artery screening in high risk asymptomatic individuals: outcomes of 3000 carotid screening.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The primary aims of the study to evaluate the efficacy of carotid screening tests to identify asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis among high-risk patients and early prevention of stroke.
BACKGROUND: The estimated prevalence of asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis (â‰¥70%) in the general adult population ranges up to 3.1%. However, the prevalence is higher in comorbid individuals. This makes it important to perform screening testing for early diagnosis and treatment in predetermined high-risk patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 3000 selected patients screened during March 2017 and September 2018 at the most populated family health center. Participants selected among registered individuals who have at least one of the risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and smoking. All the participants were asymptomatic and above the age of 55. Bilateral carotid artery screening performed by Duplex Ultrasonography (DUSG) at the first call and one year later. Patients with severe carotid and/or coronary artery stenosis treated by surgical revascularization or stent implantation in the light of the latest guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Carotid screening among high-risk asymptomatic individuals is of great importance to identify severe carotid artery as well as coronary artery stenosis. Patient education during screening may play a crucial role in preventing the disease.
