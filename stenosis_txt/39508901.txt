Title: Retinal vasculature changes in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the retinal vasculature in patient with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and to highlight association between ICA stenosis severity and retinal vasculature changes.
METHODS: Seventy-five subjects were included in this prospective study. Twenty-five healthy subjects were included in the Group 1, 25 subjects with 1-49% ICA stenosis were included in the Group 2, and 25 subjects with 50-69% ICA stenosis were included in the Group 3. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), and anterior and posterior segment examinations were performed. Macular superficial and deep capillary density, optic nerve head capillary density, and choroidal thickness data were measured using optic coherence tomography angiography.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the three groups regarding superficial vascular density, deep vascular density, vascular density of radial peripapillary capillary and choroid thickness (p < 0.05 for all). Mean parafoveal and perifoveal area vascular density of the superficial capillary plexus was significantly lower in the Group 3 than Group 1 (p < 0.05 for all). Mean whole area vascular density of the deep capillary plexus was significantly lower in Group 3 than both groups (p < 0.05 for all). Mean parafoveal area vascular density of the deep capillary plexus was significantly lower in the Group 3 than Group 1 (p < 0.05). Mean subfoveal choroid thickness in group 3 was significantly lower in the Group 3 than both groups (p < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSION: Compared to healthy controls, patients with moderate ICA stenosis revealed decreased density of superficial, deep and radial peripapillary capillary vasculature and subfoveal choroidal thickness.
