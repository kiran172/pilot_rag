Title: Tremor in triventricular hydrocephalus secondary to an aqueductal web with stenosis and response to third ventricular ventriculostomy.

Abstract: We demonstrate a case report of triventricular hydrocephalus due to an aqueductal web and stenosis which presented itself clinically solely with bilateral hand tremors in an adolescent male. The patient underwent Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and the subsequent improvement in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow resulted in complete resolution of his tremor. We propose a mechanism involving compression of the rubrospinal tract (or stretching of the frontal premotor area) and advise cranial imaging in cases of hand tremor to exclude this as a potential cause. Neurosurgical review and potential CSF diversion if triventriclar hydrocephalus is established should be considered as positive clinical outcome can be achieved.
