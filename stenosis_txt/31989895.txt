Title: Videofluoroscopic and Manometric Evaluation of Oropharyngeal and Esophageal Motility Disorders.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Esophageal motility studies are performed in patients who have dysphagia that is not explained by stenosis. Diagnosis can be challenging and requires expertise in the interpretation of tests and symptoms.
AIMS: Our aim is to investigate the diagnostic value of videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) in combination with esophageal manometry.
STUDY DESIGN: This study has a prospective study design.
METHODS: 73 patients with dysphagia underwent videofluoroscopy in a standing position. Each subject swallowed barium boluses and findings were correlated with manometry findings.
RESULTS: The study cohort was categorized into five groups according to their disease as achalasia (31.1%), presbyesophagus (4.1%), scleroderma (5.5%), neurogenic dysphagia (6.8%), and other diseases (54.4%), which included gastroesophageal reflux, diffuse esophageal spasm, cricopharyngeal achalasia, and diseases with nonspecific VFSS patterns. When evaluating VFSS, the perfect agreement was observed between two observers in the final diagnosis. (kappa: 0.91, p<0,001).
CONCLUSION: Although it does not replace manometry, VFSS is important as an additional useful imaging method in EMDs.
