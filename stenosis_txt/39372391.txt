Title: Successful surgical repair of isolated supra-cardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) with venous confluence stenosis using dual anastomosis: a case report from Syria.

Abstract: We present the case of a 7-month-old female infant with a history of recurrent respiratory infections and symptoms of respiratory distress during feeding. Echocardiography isolated revealed supracardiac-type total anomalous pulmonary venous connection with a large ostium secundum atrial septal defect and severe pulmonary hypertension. Computed tomographic angiography confirmed the diagnosis and identified stenosis at the level of the venous confluence. The surgical intervention involved a novel approach using dual anastomoses between the pulmonary venous confluence and the left atrium, alongside atrial septal defect repair with a bovine pericardial patch. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with successful weaning from mechanical ventilation on Day 9 and discharge on Day 12. The patient showed optimal venous drainage and hemodynamic stability, indicating a successful surgical outcome. This case highlights the importance of early surgical intervention in total anomalous pulmonary venous connection with complex anatomical presentations.
