Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Congenital Heart Disease.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is not widely used in patients with congenital heart disease. We describe our single-center experience of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in congenital heart disease, demonstrating short-term feasibility and safety, role in lifetime management of congenital aortic valve disease, and use as a bridge to recovery, future surgery, or transplantation.
