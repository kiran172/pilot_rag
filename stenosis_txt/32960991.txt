Title: The relationship between baseline diastolic dysfunction and postimplantation invasive hemodynamics with transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Abnormal invasive hemodynamics after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with poor survival; however, the mechanism is unknown.
HYPOTHESIS: Diastolic dysfunction will modify the association between invasive hemodynamics postTAVR and mortality.
METHODS: Patients with echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function and postTAVR invasive hemodynamic assessment were eligible for the present analysis. Diastology was classified as normal or abnormal (Stages 1 to 3). The aorto-ventricular index (AVi) was calculated as the difference between the aortic diastolic and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure divided by the heart rate. AVi was categorized as abnormal (AVi < 0.5 mmHg/beats per minute) or normal (≥ 0.5 mmHg/beats per minute).
RESULTS: From 1339 TAVR patients, 390 were included in the final analysis. The mean follow-up was 3.3 ± 1.7 years. Diastolic dysfunction was present in 70.9% of the abnormal vs 55.1% of the normal AVi group (P < .001). All-cause mortality was 46% in the abnormal vs 31% in the normal AVi group (P < .001). Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for AVi < 0.5 mmHg/beats per minute vs AVi ≥0.5 mmHg/beats per minute for intermediate-term mortality was (HR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.1, P = .017). This association was the same among those with normal diastolic function and those with diastolic dysfunction (P for interaction = .35).
CONCLUSION: Diastolic dysfunction is prevalent among TAVR patients. Low AVi is an independent predictor for poor intermediate-term survival, irrespective of co-morbid diastolic dysfunction.
