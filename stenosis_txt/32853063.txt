Title: Concomitant Aortic Root Replacement With Anterior Konno Annular Enlargement.

Abstract: The need for concomitant aortic annular enlargement and aortic root replacement may be necessary in situations of multilevel left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and/or prior aortic or aortic valve surgery, particularly in the setting of congenital heart disease. It can be extremely tedious and fraught with numerous complications. Major challenges include bleeding in difficult-to-reach areas and the potential need for subsequent operations. This article describes a technique of concomitant aortic annular enlargement and aortic root replacement that minimizes the risk of significant blood loss and facilitates future surgery should it be necessary.
