Title: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty with shockwave lithotripsy for the treatment of calcific mitral valve stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Calcific mitral stenosis (calcific MS) presents a challenge for surgical treatment and is a contraindication for most contemporary transcatheter mitral valve replacement devices (TMVR), rendering patients with very limited therapeutic options.
AIMS: This study aims to assess the clinical and hemodynamic follow-up after mitral valve lithotripsy (MVL).
METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent MVL to treat symptomatic calcific MS at St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada, were included. Patients were deemed unsuitable for mitral surgery or TMVR after heart team assessment. Patients with rheumatic MS or ≥moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) were excluded. The primary endpoint was a reduction in the invasive mitral gradient by ≥50% without significant (≥moderate) MR.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients underwent MVL between 2021 and 2023 with a mean age of 74 ± 9 years; 53% were female, with a mean STS score of 10% ± 0.1%. Following MVL, there was a reduction in the invasively measured mean trans-mitral gradient compared to baseline (14 mmHg vs. 6 mmHg; p < 0.05). The primary endpoint was achieved in 8 patients (53%) with no major procedural complications. At follow-up (median 90 days, IQR 58-115 days), 14 (93%) patients reported improved symptoms from New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV to NYHA Class I-II (p < 0.01) with stable echo-derived mean gradient (7.7 mmHg ± 2 mmHg vs. 8.4 mmHg ± 2.9 mmHg (p = 0.7).
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with symptomatic inoperable calcific MS, MVL was safe and associated with significant short-term clinical and hemodynamic improvement. MVL may represent a new compassionate therapy for this challenging cohort. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term outcomes and help define the role of IVL technology in treating calcific valvular conditions.
