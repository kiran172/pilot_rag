Title: [EC-IC bypass for occlusion of the internal carotid artery].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are barely any alternative treatment options to the drug treatment of hemodynamically caused cerebral ischemia, as in occlusion of the internal carotid artery.
OBJECTIVE: For secondary prevention of an ischemic stroke due to carotid occlusion and hemodynamic instability, extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery can be an important option in selected patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The development, study situation, indications and surgical technique for placement of an EC-IC bypass in cases of occlusion of the internal carotid artery are presented.
RESULTS: With appropriate expertise and strict selection of patients, the placement of an EC-IC bypass enables stabilization of cerebral perfusion with a low rate of complications.
CONCLUSION: The study situation is controversially discussed; nevertheless, surgical treatment in a specialized neurovascular center should at least be considered.
