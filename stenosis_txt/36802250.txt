Title: Computed tomography-guided aortic valve neocuspidization: details of preoperative assessment and surgical technique.

Abstract: The original Ozaki technique involves sizing and trimming the neovalve cusps during cross-clamp. It leads to prolongation of the ischaemic time, as compared to standard aortic valve replacement. We use preoperative computed tomography scanning of the patient's aortic root to develop personalized templates for each leaflet. With this method, autopericardial implants are prepared before the initiation of the bypass. It permits maximally adopting the procedure to the patient's individual anatomy and to shorten the cross-clamp time. We present a case of a computed tomography-guided aortic valve neocuspidization and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting with excellent short-term results. We discuss the feasibility and technical details of the novel technique.
