Title: Improved tricuspid regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement is associated with better survival: Systematic review and meta-analysis with reconstructed time-to-event data.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis compared survival outcomes among patients experiencing improvement in untreated significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis, in contrast to those without improvement.
METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched through January 2024. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. Employing network meta-analysis, a comparison involving four post-procedural TR categories (improved, no improvement, worsened, and no change) was executed. Subsequently, these categories were amalgamated into two groups (less TR after TAVR and same or greater TR after TAVR), and a standard meta-analysis was conducted. Kaplan-Meier curves depicting long-term all-cause mortality were reconstructed utilizing individual patient data derived from the studies.
RESULTS: A systematic review identified seven non-randomized studies encapsulating 698 patients. Network meta-analysis revealed that improved TR after TAVR correlated with significantly lower long-term all-cause mortality compared to the remaining cohorts. Similarly, pooled all-cause mortality of standard meta-analysis demonstrated significant reduction in patients whose TR was sub-baseline than those exhibiting same or greater TR after TAVR (HR [95% CI] = 0.43 [0.32-0.58], p &lt; .01). The hazard ratio, derived from reconstructed time-to-event data, showed a lower long-term all-cause mortality in patients with less TR after TAVR relative to the other cohort (HR [95% CI] = 0.46 [0.32-0.67], p &lt; .01).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis revealed that improved TR after TAVR correlates with superior long-term survival. The benefits of simultaneous or staged intervention on the tricuspid valve in individuals undergoing TAVR warrant validation in future investigations.
