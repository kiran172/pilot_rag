Title: Acute Heart Failure Due to Multi-vessel Coronary Spasm.

Abstract: A 46-year-old man presented to our hospital with chest pain followed by coughing and dyspnea. His myocardial enzyme levels were almost normal, and electrocardiography and echocardiography showed no obvious abnormalities. Chest radiography revealed congestion. He was diagnosed with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although subjective symptoms improved with intravenous diuretics, the patient was admitted to the hospital for a close examination. Coronary angiography showed no obvious stenosis, and a subsequent spasm provocation test demonstrated the presence of multi-vessel and diffuse spasms. Coronary spasm should be considered as a differential cause of heart failure, even in patients with HFpEF.
