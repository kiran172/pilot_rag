Title: Characteristics of Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis in the Elderly.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare characteristics of patients ≥65 years presenting with idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) to patients diagnosed at <65 years. We hypothesize that the groups have similar comorbidities and disease courses.
DATA SOURCES: Medical records of patients treated for iSGS at a tertiary care institution from January 2005-September 2022.
REVIEW METHODS: Patient demographics, time from symptom onset to diagnosis, medical history and comorbidities, and treatment modalities/intervals were recorded and analyzed. Characteristics of patients ≥65 and <65 years at presentation were compared using Chi-square analysis for non-numeric values and the Mann-Whitney U-test for numeric values.
RESULTS: One hundred seven patients with iSGS were identified and 16 (15%) were aged ≥65 years (mean age 72.6, 15 female) at presentation. These patients were compared to 91 patients aged <65 years (mean age = 47.6, 90 female). Patients ≥65 years had higher rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (p = 0.004) and tobacco use (p = 0.004). There were no significant differences in body mass index, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hormone replacement therapy, time from symptom onset to presentation, or length of operative treatment intervals.
CONCLUSION: Patients ≥65 years with iSGS have higher rates of tobacco use, suggesting that alterations in wound healing may play a role in the development of iSGS in this age group. Although rates of T2DM were higher in the elderly group, clinical significance may be limited given the overall higher rate of diabetes mellitus in the elderly population.
