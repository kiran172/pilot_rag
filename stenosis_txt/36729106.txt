Title: The Evolution of Current Management for Carotid Artery Bifurcation Disease.

Abstract: Options for treatment of symptomatic carotid bifurcation disease include carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS). While over the years CEA has established itself as the gold standard for carotid artery revascularization, results from recent trials have shown CAS to be safe and effective in selected patients. This review details the evolution of carotid artery bifurcation disease by highlighting key clinical trials.
