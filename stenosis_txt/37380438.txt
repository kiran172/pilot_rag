Title: Morphological Characteristics of Culprit Plaques in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients With Different Scores of Type A Personality　- An Intravascular Optical Coherence Tomography Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested a relationship between type A personality and the occurrence of coronary artery disease, so we used intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) to investigate the morphological characteristics of culprit plaques in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with different scores of type A personality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 221 AMI patients who underwent preintervention imaging of culprit lesions and an assessment of type A behavior pattern were included. According to the scores for the behavior questionnaire, these patients were divided into 3 groups: non-type A personality (n=91), intermediate personality (n=73), and type A personality (n=57). Patients with type A personality were younger (P=0.003) and had a higher level of total cholesterol (P=0.029) and more severe luminal stenosis (P=0.046). In addition, the prevalence of microchannels (P<0.001), macrophage accumulation (P<0.001), and plaque rupture (P=0.010) with greater number (P<0.001), cavity angle (P<0.001), and length (P<0.001) was highest in the type A personality group.
CONCLUSIONS: The culprit lesions of AMI patients with increased scores for type A personality had more severe coronary luminal stenosis, and the proportion of vulnerable features was increased.
