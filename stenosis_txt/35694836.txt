Title: Uretero-enteric stricture outcomes: secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial comparing open versus robot-assisted radical cystectomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To analyse the risk of uretero-enteric anastomotic stricture in patients randomised to open (ORC) or robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with extracorporeal urinary diversion.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 118 patients randomised to RARC (n = 60) or ORC (n = 58) at a single, high-volume institution from March 2010 to April 2013. Urinary diversion was performed by experienced open surgeons. Stricture was defined as non-malignant obstruction on imaging, corroborated by clinical status, and requiring procedural intervention. The risk of stricture within 1 year was compared between groups using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: In all, 58 and 60 patients were randomised to RARC and ORC, respectively. We identified five strictures, all in the ORC group. In patients with ≥1 year of follow-up, the increase in risk of stricture from open surgery was 9.3% (95% confidence interval 1.5%, 17%). Of the five strictures, three were managed endoscopically while two required open revision. There was no evidence that perioperative Grade 3-5 complications were associated with development of a stricture (P = 1) and no evidence of a difference in 24-month estimated glomerular filtration rate between arms (P = 0.15).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study at a high-volume centre, RARC with extracorporeal urinary diversion achieved excellent ureteric anastomotic outcomes. Purported increased risk of stricture is not a reason to avoid RARC. Future research should examine the impact of different surgical techniques and operator experience on the risk of stricture, especially as more intracorporeal diversions are performed.
