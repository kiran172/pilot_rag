Title: Misplaced S1 screw causing L5 radiculopathy, rare and unusual presentation: a report of 2 cases.

Abstract: Many spine surgeons are not optimally acquainted with anatomy anterior to sacrum. Screw malposition injuring these structures can lead to unwanted lethal consequences. We report unusual cases of acute radiculopathy due to misplaced bicortical sacral screw causing L5 nerve root impingement on anterior sacrum. A 39/M patient complained of severe rest pain (VAS 9/10) post TLIF in region of L5 dermatome with sensory deficit along the right lateral leg and straight leg raise less than 30Â°. X-ray revealed S1 screw protruding beyond the second cortex with a straight trajectory. CT scan revealed a protrusion of 11.4mm beyond anterior cortex. The patient was taken for re-surgery and the trajectory and length of screw was revised. Sciatic pain completely disappeared immediately after surgery. A 61/M patient operated elsewhere with instrumented decompression and fusion with screws passed at L4, L5 and S1 level for lumbar canal stenosis, post-surgery patient developed new onset radicular symptoms in right lower limb. Patient was managed conservatively in the form of L5 selective nerve root block. Pain and numbness improved. Bicortical purchase of S1 screw though improves pull out strength, is associated with a risk of neurovascular complications. Surgeons should be alerted to the misplacement of S1 pedicle screws to avoid involvement not only anterior to the anteromedial neurovascular tissue, but also anterolateral to the arrangement of the L5 nerve root.
