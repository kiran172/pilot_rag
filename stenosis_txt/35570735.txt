Title: Anomalous Origin of the Left Coronary Artery From the Right Pulmonary Artery of an Infant.

Abstract: A female presented 2 weeks after birth with an unbalanced atrioventricular canal, double outlet right ventricle, mild pulmonary stenosis, and patent ductus arteriosus that eventually caused pulmonary over circulation. After pulmonary artery banding, she experienced myocardial ischemia, suggesting interference with coronary blood flow by the band that had been placed on the main pulmonary trunk. The band was removed and revised to bilateral branch pulmonary artery banding, and cardiac function improved. An anomalous left coronary artery from the underside of the right pulmonary artery was identified. Eight weeks later, the patient underwent coronary transfer and reimplantation of the left coronary artery into the aorta followed by main pulmonary artery banding. She subsequently underwent bidirectional Glenn.
