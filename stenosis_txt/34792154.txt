Title: Easy surgical explantation technique for self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve: 'lasso technique'.

Abstract: A prosthesis with a self-expanding nitinol frame firmly incorporates into the aortic wall and thus is difficult to explant. We introduce a novel technique that simplifies explantation.
