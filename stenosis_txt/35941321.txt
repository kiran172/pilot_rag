Title: Prognostic impact of patients' management based on anatomic/functional phenotype: a study in patients with chronic coronary syndromes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In stable coronary artery disease (CAD), the prognostic interaction between clinical variables and treatment appropriateness based on anatomic/functional phenotype needs to be evaluated.
METHODS: 1585 consecutive patients underwent myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and coronary angiography within 90 days. Obstructive CAD (> 70% stenosis) with downstream moderate-to-severe ischemia (> 10%) was considered significant. Coronary revascularization was considered appropriate if all hemodynamically significant lesions were revascularized, while medical therapy only was deemed appropriate in the absence of hemodynamically significant CAD.
RESULTS: Obstructive CAD and moderate-to-severe ischemia were documented in 1184 (75%) and 466 (29%) patients, respectively. Over mean follow-up of 4.7 ± 2.5 years, the primary endpoint (cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction) occurred in 132 (8.2%) patients. Of patients with obstructive CAD, 797 (67%) were managed appropriately. Patients' management was inappropriate in 389 patients, because either non-hemodynamically significant lesions were revascularized (50%, including 2 patients with non-obstructive lesions being inappropriately revascularized) or ischemia-causing CAD was left untreated (50%). At multivariate analysis, an inappropriate management (P < .001) was correlated with the primary endpoint, together with previous myocardial infarction (P = .009), lower ejection fraction (P < .001) and higher glucose levels (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In stable CAD patients, management based on anatomic/functional phenotyping was correlated with a prognostic advantage at long-term follow-up. Correlation between treatment categories and patients' prognosis. A significantly higher event-rate was observed in patients where hemodynamically significant coronary lesions were left untreated-either because MT was not-adherently chosen or in the case of incomplete revascularization-than in those that were revascularized completely (17.6% vs 5.1%; P < .001). Conversely, the revascularization of non-hemodynamically significant CAD correlated with a higher event-rate than that of similar patients managed medically (13.8% vs 8.3%, P = .04). The event-rate of patients in whom coronary revascularization was performed in the presence of hemodynamically significant CAD ('appropriate revascularization') was similar to those with "No CAD/non-obstructive CAD" (5.1% vs 3.5%; P = NS).
