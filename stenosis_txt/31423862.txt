Title: Safety of simultaneous bilateral carotid artery stenting for bilateral carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bilateral carotid artery stenting (BCAS) is often performed in two stages (staged BCAS) but it is also an option to be performed in one stage (simultaneous BCAS). To confirm the safety of simultaneous BCAS, we retrospectively analyzed perioperative and postoperative course of simultaneous BCAS compared with staged BCAS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with symptomatic stenosis of ≥50% or asymptomatic stenosis of ≥80% of bilateral carotid arteries underwent BCAS. Procedure time, symptomatic ischemic complications, presence/absence of high-intensity spots on postoperative diffusion-weighted image, duration of postoperative hospital stays and 30 days outcome of patients performed with simultaneous BCAS (group A, 8 patients with 16 stenotic lesions (8 procedures)) were compared with those of staged BCAS (group B, 4 patients with 8 stenotic lesions (8 procedures)).
RESULTS: In groups A and B, procedure time was 146.0 ± 53.8 and 103.5 ± 39.4 min; intraoperative hypotension was observed in 62.5% and 50.0%; postoperative hypotension occurred in 37.5% and 50.0%; diffusion-weighted image showed high-intensity spots in 37.5% and 12.5%; and duration of postoperative hospital stays was 5.1 ± 1.8 and 5.3 ± 2.3 days. No patients suffered symptomatic ischemic complications. In simultaneous BCAS, there was a tendency that procedure time was longer and high-intensity spots on postoperative diffusion-weighted image was more frequent, but there was no increase in symptomatic ischemic complications and duration of hospital stays compared to staged BCAS.
CONCLUSIONS: Safety of simultaneous BCAS may not be inferior to staged BCAS. In terms of duration of hospital stays, simultaneous BCAS can be superior to staged BCAS for patients with bilateral carotid artery stenosis.
