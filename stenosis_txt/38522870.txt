Title: Surgical Heritage: You Had to Be There, Ross: The Comeback Kid.

Abstract: Half a century after the first pulmonary autograft operation (Ross operation), performed in 1967 by Donald Ross in central London, there is a very strong conviction that the Ross operation is the best available valve substitute today, not only for children, but also for younger and older adults. The Ross operation has stimulated a lot of science to do with tissue-engineering and biology of heart valves, which is a promising avenue for the future. For one of us (M.Y.), it has certainly been a privilege to be associated with the comeback of the Ross operation.
