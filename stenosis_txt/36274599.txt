Title: [The effective analysis of refractory esophageal stricture after endoscopic mucosal dissection of early esophageal cancer treated by endoscopic radiotomy combined with local injection of triamcinolone acetonide].

Abstract: Refractor esophageal stenosis after endoscopic submucosal dissection of early esophageal carcinoma is a difficult clinical problem. To verify the effect of endoscopic radial incision combined local triamcinolone injection to treat refractory esophageal stenosis, we retrospectively analyzed 7 patients diagnosed with refractory esophageal stricture after endoscopic mucosal dissection of early esophageal cancer in this study, of whom 4 male and 3 female patients, aged 50-76 years, with the mean age of 63 years. We performed the endoscopic radial incision in the thickness point of the scar stricture and injected the triamcinolone locally. The results showed it was safe and effective. The follow-up showed no esophageal stenosis occured and no adverse reaction such as hemorrhage, perforation, tumor-recurrence and triamcinolone-allergy occured.
