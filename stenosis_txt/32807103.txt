Title: Congenital subclavian-superior vena cava arteriovenous fistula with initial stenosis in an adult: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A subclavian-superior vena cava arteriovenous fistula is usually acquired and secondary to trauma or operations, while congenital causes are very rare. A congenital arteriovenous fistula leads to congestive heart failure soon after birth and is typically diagnosed in early infancy.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present an unusual case of a 21-year-old female suffering from new-onset heart failure at 20â€‰years old who was diagnosed with a congenital arteriovenous fistula from the right subclavian artery to the superior vena cava (RSA-to-SVC) with stenosis at the proximal initial site of the fistula. The patient successfully underwent transcatheter occlusion for the fistula and had a significant improvement in symptoms at the 3-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: An RSA-to-SVC fistula is a very rare congenital disorder that can lead to shunt-related heart failure. If there is an indication for closure, as with the patient presented, percutaneous device closure can be considered a reasonable option.
