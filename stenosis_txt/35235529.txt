Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Nonagenarians: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nonagenarians represent only a small proportion of patients included in large transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) trials, but will become a relevant future population in need of treatment due to demographic change. Thus, this study sought to evaluate outcomes of TAVR for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis (AS) in nonagenarian patients.
METHODS: We screened Medline/Pubmed for studies that stated specific outcomes for nonagenarians undergoing TAVR. A weighted meta-analysis was conducted, calculating pooled estimate rates using a binary random-effects model for dichotomous variables, and comparing non-dichotomous outcomes with a continuous random-effects model.
RESULTS: Data from 23 studies including 16,094 nonagenarians were merged; 53.4% were women. Despite reasonable rates of comorbidities, Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score was 10.2 Â± 5.4. Pooled estimate rate of procedural success was 94.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.7-96.6), with major vascular complications occurring in 6.3% (95% CI, 2.7-9.8) and at least moderate postprocedural paravalvular leak in 7.5% (95% CI, 4.4-10.6). The rate of periprocedural stroke or transient ischemic attack was 2.6% (95% CI, 2.0-3.2). At 30 days, the pooled estimate of mortality was 6.1% (95% CI, 4.7-7.4) and a permanent pacemaker was implanted in 12.6% (95% CI, 7.6-17.6). After 1 year, the mortality rate was 20.5% (95% CI, 15.9-25.1).
CONCLUSION: TAVR in nonagenarians is an effective and safe procedure, with encouraging outcomes given the general life expectancy of these patients. Currently, only selected nonagenarians are undergoing TAVR, but their number will grow as life expectancy continues to increase in the developed world. Specific research to identify ideal candidates and techniques in this cohort is needed.
