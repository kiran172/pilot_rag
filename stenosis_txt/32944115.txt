Title: Chronic dissection of the abdominal aorta as a rare complication of Takayasu disease.

Abstract: Takayasu's arteritis exposes to complications of varying severity, such as arterial stenosis, thrombosis, and more rarely aneurysms. Aortic dissection is a rare complication of Takayasu's disease, reported in few times in the literature, only 7 of which concern the abdominal aorta. We report the case of a 41-year-old woman followed for Takayasu disease for 15 years, who presented an asymptomatic and chronic dissection of the abdominal subrenal aorta. The patient underwent conservative medical treatment. After a follow-up of 17 months, the aortic dissection was still asymptomatic, with a stable appearance on follow-up imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of asymptomatic aortic dissection as a rare complication of Takayasu disease.
