Title: Human Genetics of Semilunar Valve and Aortic Arch Anomalies.

Abstract: Lesions of the semilunar valve and the aortic arch can occur either in isolation or as part of well-described clinical syndromes. The polygenic cause of calcific aortic valve disease will be discussed including the key role of NOTCH1 mutations. In addition, the complex trait of bicuspid aortic valve disease will be outlined, both in sporadic/familial cases and in the context of associated syndromes, such as Alagille, Williams, and Kabuki syndromes. Aortic arch abnormalities particularly coarctation of the aorta and interrupted aortic arch, including their association with syndromes such as Turner and 22q11 deletion, respectively, are also discussed. Finally, the genetic basis of congenital pulmonary valve stenosis is summarized, with particular note to Ras-/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) pathway syndromes and other less common associations, such as Holt-Oram syndrome.
