Title: Evaluation of Computerized Tomography Utilization in Comparison to Digital Subtraction Angiography in Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Perform literature review to analyze current practices in imaging patient with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and examine patterns in our practice in order to assess whether a lower extremity computed tomography angiography (CTA) in addition to digital subtraction angiography enhanced the assessment of vessel calcification, percentage of stenosis, and affected outcomes in patients with PAD.
METHODS: The study included patients who underwent lower extremity imaging and were followed up to 12 months. This population was divided into cases who had both an angiogram and CTA performed within 30 days (n = 20), and controls who underwent angiography only (n = 19). Baseline characteristics, imaging results, and clinical outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients met study criteria (mean age was 58.4 years, 69.2% were males, and 33.3% had diabetes). Patients mostly presented with tissue loss/rest pain (10.3%), claudication (15.4%), acute limb (10.3%), and trauma (15.4%). We have not observed any statistically significant differences in various examined blood vessels when their features (e.g., vessel diameter, stenosis, calcifications) were assessed by CTA combined with angiography versus angiography alone. The exceptions were external iliac artery, superficial femoral artery and dorsalis pedis vessels. In external iliac artery percentage of stenosis was 1.11% as determined by computed tomography (CT) scan versus 30% by angiography (P = 0.009). For superficial femoral artery stenosis, the percentage determined by CT was 48.68% vs. 81.41% by angiography, and observed difference between 2 modalities was statistically significant (P = 0.025). For dorsalis pedis percentage of stenosis detected by CT scan was 60.63% vs. 22.73% by angiography, and the differences in findings by these modalities were statistically significant (P = 0.039). The most frequent perioperative complication was cardiac-related (35.5%). Nineteen patients were readmitted and 8 had reinterventions within 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Both imaging modalities yielded similar results for assessing vessel calcification and percentage of stenosis regardless of anatomic vessel location. Overall, utilization of CTA in addition to angiography for large vessels above the knee (e.g., iliac artery, superficial femoral artery) and below the knee for dorsalis pedis provided more detailed information on the properties of these vessels. Therefore, during preoperative assessments, CTA may be helpful in addition to angiography for planning surgical and endovascular interventions for symptomatic PAD treatment in larger vessels.
