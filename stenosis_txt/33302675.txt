Title: The clinical value of multimodal ultrasound for the evaluation of disease activity and complications in inflammatory bowel disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has the characteristics of chronic relapse and remission, which makes early diagnosis and effective evaluation of disease activity especially crucial. With the development of ultrasound technology, its role in the diagnosis and treatment of IBD is increasing. This study aimed to explore the value of multimodal ultrasound in the assessment of disease activity and complications in IBD.
METHODS: Patients with clinically confirmed IBD were selected and examined with two-dimensional ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), elastography, endoscopy with biopsies, and whole-abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT). Collect relevant laboratory data, including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, etc. Endoscopy is used as the gold standard for disease activity assessment, and the diagnostic value of each ultrasound parameter is compared separately, and correlation analysis is made.
RESULTS: Intestinal maximum wall thickness in patients in the disease activity group (active group) was significantly thicker than that in patients in remission group (7.93±2.65 vs. 4.16±1.08 mm, P<0.001). The mean values of Peak Enhancement (PE) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were higher in the active stage than in remission, with a significant difference (-40.66±4.81 vs. -50.47±5.03 db, 356.44±170.67 vs. 194.42±92.09 dBsec, both P<0.05). Time To Peak (TTP) showed no significant difference between the active stage and remission (20.04±8.74 vs. 20.09±11.13 s, P>0.05). Twenty cases of intestinal stricture were detected by ultrasound, and no fistula or abscesses were detected. CEUS and elastography could distinguish inflammatory bowel stenosis and fibrous bowel stenosis in patients with IBD. In the fibrosis group and inflammation group, the mean shear wave velocity, Young's modulus, TTP, PE, and AUC were statistically significantly different (P<0.05). The mean maximum wall thickness and disease extent assessed by ultrasound and CT were strongly correlated (r=0.799, 0.831). Wall thickness showed a moderate positive correlation with CRP and ESR and a strong positive correlation with Mayo score (P<0.05), but no significant correlation with CDAI (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal ultrasound provides more detailed clinical reference values for the comprehensive evaluation of IBD.
