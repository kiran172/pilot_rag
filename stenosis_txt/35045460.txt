Title: [A Case of Anastomotic Stenosis with Reconstructed Small Intestine Mucosal Damage during Taking S-1 Orally after Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer].

Abstract: An 83-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy and Billroth Ⅱ reconstruction for gastric cancer. Since histopathological examination revealed that the lesion was Stage ⅢA, she had started taking S-1 as an adjuvant chemotherapy 7 weeks after gastrectomy. Seventeen days later after taking S-1 administration, she felt nauseous and self-interrupted. Nineteen days later, she was urgently hospitalized. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy(EGD)showed anastomotic lumen was open, but reconstructed small intestine mucosal damage was found, and reconstructed small intestine muscle layer was fused to anastomotic region. On 50th day of hospitalization, mucosa was regenerated and endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD)was performed from 78th day. She was discharged on 151th day of hospitalization after 7 times of EBD. One year later, she does not need EBD and can be taken orally and has no recurrence.
