Title: Angiographic patterns and temporal changes of arterial lesions in Behcet's disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease (BD) can entail vascular involvement in various forms including aneurysm. We evaluated the angiographic patterns and changes in arterial lesions over time in BD patients with arterial involvement.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of BD patients diagnosed with arterial lesions between 1995 and 2018. Angiographic patterns were categorized as stenosis, occlusion, dilatation, or aneurysm. Patients were divided according to symptom duration (<5, 5-10, >10 years). Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate the risk factors for vascular progression.
RESULTS: 47 BD patients had arterial involvement in the following patterns: aneurysm (n = 31), stenosis (n = 17), dilatation (n = 13), and occlusion (n = 8). Aneurysm (70.8%) was the most common pattern in 24 patients with short (&lt;5 years) symptom duration. Stenosis was more common (50.0%) in 12 patients with longer symptom durations (&gt;10 years). In 23 patients with follow-up imaging (median, 5.7 years), eight (34.8%) developed 11 new lesions: stenosis (n = 5), dilatation (n = 1), and aneurysm (n = 5). One stenotic lesion progressed to occlusion, and two dilated lesions progressed to aneurysms. Lower extremity involvement and methotrexate use were associated with arterial progression, with hazard ratios of 5.716 (p = 0.029) and 0.101 (p = 0.049), respectively.
CONCLUSION: In BD patients with arterial involvement, aneurysm was the most common pattern in earlier stages of BD, while stenosis was more common in later stages of BD. Methotrexate use was associated with lower risk of arterial lesion progression.
