Title: Surgical Treatment of Vertebral Artery Stenosis: An Overlooked Surgery with Low Morbidity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vertebral artery (VA) stenosis as a cause of ischemic events and its surgical treatment is an overlooked subject. After reporting our initial results, the results of VA stenosis operations and the follow-up studies are analyzed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study includes 43 symptomatic proximal VA stenosis patients between September 2012 and March 2019. The demographics and clinical data were obtained from the hospital records. Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography were used to establish the diagnosis and for follow-up. The surgical procedures were as follows: VA transposition in 30 (69.8%), VA bypass 8 (18.6%), saphenous vein interposition in VA in 4 (9.3%), and decompression of kinking in 1 (2.3%) patient. Eleven patients (25.5%) had concomitant carotid surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival and patency rates.
RESULTS: Most common symptoms were vertigo and loss of balance in 38 (88.4%) and 14 (32.6%) patients, respectively. Twenty-five patients were males (58.1%), and the average age was 64.6 ± 9.8 (50-90) years. The 30-day death, 30-day stroke, and 30-day death/stroke rates were 2.3%, 4.7%, and 7%, respectively. Ten patients (23.3%) had morbidities which were related to the intervention. Horner syndrome was found in 5 (11.6%) patients, and facial nerve injury was found in one (2.3%) patient. Three (7.1%) patients died during the follow-up period, and overall survival of the patients at 3 years was 91.4% ± 5.8%. Two (4.7%) patients had cerebrovascular events (CVEs) occurred during the follow-up. One- and three-year CVE-free survivals were 97.1% ± 2.9% and 90.1% ± 7.2%, respectively. Two patients (5.4%) had restenosis. One- and three-year patency of VA after procedure was 89.1% ± 7.4%. Thirty-seven (86%) patients had complete recovery of symptoms after surgery; 5 patients (11.6%) kept their preoperative symptoms in different levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral artery surgery can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity rates. Restenosis-free, CVE-free, and overall survival rates are satisfactory.
