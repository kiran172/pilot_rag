Title: A comparative study of rubber band ligation versus BANANA-Clip in grade 1 to 3 internal hemorrhoids.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Rubber band ligation (RBL) for grade 1 to 3 internal hemorrhoids is a well-established modality of choice. But RBL is also a kind of surgical treatment; it is not free from complications (e.g., delayed bleeding [DB], rectal stenosis). This study aimed to investigate the results of the comparative treatment of RBL and BANANA-Clip (BC; Endovision).
METHODS: Study participants were 632 consecutive patients with grade 1 to 3 internal hemorrhoids attended to Department of Colorectal Surgery at Wellness Hospital between January 2010 and May 2019. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of complications, including DB between RBL and BC.
RESULTS: There were 304 male and 328 female patients, whose ages ranged from 15 to 84 years, with a mean age of 45.7 years. The common symptom and cause of treatment was prolapse (70.1%). The number of ligated sites was 1.49±0.57 in the RBL group and 1.99±0.77 in the BC group. RBL showed a significantly higher incidence of DB (3.5%) compared to BC (0%) (P=0.001). The 1-year success rate was 95.9% in the RBL group and 99.7% in the BC group (P=0.005).
CONCLUSION: In our study, BC was more reliable in treating grade 1 to 3 internal hemorrhoids with higher success rates and less post-ligation complications, especially DB, compared to RBL.
