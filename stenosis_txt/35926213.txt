Title: Implementation of Office Hysteroscopy for the Evaluation and Treatment of Intrauterine Pathology.

Abstract: Hysteroscopy provides a minimally invasive strategy to evaluate intrauterine pathology and manage conditions such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, intrauterine adhesions, m√ºllerian anomalies, and intrauterine foreign bodies. Increasing access to hysteroscopy procedures in the office has the potential to improve patient care by minimizing financial and logistical barriers, aiding in streamlined diagnosis and treatment planning, and potentially averting unnecessary operative procedures and anesthesia. Office hysteroscopy refers to procedures performed in outpatient settings where pain management involves no medications, oral nonsedating medications, local anesthetic agents, or oral or inhaled conscious sedation. We present best practices for the implementation of hysteroscopy in an office setting. These include appropriate patient selection, optimal procedural timing, cervical preparation for patients at highest risk of cervical stenosis or pain with dilation, individualized pain-management strategies, use of distension media, and video monitoring to engage patients in the procedure. We describe miniaturized equipment for use in the office setting and "no-touch" vaginoscopic approaches to limit patient discomfort. With appropriate training and experience, office hysteroscopy presents a simple and cost-effective modality for optimizing gynecologic care for our patients.
