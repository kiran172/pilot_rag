Title: Imaging in neonatal respiratory disease.

Abstract: The purpose of this review is to describe the current state of the art in clinical imaging for NICU patients, divided into major areas that correspond to likely phenotypes of neonatal respiratory disease: airway abnormalities, parenchymal disease, and pulmonary vascular disease. All common imaging modalities (ultrasound, X-ray, CT, and MRI) are discussed, with an emphasis on modalities that are most relevant to the individual underlying aspects of disease. Some promising aspects of dynamic and functional imaging are included, where there may be future clinical applicability.
