Title: Management of the Temporal Bone Fibrous Dysplasia With External Auditory Canal Stenosis and Secondary Cholesteatoma in an Asian Population: A 11-Case Series.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This article summarizes the experience of diagnosis and treatment of temporal bone fibrous dysplasia (FD) with external auditory canal (EAC) stenosis and secondary cholesteatoma in the Chinese population, in order to improve the quality of life of patients in the future.
METHODS: Eleven patients with FD of the temporal bone who underwent surgery were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: All lesions originated from the temporal bone, and all involved of the EAC. There were 11 cases of cholesteatoma in the EAC, 4 cases of cholesteatoma in the middle ear. The most common symptoms were hearing loss (100%), tinnitus (36.4%), and otorrhea (36.4%). Two patients were severe-profound sensorineural hearing loss, and one patient was complicated with subperiosteal abscesses. All 11 patients underwent surgery. There were no perioperative complications in this series and median follow-up time was 4.2 years.
CONCLUSION: Temporal bone FD remains a rare diagnosis, especially in the Asian population. The lesions mainly lead to stenosis of the EAC, especially at the osteochondral junction. Cholesteatoma is the main complication of this disease, which is secondary to occlusion of the EAC with the growth of the lesion. Canaloplasty of EAC combined with wide meatoplasty can provide excellent prognosis in most cases.
