Title: Prognostic Impact of Polypharmacy following Trans-Catheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy in elderly patients with various comorbidities is associated with mortality and morbidity. However, the prognostic impact of polypharmacy in patients with severe aortic stenosis receiving trans-catheter aortic valve replacement remains unknown.
METHODS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis who received trans-catheter aortic valve replacement between 2015 and 2022 and were followed up at our institute following index discharge were included in this retrospective study. The impact of polypharmacy, which was defined as medication numbers â‰¥10 at index discharge, upon 2-year all-cause death was investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 345 patients (median age 85 [83, 89] years old, 99 (29%) men) were included. Median medication number was 9 (7, 10) at the index discharge and 88 (26%) were classified as receiving polypharmacy. Frailty index, including mini-mental state examination and CSHA score, were not significantly different between those with and without polypharmacy (p &gt; 0.05 for both). Polypharmacy was associated with higher 2-year cumulative mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio of 21.4 (95% confidence interval, 6.06-74.8, p &lt; 0.001). As a sub-analysis, the number of cardiovascular medications was not associated with 2-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.48, p = 0.46), whereas a higher number of non-cardiovascular medications was associated with an incremental increase in 2-year mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.39 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.63, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis, polypharmacy was associated with worse short-term survival following trans-catheter aortic valve replacement. Prognostic implication of aggressive intervention to decrease the amount of medication among those receiving TAVR requires further prospective studies.
