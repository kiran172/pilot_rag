Title: Carotid, Vertebral, and Brachiocephalic Interventions.

Abstract: Carotid atherosclerosis most frequently manifests in the proximal internal carotid artery and the common carotid artery bifurcations. Subclavian artery atherosclerosis affects the proximal segments with a relatively higher incidence on the left and becomes clinically important in the presence of vertebrobasilar insufficiency or coronary steal. Atherosclerosis of the vertebral artery can lead to posterior circulation stroke. The authors review the major trials on carotid carotid, brachiocephalic and vertebral artery stenosis along with the various available diagnostic and interventional techniques.
