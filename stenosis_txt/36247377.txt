Title: Aortic Stenosis Severity: Rhythm Makes a Difference.

Abstract: • Bradycardia may increase aortic valve flow by increasing ventricular filling. • Elevated aortic flow may skew accurate evaluation of AS. • Permanent AF may increase diastolic filling variability. • Correction of abnormal flow conditions is crucial to assess AS.
