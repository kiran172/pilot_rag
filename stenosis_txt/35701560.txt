Title: Genome-Wide Association Study of Intracranial Artery Stenosis Followed by Phenome-Wide Association Study.

Abstract: The genetic background of intracranial artery stenosis (ICAS), a major cause of ischemic stroke, remains elusive. We performed the world's first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ICAS using DNA samples from Japanese subjects, to identify the genetic factors associated with ICAS and their correlation with clinical features. We also conducted a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of the top variant identified via GWAS to determine its association with systemic disease. The GWAS involved 408 patients with ICAS and 349 healthy controls and utilized an Asian Screening Array of venous blood samples. The PheWAS was performed using genotypic and phenotypic data of the Biobank Japan Project, which contained information on 46 diseases and 60 quantitative trait data from &gt; 150,000 Japanese individuals. The GWAS revealed that the East Asian-specific functional variant of RNF213, rs112735431 (c.14429G &gt; A, p.Arg4810Lys), was associated with ICAS (odds ratio, 12.3; 95% CI 5.5 to 27.5; P = 7.8 × 10-10). Stratified analysis within ICAS cases demonstrated that clinical features of those with and without the risk allele were different. PheWAS indicated that high blood pressure and angina were significantly associated with RNF213 rs112735431. The first GWAS of ICAS, which stratifies subpopulations within the ICAS cases with distinct clinical features, revealed that RNF213 rs112735431 was the most significant variant associated with ICAS. Thus, RNF213 rs112735431 shows potential as an important clinical biomarker that characterizes pleiotropic risk in various vascular diseases, such as blood pressure and angina, thereby facilitating personalized medicine for systemic vascular diseases in East Asian populations.
