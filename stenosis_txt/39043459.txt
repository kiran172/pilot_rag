Title: Valve-in-Valve-in-Valve.

Abstract: In the case of the degeneration of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the standard. However, these valves are also susceptible to deterioration. In such instances, a new TAVI implantation may be considered. We present the case of a patient with a SAVR who underwent two TAVI procedures, spaced 8 years apart. We discuss important practical aspects, including the risk of coronary obstruction and the final valve diameter.
