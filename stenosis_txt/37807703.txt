Title: Modified Tubeless Ureterocutaneostomy in High-Risk Patients After Radical Cystectomy and its Long-Term Clinical Outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to prevent stoma stenosis and achieve tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy in elderly and high-risk patients with our modified cutaneous ureterostomy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 40 and 49 patients (176 renal units) who underwent Toyoda (group 1) and modified cutaneous ureterostomy (group 2) between 2012 and 2021. The average follow-up period was 44 months. The primary results of our study were the catheter-free rate and clinical outcomes, especially renal function and urinary diversion-related complications. Significant differences in catheter-free rate and urinary diversion-related complications were found between our modified method and the Toyoda technique.
RESULTS: A total of 56 (71.8%) of 78 renal units in group 1 and 89 (90.8%) of 98 renal units in group 2 remained catheter free. Compared with group 1, group 2 had a higher catheter-free rate (P = .001). Multivariate analysis indicated that the surgical procedure (HR = 0.268; P = .001) and body mass index (HR = 3.127; P = .002) were the predictors independently associated with catheter insertion. During follow-up, renal deterioration was observed in 32 (36.0%) patients. Patients with catheter insertion were more likely to suffer from renal deterioration (P &lt; .001), postoperative pyelonephritis (P &lt; .001), and urolithiasis (P &lt; .001) than their counterparts.
CONCLUSION: Our modified cutaneous ureterostomy method may provide an effective and simple approach to tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy in elderly and high-risk patients.
