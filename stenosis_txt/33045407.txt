Title: An unusual combination of an atypical maternally inherited novel 0.3 Mb deletion in Williams-Beuren region and a de novo 22q11.21 microduplication in an infant with supravalvular aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), intellectual disability, overfriendliness and dysmorphic features. It is typically caused by 1.5-1.8 Mb deletions on 7q11.23. The 22q11.21 microduplication syndrome has a variable phenotype and is frequently associated with congenital heart disease. Here we present a unique patient, carrying aberrations within both of the above syndrome regions, referred for possible diagnosis of WBS because of SVAS. The patient was a boy who died suddenly 47 days after birth, possibly due to cardiac complications. Genetic testing was carried out, including array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH), Fluorescence In situ Hybridization (FISH) and Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) showing that the proband was heterozygous for a novel and atypical 0.3 Mb deletion in WBS region (7q11.23) encompassing the ELN gene. In addition, he was found heterozygous for a 22q11.21 microduplication. Parental studies revealed that the 7q11.23 deletion was inherited from the mother who also exhibited a cardiovascular phenotype, however very mild. The same maternally inherited deletion was detected in one of the proband's siblings, born two years later with a less severe SVAS. The 22q11.2 microduplication was de novo in origin. Detection and investigation of atypical deletions within known syndrome regions are crucial for better genotype-phenotype correlations and more accurate characterization of critical regions. The combined effect of two different genetic defects - one in a known syndrome region and one with variable clinical significance, is valuable for revealing gene interactions and enabling more accurate predictions, especially in prenatal diagnosis.
