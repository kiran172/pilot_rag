Title: Contralateral radiculopathy after unilateral transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion: causes and prevention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Unilateral transforminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) with a single cage can provide circumferential fusion and biomechanical stability. However, the causes and prevention of contralateral radiculopathy following unilateral TLIF remain unclear.
METHODS: In total, 190 patients who underwent unilateral TLIF from January 2017 to January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiological parameters including lumbar lordosis, segmental angle, anterior disc height, posterior disc height (PDH), foraminal height (FH), foraminal width, and foraminal area (FA) were measured preoperatively and postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale scores were also recorded.
RESULTS: The incidence of contralateral radiculopathy after unilateral TLIF was 5.3% (10/190). The most common cause was contralateral foraminal stenosis. Unilateral TLIF could increase the lumbar lordosis, segmental angle, and anterior disc height but decrease the PDH, FA, and FH in patients with symptomatic contralateral radiculopathy. The intervertebral cage should be placed to cover the epiphyseal ring and cortical compact bone of the midline, and the disc height can be increased to enlarge the contralateral foramen.
CONCLUSION: The most common cause of contralateral radiculopathy is contralateral foraminal stenosis. Careful preoperative planning is necessary to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Improper unilateral TLIF will decrease the PDH, FA, and FH, resulting in contralateral radiculopathy.
