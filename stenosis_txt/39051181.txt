Title: Effects of tanshinone IIA on endothelial cell dysfunction in uremic condition.

Abstract: An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis in uremic patients, yet its dysfunction poses a significant clinical challenge. Venous stenosis, primarily caused by venous neointimal hyperplasia, is a key factor in the failure of vascular access. During vascular access dysfunction, endothelial cells (ECs) transform mechanical stimuli into intracellular signals and interact with vascular smooth muscle cells. Tanshinone IIA, an important compound derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been widely used to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, its role in modulating ECs under uremic conditions remains incompletely understood. In this research, ECs were exposed to sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) and subjected to shear stress and uremic conditions. The results indicate that STS can reduce the suppressive effects on the expression of NF-κB p65, JNK and Collagen I in uremia-induced ECs. Moreover, the downregulation of NF-κB p65, JNK and Collagen I can be enhanced through the inhibition of ERK1/2 and the upregulation of Caveolin-1. These findings suggest that tanshinone IIA may improve EC function under uremic conditions by targeting the Caveolin-1/ERK1/2 pathway, presenting tanshinone IIA as a potential therapeutic agent against AVF immaturity caused by EC dysfunction.
