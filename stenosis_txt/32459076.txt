Title: Surgery from the future: Performing a safe valve-in-valve explantation.

Abstract: As the number of young and relatively low-risk patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation increases, the number who will require open heart surgery months or years later will also increase. Only a few cases of late transcatheter heart valve explantation (without root replacement) have been reported in the literature, and this rare procedure can be surgically very challenging. In this video tutorial we present the case of a patient with a valve-in-valve subacute thrombosis, and we describe the surgical technique for valve explantation.
