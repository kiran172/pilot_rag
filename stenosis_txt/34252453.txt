Title: Comparison of anesthesia management in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the effects of two different anesthetic techniques in our patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: In this study, 303 patients who underwent TAVI procedure with a diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided according to the type of anesthesia given during each procedure as; general anesthesia (GA), local anesthesia (LA).
RESULTS: LA was preferred in 245 (80.8%) of 303 patients who underwent TAVI, while GA was preferred in 58 patients (19.1%). Median ages ​​of our patients who received LA and GA were 83 and 84, respectively. The procedure and anesthesia durations of the patients in the GA group were longer than the LA group (p< 0.00001, p < 0.00001, respectively). Demographic and pre-operative clinical data were similar in comparison between two groups (p > 0.05) except for peripheral artery disease. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity in both groups. While the number of inotrope use was significantly higher in patients who received GA (p < 0.00001), no significant differences were found between LA and GA patients in terms of major complications and mortality (p > 0.05). Intensive care and hospital stays were significantly shorter in the LA group (p = 0.001, p = 0.023, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The anesthetic technique of TAVI procedure did not have a significant effect on outcomes including; complications, mortality and success of the procedure. LA provides shorter duration of procedure and hospital stay.
