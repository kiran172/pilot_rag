Title: [Endoscopic management of complications in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic system and the tracheobronchial tree].

Abstract: Endoscopic methods are nowadays a priceless tool for the treatment of postoperative complications after hepatobiliary, pancreatic and thoracic surgery. Endoscopic decompression of the biliary tract is the treatment of choice for biliary duct leakage after cholecystectomy, hepatic resection or liver transplantation. Postoperative biliary duct stenosis can also be successfully treated by endoscopic balloon dilatation and implantation of various endoprostheses in most of the patients. In the case of pancreatic fistulas, especially those occurring after central or distal pancreatic resections, endoscopic decompression of the pancreatic duct can significantly contribute to rapid healing. Additionally, interventional endosonography provides a valuable treatment option for transgastric drainage of postoperative fluid collections, which often accompany a pancreatic fistula. Various treatment alternatives have been described for the bronchoscopic treatment of bronchopleural and tracheoesophageal fistulas, which often lead to the rapid alleviation of symptoms and often to the definitive closure of the fistula.
