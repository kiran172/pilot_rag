Title: The incidence of obesity, venous sinus stenosis and cerebral hyperaemia in children referred for MRI to rule out idiopathic intracranial hypertension at a tertiary referral hospital: a 10 year review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Children referred to a tertiary hospital for the indication, "rule out idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)" may have an increased risk of raised venous sinus pressure. An increase in sinus pressure could be due to obesity, venous outflow stenosis or cerebral hyperemia. The purpose of this paper is to define the incidence of each of these variables in these children.
METHODS: Following a data base review, 42 children between the ages of 3 and 15 years were found to have been referred over a 10 year period. The body mass index was assessed. The cross sectional areas and circumferences of the venous sinuses were measured at 4 levels to calculate the hydraulic and effective diameters. The arterial inflow, sagittal and straight sinus outflows were measured. Automatic cerebral volumetry allowed the brain volume and cerebral blood flow (CBF) to be calculated. The optic nerve sheath diameter was used as a surrogate marker of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). The sagittal sinus percentage venous return was used as a surrogate marker of elevated venous pressure. Age and sex matched control groups were used for comparison.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, the obesity rates were not significantly different in this cohort. Compared to controls, those at risk for IIH had a 17% reduction in transverse sinus and 14% reduction in sigmoid sinus effective cross sectional area (p = 0.005 and 0.0009). Compared to controls, the patients at risk for IIH had an arterial inflow increased by 34% (p < 0.0001) with a 9% larger brain volume (p = 0.02) giving an increase in CBF of 22% (p = 0.005). The sagittal and straight sinus venous return were reduced by 11% and 4% respectively (p < 0.0001 and 0.0009) suggesting raised venous sinus pressure. Forty five percent of the patients were classified as hyperemic and these had optic nerve sheath diameters 17% larger than controls (p < 0.0002) suggesting raised ICP.
CONCLUSION: In children with the chronic headache/ IIH spectrum, the highest associations were with cerebral hyperemia and mild venous sinus stenosis. Obesity was not significantly different in this cohort. There is evidence to suggest hyperemia increases the venous sinus pressure and ICP.
