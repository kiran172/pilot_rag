Title: LA-to-LV Valved Conduit for Relief of Mitral Stenosis in Patients With HCM and Severe MAC.

Abstract: A left atrium-to-left ventricle valved conduit is an alternative to conventional mitral valve (MV) replacement in patients with MV stenosis associated with a heavily calcified annulus. We describe a series of 6 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who received a valved conduit to bypass a stenotic MV, with or without concomitant septal myectomy.
