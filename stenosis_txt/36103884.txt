Title: Update on Interventional Radiology of the Spine.

Abstract: Interventional radiologists now perform spinal interventions routinely for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. New technologies for the management of spine pathologies have emerged with promising results in terms of safety and efficacy. Interventional radiology techniques in the spine include percutaneous biopsy and therapies for intervertebral disk herniation or spinal stenosis, facet and sacroiliac joint pathologies, vertebral and sacral fractures, and metastases. These techniques can also be easily combined one with the other or to further therapeutic approaches including systemic therapies, surgical approaches, and radiotherapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current percutaneous imaging-guided interventional radiology techniques in the spine. It will help readers become familiar with the most common indications, learn about different technical considerations during performance, and review the available evidence. Controversies concerning new products and technical approaches are also addressed.
