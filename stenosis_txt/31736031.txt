Title: Dynamic Stabilization of the Lumbar Spine using the Dynesys® System.

Abstract: AIM: To present the clinical results in patients with minor instability with Dynesys® a soft spinal stabilization system.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 83 patients were operated upon and the Dynesys® system was applied. Indications for surgery included painful degenerative disc disease, degenerative spondylolisthesis and lumbar canal stenosis.
RESULTS: The results for the Dynesys® system were satisfactory, and we have calculated the overall complication rate to be 20.4% (n=17), which is in agreement with the literature.
CONCLUSION: The Dynesys® dynamic stabilization system effectively protects lumbar motion and achieves lumbar stability in patients with lumbar spinal problems. Our clinical result support literature that Dynesys® system is a strong alternative to fusion and instrumentation system in patient with chronic instabilities.
