Title: Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Loaded Hydrogel Improves Surgical Treatment for Chronic Cerebral Ischemia.

Abstract: Chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) results in a prolonged insufficient blood supply to the brain tissue, leading to impaired neuronal function and subsequent impairment of cognitive and motor abilities. Our previous research showed that in mice with bilateral carotid artery stenosis, the collateral neovascularization post Encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS) treatment could be facilitated by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation. Considering the advantages of biomaterials, we synthesized and modified a gelatin hydrogel for MSCs encapsulation. We then applied this hydrogel on the brain surface during EMS operation in rats with CCI, and evaluated its impact on cognitive performance and collateral circulation. Consequently, MSCs encapsulated in hydrogel significantly augment the therapeutic effects of EMS, potentially by promoting neovascularization, facilitating neuronal differentiation, and suppressing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, taking advantage of multi-RNA-sequencing and in silico analysis, we revealed that MSCs loaded in hydrogel regulate PDCD4 and CASP2 through the overexpression of miR-183-5p and miR-96-5p, thereby downregulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and inhibiting early apoptosis. In conclusion, a gelatin hydrogel to enhance the functionality of MSCs has been developed, and its combination with EMS treatment can improve the therapeutic effect in rats with CCI, suggesting its potential clinical benefit.
