Title: Neointimal dissection - a rare complication to endovascular treatment in grafts and stent grafts.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neointima formation and hyperplasia in vascular grafts may lead to graft complications threatening the patency of the vascular reconstruction. A rare complication to endovascular treatment of grafts and stent grafts is dissection inside the graft.
CASE REPORT: We present here a case of a 69-year-old female with acute occlusion of the limb of an aorto-bifemoral graft for the third time, 16 years after the primary operation. As at the first two occasions, catheter-based intra-arterial thrombolysis was performed, but with residual stenosis inside the graft. During stent placement, dissection of the neointima or fibrin sheet occluded the inflow to the stent. The complication was resolved with placement of kissing stents.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to recognize iatrogenic neointima dissection inside graft and stent grafts, as continued thrombolysis will not solve this, but increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
