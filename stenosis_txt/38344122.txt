Title: Bronchial sleeve resections.

Abstract: Although bronchial sleeve resections were previously defined as an alternative technique to pneumonectomy for patients with limited pulmonary reserve, currently these resections are applied as a standard even in patients having normal pulmonary capacity. Pneumonectomy, itself, is a disease, and sleeve lobectomies can be performed without compromising oncological principles and without causing significant morbidity and mortality. In parallel with the developments in surgical techniques, bronchial sleeve resections can be performed by videothoracoscopic and robotic surgeries. Major complications in sleeve lobectomies are bronchial dehiscence, bronchopleural fistulas, and broncho-arterial fistulas. Late complications are bronchial stenosis and tumor recurrence.
