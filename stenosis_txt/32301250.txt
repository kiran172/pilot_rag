Title: Predictive role of Selvester QRS score in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Few data exist regarding the late clinical impact of the Selvester score prediction of myocardial fibrosis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study evaluated the predictive power of the Selvester score on survival in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe AS who had preoperative electrocardiograms were included. Clinical follow-up was obtained retrospectively. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular death and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Two-hundred twenty-eight patients were included (mean age, 81.5 ± 7.4 years; women, 58.3%). Deceased patients had a higher mean score (4.6 ± 3.2 vs. 1.4 ± 1.3; p < .001). At a mean follow-up of 36.2 ± 21.2 months, the Selvester score was independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-1.84; p < .001), cardiovascular death (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.38-1.74; p < .001), and MACE (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.30-1.68; p < .001). After 5 years, the mortality risk was incrementally related to the Selvester score. The involvement of the inferior wall of the left ventricle was a lower mortality risk factor (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18-0.98; p = .046). For a Selvester score of 3, the area under the curve showed 0.92, 0.94, and 0.86 (p < .001), respectively, for 1, 2, and 3 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Selvester scores increase the risk of poor outcomes in patients with AS undergoing TAVR. The involvement of the anterior or lateral wall presents worse prognosis.
