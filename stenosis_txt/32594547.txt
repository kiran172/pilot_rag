Title: Echocardiographic diagnosis and follow-up for ALCAPA syndrome treated with the Takeuchi procedure.

Abstract: We present the case of an 18-year-old man with aborted sudden cardiac death. His initial echocardiogram suggested an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Diagnosis was confirmed with coronary angiography. He underwent Takeuchi procedure and fully recovered. A two-year follow-up echocardiogram showed a moderate supravalvular pulmonary stenosis related to the transpulmonary baffle. The presence of extensive collateral circulation should raise suspicion of ALCAPA. Postoperative surveillance in this group of patients needs to be oriented in finding complications such as supravalvular pulmonary stenosis, aortic and pulmonary valve insufficiency, and baffle obstruction and leaks.
