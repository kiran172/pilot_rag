Title: Propofol Versus Remifentanil Sedation for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Single Academic Center Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Comparison of remifentanil versus propofol for sedation during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures to analyze the risk of sedation-related hypoxemia and hypotension. Secondary outcomes included the rate of conversion to general anesthesia, procedure length, rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and 30-day mortality.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: A single tertiary teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-nine patients who had propofol or remifentanil sedation for TAVR between March 2017 and March 2020.
INTERVENTION: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 130 patients (50.2%) in the propofol cohort and 129 patients (49.8%) in the remifentanil cohort. The primary outcomes were oxygen saturation nadir values and vasopressor infusion use. Remifentanil was associated with a lower oxygen saturation nadir, as compared to propofol (91.3% v . 95.4%, p < 0.001). Risk factors associated with hypoxemia (defined as <92%) were body mass index (p = 0.0004), obstructive sleep apnea (p = 0.004), and remifentanil maintenance (p < 0.001). Vasopressor infusion use was significantly higher with propofol (64.9% v . 8.5%, p < 0.001). Propofol maintenance and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor-blocker use were the only variables identified as risk factors for vasopressor use (p < 0.001 and p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing TAVR with conscious sedation, remifentanil was associated with more hypoxemia while propofol was associated with a higher rate of vasopressor use.
