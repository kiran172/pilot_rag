Title: Is There a Link Between Carotid Atherosclerosis and Idiopathic Overactive Bladder Among Women with Metabolic Syndrome?

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between increased intima-media thickness (IMT) and atherosclerotic carotid plaque (CP) with idiopathic overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) in women with metabolic syndrome (MetS).
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, which included consecutive women aged 40-75 years with MetS, seeking medical assistance at a reference center between April and December 2016. OAB-V8 questionnaire was used to estimate the prevalence of OAB symptoms, which were defined by a score ≥8 points. All patients underwent bilateral carotid artery ultrasound to assess IMT and CP. Atherosclerosis was defined by the identification of CP during ultrasound, which was diagnosed according to the Mannheim carotid intima-media thickness and plaque consensus.
RESULTS: Forty-five women were prospectively included. Mean age was 60±9.3 years (range 40-75 ys). Eighteen (40%) patients were diagnosed with OAB. IMT in the general population was 0.72 mm (SD = 0.20). Overall prevalence of atherosclerosis, defined by the presence of the carotid artery plaque, was 51%. OAB prevalence among women with atherosclerosis was higher than in those without atherosclerosis (56.52% versus 22.73%), with a prevalence ratio of 2.49 (p=0.04). Additionally, OAB was associated with degree of carotid stenosis (p = 0.029).
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of female patients with MetS, there was an association between carotid atherosclerosis and OAB. Identification of carotid ultrasound abnormalities may lead to refined treatment decision-making among OAB patients.
