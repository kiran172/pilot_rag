Title: Commissural Alignment With ACURATE neo2 Valve in an Unselected Population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Commissural alignment has become an important topic in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) because it may improve coronary access, facilitate future valve procedures, and possibly improve valve durability. The efficacy of commissural alignment with ACURATE neo2 has not yet been shown in a large population.
OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to determine the feasibility and success of attempting commissural alignment in an unselected TAVR population treated with the ACURATE neo2 prosthetic heart valve.
METHODS: A total of 170 consecutive patients underwent TAVR with a dedicated implantation technique to align the TAVR valve to the native valve. Using right-left overlap and 3-cusp views, valve orientation was adjusted by rotation of the unexpanded valve at the level of the aortic root. Effectiveness was assessed postprocedure as the degree of misalignment determined by analyzing fluoroscopic valve orientation to corresponding cusp orientation on preprocedural computed tomography. Safety endpoints included mortality, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and additional complications through 30 days.
RESULTS: Of 170 patients, 167 (98.2%) could be analyzed for alignment, and all 170, for safety outcomes. Most patients (97%) had successful alignment (≤ mild misalignment), with 80% with commissural alignment, while the degrees of misalignment were 17% mild, 1.2% moderate, 1.8% severe.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large evaluation of a commissural alignment technique, alignment was achieved in nearly all patients without safety concerns or impact to procedure duration. Commissural alignment appears effective and safe across all patients with this novel technique.
