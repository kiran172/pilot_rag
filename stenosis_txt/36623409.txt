Title: Impact of Mild Paravalvular Regurgitation on Long-Term Clinical Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: The impact of mild paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains controversial. We evaluated the impact of mild PVR after TAVI on long-term clinical outcomes. We included patients who underwent TAVI for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis between December 2008 and June 2019 at 2 international centers and compared all-cause death between the group with mild PVR (group 1) and the group with none or trace PVR (group 2). PVR was categorized using a 3-class grading scheme, and patients with PVR ≧ moderate and those who were lost to follow-up were excluded. This retrospective analysis included 1,404 patients (mean age 81.7 ± 6.5 years, 58.0% women). Three hundred fifty eight patients (25.5%) were classified into group 1 and 1,046 patients (74.5%) into group 2. At baseline, group 1 was older and had a lower body mass index, worse co-morbidities, and more severe aortic stenosis. To account for these differences, propensity score matching was performed, resulting in 332 matched pairs. Within these matched groups, during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, group 1 had a significantly lower survival rate at 5 years (group 1: 62.0% vs group 2: 68.0%, log-rank p = 0.029, hazard ratio: 1.41 [95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 1.91]). In the matched cohort, patients with mild PVR had a significant 1.4-fold increased risk of mortality at 5 years after TAVI compared with those with none or trace PVR. Further studies with more patients are needed to evaluate the impact of longer-term outcomes.
