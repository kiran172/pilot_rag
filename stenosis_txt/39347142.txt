Title: Platelet-Rich Plasma in Urogynecology: A Case Series.

Abstract: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) use in urogynecology is expanding as it shows good results with minimal side effects. We present three new indications of PRP use in urogynecology that have not been previously reported. Our case series demonstrated that PRP improved wound healing and recovery in a woman with chronic obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) after home delivery, decreased pain in a patient suffering from vulvodynia, and enhanced epithelization in recurrent vaginal stenosis after Fournier gangrene. We have also reviewed patient selection criteria, PRP preparation prerequisites, and techniques. A safe, simple protocol with an optimal platelet yield without using commercial PRP kits is described.
