Title: [Surgical plan selection and efficacy analysis in 32 cases of laryngotracheal stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the optimization of surgical procedures for laryngotracheal stenosis and its effect analysis. Methods: The data of 32 patients with acquired laryngotracheal stenosis who received surgical treatment from October 2015 to December 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. The age ranged from 19 to 72 years, with an average of (34.0±9.0) years. The medical history ranged from 1 to 32 months (median 3 months). As for etiology, there were 30 cases of iatrogenic laryngotracheal stenosis, including 20 cases of tracheal intubation and 10 cases of tracheotomy (7 cases of percutaneous tracheotomy and 3 cases of traditional tracheotomy). There were 1 case of laryngotracheal trauma and 1 case of airway Penicillium marneffei infection. According to Myer-Cotton grading system, grade Ⅳ stenosis was found in 14 cases, including 12 cases involving trachea and 2 cases involving trachea and subglottic area.There were 18 cases of grade Ⅲ, all of which involved the cervical trachea 5 cases failed in operation in other hospitals. According to stenosis grading, course of disease, primary disease control and the patient's general condition, the surgical plan was determined individually. The operations of end-to-end anastomosis, circumferential tracheal partial resection, T-tube placement and CO<sub>2</sub> laser tracheal scar resection were performed respectively. The recovery of airway function and perioperative complications were observed one year after operation. Results: End-to-end anastomosis was performed in 16 cases, and partial circumferential tracheal resection in 2 cases, and tracheal granulation (scar) resection by CO<sub>2</sub> laser in 2 cases and T-tube insertion in 12 cases. Eighteen cases which performed end-to-end anastomosis, partial resection of circumferential trachea in and 2 cases which performed laser tracheal scar resection were all recovered airway function at one stage. After 1 year, 19 cases were cured and 1 case was effective. Of 12 patients with T tube implantation, 11 cases were successfully extubated after 6-12 months, 7 cases were cured after 1 year, 2 cases were effective and 3 cases were ineffective. Among the 3 cases of failure, 2 cases were successfully extubated by sleeve resection and end-to-end anastomosis in the second stage, and the other case refused to accept other treatment methods and the T-tube was placed again, and the tube was blocked and the patient survived. During the follow-up period, the total cure rate was 87.5%, the effective rate was 9.4%, and the total extubation rate was 96.9%.The most common complication was subcutaneous emphysema, accounting for 78% (25/32), but no serious mediastinal emphysema or pneumothorax occurred. In the T-tube implantation group, granulation tissue grew in different degrees around the neck wound after operation, and improved or disappeared after 6-9 months. Anterior cervical tracheal fistula occurred in 4 cases of T-tube implantation group after extubation, which were cured by sealing the stoma. There were no complications such as severe bleeding or perioperative death. Conclusion: When there were various factors, the optimization of the surgical plan according to the degree of stenosis, the course of disease, the control of primary disease and the general condition was an important guarantee to improve the curative effect of laryngotracheal stenosis.
