Title: Iatrogenic bioprosthetic, self-expandable, transcatheter aortic valve replacement dysfunction after cardiac catheterization.

Abstract: Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) is typically a progressive process related to natural wear of the prosthesis. With acute presentations, possible durability issues or iatrogenic causes need to be considered. Here, we present 2 patients with acute BVD of self-expanding, transcatheter aortic valve replacement post-heart catheterization. The presentations and outcomes, in otherwise normally functioning valves antecedent to the heart catheterizations, raise the question of the increased complexity of coronary access in this valve platform, and whether that or other features provide for greater risk of such events. We believe this to be the first publication of such events and they help to highlight the importance of valve implantation planning, as well as familiarity with the potential complexity of coronary access during heart catheterization.
