Title: Long-term outcomes and determinants of stenosis recurrence after renal artery angioplasty in hypertensive patients with renovascular disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Restenosis (RS) following percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) of renal artery stenosis (RAS) might have an unfavourable impact on renal function and blood pressure (BP) outcomes.
AIM: To evaluate the prevalence and predictors of RS in patients treated with PTA for RAS, and the relationship between BP and renal function (RF) changes with RS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed freedom from RS in 210 patients (age 64.6 ±12.8 years; range: 20-85), who underwent 248 successful stent-assisted PTAs in RAS. The change in levels of serum creatinine (SCC), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), systolic/diastolic BPs (SBP/DBP) were analysed prior to PTA, at 6-, 12-month, and final follow-up visits, and whenever RS was diagnosed.
RESULTS: RS was identified in 30 (14.3%) patients, and there were 36 (14.5%) lesions. The Kaplan-Meier RS-free survival curves in fibromuscular dysplasia, atherosclerosis, and vasculitis at 1 and 7 years were: 100% and 100%; 95.6 and 83.9%; and 71.4 and 39.7%, respectively. Patients with RS, as compared to RS-free patients, presented with less pronounced changes in respect with: SBP (1.4 ±17.6 vs. -15.8 ±25.8 mm Hg; p = 0.01), DBP (2.64 ±10.1 vs. -6.5 ±14.1 mm Hg; p = 0.002), SCC (22.4 ±55.2 vs. -3.6 ±43.9 µmol/l; p = 0.002), and eGFR (-1.85 ±18 vs. -5.34 ±19.5 mm Hg; p = 0.045). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, independent predictors of RS occurred: lack of BP decrease (HR = 4.19, 95% CI: 1.67-10.3; p = 0.002), eGFR increase &lt; 0.17 ml/min/1.73 m2 (HR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.08-7.91; p = 0.033), stent diameter ≤ 5 mm (HR = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.09-6.97; p = 0.031), and vasculitis (HR = 5.61, 95% CI: 1.83-17.2; p = 0.003). RS was treated in 24 patients with RS recurrence in 20%.
CONCLUSIONS: The RS rate differs depending on RAS aetiology. Lack of SBP/DBP and eGFR improvement, vasculitis, and stent diameter are associated with RS risk. Repeated PTA is effective, but recurrent RS occurs in 20% of cases.
