Title: Mechanical Thrombectomy and Stenting for Radiation-Induced Carotid Stenosis-Related Stroke: A Case Report.

Abstract: Radiation-induced stenosis of the carotid artery is a significant risk factor for large-vessel ischemic stroke, which usually leads to significant impairment of neurological function. We performed intra-arterial thrombectomy on a 63-year-old male patient who had laryngeal cancer and postradiation carotid stenosis. He presented with acute-onset dysarthria and left hemiplegia. Brain computed tomography perfusion scan showed right middle cerebral artery ischemic change. Angiography confirmed total occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy with carotid stenting was performed immediately, and recanalization was achieved. The patient fully recovered and was discharged after a 1-week hospitalization. Our experience suggests that early intervention for radiation-related carotid stenosis might be essential and beneficial for the outcome of large-vessel ischemic stroke.
