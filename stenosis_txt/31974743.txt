Title: Catheter-Directed Thrombectomy for Highly Symptomatic Patients with Iliofemoral Deep Venous Thrombosis not Responsive to Conservative Treatment.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The use of pharmacomechanical thrombectomy in patients with symptomatic iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) not responsive to conservative treatment is under-investigated until now. This prompted us to review and analyze our results (technical/clinical outcome, complications) and compare them to the current literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2013 and 2019, 19 patients (14 women and 5 men; mean age: 41.2 years, SD: 18.2) with iliofemoral DVT and excessive pain not responsive to conservative treatment were treated with pharmacomechanical thrombectomy. Patients were followed up for 12 months. Demographics, technical success and clinical outcome data (pain score/Villalta score) were collected.
RESULTS: Thrombectomy ± thrombolysis was successful in all cases (n = 19). No major complications were observed. Eight out of nineteen cases developed hematoma at the sheath insertion site not requiring further treatment. Seven out of nineteen cases required additional continuous lysis for complete iliofemoral clot solution. All patients received balloon angioplasty to treat post-thrombotic strictures. In 16/19 cases, stents were placed to preserve iliofemoral caliber and maintain unrestricted iliac venous outflow. Three patients (16%) required re-intervention due to re-thrombosis or in-stent stenosis after 4, 14 days and 4 months, respectively. Symptoms could be improved temporarily or indefinitely in 19 out of 19 patients. 1 year following thrombectomy mean pain score was reduced by 87%, mean Villalta score was 2.6 (SD: 4), and iliofemoral veins were patent in 15/17 patients.
CONCLUSION: In symptomatic patients with iliofemoral DVT, refractory to conservative treatment, catheter-directed thrombectomy enables rapid and long-lasting pain relief. High patency rates can be achieved in patients receiving PTA and venous stenting post-thrombectomy.
