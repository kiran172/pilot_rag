Title: Predicting severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis using proximal left anterior descending coronary artery tortuosity and the angle between the left main and anterior descending coronary arteries: a retrospective cross-sectional study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary bifurcation angles influence plaque initiation in the coronary artery, and changes in blood flow caused by tortuosity in the coronary arteries can reduce blood pressure distal to the tortuous portion of the coronary artery, leading to myocardial ischemia. We aimed to describe two factors (coronary artery tortuosity and bifurcation angle) as one descriptor for the evaluation of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) disease.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 133 consecutive patients who underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) for angina symptoms between November 2019 and January 2020. The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of significant LAD stenosis on CTA (defined as LAD stenosis >50%). The straight length of the vessel was measured using the central luminal line of the flow path, and, calculated using proprietary algorithms in TeraRecon software. We used three-dimensional volume rendering and two-dimensional axial images to measure the left main coronary artery (LM)-LAD angles.
RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, there were significant differences in the linear distance between the endpoints of the 20 mm actual curve of the LAD (d20), cosine value for LM-LAD angle (cosθ) <0.8, age, presence of hypertension or diabetes, and number of pack years [hazard ratio (HR): 2.70, 8.04, 1.05, 3.70, 2.82, and 1.04; P=0.029, P<0.001, P=0.020, P=0.024, P=0.021, and P=0.002, respectively]. However, in the multivariate analysis, the cosθ multiplied by d20 (d20*cosθ) <15.5, presence of hypertension and number of pack years (HR: 11.36, 4.54, and 1.04; P<0.001, P=0.019, and P=0.003, respectively) were predictors of significant proximal LAD stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: As the tortuosity and LM-LAD angle increased (d20 and cosθ decreased, respectively), the chance of proximal LAD lesions formation increased. d20*cosθ might be useful as a predictor of proximal LAD stenosis.
