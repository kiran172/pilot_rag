Title: A transconjunctival surgical technique for dacryocystotomy in dogs with foreign body-induced dacryocystitis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe a simplified, less invasive dacryocystotomy technique that allows for complete inspection of the canine lacrimal sac and to retrospectively evaluate this surgical technique in a larger series of dogs. The anatomical background of the canine nasolacrimal system is described as a basis for the surgical technique.
METHODS: Records of dogs from 2003 to 2023 which were diagnosed with dacryocystitis due to presumed foreign body and underwent surgical exploration and removal of foreign bodies within the lacrimal sac using this technique were reviewed. Postoperative treatment and outcome were evaluated.
RESULTS: Records of 48 dogs were included. A foreign body was discovered during the surgery or upon retrieval of the catheter in 85% of cases (41/48). An indwelling catheter was placed in 83% of cases (40/48) for a median of 21 days. At the last recheck, the nasolacrimal duct was patent in 87% of the cases (41/47). The median follow-up time was 34 days (3-1255 days). The most commonly affected breeds were Golden retrievers (11) and dachshunds (8). The following complications occurred: two dogs removed or partly removed the catheter themselves (day 7, day 14), and one dog showed marked irritation at the catheter site which had to be removed by day 10.
CONCLUSIONS: The transconjunctival dacryocystotomy technique is simple and less invasive than other described techniques with a successful long-term outcome in the majority of cases.
