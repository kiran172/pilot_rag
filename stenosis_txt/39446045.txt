Title: Impactful Cardiac CT and MRI Articles from 2023.

Abstract: Cardiac imaging is important in diagnosing, treating, and predicting prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease. Imaging protocols and analysis are consistently evolving, and the implementation of artificial intelligence-based applications is of increasing interest. This review presents recent advancements in noninvasive cardiac imaging, specifically focusing on cardiac CT and MRI, from notable publications across multidisciplinary journals in 2023 of interest to both radiologists and referring clinicians in the field. The discussion encompasses the latest trials of CT fractional flow reserve and the performance of the newest generation of photon-counting detector CT, particularly in coronary stenosis quantification. Additionally, it addresses coronary plaque quantification using artificial intelligence applications and their implications from large patient cohorts, alongside prognostic outcomes, and the value of coronary artery calcification scores. Various aspects of CT trials, such as anatomic planning before revascularization, high-risk plaque features, outcomes, and pericoronary fat index, are evaluated. New insights from cardiac MRI trials for cardiomyopathies, including cardiac amyloidosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and valvular disease, are also outlined. The review concludes by highlighting impactful societal statements and guidelines.
