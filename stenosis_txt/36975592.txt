Title: Lipoprotein(a) and Its Autoantibodies in Association with Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the Western world. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an independent risk factor of coronary heart disease (CHD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). The aim of this study was to assess the role of Lp(a) and its autoantibodies [autoAbs] in CAVS in patients with and without CHD. We included 250 patients (mean age 69 ± 3 years, males 42%) and divided them into three groups. There were two groups of patients with CAVS depending on the presence (group 1) or absence of CHD (group 2). The control group included the patients without CHD or CAVS. According to logistic regression analysis, levels of Lp(a), IgM autoAbs to oxidized Lp(a) (oxLp(a)), and age were independent predictors of CAVS. A concomitant increase in Lp(a) level (≥30 mg/dL) and a decrease in IgM autoAbs concentration (&lt;9.9 lab. Units) are associated with CAVS with an odds ratio (OR) of 6.4, p &lt; 0.01, and with CAVS and CHD with an OR of 17.3, p &lt; 0.001. IgM autoantibodies to oxLp(a) are associated with calcific aortic valve stenosis regardless of Lp(a) concentration and other risk factors. Higher Lp(a) and lower IgM autoantibodies to oxLp(a) levels are associated with a much higher risk of calcific aortic valve stenosis.
