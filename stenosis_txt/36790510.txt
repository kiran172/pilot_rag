Title: Curable leakage in stapled IPAA has little effect on the long-term pouch function.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and grade of anastomotic leakage (AL) in stapled ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and its long-term impact on the pouch functions.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted on UC patients who underwent stapled IPAA at Yokohama City University Medical Center between 2007 and 2018. The diagnosis and grading of AL were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer. We assessed the functional pouch rate, late complication, pouch survival rate, bowel function (bowel movements per day, soiling, spotting, difficulty in distinguishing feces from flatus) and pouch inflammation (pouchitis disease activity index; PDAI) in the long-term period.
RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-six patients were analyzed. Twenty-three (8.3%; grade B/C; 13/10) patients were diagnosed with AL, but a functional pouch was achieved in all the twenty-three patients. Anastomotic stricture was significantly more common in patients with AL (AL group) than in patients without AL (non-AL group; AL/non-AL: 13.0/3.2%, p = 0.020). There were no differences in other late complications. Furthermore, the pouch survival rate did not differ between the AL and non-AL groups (100.0/97.9%/10 years, p = 0.494). There were no differences between the groups in bowel movements per day, spotting, soling, difficulty in distinguishing feces from flatus, or PDAI postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Curable AL may not affect late complications (except anastomotic stricture), pouch survival, the bowel function, or pouch inflammation over the long term. Perioperative management to prevent the severity of AL is as important as preventing its occurrence.
