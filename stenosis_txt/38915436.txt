Title: Non-contrast preoperative MRI for determining renal perfusion and visualizing renal arteries in potential living kidney donors at 1.5 Tesla.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to create and evaluate a preoperative non-contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/angiography (MRA) protocol to assess renal function and visualize renal arteries and any abnormalities in potential living kidney donors.
METHODS: In total, 28 subjects were examined using scintigraphy to determine renal function. In addition, 3D-pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL), a 2D-non-CE electrocardiogram-triggered radial quiescent interval slice-selective (QISS-MRA), and 4D-CE time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories (CE-MRA) were performed to assess renal perfusion, visualize renal arteries and detect any abnormalities. Two glomerular filtration rates [described by Gates (GFR<sub>G</sub>) and according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula (GFR<sub>CKD-EPI</sub>)]. The renal volumes were determined using both MRA techniques.
RESULTS: The mean value of regional renal blood flow (rRBF) on the right side was significantly higher than that on the left. The agreements between QISS-MRA and CE-MRA concerning the assessment of absence or presence of an aberrant artery and renal arterial stenosis were perfect. The mean renal volumes measured in the right kidney with QISS-MRA were lower than the corresponding values of CE-MRA. In contrast, the mean renal volumes measured in the left kidney with both MRA techniques were similar. The correlation between the GFR<sub>G</sub> and rRBF was compared in the same manner as that between GFR<sub>CKD-EPI</sub> and rRBF.
CONCLUSION: The combination of pCASL and QISS-MRA constitute a reliable preoperative protocol with a total measurement time of <10Â min without the potential side effects of gadolinium-based contrast agents or radiation exposure.
