Title: The first major complication due to laser treatment for stress urinary incontinence: a short report.

Abstract: AIM: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common benign disease causing a markedly negative impact on quality of life. Vaginal laser is a minimally invasive treatment and no major complications of this technique have been published to date. The purpose of the article is to present the first major adverse event related to this treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present the case of a 48-year-old woman with an important complication after vaginal laser for SUI.
RESULTS: The patient presented a transverse vaginal septum and shortening of vaginal length after two sessions of vaginal erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser treatment. She required two surgical interventions, local injections, and pelvic floor physiotherapy, although currently the patient has not experienced complete resolution of symptoms.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal laser use can lead to serious adverse events. Selection of patients and treatment must be carried out with caution.
