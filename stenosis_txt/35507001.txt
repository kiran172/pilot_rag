Title: Transition in cardiology 2: Maternal and fetal congenital heart disease.

Abstract: The number of women with congenital heart disease (CHD) reaching reproductive age has been increasing. Many women with CHDs are desirous of pregnancy, but they face issues regarding preconception, antepartum, and postpartum management. On the other hand, the fetal diagnosis of CHD has improved with advances in the technique and equipment for fetal echocardiography. Recently, experiences with fetal intervention have been reported in patients with severe CHD, such as critical aortic stenosis. Nevertheless, some types of CHD are challenge to diagnose prenatally, resulting in adverse outcomes. Medical care is part of the transitional care for women and fetuses with CHD during the perinatal period. Pre-conceptional and prenatal counseling play an important role in transitional care. Sex and reproductive education need to be performed as early as possible. We herein review the current status, important issues to be resolved, and the future of maternal and fetal CHD to relevant caregivers.
