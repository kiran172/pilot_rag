Title: Congenital colonic stenosis: an unusual cause of colonic obstruction masquerading as Hirschsprung's disease in infancy.

Abstract: Congenital colonic stenosis (CCS) is an extremely rare cause of large bowel obstruction in early infancy. Only 35 cases of CCS have been reported in literature to date. CCS often causes a diagnostic quandary as it is difficult to distinguish it clinically from Hirschsprung's disease. We report a case of an infant with CCS who was managed with resection of the diseased colonic segment with critical stenosis at two sites and colo-colonic anastomosis. In our report, we discuss the challenges faced in the diagnosis and surgical management of this unusual case.
