Title: State of the Art Management of Aortic Valve Disease in Ankylosing Spondylitis.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiac involvement in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) generally manifests itself as aortic insufficiency, aortitis, disturbance in cardiac conduction, and myocardial dysfunction. We have used a case-based approach to review the current state of the art knowledge regarding the diagnosis and management of aortic valve disease and aortitis in patients with AS.
RECENT FINDINGS: The risk for aortic valve disease and aortic valve replacement or repair is significantly higher than in people without AS, and this risk increases with age. Echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and CT can serve as effective tools for screening and follow-up. Surgical repair/replacement remains the mainstay of therapy for aortic insufficiency and aortic dilation, whereas transcatheter-based techniques may be favorable in the setting of aortic stenosis. Aortic valve and atrioventricular conduction abnormalities contribute to overall cardiovascular burden in AS. Optimal timing and therapeutic technique are dependent on assessment of overall risk and serial follow-up.
