Title: Dilatation of hepaticojejunostomy anastomotic stricture with a drill dilator during balloon enteroscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

Abstract: Endoscopic options are limited when balloon dilators fail to pass through hepaticojejunostomy anastomotic strictures during balloon enteroscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Okamoto and colleagues demonstrate successful intrahepatic duct drainage in a patient with a history of extended left hepatectomy with roux-en-Y reconstruction using Tornus ES, a new drill dilator.
