Title: Impact of pulmonary artery coarctation on pulmonary artery growth and definitive repair following modified Blalock-Taussig shunt.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary artery coarctation may pose a risk for pulmonary stenosis and subsequent failure to achieve definitive repair. We sought to assess the impact of pulmonary artery coarctation on pulmonary artery growth.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in 130 patients, including 37 single ventricles with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt as first palliation. Pulmonary artery coarctation was defined as discrete stenosis of the pulmonary artery, with a diameter of less than 3 mm and with the ductus arteriosus connected. Preoperative echocardiography showed pulmonary artery coarctation in 29 patients (22%). Concomitant pulmonary artery plasty was performed in 14 patients with discrete stenosis having a diameter of less than 2 mm.
RESULTS: Pre-modified Blalock-Taussig shunt left pulmonary artery z-scores were lower in patients with pulmonary artery coarctation than in those without (-4.0 [-5.8, -2.1] vs -1.7 [-2.6, -0.8], P < .001), and this remained the same even after modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (-2.5 [-5.1, -0.5] vs -0.5 [-2.4, 0.8], P = .010). Concomitant pulmonary artery plasty did not result in catch-up growth of the left pulmonary artery (post-modified Blalock-Taussig shunt left pulmonary artery z-score in patients with pulmonary artery plasty: -3.0 (-6.5, -2.0) versus those without: -1.8 (-3.3, -0.3), P = .279). Definitive repair/Fontan completion was achieved in 111 patients (85%), and this was not affected by the presence of pulmonary artery coarctation.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery coarctation affected disproportionate pulmonary artery growth throughout the staged repair, but did not result in failure of definitive repair/Fontan completion. Pulmonary artery plasty during the neonatal period did not contribute to catch-up growth of the left pulmonary artery; therefore, surgical indications and timing should be carefully considered.
