Title: Hydrocephalus Research.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This paper highlights the hydrocephalus research efforts undertaken at AIIMS, New Delhi, supporting progress in the field.
MATERIAL: Over a period of three decades, basic research, clinical investigations, and multicentric studies were undertaken. This report will review the work mainly to emphasize the need for future generations to pursue further research. Studies that impacted hydrocephalus care (mainly in India) are described, and some of these findings may be useful in other resource-challenged situations.
RESULTS: Investigative studies on the effect of shunting on brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER), transcranial Doppler (TCD), and CT-SPECT were published offering management options for patients. Participation in the International Infant Hydrocephalus Study (IIHS) study offered opportunities to compare our approaches and develop modifications in patient care. This effort proved shunting was equal or better for young children with congenital aqueductal stenosis. Shunt infection protocols and changes made in a systematic manner helped develop local protocols to reduce postoperative shunt infections.
CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocephalus research over three decades at AIIMS, New Delhi was productive and educational, confirming that locally performed investigative work can help in decision making. Further studies and active participation in international efforts are necessary to advance the field.
