Title: Post-extubation laryngitis in children: diagnosis, management and follow-up.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To describe the occurrence of post-extubation laryngitis, analyze its one-year evolution, and correlate laryngeal lesions with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Retrospective study including children up to 13 years old at a tertiary hospital between March 2020 and March 2022 with diagnosis of post-extubation laryngitis confirmed by endoscopic examination. Exclusion criteria were prior history of intubation or anatomical airway abnormalities. Medical records were reviewed to characterize patients, underlying diagnosis, laryngeal lesions, treatment, and outcomes at 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: The study included 38 endoscopically confirmed post-extubation laryngitis cases, corresponding to 86.4% of suspected cases. The mean age was 13.24 months, and 60.5% were male. Acute respiratory failure was the leading cause of intubation. Initial treatment was clinical, and initial diagnosis was defined by nasopharynoglaryngoscopy and/or Microlaryngoscopy and Bronchoscopy (MLB) findings. Initial diagnostic MLB was performed in 65.7% of the patients. Approximately half (53%) of the patients exhibited moderate or severe laryngeal lesions. When compared to mild cases, these patients experienced a higher rate of extubation failures (mean of 1.95 vs. 0.72, p = 0.0013), underwent more endoscopic procedures, and faced worse outcomes, such as the increased need for tracheostomy (p = 0.0001) and the development of laryngeal stenosis (p = 0.0450). Tracheostomy was performed in 14 (36.8%) children. Patients undergoing tracheostomy presented more extubation failures and longer intubation periods. Eight (21%) developed laryngeal stenosis, and 17 (58.6%) had complete resolution on follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Post-extubation laryngitis is a frequent diagnosis among patients with clinical symptoms or failed extubation. The severity of laryngeal lesions was linked to a less favorable prognosis observed at one-year follow-up. Otolaryngological evaluation, follow-up protocols, and increased access to therapeutic resources are essential to manage these children properly.
