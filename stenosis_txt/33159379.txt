Title: Buccal mucosal ureteroplasty for the management of ureteric strictures: A systematic review of the literature.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature evaluating the efficacy and safety of buccal mucosa ureteroplasty.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out using a protocol devised a priori. The review was registered with the Joanna Briggs Institute. Results were scrutinized and full text of all relevant articles was obtained for review.
RESULTS: A systematic search resulted in 1092 articles, with scrutiny resulting in 1079 exclusions. Two additional articles were identified from references, resulting in a total of 15 included studies containing a total of 72 buccal mucosal ureteroplasty procedures. A total of 34 cases were carried out using the open approach, and 38 were carried out using the robot assisted approach. The overall reported success rate was reported to be 66 out of 72 (91.6%), being 32 out of 34 (94.1%) and 34 out of 38 (89.5%) open and robotic cases, respectively. The complication rate was reported in 60 cases, being 15 out of 60 (25%) for all complications, with a 5% (3/60) rate for complications graded as Clavien-Dindo score â‰¥3.
CONCLUSIONS: Buccal mucosa ureteroplasty appears to have high success rates and low rates of serious complications in both open and robot assisted approaches. However, the current available literature is limited to 72 cases, and further studies with larger patient populations and ongoing longitudinal review are warranted.
