Title: Fenestrated-branched endovascular aortic repair in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Renal function impairment is a common complication after open repair of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). The purpose of this study was to assess renal perioperative outcomes and renal function deterioration after fenestrated-branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F/BEVAR) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: The study included 186 patients who underwent F/BEVAR between 2013 and 2018 for suprarenal, juxtarenal, and type I to type IV TAAAs. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and CKD were defined using RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage renal disease) and CKD staging system (stage ≥3, GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2), respectively. For those without baseline CKD, renal decline was defined as a drop in GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (ie, progression to CKD stage 3 or higher). For patients with baseline renal dysfunction, GFR decline ≥20% or progression in CKD stage (ie, from stage 3 to stage 4) was considered renal decline.
RESULTS: CKD was present in 83 patients (44.6%). Postoperative AKI was diagnosed in 27 patients (14.5%); 13 (48.1%) had history of CKD and 14 (51.9%) had adequate renal function preoperatively (P = .8). None of these patients required permanent renal replacement therapy. Intraoperative technical success was 100%. Overall 30-day mortality was 1.1%. There was no difference in 30-day mortality in patients with (1.2%) and without (1.0%) CKD (P = .5). During a median follow-up time of 12 months (interquartile range, 6-23 months), renal decline was observed in 21 patients (25.3%) with previous CKD and in 11 patients (10.6%) without CKD (P = .01). Among patients with previous CKD, 18 patients (9%) progressed from stage 3 CKD to stage 4. In patients with progression in CKD stage, two (5%) had renal stent stenosis requiring restenting. Among patients with renal decline, 13 had juxtarenal aneurysms (21.3%), 27 had suprarenal aneurysms (44.3%), and 21 had TAAAs (34.3%; P = .4). Subset analysis of patients who developed AKI in the immediate postoperative period found that patients with a history of CKD were less likely to experience freedom from renal decline.
CONCLUSIONS: F/BEVAR is an effective and safe procedure for patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms and TAAAs, even among patients with CKD. The frequency of AKI was not affected by pre-existing CKD. Midterm outcomes demonstrated that progression of CKD was more frequent among patients with pre-existing CKD, but permanent renal replacement therapy was not required. Anatomic extent of aneurysms did not affect CKD progression. CKD patients are susceptible to renal decline over time if they experience AKI in the postoperative period. Therefore, preventing AKI in the postoperative period should be regarded as a priority. Long-term effects of CKD after F/BEVAR remain to be elucidated.
