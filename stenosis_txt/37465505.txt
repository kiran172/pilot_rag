Title: Effect of intubation in patients with functional epiphora after endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy.

Abstract: AIM: To investigate the effect of bicanalicular silicone tube intubation (BSTI) in the treatment of functional epiphora after endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (En-DCR).
METHODS: Clinical data of 84 patients (95 eyes) with functional epiphora after En-DCR were retrospectively analyzed. Functional epiphora was confirmed as persistent or recurrent epiphora by fluorescein dye disappearance test (FDDT), lacrimal irrigation test, as well as endoscopic examination. Secondary BSTIs were recommended for patients with functional epiphora. These tubes were removed 1mo after surgery. Functional success and associated complications were assessed after 2y of follow-up.
RESULTS: Seven patients (9 eyes) refused intervention, 5 patients (6 eyes) did not complete postoperative follow-up, and 1 patient (1 eye) developed tube prolapse within 1mo after surgery. Seventy-one patients (79 eyes) were included at last. Functional success ratios at six months, one year, as well as two years post-operation were 94.9% (75/79), 92.4% (73/79), and 91.1% (72/79), respectively. Three eyes presented with punctal slitting (2 eyes without epiphora), 1 eye with proximal canaliculus slitting, 1 eye with canaliculus stenosis and 4 eyes with still present functional epiphora without detectable abnormal at the last follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Secondary intubation is an effective procedure with low recurrence probability for functional epiphora after En-DCR. Punctal and canaliculus injury are the main tube-associated complications after secondary intubation.
