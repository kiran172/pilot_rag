Title: Management of obstructive urethroliths, urethral pseudodiverticulum, and stricture by diverticulectomy, urethroplasty, and urethral stenting placement in a male goat.

Abstract: A 5-year-old wether was presented for an acute onset of loss of appetite and inability to urinate. Urethral urolithiasis causing urethral obstruction was diagnosed and a cystostomy catheter was placed. The wether continued to be unable to urinate through the urethra and further developed a perineal pseudodiverticulum. Diverticulectomy followed by a urethroplasty using porcine small intestinal submucosa was performed to relieve the obstruction. The wether developed a urethral stricture following urethroplasty and the owners refused a perineal urethroplasty. Cystourethrography, fluoroscopic-guided balloon dilations, and urethral stent placement were done to establish urethral patency. The wether developed tissue ingrowth through the stent, resulting in recurrent obstruction that necessitated placement of covered urethral stents. Key clinical message: Although obstructive uroliths usually carry a guarded prognosis in small ruminants, the use of novel interventional radiology techniques along with urethroplasty using a xenograft allowed a wether to achieve urethral patency and normal urinations.
