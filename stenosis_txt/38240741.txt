Title: Spinal surgery and the risk of reoperation after total hip arthroplasty: a cohort study based on Swedish spine and hip arthroplasty registers.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies suggest increased revision risk of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in individuals with lumbar spinal fusion, but studies including non-fused individuals are lacking. We aimed to investigate whether individuals undergoing lumbar spinal stenosis surgery with or without fusion are at an increased risk of reoperation before or after THA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Swedish Spine Register and the Swedish arthroplasty register were searched from 2000 through 2021. Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier and binary multivariate logistic regression were used to compare reoperation rates up to 10 years after THA surgery.
RESULTS: 7,908 individuals had undergone lumbar spinal stenosis surgery (LSSS) (fusion n = 1,281) and THA. LSSS before THA compared with THA-only controls was associated with a higher risk of THA reoperations: 87 (2%) out of 3,892 vs. 123 (1%) out of 11,662 (P < 0.001). LSSS after THA compared with THA-only controls was not associated with a higher risk of reoperation, confirmed by Kaplan- Meier analyses and binary multivariate logistic regression. Mortality was lower in individuals undergoing both LSSS and THA, regardless of procedure order. There was no difference in THA reoperations in individuals who had undergone LSSS before THA without fusion or with fusion. The individuals who had undergone LSSS after THA with fusion had an increased risk of THA reoperation compared with those without fusion.
CONCLUSION: LSSS with or without fusion before THA is associated with an increased risk of THA reoperation. Spinal fusion increased the risk of reoperation of THA when performed after THA.
