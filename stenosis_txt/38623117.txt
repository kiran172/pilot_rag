Title: When the Stomach Takes a Vacation: The Unseen Battles of Gastroparesis.

Abstract: Gastroparesis is a syndrome characterised by delayed gastric emptying that is usually idiopathic, diabetic, or iatrogenic. This underdiagnosed disease has a substantial influence on the quality of life of its patients. We present the case of an 86-year-old man with dementia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease who developed symptoms of gastroparesis during a lengthy hospital stay. Computed tomography (CT) and upper digestive endoscopy demonstrated gastric distention and pyloric stenosis. Despite cautious treatment and eventual pyloric dilation, the patient died from aspiration due to refractory respiratory failure. This example emphasises the need for early detection and thorough examination of gastroparesis to optimise patient outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality.
