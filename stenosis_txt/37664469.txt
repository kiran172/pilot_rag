Title: Sequential treatment for diabetic foot ulcers in dialysis patients: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are common in patients with diabetes, especially those undergoing hemodialysis. In severe cases, these ulcers can cause damage to the lower extremities and lead to amputation. Traditional treatments such as flap transposition and transfemoral amputation are not always applicable in all cases. Therefore, there is a need for alternative treatment methods.
CASE SUMMARY: This report describes a 62-year-old female patient who was admitted to the hospital with plantar and heel ulcers on her left foot. The patient had a history of renal failure and was undergoing regular hemodialysis. Digital subtraction angiography showed extensive stenosis and occlusion in the left superficial femoral artery, left peroneal artery and left posterior tibial artery. Following evaluation by a multidisciplinary team, the patient was diagnosed with type 2 DFUs (TEXAS 4D). Traditional treatments were deemed unsuitable, and the patient was treated with endovascular surgery in the affected area, in addition to supportive medical treatment, local debridement, and sequential repair using split-thickness skin and tissue-engineered skin grafts combined with negative pressure treatment. After four months, the wound had completely healed, and the patient was able to walk with a walking aid.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a new treatment method for DFUs was successful, using angioplasty, skin grafts, and negative pressure.
