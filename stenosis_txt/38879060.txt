Title: Late Outcomes of Patients in the Emergency Department With Acute Chest Pain Evaluated With Computed Tomography-Derived Fractional Flow Reserve.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) guides the need for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Late outcomes after FFR<sub>CT</sub> are reported in stable ischemic heart disease but not in acute chest pain in the emergency department (ACP-ED). The objectives are to assess the risk of death, myocardial infarction (MI), revascularization, and ICA after FFR<sub>CT</sub>. From 2015 to 2018, 389 low-risk patients with ACP-ED (negative biomarkers, no electrocardiographic ischemia) underwent CTA and FFR<sub>CT</sub> and were entered into a prospective institutional registry; patients were followed up for 41 ± 10 months. CTA stenosis ≥50% was present in 81% of the patients. Positive (FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤0.80) and negative FFR<sub>CT</sub> were observed in 124 (32%) and 265 patients (68%), respectively. ICA was performed in 108 of 124 patients (87%) with positive FFR<sub>CT</sub> and 89 of 265 patients (34%) with negative FFR<sub>CT</sub> (p &lt;0.00001). Revascularization was performed in 87 of 124 (70%) patients with positive FFR<sub>CT</sub> and in 22 of 265 (8%) with negative FFR<sub>CT</sub> (p &lt;0.00001). Appropriateness of revascularization was established by blinded adjudication of ICA and invasive FFR using practice guidelines; revascularization was appropriate in 81 of 124 (65%) and 6 of 265 (2%) of FFR<sub>CT</sub>-positive and -negative patients, respectively (p &lt;0.00001). At follow-up, for patients with positive versus negative FFR<sub>CT</sub>, the rates were 0.8% versus 0% for death (p = 0.32) and 1.6% versus 0.4% for MI (p = 0.24). In conclusion, in low-risk patients with ACP-ED who underwent CTA and FFR<sub>CT</sub>, the risk of late death (0.2%) and MI (0.7%) are low. Negative FFR<sub>CT</sub> is associated with excellent long-term prognosis, and positive FFR<sub>CT</sub> predicts obstructive disease requiring revascularization. FFR<sub>CT</sub> can safely triage patients with ACP-ED and reduce unnecessary ICA and revascularization.
