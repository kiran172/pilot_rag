Title: The timing of oesophageal dilatations in anastomotic stenosis after one-stage anastomosis for congenital oesophageal atresia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In infants with congenital oesophageal atresia, anastomotic stenosis easily occurs after one-stage oesophageal anastomosis, leading to dysphagia. In severe cases, oesophageal dilatation is required. In this paper, the timing of oesophageal dilatation in infants with anastomotic stenosis was investigated through retrospective data analysis.
METHODS: The clinical data of 107 infants with oesophageal atresia who underwent one-stage anastomosis in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2018 were retrospectively analysed. Data such as the timing and frequency of oesophageal dilatation under gastroscopy after surgery were collected to analyse the timing of oesophageal dilatation in infants with different risk factors.
RESULTS: For infants with refractory stenosis, the average number of dilatations in the early dilatation group (the first dilatation was performed within 6 months after the surgery) was 5.75 ± 0.5, which was higher than the average of 7.40 ± 1.35 times in the normal dilatation group (the first dilatation was performed 6 months after the surgery), P = 0.038. For the infants with anastomotic fistula and anastomotic stenosis, the number of oesophageal dilatations in the early dilatation group was 2.58 ± 2.02 times, which was less than the 6.38 ± 2.06 times in the normal dilatation group, P = 0.001. For infants with non-anastomotic fistula stenosis, early oesophageal dilatation could not reduce the total number of oesophageal dilatations.
CONCLUSION: Starting to perform oesophageal dilatation within 6 months after one-stage anastomosis for congenital oesophageal atresia can reduce the required number of dilatations in infants with postoperative anastomotic fistula and refractory anastomotic stenosis.
