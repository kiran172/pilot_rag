Title: Minimally Invasive Treatment for Degenerative Lumbar Spine.

Abstract: Degenerative lumbar spine disorder (DLSD) is a ubiquitously occurring event that may be induced or accelerated by multiple factors such as from overuse, trauma, genetic predisposition, nutrition deficiency, and others. While our understanding of this degenerative disorder is limited, in terms of prevention, the symptoms from DLSD can be significant and may lead to the reduction in the patient's quality of life and loss of work time. In the Global Burden of Disease Study, low back pain was ranked the highest of 291 different conditions, due to the number of years lost to disability, amounting to 83 million disability-adjusted life years lost in 2010. DLSD contains conditions involving disc degeneration, lumbar spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis, including symptoms ranging from low back pain to lower extremity radicular pain and weakness. In this issue, we will be discussing treatments for patients suffering with chronic low back pain from endplate disruption, utilizing basivertebral nerve radiofrequency ablation, also known as the INTRACEPT procedure. This issue will also cover minimally invasive lumbar decompression from lumbar spinal stenosis, due to contributory ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, utilizing the percutaneous image-guided lumbar decompression technique known as the MILD procedure.
