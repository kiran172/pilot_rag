Title: A case of repeated in-stent restenosis of coronary artery as a primary manifestation of seronegative antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a multisystemic autoimmune disorder which affects many organs or systems; however, coronary artery is relatively less frequently involved.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old female with effort chest pain was hospitalized for unstable angina in Janurary, 2015. Coronary angiography revealed sub-total occlusion of proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, where a drug-eluting stent was successfully deployed. The patient experienced multiple in-stent stenosis at LAD coronary artery and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was advised. Subsequently, severe stenosis of left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery emerged, and the patient suffered persistent in-stent restenosis. Eventually, the patient was diagnosed with seronegative antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and salvaged by immunosuppressants.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated in-stent restenosis could be a primary manifestation of seronegative antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and suppression of autoimmune activity and inflammation other than purely coronary revascularization might be a better option.
