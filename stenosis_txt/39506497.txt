Title: The Predictive Value of the CatLet Scoring System for Long-Term Prognosis After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Chronic Coronary Syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary Artery Tree description and Lesion EvaluaTion (CatLet) angiographic scoring system is a newly developed vascular scoring for assessing the degree of coronary artery stenosis and coronary artery variability. Preliminary studies have demonstrated its superiority over the Synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score in predicting outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study aimed to assess the predictive value of the CatLet score in long-term prognosis after PCI for chronic coronary syndrome (CCS).
METHODS: A total of 201 patients, who were diagnosed with chronic coronary syndrome, undergoing coronary DES implantation and calculable Catlet score at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College in China were consecutively enrolled from January 2020 to June 2021. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, recurrent angina, cardiac death, heart failure and ischemia-driven revascularization, were stratified according to CatLet score tertiles: 0 ≤ CatLet_low ≤ 23(n = 66), CatLet_mid 24-43(n = 68), and CatLet_top ≥ 44(n = 67), respectively.
RESULTS: The CatLet score predicted long-term prognosis with a median follow-up of 3.0 years. Of 201 patients analyzed, the rates of MACEs and cardiac death were 25.37% and 3.98%, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves for all endpoints showed increasing outcome events with the increasing tertiles of the CatLet score, with p-value < 0.05 on the trend test. For MACE and cardiac death, the area under the curve (AUC) of the CatLet score was 0.744 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.668-0.820) and 0.804 (95% CI: 0.672-0.936), respectively; Alone or after adjusting for risk factors, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI)/unit higher score was 9.41 (3.18-27.85) for MACEs and 1.85 (1.20-2.84) for cardiac death, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The CatLet score is an independent predictor of long-term clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome after percutaneous coronary intervention.
