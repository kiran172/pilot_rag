Title: Effect of oral anticoagulation on clinical outcomes and haemodynamic variables after successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effect of oral anticoagulation on clinical and haemodynamic outcomes following successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation is unclear.
AIMS: To evaluate the effect of oral anticoagulation within the first year after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
METHODS: All patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation in two French tertiary centres from 2010 to 2016 were included prospectively. The composite outcome of death, stroke, readmission for heart failure or major/life-threatening bleeding according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 criteria within 1year was evaluated. Valvular haemodynamic deterioration was defined as mean transprosthetic gradient ≥20mmHg or an increase of ≥10mmHg during echocardiographic follow-up.
RESULTS: Of the 1139 patients included, 400 (35.1%) were discharged on oral anticoagulation. The primary endpoint was more frequent in the group with versus without oral anticoagulation (29.4% vs. 17.3% 21.5%; hazard ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.42-2.35). Composite endpoint risk factors were chronic pulmonary and kidney diseases, previous atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30% at discharge and no femoral vascular approach, but not oral anticoagulation prescription at discharge. Conversely, 58 patients were identified with valvular haemodynamic deterioration, including 11 (19%) in the group with oral anticoagulation and 47 (81%) in the group without oral anticoagulation. Valvular haemodynamic deterioration risk factors were absence of oral anticoagulation exposure, increased body mass index, use of a balloon-expandable bioprosthesis and use of a bioprosthesis with diameter ≤23mm. Antithrombotic treatment crossover (i.e. oral anticoagulation interruption or introduction during follow-up) occurred in 9.6% of patients, and was a risk factor for death (adjusted hazard ratio 3.39, 95% confidence interval 1.63-7.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline characteristics, rather than oral anticoagulation prescription at discharge, were associated with adverse outcomes following successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Conversely, oral anticoagulation was associated with reduced valvular haemodynamic deterioration.
