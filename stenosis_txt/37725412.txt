Title: Elastography for Evaluation of Regression in Liver Fibrosis After Surgical Biliary Drainage for Benign Biliary Strictures: A Practical Possibility?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepatic fibrosis and secondary biliary cirrhosis are consequences of long-standing benign biliary strictures. Evidence on the reversibility of fibrosis after the repair is incongruous.
METHODOLOGY: A prospective observational study on patients who underwent Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy for benign biliary stricture. A liver biopsy was performed during repair and correlated with preoperative elastography. The improvement in liver functions and regression of fibrosis was compared with preoperative liver function tests and elastography.
RESULTS: A Total of 47 patients [mean age-38.9 y (Range: 21 to 66)] with iatrogenic benign biliary stricture were included. A strong female preponderance was noted. High strictures (type III and IV) comprised 72.7% of the study group. The median interval (injury to repair) was 7 months (2 to 72 mo). The median duration of jaundice was 3 months (1 to 20 mo). Both factors had a significant correlation with the stage of fibrosis ( P =0.001 and P =0.03, respectively). Liver biopsy revealed stage I, II, III, and IV fibrosis in 26 (55.3%), 11 (23.4%), 2 (4.3%), and 2(4.3%), respectively. The remaining 6 (12.8%) had no fibrosis. The severity of fibrosis had a good correlation with preoperative liver stiffness measurement-value on FibroScan. Significant improvement in liver function tests (bilirubin-3.55±3.48 vs. 0.59±0.52; Albumin-3.85±0.61 vs. 4.14±0.37; ALP-507.66±300.65 vs. 167±132.07; P value 0.00) and regression of fibrosis (liver stiffness measurement; 10.42±5.91 vs. 5.85±3.01, P value 0.00) was observed after repair of the strictures.
CONCLUSION: Improved biliary function and regression of liver fibrosis can be achieved with timely repair of benign biliary stricture and it is feasible to be evaluated using elastography.
