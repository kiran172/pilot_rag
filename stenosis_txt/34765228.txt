Title: Minimally invasive spinal surgery in a young cat with vertebral hypertrophy.

Abstract: CASE SUMMARY: A 2-year-old neutered female Scottish Fold cat was presented with an 8-week history of progressive back pain, paraparesis and decrease of postural reactions in both pelvic limbs. MRI showed spinal cord compression from both ventral sides, which originated from the T4 vertebral body and pedicle. The lesion compressing the spinal cord had a bone-like density on CT, and endoscopic surgery was performed to excise it. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue showed no evidence of malignancy and the lesion was diagnosed as vertebral hypertrophy. After surgery, the neurological status of the cat gradually improved. The cat was ambulant at the follow-up evaluation 2 weeks after surgery. Six months later, hindlimb paresis had improved considerably, and no recurrence was observed on CT.
RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: This is the first description of thoracic vertebral canal stenosis due to hypertrophy of a single vertebra in a young cat. Excision of the hypertrophic vertebra by endoscopic surgery is less invasive than open surgery and may give a good prognosis.
