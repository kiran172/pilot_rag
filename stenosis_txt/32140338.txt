Title: Airway Management for an Adult Epiglottic Abscess.

Abstract: Awake intubation is frequently described in the literature as the preferred method for securing the airway in adult patients with epiglottitis, whereas children with epiglottitis are usually intubated following an inhalational induction. However, if topicalization is difficult due to the presence of an abscess or an uncooperative patient, an inhalational induction may still be a reasonable approach in the adult patient. In a review of the literature, only one recent case report had been found describing an inhalational induction with video laryngoscopy. However, this attempt was unsuccessful, mandating the need for a surgical airway. Our case report describes a successful inhalational induction and video laryngoscopeÂ intubation without the use of a paralytic agent in an adult patient with an epiglottic abscess and moderate airway stenosis.
