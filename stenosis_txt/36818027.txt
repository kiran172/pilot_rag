Title: Idiopathic double tracheal stenosis mimicking asthma: a case report.

Abstract: Idiopathic tracheal stenosis (Idio-SS) is an extremely rare disease. Its diagnosis is of exclusion and could be misdiagnosed as asthma. Herein, we report the case of a 39-year-old woman who had been treated for asthma for several months. She has no history of endotracheal intubation or granulomatous disease. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy and thoracic computed tomography revealed double tracheal stenosis. The patient had rigid bronchoscopy; the upper tracheal stenosis was dilated with insertion of a silicone airway stent at the level of the distal stenosis. The diagnosis of idiopathic stenoses was made according to the clinico-radiological features. Symptoms were completely relieved and no recurrence was observed after one year of follow-up. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and early diagnosis of Idio-SS in patients with unexplained wheezing and dyspnea. It also illustrates the role of endoscopic procedures in this situation.
