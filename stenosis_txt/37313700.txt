Title: [Cicatricial tracheal stenosis. Is prevention possible? A single-region experience].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To develop the measures for prevention and treatment of tracheal stenosis in various phases of disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 290 patients who underwent long-term mechanical ventilation between 2006 and 2021. The main causes of previous intensive care with prolonged ventilation were combined trauma and stroke. All patients were divided into two groups. Group I included 149 people who underwent decannulation in a specialized department with further staged endoscopic follow-up. Group II included 141 patients with cicatricial tracheal stenosis and no follow-up. All patients underwent endoscopic treatment, tracheal resection and staged reconstructive plastic surgery.
RESULTS: In the 1st group, tracheal stenosis occurred in 28 cases (18.8%). Of these, initial (edematous and granulation) stenoses were detected in 17 (60.7%), granulation-fibrous stenoses - in 11 (39.3%) cases. Endoscopic treatment was successful in 24 (85.7%) patients. Four patients with tracheomalacia underwent circular tracheal resections. In the 2nd group, all patients required surgical interventions (circular resections - 71 cases, staged reconstructive plastic surgery - 70 patients). Among 70 patients after reconstructive surgery, 24 (34.2%) ones recovered, and 28 (40%) patients need for cannula. Seventeen (24.2%) patients are unavailable for follow-up, and 1 patient (1.42%) died from concomitant disease. Complications after circular resection occurred in 16 cases (24.6%), postoperative mortality was 2.7%.
CONCLUSION: Follow-up after prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheotomy makes it possible to prevent severe forms of tracheal stenosis and carry out early endoscopic treatment.
