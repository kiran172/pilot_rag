Title: A rare middle aortic syndrome with celiac trunk, superior mesenteric and bilateral renal artery involvement.

Abstract: Middle aortic syndrome (MAS) is a rare atypical aortic coarctation (AC), often accompanied by refractory renal hypertension, which eventually leads to death from congestive heart failure, stroke or hypertensive encephalopathy. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has unique advantages in assessing aortic stenosis and splanchnic artery abnormalities. Prompt aortic bypass surgery can relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. In this study, we report a patient with MAS diagnosed by CTA and follow-up after thoracoabdominal aortic bypass grafting.
