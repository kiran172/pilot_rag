Title: Fetal cardiac interventions: Where do we stand?

Abstract: Fetal cardiac intervention (FCI) is a novel and evolving technique that allows for in utero treatment of a subset of congenital heart disease. This review describes the rationale, selection criteria, technical features, and current outcomes for the three most commonly performed FCI: fetal aortic stenosis with evolving hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS); HLHS with intact or restrictive atrial septum; and pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, with concern for worsening right ventricular (RV) hypoplasia.
