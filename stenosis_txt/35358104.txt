Title: Study Level Meta-Analysis of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With the ACURATE neo Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valve.

Abstract: The ACURATE neo transcatheter aortic valve is a self-expanding device. Several studies have investigated safety and efficacy, but meta-analysis and pooled data are lacking. We aimed to provide a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis on the clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation with the ACURATE neo valve. A systematic literature search for eligible records was conducted. The primary endpoint was device success as designated by Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The secondary endpoints (time frame: 30 days) were all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, need for new permanent pacemaker, major vascular complications, major bleeding, acute kidney injury stage II or III, and paravalvular regurgitation grade moderate or severe (II or III). Our search yielded a total of 355 records, 20 of those (n = 5858 ACURATE neo receivers) were included in our meta-analysis. Device success was achieved in 94.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.4-96.5%) of the patients. The 30-day all-cause mortality incidence proportion was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.3-2.4%). New pacemaker implantation was required in 7.7% (95% CI, 6.4-9.2%) of the patients, stroke occurred in 1.9% (95% CI, 1.6-2.3%), myocardial infarction in 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3-0.7%), major bleeding in 5.0% (95% CI, 3.9-6.5%), major vascular complication in 5.6% (95% CI, 4.0-7.8%), acute kidney injury stage ≥2 in 2.5% (95% CI, 1.8-3.4%), and paravalvular leak grade ≥moderate was observed in 4.3% (95% CI, 3.0-6.2%). Balloon predilatation and postdilatation incidence was 93.9% (95% CI, 87.0-97.3%) and 43.2% (95% CI, 37.9-48.6%), respectively. ACURATE neo appears to be safe and effective in our analysis with high device success incidence, low mortality, and low new pacemaker implantations.
