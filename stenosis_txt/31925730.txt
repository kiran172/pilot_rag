Title: Insight into Dunbar syndrome: color-Doppler ultrasound findings and literature review.

Abstract: Dunbar syndrome, also known as median arcuate ligament syndrome, is a rare clinical condition due to the external compression of the celiac trunk by the median arcuate ligament causing abdominal angina. We report a case of Dunbar syndrome and its borderline imaging findings focused on the crucial diagnostic role of color-Doppler ultrasound. We also reviewed the current literature, delineating the clinical manifestations and the diagnostic workup of the Dunbar syndrome with the objective to increase the knowledge of this clinical entity as a cause of postprandial abdominal pain and to underline the pivotal role of color-Doppler ultrasound to avoid incorrect or delayed diagnosis.
