Title: Structural valve deterioration of the Labcor Dokimos aortic prosthesis: a single-centre experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to assess the performance and incidence of the deterioration of the Labcor Dokimos bioprosthetic aortic valve.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical chart review of 116 patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement with the Labcor Dokimos aortic valve between 2010 and 2018. Abstracted data included patient demographic and echocardiographic data. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with structural valve deterioration (SVD) and patients without SVD.
RESULTS: Among the patients with complete follow-up (n = 95), 10 patients were excluded because they died within a year; 85 patients were included in the final analysis. Of the 85 patients, 32 (38%) developed SVD; 22 (26%) had severe SVD, 15 (18%) of whom underwent reintervention. The most common aetiology of SVD was severe central aortic regurgitation, which was detected in 91% of the patients who had severe SVD. The average time from operation to severe SVD was 4.7 years with a minimum of 1.5 years and a maximum of 7.9 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Bioprosthetic aortic valve deterioration due to severe aortic regurgitation is common and occurs early with the Labcor Dokimos valve. This occurrence needs to be furthered investigated in larger registries.
