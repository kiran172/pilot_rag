Title: Primary cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma in a mitral valve involved with rheumatic disease.

Abstract: A 51-year-old female underwent emergency mitral valve replacement for mitral stenosis with an undetermined mass which was attached to the anterior mitral leaflet. Histopathological testing of the excised specimen confirmed the diagnosis of rheumatic mitral disease in combination with a primary rhabdomyosarcoma. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with pazopanib hydrochloride was given. At 10 months of follow-up, repeated computed tomographic screening has not shown any signs of local recurrence or secondary metastases. The potential for the existence of primary rhabdomyosarcomas should be borne in mind when faced with undetermined masses on mitral leaflets, even in the presence of rheumatic disease.
