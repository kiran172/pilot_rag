Title: Oxygen extraction fraction mapping with multi-parametric quantitative BOLD MRI: Reduced transverse relaxation bias using 3D-GraSE imaging.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based quantification of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) effect allows oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) mapping. The multi-parametric quantitative BOLD (mq-BOLD) technique facilitates relative OEF (rOEF) measurements with whole brain coverage in clinically applicable scan times. Mq-BOLD requires three separate scans of cerebral blood volume and transverse relaxation rates measured by gradient-echo (1/T<sub>2</sub>∗) and spin-echo (1/T<sub>2</sub>). Although the current method is of clinical merit in patients with stroke, glioma and internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS), there are relaxation measurement artefacts that impede the sensitivity of mq-BOLD and artificially elevate reported rOEF values. We posited that T<sub>2</sub>-related biases caused by slice refocusing imperfections during rapid 2D-GraSE (Gradient and Spin Echo) imaging can be reduced by applying 3D-GraSE imaging sequences, because the latter requires no slice selective pulses. The removal of T<sub>2</sub>-related biases would decrease overestimated rOEF values measured by mq-BOLD. We characterized effects of T<sub>2</sub>-related bias in mq-BOLD by comparing the initially employed 2D-GraSE and two proposed 3D-GraSE sequences to multiple single spin-echo reference measurements, both in vitro and in vivo. A phantom and 25 participants, including young and elderly healthy controls as well as ICAS-patients, were scanned. We additionally proposed a procedure to reliably identify and exclude artefact affected voxels. In the phantom, 3D-GraSE derived T<sub>2</sub> values had 57% lower deviation from the reference. For in vivo scans, the formerly overestimated rOEF was reduced by -27% (p ​&lt; ​0.001). We obtained rOEF ​= ​0.51, which is much closer to literature values from positron emission tomography (PET) measurements. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to a focal rOEF elevation in an ICAS-patient was demonstrated. In summary, the application of 3D-GraSE improves the mq-BOLD-based rOEF quantification while maintaining clinically feasible scan times. Thus, mq-BOLD with non-slice selective T<sub>2</sub> imaging is highly promising to improve clinical diagnostics of cerebrovascular diseases such as ICAS.
