Title: Staging cardiac damage in patients with aortic regurgitation.

Abstract: The impact of "downstream" pathophysiological cardiac consequences in aortic regurgitation patients were not well established. The aim of our study was to validate a staging system built for severe aortic stenosis in a large real-world cohort of aortic regurgitation (AR) patients, evaluating the prevalence of different stages of cardiac damage and assess its prognostic impact. Clinical, echocardiographic and outcome data of patients with moderate-severe AR who underwent transthoracic echocardiography between January/2014 and September/2019 were retrospectively analysed. Patients were classified according to the extent of cardiac damage: Stage 0 (no cardiac damage), Stage 1 (left ventricular damage), Stage 2 (mitral valve or left atrial damage), Stage 3 (tricuspid valve or pulmonary artery vasculature damage) and Stage 4 (right ventricular damage). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. A total of 571 patients (median age 73, 51% male) were enrolled: Stage 0 (14.0%), Stage 1 (21.5%), Stage 2 (49.2%), Stage 3 (12.3%) and Stage 4 (3.0%). Median follow-up time was 39.5 months (IQR 22.2 to 61.0). At the end of follow-up, cumulative death was significantly higher in more advanced disease stages (log-rank p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, Stage 3-4 was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 3.20; 95% CI 1.48-6.93; p = 0.003). Our study suggests that extra-valvular damage is common in patients with significant AR and that a staging system developed for aortic stenosis also provides prognostic information in these patients. This staging system may be helpful for clinical decision-making regarding the time of valvular intervention.
