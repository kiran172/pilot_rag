Title: Signal intensity and volume of carotid intraplaque hemorrhage on magnetic resonance imaging and the risk of ipsilateral cerebrovascular events: The Plaque At RISK (PARISK) study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Plaque At RISK (PARISK) study demonstrated that patients with a carotid plaque with intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) have an increased risk of recurrent ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular events. It was previously reported that symptomatic carotid plaques with IPH showed higher IPH signal intensity ratios (SIR) and larger IPH volumes than asymptomatic plaques. We explored whether IPH SIR and IPH volume are associated with future ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular events beyond the presence of IPH.
METHODS: Transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate carotid stenosis and an ipsilateral IPH-positive carotid plaque (n = 89) from the PARISK study were included. The clinical endpoint was a new ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular event during 5 years of follow-up, while the imaging-based endpoint was a new ipsilateral brain infarct on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 years (n = 69). Trained observers delineated IPH, a hyperintense region compared to surrounding muscle tissue on hyper T<sub>1</sub>-weighted magnetic resonance images. The IPH SIR was the maximal signal intensity in the IPH region divided by the mean signal intensity of adjacent muscle tissue. The associations between IPH SIR or volume and the clinical and imaging-based endpoint were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models and logistic regression, respectively.
RESULTS: During 5.1 (interquartile range: 3.1-5.6) years of follow-up, 21 ipsilateral cerebrovascular ischemic events were identified. Twelve new ipsilateral brain infarcts were identified on the 2-year neuro MRI. There was no association for IPH SIR or IPH volume with the clinical endpoint (hazard ratio (HR): 0.89 [95% confidence interval: 0.67-1.10] and HR: 0.91 [0.69-1.19] per 100-µL increase, respectively) nor with the imaging-based endpoint (odds ratio (OR): 1.04 [0.75-1.45] and OR: 1.21 [0.87-1.68] per 100-µL increase, respectively).
CONCLUSION: IPH SIR and IPH volume were not associated with future ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular events. Therefore, quantitative assessment of IPH of SIR and volume does not seem to provide additional value beyond the presence of IPH for stroke risk assessment.
