Title: Relation of circulating lncRNA GAS5 and miR-21 with biochemical indexes, stenosis severity, and inflammatory cytokines in coronary heart disease patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA GAS5 (lnc-GAS5) and its target microRNA-21 (miR-21) regulate blood lipid, macrophages, Th cells, vascular smooth muscle cells to participate in atherosclerosis, and related coronary heart disease (CHD). The study aimed to further explore the linkage of their circulating expressions with common biochemical indexes, stenosis severity and inflammatory cytokines in CHD patients.
METHODS: Ninety-eight CHD patients and 100 controls confirmed by coronary angiography were enrolled. Plasma samples were collected for lnc-GAS5 and miR-21 detection by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and inflammatory cytokines determination by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Lnc-GAS5 was increased in CHD patients compared with controls (2.270 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.676-3.389) vs. 0.999 ([IQR: 0.602-1.409], p < 0.001), whereas miR-21 showed opposite tread (0.442 [IQR: 0.318-0.698] vs. 0.997 [IQR: 0.774-1.368], p < 0.001). In aspect of their intercorrelation, lnc-GAS5 negatively linked with miR-21 in CHD patients (p < 0.001) instead of controls (p = 0.211). Interestingly, among the common biochemical indexes, lnc-GAS5 related to decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.008) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), while miR-21 correlated with lower total cholesterol (p = 0.024) and CRP (p < 0.001) in CHD patients. As stenosis degree, lnc-GAS5 positively correlated with Gensini score (p < 0.001), but miR-21 exhibited negative association (p = 0.003) in CHD patients. In terms of inflammatory cytokines, lnc-GAS5 positively related to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-17A, while miR-21 negatively linked with TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 in CHD patients (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Circulating lnc-GAS5 and its target miR-21 exhibit potency to serve as biomarkers for CHD management.
