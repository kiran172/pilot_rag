Title: Outcomes of Alternative Access Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedures.

Abstract: Alternative access transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) consists primarily of 4 different options: transcaval, transaxillary, transcarotid, and transapical. While many centers have a preferred alternative access site, few papers have compared the outcomes of TAVR with each alternative access site. In this review, we examine the outcomes of TAVR at each alternative access site, focusing on mortality, stroke, bleeding, pacemaker insertion, paravalvular leakage, and discharge to home. Notable findings include higher mortality in the transapical group and higher stroke rate in the transaxillary group. On the basis of these data, we suggest that transcarotid TAVR might represent the second choice of approach for TAVR when alternate access is required.
