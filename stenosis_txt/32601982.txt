Title: Double-face preputial island flap revisited: is it a reliable one-stage repair for severe hypospadias?

Abstract: PURPOSE: We have studied outcome of double-face preputial island flap (DFPIF) technique in severe types of hypospadias: penoscrotal, scrotal and perineal.
METHODS: We have used DFPIF in 75 boys at a median age of 1.1 years (1.0-1.5). The meatus was penoscrotal, scrotal or perineal after de-gloving the penis. The inner face of the foreskin was used for urethroplasty and the outer face for ventral skin covering. Modifications were added: proximal anastomosis was protected by a spongioplasty; in case of urethral plate transection, we anastomosed on onlay proximal and distal segments of the flap (onlay-tube-onlay) and the tubularized part was sutured to corpus cavernosa. FU was scheduled at one month then every 3 months for a year then annually. At each consultation, the surgeon filled out a detailed cosmetic and functional sheet including flowmeter.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients had onlay preputial flap repair with urethral plate preservation. Forty-one had the onlay-tube-onlay technique. All children had a curvature, 19 had a significant residual curvature after dissection, corrected by dorsal plication (n = 9) and ventral lengthening (n = 10). Median FU was 4.2 years (2.7-6.5). 36 children (48%) had complications and needed redo surgery: 12 fistulas, 11 diverticula, 7 meatal stenosis, 3 strictures and 2 residual curvatures. All children but three voided within the normal limits for their age.
CONCLUSION: DFPIF remains a good option for a one-stage repair of severe hypospadias. After a median of 1.8 procedures, the final success rate was 96%. The healthy well-vascularized ventral skin allows safe redo surgery when needed.
