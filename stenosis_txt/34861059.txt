Title: MicroRNA-34a in coronary heart disease: Correlation with disease risk, blood lipid, stenosis degree, inflammatory cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) plays an essential role in regulating blood lipid, inflammation, cell adhesion molecules, and atherosclerosis, the latter factors are closely involved in the etiology of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the clinical value of miR-34a in CHD patients' management is rarely reported. Hence, this study aimed to assess the correlation of miR-34a with disease risk, blood lipid, coronary artery stenosis, inflammatory cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules of CHD.
METHODS: A total of 203 CHD patients and 100 controls were recruited in this study, then their plasma samples were collected to detect the miR-34a by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, serum samples from CHD patients were obtained for inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecule measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: MiR-34a was elevated in CHD patients compared to controls (p < 0.001) and it disclosed a good diagnostic value of CHD (area under curve: 0.899, 95% confidence interval: 0.865-0.934). Besides, miR-34a positively correlated with triglyceride (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (p = 0.022) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.004), but not with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.110) in CHD patients. Moreover, miR-34a associated with Gensini score in CHD patients (p < 0.001). As to inflammation-related indexes and cell adhesion molecules, MiR-34a expression was positively linked with C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), tumor necrosis factor alpha (p = 0.005), interleukin (IL)-1β (p = 0.020), IL-17A (p < 0.001), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (p < 0.001), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (p = 0.010) in CHD patients, but not with IL-6 (p = 0.118) and IL-10 (p = 0.054).
CONCLUSION: MiR-34a might serve as a biomarker in assistance of diagnosis and management of CHD.
