Title: Long-Term Influence of Atrial Switch Operation on Hemodynamics After the Rastelli Procedure.

Abstract: The study aimed to investigate the long-term influence of atrial switch on post-Rastelli hemodynamic condition. Of 112 patients with transposition of the great arteries (TGA) or TGA-type double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and pulmonary stenosis (PS) who underwent intra-cardiac repair between 1979 and 2018, 50 patients with levo-TGA underwent atrial switch and Rastelli as an anatomic repair and 62 patients with dextro-TGA underwent Rastelli. Postoperative outcomes were retrospectively compared. The median follow-up durations were 20.1 years (interquartile range: 4.3, 32.4) in the Rastelli group and 15.3 years (7.1, 23.0) in the atrial switch plus Rastelli group (p = 0.19). Sex, age, and weight at operation were similar in both groups. Overall survival rates at 30 years were 69.8% in the Rastelli group and 80.1% in the atrial switch plus Rastelli group (p = 0.18). The atrial switch plus Rastelli group required more frequent catheter interventions (p < 0.001), mainly for caval obstruction (n = 8) and atrial arrhythmia (n = 6). Medication was more frequent in the atrial switch plus Rastelli group (p = 0.009). Exercise capacity was similarly reduced in two groups. Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) occurred in three long-term survivors in the atrial switch plus Rastelli group (p = 0.07). Concomitantly performed atrial switch operation did not affect long-term survival and exercise capacity after Rastelli procedure. However, the occurrence of PLE, a frequent need for medication, and catheter interventions after atrial switch plus Rastelli may result from atrial switch under the post-Rastelli condition.
