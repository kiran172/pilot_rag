Title: Transdural Approach for Resection of Craniovertebral Junction Cysts: Case Series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) cysts, including retro-odontoid pseudotumors, are challenging pathologies to treat and manage effectively. Surgical intervention is indicated when these lesions result in progressive myelopathy, intractable pain, or instability.
OBJECTIVE: To present a case series of older patients who underwent successful resection retro-odontoid lesions using transdural approach.
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective observation study of older patients who underwent transdural resection of CVJ cysts at a single institution was performed. Summary demographic information, clinical presentation, perioperative and intraoperative imaging, and Nurick scores were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Eight patients were included (mean age [±SD] 75.88 ± 9.09 years). All patients presented with retro-odontoid lesions resulting in severe cervical stenosis, cord compression, and myelopathy. The mean duration of surgery was 226 ± 83.7 minutes. The average intraoperative blood loss was 181.2 cc. The average hospital stay was 4.5 days ± 1.3 (range, 3-7 days). The average follow-up time was 12.5 ± 9.5 months. No intraoperative complications were encountered. The Nurick classification score for myelopathy improved at the final postoperative examination (2.38 ± 1.06 vs 1 ± 1.07). Three patients demonstrated a pre-existing deformity prompting an instrumented fusion. Both computed tomography and MRI evidence of complete regression of retro-odontoid cyst were noted in all patients on the final follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Posterior cervical transdural approach for ventral lesions at the CVJ is a safe and effective means of treating older patients with progressive myelopathy. This technique provides immediate spinal cord decompression while limiting neurological complications commonly associated with open or endoscopic anterior transpharyngeal approaches.
