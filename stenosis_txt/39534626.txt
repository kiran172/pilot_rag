Abstract: A 29-year-old woman with a history of severe rheumatic mitral stenosis status post mitral valvuloplasty presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion during her second pregnancy. She underwent multimodality evaluation throughout her pregnancy, which helped to guide medical therapy and prevent unnecessary mechanical intervention and premature delivery.
