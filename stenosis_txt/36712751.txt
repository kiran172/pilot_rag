Title: The Impact of Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction Reduction and Transient Ischemic Dilation in Patients With Normal Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Myocardial Perfusion Imaging.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death in developed countries. Non-invasive functional imaging modalities are currently recommended as initial diagnostic tests in patients with an intermediate-high pretest probability of CAD. Single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) creates images of regional myocardial tracer uptake, reflecting relative myocardial blood flow. However, there are other non-perfusion predictors of CAD, such as transient ischemic dilatation (TID) and reduced post-stress left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). Available data regarding these parameters is controversial. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of significant CAD in patients with non-perfusion high-risk markers of ischemia despite a normal SPECT-MPI.
METHODS: Single-center, observational, retrospective, and longitudinal study. Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, normal SPECT-MPI, and availability of gated study for LVEF and volume analysis. Exclusion criteria were any known cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease and known CAD. Non-perfusion high-risk markers: LVEF reduction ≥5% on post-stress images; TID (defined as a stress/rest left ventricle volume ratio ≥ 1.15), including end-systolic, end-diastolic, and mean volumes. The primary endpoint was the identification of significant CAD (stenosis >70% on an epicardial coronary artery or >50% on the left main artery) on invasive coronary angiography.
RESULTS: A total of 197 patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 64 ± 12.6 years and 59.4% (n = 117) of patients were male. Overall, 26% of patients had LVEF reduction ≥5% on stress study; 24.9% had a stress/rest end-systolic volume ratio ≥ 1.15; 7.1% had a stress/rest mean volume ratio ≥ 1.15; 7.1% had a stress/rest end-diastolic volume ratio ≥ 1.15. Time-to-primary endpoint was significantly lower in patients with LVEF reduction ≥5% on stress study (67.99 (95% CI 60.49-75.49) vs. 77.56 months (95% CI 75.14-79.99); p = 0.003) and in patients with stress/rest end-systolic volume ratio ≥ 1.15 (68.39 (95% CI 60.69-76.10) vs. 77.31 months (95% ICCI 74.68-79.76); p = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: In patients with normal perfusion on SPECT-MPI, the incidence of significant CAD was significantly higher in those with LVEF reduction ≥ 5% on stress study and in those with a stress/rest end-systolic volume ratio ≥ 1.15, during a follow-up period of five years.
