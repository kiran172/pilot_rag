Title: Unstable Carotid Artery Thrombus in a Patient With COVID-19 Infection.

Abstract: We present a case of an unvaccinated, 43-year-old African American female patient with COVID-19 infection and clinical evidence of a left hemispheric stroke. A non-occlusive thrombus with a radiographic target lesion was identified on computed tomography angiography (CTA). A multi-disciplinary discussion regarding concern for embolization was provided due to its unstable nature, as well as evidence of recent stroke. Given her acute COVID-19 infection, symptomatology, and radiographic findings, it was concluded that the etiology of her stroke appeared most consistent with a hypercoagulable-related embolism rather than an atheroembolic event. The patient underwent left carotid artery thrombectomy with bovine patch angioplasty. Operative findings included: left carotid thrombus, minimal plaque after evacuation of the thrombus, and a small proximal internal carotid artery diameter. Given concern for stenosis with primary repair a bovine pericardial patch angioplasty was performed. We present a paradigm for extracranial carotid thrombectomy with therapeutic anticoagulation for COVID-related spontaneous arterial thrombosis.
