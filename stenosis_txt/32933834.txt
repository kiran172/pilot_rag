Title: Single-level controlled comparison of OLIF51 and percutaneous screw in lateral position versus MIS-TLIF for lumbosacral degenerative disorders: Clinical and radiologic study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We have performed minimally invasive Oblique Lateral Interbody Fusion at L5/S1 (OLIF51) and simultaneous posterior screwing in lateral position for lumbosacral disorders. This study compared the clinical and radiologic results between OLIF51 versus Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (MIS-TLIF) in single-level fusion for lumbosacral degenerative disorders.
METHODS: A total of 71 patients underwent either OLIF51 (33 cases) or MIS-TLIF (38 cases) at L5/S1 spinal segment. The average age was 64 yrs (27-88). The disorders were L5 isthmic or degenerative spondylolisthesis, foraminal stenosis, pseudarthrosis and adjacent segment degeneration, and others. Using 35 mm oblique incision, OLIF51 was performed followed by posterior percutaneous fixation in same lateral position. MIS-TLIF was performed with midline 40 mm incision and modified cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screws. The operation time, estimated blood loss, JOABPEQ effectiveness rate (%), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), fusion rate, radiologic alignment, and complications were evaluated.
RESULTS: Average follow-up period was 25 and 31 months (12-45) in OLIF51 and MIS-TLIF, respectively. The average operation time and estimated blood loss were 165min, 62 ml and 163 min and 68 ml, respectively. The JOABPEQ effectiveness rate in OLIF51 demonstrated higher value in low back function (44% vs 17%, P < 0.02). The fusion rate was 97% and 92% in OLIF51 and MIS-TLIF, respectively. The segmental lordosis was significantly larger in OLIF51 (17 vs 11 deg, P < 0.01). There were no vascular or neural complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Although two groups demonstrated the equivalent surgical invasiveness, there was the significant superiority of OLIF51 in terms of low back function over MIS-TLIF. The segmental lordosis creation was also better in OLIF51. Even in the single-level lumbosacral fusion, OLIF51 serves as the safe and viable surgical procedure with use of lateral position surgery, minimizing the residual low back dysfunction.
