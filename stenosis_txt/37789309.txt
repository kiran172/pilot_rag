Title: Serum antioxidant enzymes in spinal stenosis patients with lumbar disc herniation: correlation with degeneration severity and spinal fusion rate.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) correlated with the intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) severity and the postoperative spinal fusion rate in lumbar spinal stenosis patients accompanied with lumbar disc herniation.
METHODS: This retrospective study investigated 310 cases of posterior lumbar decompression and fusion. The cumulative grade was calculated by adding the pfirrmann grades of all the lumbar discs. Subjects were grouped based on the median cumulative grade. Logistic regression was used to determine the associations among the demographical, clinical, and laboratory indexes and severe degeneration and fusion. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to measure model discrimination, and Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test was used to measure calibration.
RESULTS: SOD and GR levels were significantly lower in the severe degeneration group (cumulative grade > 18) than in the mild to moderate degeneration group (cumulative grade ≤ 18). Furthermore, the SOD and GR concentrations of the fusion group were significantly higher than that of the non-fusion group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006). The multivariate binary logistic models revealed that SOD and GR were independently influencing factors of the severe degeneration (OR: 0.966, 95%CI: 0.950-0.982, and OR: 0.946, 95%CI: 0.915-0.978, respectively) and non-fusion (OR: 0.962; 95% CI: 0.947-0.978; OR: 0.963; 95% CI: 0.933-0.994). The models showed excellent discrimination and calibration. Trend analysis indicated that the levels of SOD and GR tended to decrease with increasing severity (p for trend < 0.001 and 0.003). In addition, it also revealed that SOD provided protection from non-fusion in a concentration-dependent manner (p for trend < 0.001). However, GR concentration-dependent effects were not apparent (p for trend = 0.301).
CONCLUSION: High serum SOD and GR levels are associated with a better fusion prognosis and a relief in degeneration severity.
