Title: High-Throughput Metabolomics Applications in Pathogenesis and Diagnosis of Valvular Heart Disease.

Abstract: High-throughput metabolomics techniques are a useful tool to understand many disease conditions including cardiovascular disease such as valvular heart disease(s) (VHD). VHD involves damage to heart valves, mostly presenting as stenosis, regurgitation or prolapse and can be classified into degenerative, rheumatic, congenital, or prosthetic valve disease. Gaps remain in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the common VHD. It is now fitting to place into perspective the contribution of metabolomics in the mechanism of development, diagnosis, and prognosis of VHD. A structured search for metabolomics studies centred on human VHD was undertaken. Biomarkers associated with the pathogenesis of bicuspid aortic valve disease, mitral valve disease, rheumatic heart disease, and degenerative aortic valve stenosis are reviewed and discussed. In addition, metabolic biomarkers reported to prognosticate patient outcomes of post-valve repair or replacement are highlighted. Finally, we also review the pitfalls and limitations to consider when designing metabolomics studies, especially from a clinician's viewpoint. In the future, reliable and simple metabolic biomarker(s) may supplement the existing diagnostic tools in the early diagnosis of VHD.
