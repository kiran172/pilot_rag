Title: Monitoring Posterior Cerebral Perfusion Changes With Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast-Enhanced Perfusion MRI After Anterior Revascularization Surgery in Pediatric Moyamoya Disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to evaluate posterior cerebral circulation in pediatric patients with moyamoya disease (MMD) who underwent anterior revascularization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively included 73 patients with MMD who underwent DSC perfusion MRI (age, 12.2 Â± 6.1 years) between January 2016 and December 2020, owing to recent-onset clinical symptoms during the follow-up period after completion of anterior revascularization. DSC perfusion images were analyzed using a dedicated software package (NordicICE; Nordic NeuroLab) for the middle cerebral artery (MCA), posterior cerebral artery (PCA), and posterior border zone between the two regions (PCA-MCA). Patients were divided into two groups; the PCA stenosis group included 30 patients with newly confirmed PCA involvement, while the no PCA stenosis group included 43 patients without PCA involvement. The relationship between DSC perfusion parameters and PCA stenosis, as well as the performance of the parameters in discriminating between groups, were analyzed.
RESULTS: In the PCA stenosis group, the mean follow-up duration was 5.3 years after anterior revascularization, and visual disturbances were a common symptom. Normalized cerebral blood volume was increased, and both the normalized time-to-peak (nTTP) and mean transit time values were significantly delayed in the PCA stenosis group compared with those in the no PCA stenosis group in the PCA and PCA-MCA border zones. TTP<sub>PCA</sub> (odds ratio [OR] = 6.745; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.665-17.074; P &lt; 0.001) and CBV<sub>PCA-MCA</sub> (OR = 1.567; 95% CI = 1.021-2.406; P = 0.040) were independently associated with PCA stenosis. TTP<sub>PCA</sub> showed the highest receiver operating characteristic curve area in discriminating for PCA stenosis (0.895; 95% CI = 0.803-0.986).
CONCLUSION: nTTP can be used to effectively diagnose PCA stenosis. Therefore, DSC perfusion MRI may be a valuable tool for monitoring PCA stenosis in patients with MMD.
