Title: Specific clinical vignettes in high-risk protected percutaneous coronary intervention.

Abstract: There are several cardiac- and patient-related factors that come into play when considering patients for protected percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac factors include complexity/location of coronary lesions, the degree of left or right ventricular impairment, the presence of valvular lesions, and ventricular arrhythmias. Patient related factors include comorbidities that would render the patient at a higher risk of death should cardiogenic shock ensue during the procedure. Comorbidities include chronic lung disease (chronic obstructive airways disease, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis), renal or liver impairment, other cardiovascular diseases (such as previous cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, carotid stenosis), diabetes, frailty and advanced age. Here, we present three very different cases where left ventricular support was deemed appropriate to reduce peri-procedural risk and optimize outcomes.
