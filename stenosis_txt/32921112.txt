Title: Tracheal stent placement provides opportunity for subsequent anti-cancer therapy for cancer patients with malignant respiratory complications.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with severe acute dyspnea due to malignant tracheal stenosis or tracheoesophageal fistula often need advanced respiratory support. Tracheal stenting is an important palliative treatment of such patients. This study retrospectively analyzes the efficacy and outcomes of airway stenting in patients with tracheal stenosis or tracheoesophageal fistula.
METHODS: Patients underwent stenting from 2005 to 2018 in a single center were reviewed. Ninety-seven patients with malignant tracheal stenosis and/or tracheoesophageal fistula who underwent stenting were analyzed, all these patients had poor respiratory status.
RESULTS: The median survival time of patients after stent placement was 119 days. Forty-five patients were treated with anti-tumor therapy after placing the stent. Discharged intensive care unit (ICU) within 3 days and postoperative antitumor treatment were independent predictors for the survival time after tracheal stenting (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Tracheal stent implantation played an important role for additional anti-cancer treatment.
