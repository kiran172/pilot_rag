Title: Chronic occlusion of the internal carotid artery: Endovascular revascularization technique of long occlusive lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite series of endovascular recanalization of chronically occluded ICA (COICA) have been already reported, technical aspects of this strategy were not described. We discussed technical details and feasibility of this strategy.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Five COICA (C1-cavernous ICA) patients presenting symptomatic hypoperfusion were recanalized with multiple coronary and carotid stents. All patients experienced long-term reperfusion with resolution of the clinical symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular revascularization of COICA appears feasible and associated with improvement of the hypoperfusion.
