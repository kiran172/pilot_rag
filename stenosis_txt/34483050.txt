Title: 2021 CSANZ and ANZSCTS Position Statement on the Operator and Institutional Requirements for a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) Program in Australia.

Abstract: This document establishes the minimum standard for accreditation of institutions and operators as endorsed by the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) and the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS). The original Joint Society Position Statement was ratified in August 2014. This 2021 update replaces the original and serves as a consensus within which the Conjoint Committee for Trancatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) Accreditation will function, as recommended by Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) Determination for TAVI. This is not a Guideline Statement but takes into consideration regional, legislative, and health system factors important to establishing requirements for TAVI accreditation in Australia.
