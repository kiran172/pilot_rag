Title: Single access transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation for challenging iliofemoral route.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Optimal access for transcatheter aortic valve implantation is still a matter of debate. A tailored approach for patient anatomy is mandatory to reduce vascular complications and improve outcomes.
AIMS: To optimize surgical technique in challenge scenario.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here, we present a case of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement performed using single arterial access.
RESULTS: A 92 years old patients affected by severe aortic stenosis showed no secondary arterial access. A single access approach was performed using the aortic valve calcification and the inferior margin of the second rib as lankdmarks for valve implantation.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Alternative options for TAVR are mandatory to deal with complex cases. The described technique is a simple and reproducible approach.
