Title: Extracranial Carotid-Vertebral Artery Bypass Technique and Surgical Outcomes.

Abstract: Vertebral artery (VA) occlusion is frequently encountered, usually without acute ischemic injury of the brain. However, when it is accompanied by hypoplasia or stenosis of the opposite VA, brain ischemia may develop due to insufficient collateral supply. Both hemodynamic instability and embolic infarction can occur in VA occlusion, which may cause severe symptoms in a patient. Extracranial carotid-VA bypass should be considered for symptomatic VA occlusion patients, especially when the patient has repeated ischemic brain injuries. In this report, the cases of three extracranial carotid-VA bypass patients are introduced, along with a brief description of the surgical techniques. All three cases were treated with different bypass methods according to their disease location.
