Title: Combined Triple Transcatheter Aortic Procedure in a Patient With Aortic Stenosis, Coarctation, and Aneurysm.

Abstract: We present the case of a 71-year-old man admitted because of chest tightness, palpitations, and progressive shortness of breath. The diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis, coarctation, and aneurysm was established, as well as severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Three consecutive transcatheter procedures were successfully performed in a single session. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
