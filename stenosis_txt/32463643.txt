Title: Newborn Circumcision Techniques.

Abstract: Newborn male circumcision is a common elective surgical procedure for the removal of foreskin covering the glans penis. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Family Physicians recognize that there are health benefits of newborn male circumcision but do not universally recommend the procedure. Performing male circumcision during the neonatal period has several advantages, including a lower risk of complications, faster healing, and lower cost. The three most common techniques for newborn male circumcision utilize the Mogen clamp, the Gomco clamp, or the Plastibell device. Complications are uncommon and can include bleeding, injury to the penis, adhesions, excessive skin removal, phimosis, and meatal stenosis. Anatomic and medical contraindications may require that the procedure be deferred beyond the neonatal period. Infants with anatomic abnormalities should be referred to a pediatric urologist. Physicians should present information about potential benefits and risks rather than withholding or recommending circumcision. Parents should weigh the health benefits and risks and consider their own religious, cultural, and personal preferences when making the decision.
