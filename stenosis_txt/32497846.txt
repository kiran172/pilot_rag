Title: Three-Dimensional versus 2-Dimensional Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy: Surgical Results of a Preliminary Comparative Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3-D) endoscopes have been widely used for a large variety of approaches in neurosurgical practice. However, in the last decade, 3-D scopes were barely used for ventricular surgery. In this study, we illustrated our preliminary experience with a 3-D endoscope for third ventriculostomy using new dedicated endoscopic equipment.
METHODS: Over a 12-month period, a high-definition 3-D endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed in 14 patients with obstructive hydrocephalus. Patients were followed prospectively and compared retrospectively with a matched group of 16 similar patients who underwent ETV with a standard 2-dimensional (2-D) endoscope. Surgical outcome and intra- and postoperative course were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: 3-D ETV provided excellent surgical results, and no significant difference was shown in terms of outcome, complication, and length of hospitalization between the 2 groups. Moreover, operative time (minutes) was significantly shorter in the 3-D group than the 2-D ETV group (19.9 ± 4.8 vs. 22.9 ± 1.4, respectively; P < 0.05), and the use of the 3-D endoscope provided subjective improvements of depth perception, hand-eye coordination, and surgeon comfort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary study clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of 3-D ETV and provided a significant reduction of operative time. Depth information from the 3-D scope appears to facilitate rapid and stable ETV maneuvers, representing a critical development that may become a valuable tool for neuroendoscopy.
