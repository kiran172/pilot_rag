Title: Risk factors for anastomotic stenosis after radical resection of rectal cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: Radical resection of rectal cancer is a safe and effective treatment, but there remain several complications related to anastomosis. We aimed to assess the risk factors and incidence of rectal anastomotic stenosis (AS) after rectal cancer resection. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis after searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Medline databases from inception until May 2023. Data are reported as the combined odds ratio (OR) for categorical variables and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous variables. Six hundred and fifty-nine studies were retrieved, nine (3031 patients) of which were included in the meta-analysis. Young age (WMD = -3.09, P = 0.0002), male sex (OR = 1.53, P = 0.0002), smoking (OR = 1.54, P = 0.009), radiotherapy (OR = 2.34, P = 0.0002), protective stoma (OR = 2.88, P = 0.007), intersphincteric resection surgery (OR = 6.28, P = 0.05), anastomotic fistula (OR = 3.72, P = 0.003), and anastomotic distance (WMD = -3.11, P = 0.0006) were identified as factors that increased the risk of AS, while staple (OR = 0.39, P < 0.001) was a protective factor. The incidence of AS after rectal cancer resection was approximately 17% (95% CI: 13%-21%). We identified eight risk factors and one protective factor associated with AS after rectal cancer resection. These factors may be combined in future studies to develop a more comprehensive and accurate prediction model related to AS after rectal cancer resection.
