Title: Long-Term Results of Percutaneous Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty in Children With Aortic Stenosis: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Congenital aortic stenosis is a common pathology in the childhood age group and its clinical spectrum varies between asymptomatic and severe heart failure. In our study, we planned to evaluate the long-term results of patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) due to critical aortic valve stenosis in our clinic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Patients aged 0-18 years who underwent aortic balloon valvuloplasty due to aortic stenosis in our clinic between January 2002 and January 2022 were retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: Among the 48 patients who underwent balloon valvuloplasty due to aortic stenosis, 13 (27%) were female, and 35 (73%) were male. The median age at the time of the procedure was 27.5 months (IQR: 4-96), the median weight was 9.9 kg (IQR: 5.40-29.50), and the median height was 79 cm (IQR: 54-133). The median follow-up duration was 93.5 months (IQR: 38-132). Angiographic assessments in all patients revealed a median left ventricular pressure of 160 mmHg (IQR: 140-200) and a median pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta of 60 mmHg (IQR: 42-80). The median balloon diameter used was 10 mm (IQR: 8-12). Post-procedural measurements showed a median mean gradient of 30 mmHg (IQR: 20-35) between the left ventricle and the aorta. The procedure was successful in 45 (93.5%) patients. During follow-up, 11 patients required surgical intervention. Ross procedure was performed in five patients, homograft in five patients, and mechanical valve implantation in one patient. Risk factors for the need for surgical intervention were evaluated in detail. During the follow-up, the risk factor for intervention was determined to be aortic insufficiency.
CONCLUSION: Aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty is a safe and successful treatment method for critical aortic stenosis. It should be the first choice of treatment option in suitable patients.
