Title: The endoscopic management of oesophageal strictures.

Abstract: An oesophageal stricture refers to a narrowing of the oesophageal lumen, which may be benign or malignant. The cardinal feature is dysphagia, and this may result from intrinsic oesophageal disease or extrinsic compression. Oesophageal strictures can be further classified as simple or complex depending on stricture length, location, diameter, and underlying aetiology. Many endoscopic options are now available for treating oesophageal strictures including dilatation, injectional therapy, stenting, stricturotomy, and ablation. Self-expanding metal stents have revolutionised the palliation of malignant dysphagia, but oesophageal dilatation with balloon or bougienage remains first-line therapy for most benign strictures. The increase in endoscopic and surgical interventions on the oesophagus has seen more benign refractory oesophageal strictures that are difficult to treat, and often require advanced endoscopic techniques. In this review, we provide a practical overview on the evidence-based management of both benign and malignant oesophageal strictures, including a practical algorithm for managing benign refractory strictures.
