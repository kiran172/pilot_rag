Title: Endovascular therapy of subclavian artery occlusive disease involving the vertebral artery origin.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Background: While the majority of subclavian artery (SA) lesions are localized in the proximal segment, the evidence in patients with medial SA disease involving the vertebral artery (VA) origin are scarce.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent percutaneous revascularization of the SA at our institution.
RESULTS: A total of 196 patients were retrospectively analyzed. The majority of SA lesions (n = 163, 83 %) were located in the proximal segment, whereas 28 lesions (14 %) were located in the medial segment, and only 5 lesions (3 %) involved the distal segment. Procedural success was high for both stenosis (96 %) and occlusion (89 %) and did not differ depending on lesion location. Revascularization techniques in the medial segment included stenting of the SA only (13 patients), additional VA balloon-dilatation (6 patients), and bifurcation stenting of the SA and VA using T-stenting technique (9 patients). Outcome after a median of 12 months showed no significant differences in freedom from restenosis between proximal and medial lesions (90 % vs. 95 %; p = 0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular revascularization of SA disease with medial segments involving the VA origin required more complex techniques and showed long-term patency rates comparable to those in lesions located within the proximal SA.
