Title: Energy Loss Index and Dimensionless Index Outperform Direct Valve Planimetry in Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Among patients with suspected severe aortic stenosis (AS), discordance between effective orifice area (EOA) and transvalvular gradients is frequent and requires a multiparametric workup including flow assessment and calcium-scoring to confirm true severe AS. The aim of this study was to assess direct planimetry, energy loss index (Eli) and dimensionless index (DI) as stand-alone parameters to identify non-severe AS in discordant cases. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we included consecutive AS patients &gt; 70 years with EOA &lt; 1.0 cm2 referred for valve replacement between 2014 and 2017. AS severity was retrospectively reassessed using the multiparametric work-up recommended in the 2021 ESC/EACTS guidelines. DI and ELi were calculated, and valve area was measured by direct planimetry on transesophageal echocardiography. Results: A total of 101 patients (mean age 82 y; 57% male) were included. Discordance between EOA and gradients was observed in 46% and non-severe AS found in 24% despite an EOA &lt; 1 cm2. Valve planimetry performed poorly, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.64. At a cut-off value of &gt;0.82 cm2, sensitivity and specificity to identify non-severe AS were 67 and 66%, respectively. DI and ELi showed a higher diagnostic accuracy, with an AUC of 0.77 and 0.76, respectively. Cut-off values of &gt;0.24 and &gt;0.6 cm2/m2 identified non-severe AS, with a high specificity of 79% and 91%, respectively. Conclusions: Almost one in four patients with EOA &lt; 1 cm2 had non-severe AS according to guideline-recommended multiparametric assessment. Direct valve planimetry revealed poor diagnostic accuracy and should be interpreted with caution. Usual prognostic cut-off values for DI &gt; 0.24 and ELI &gt; 0.6 cm2/m2 identified non-severe AS with high specificity and should therefore be included in the assessment of low-gradient AS.
