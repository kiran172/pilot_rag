Title: Clinical Impact of Preexisting Right Bundle Branch Block after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now the treatment of choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis regardless of their surgical risk. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) can be a predictor for development of significant atrioventricular (AV) block after TAVR, requiring permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). However, data related to the risk of PPI requirement with preexisting RBBB is scarce. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess clinical outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR with RBBB on preexisting electrocardiogram.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review to identify randomized and nonrandomized clinical studies that reported any clinical impact of patients undergoing TAVR with preexisting RBBB. A total of eight databases including PubMed (Medline), Embase, Cochrane Library, ACP Journal Club, Scopus, DARE, and Ovid containing articles from January 2000 to May 2020 were analyzed.
RESULTS: We identified and screened 224 potential eligible publications through the databases and found 14 relevant clinical trials for a total of 15,319 participants. There was an increased 30-day pacemaker implantation rate of 38.1% in the RBBB group compared to 11.4% in the no RBBB group with a risk ratio of 3.56 (RR 3.56 (95% CI 3.21-3.93, p &lt; 0.01)). There was an increased 30-day all-cause mortality in the RBBB group of 9.5% compared with 6.3% in the no RBBB group with an odds ratio of 1.60 (OR 1.60 (95% CI 1.14-2.25, p &lt; 0.01)).
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that patients with preexisting RBBB have higher incidence of PPI and all-cause mortality after TAVR compared with patients without RBBB. Further trials are needed to compare the clinical outcomes based on TAVR valve types and assess the benefit of PPI in patients with new-onset RBBB after TAVR.
