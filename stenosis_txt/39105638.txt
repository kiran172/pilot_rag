Title: Reliability of CT Enterography for Describing Fibrostenosing Crohn Disease.

Abstract: Background Standardized methods to measure and describe Crohn disease strictures at CT enterography are needed to guide clinical decision making and for use in therapeutic studies. Purpose To assess the reliability of CT enterography features to describe Crohn disease strictures and their correlation with stricture severity. Materials and Methods A retrospective study was conducted in 43 adult patients with symptomatic terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures who underwent standard-of-care CT enterography at a tertiary care center at the Cleveland Clinic between January 2008 and August 2016. After training on standardized definitions, four abdominal radiologists blinded to all patient information assessed imaging features (seven continuous measurements and nine observations) of the most distal ileal stricture in two separate sessions (separated by ≥2 weeks) in random order. Features with an interrater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.41 or greater (ie, moderate reliability or better) were considered reliable. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis identified reliable features associated with a visual analog scale of overall stricture severity. Significant reliable features were assessed as components of a CT enterography-based model to quantitate stricture severity. Results Examinations in 43 patients (mean age, 52 years ± 16 [SD]; 23 female) were evaluated. Five continuous measurements and six observations demonstrated at least moderate interrater reliability (interrater ICC range, 0.42 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.57] to 0.80 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.88]). Of these, 10 were univariably associated with stricture severity, and three continuous measurements-stricture length (interrater ICC, 0.64 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.81]), maximal associated small bowel dilation (interrater ICC, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.88]), and maximal stricture wall thickness (interrater ICC, 0.50 [95% CI: 0.34, 0.62])-were independently associated (P value range, &lt;.001 to .003) with stricture severity in a multivariable model. These three measurements were used to derive a well-calibrated (optimism-adjusted calibration slope = 1.00) quantitative model of stricture severity. Conclusion Standardized CT enterography measurements and observations can reliably describe terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures. Stricture length, maximal associated small bowel dilation, and maximal stricture wall thickness are correlated with stricture severity. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.
