Title: Retrograde open celiac stenting for ischemic hepatitis after pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Abstract: A 74-year-old man with pancreatic cancer had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy and subsequently developed ischemic hepatitis secondary to high-grade celiac artery stenosis. Celiac antegrade stenting via brachial artery access was unsuccessful, and open antegrade bypass would have required takedown of the pancreatic and/or biliary anastomoses for adequate exposure. Retrograde open celiac stenting was, therefore, successfully performed via the gastroduodenal artery stump. His ischemic hepatitis resolved, and he was ultimately discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy. Computed tomography angiography at 6 months demonstrated a widely patent celiac stent. Retrograde open celiac stenting via the gastroduodenal artery stump is an alternative to open bypass for celiac revascularization not amenable to percutaneous antegrade stenting in patients who have undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy.
