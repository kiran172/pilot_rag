Title: Predictors of stricture after non-circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection of the esophagus and single-dose triamcinolone injection immediately after the procedure.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Local triamcinolone (TA) injection is widely used to prevent stricture formation after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). However, stricture develops in up to 45% of patients despite this prophylactic measure. We therefore conducted a single-center prospective study to identify predictors of stricture after esophageal ESD and local TA injection.
METHODS: Patients who underwent esophageal ESD and local TA injection and who were comprehensively assessed for lesion- and ESD-related factors were included in the study. Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the predictors of stricture.
RESULTS: A total of 203 patients were included in the analysis. Multivariate analysis identified residual mucosal width ≤5 mm (odds ratio [OR], 29.0; P < .0001) or 6 to 10 mm (OR, 3.7; P = .04), history of chemoradiotherapy (OR, 5.1; P = .045), and tumor in the cervical or upper thoracic esophagus (OR, 3.8; P = .018) as independent predictors of stricture. Based on the ORs of the predictors, patients were stratified into 2 groups according to stricture risk: patients in the high-risk group (residual mucosal width ≤5 mm or 6-10 mm with another predictor) had a stricture rate of 52.5% (31 of 59 cases), and patients in the low-risk group (residual mucosal width ≥11 mm or 6-10 mm without other predictors) had a stricture rate of 6.3% (9 of 144 cases).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified predictors of stricture after ESD and local TA injection. Local TA injection prevented stricture formation after ESD in low-risk patients but was not sufficient to prevent stricture in high-risk patients. Additional interventions should thus be considered in high-risk patients. (University Hospital Medical Network Clinical Trials Registry number: UMIN 000028894.).
