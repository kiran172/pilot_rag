Title: A Gap in Care Leads to Progression of Fibrosis in Eosinophilic Esophagitis Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are few data assessing disease progression in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) after diagnosis. We aimed to determine outcomes and assess for progression of fibrosis in patients with EoE with a gap in their regular care.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with EoE, a "gap" in care was defined as ≥2 years without medical contact for EoE. For inclusion, a gap in care and both pre- and post-gap endoscopies were required. Patients with and without a gap were compared. Data were also compared in gap patients before the gap and after EoE care resumed, and progression of fibrosis and predictors were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 701 patients with EoE, 95 (14%) had a gap in care (mean time without care, 4.8 ± 2.3 years). Post-gap, 12% presented with food impaction requiring emergency evaluation. Compared with pre-gap, patients post-gap had higher endoscopic severity (2.4 vs 1.5; P < .001) and smaller esophageal diameters (11.0 vs 12.7 mm; P = .04). Strictures were more prevalent with longer gap time (P < .05 for trend). Each additional year of gap time increased odds of stricture by 26%, even after accounting for pre-gap dilation. Additionally, of 67 patients without pre-gap fibrosis, 25 (37%) had at least one fibrotic feature (stricture, narrowing, or requiring dilation) post-gap.
CONCLUSIONS: A gap in care of ≥2 years in patients with EoE was associated with signs of increased disease activity, and progression to fibrostenosis was noted, particularly with longer gaps in care. Because EoE can progress to fibrosis even after diagnosis, regular care in patients with EoE is required, perhaps at intervals <2 years.
