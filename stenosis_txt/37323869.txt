Title: Race-Specific Impact of Conventional Surgical Risk Score on 1-Year Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Interracial differences in the distribution and prognostic value of conventional Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score on long-term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the impact of STS scores on clinical outcomes at 1-year after TAVR between Asian and non-Asian populations.
METHODS: We used the Trans-Pacific TAVR (TP-TAVR) registry, a multinational multicenter, observational registry involving patients undergoing TAVR at 2 major centers in the United States and 1 major center in Korea. Patients were classified into 3 groups (low, intermediate, and high-risk) according to the STS score and compared between STS risk groups and race. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 1-year.
RESULTS: Among 1,412 patients, 581 were Asian and 831 were non-Asian. The distribution of the STS risk score group was different between Asian and non-Asian groups (62.5% low-, 29.8% intermediate-, and 7.7% high-risk in Asian vs 40.6% low-, 39.1% intermediate-, and 20.3% high-risk in non-Asian). In the Asian population, the all-cause mortality at 1-year was substantially higher in the high-risk STS group than in the low- and intermediate-risk groups (3.6% low-risk, 8.7% intermediate-risk, and 24.4% high-risk; log-rank P &lt; 0.001), which was primarily driven by noncardiac mortality. In the non-Asian group, there was a proportional increase in all-cause mortality at 1-year according to the STS risk category (5.3% low-risk, 12.6% intermediate-risk, and 17.8% high-risk; log-rank P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In this multiracial registry of patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR, we identified a differential proportion and prognostic impact of STS score on 1-year mortality between Asian and non-Asian patients (TP-TAVR [Transpacific TAVR Registry]; NCT03826264).
