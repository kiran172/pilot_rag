Title: A case of surgical pulmonary artery plasty for pulmonary artery stenosis after right single-lung transplantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In lung transplantation, vascular complications are relatively rare. However, severe pulmonary artery stenosis after lung transplantation can cause clinical symptoms and lead to graft dysfunction.
CASE PRESENTATION: The present patient underwent right lung transplantation for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After lung transplantation, pulmonary blood flow scintigraphy showed a decreased blood flow to the transplanted lung, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed pulmonary artery anastomotic stenosis. As the initial treatment, balloon dilation of the pulmonary artery was attempted and unsuccessful. Right pulmonary artery plasty was then performed 5Â months after lung transplantation. Following the procedure, the pulmonary artery stenosis was released, and the blood flow to the transplanted lung improved.
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment should be considered for pulmonary artery stenosis after lung transplantation if minimally invasive intervention is not effective.
