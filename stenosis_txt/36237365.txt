Title: Intracerebral Hemorrhage Caused by Thrombosis of a Developmental Venous Anomaly with an Unusual Structure: A Case Report.

Abstract: Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are common intracranial vascular malformations and they are generally do not cause clinical complications. In cases showing DVA and hemorrhage, the hemorrhage is usually associated with adjacent cavernous malformations. Very few cases of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) caused by thrombosis in DVA have been reported in the literature. In this case report, we present an interesting case of a large ICH caused by thrombosis within a DVA with an unusual structure that may have potentiated the thrombosis.
