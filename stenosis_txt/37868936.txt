Title: Iatrogenic Left Ventricle Outflow Tract Ventricular Tachycardia Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Case Series.

Abstract: Focal left ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia (LVOT-VT) is rarely reported following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Similarly, unexplained sudden cardiac death after TAVR also is rarely described and may be attributed to VT. We present two cases of patients who underwent TAVR and later presented with VT of suggested LVOT origin. Both patients were treated with amiodarone for suppression of VT.
