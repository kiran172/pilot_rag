Title: Association of Aortic Valve Calcification and High Levels of Lipoprotein (a): Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: This study aimed to assess the association between aortic valve calcification and lipoprotein (a). We searched PUBMED, WOS, and SCOPUS databases. Inclusion criteria were any controlled clinical trials or observational studies that reported the level of Lipoprotein A in patients with aortic valve calcifications, excluding case reports, editorials and animal studies. RevMan software (5.4) was used to perform the meta-analysis. After complete screening, 7 studies were included with a total number of 446,179 patients included in the analysis. The pooled analysis showed a statistically significant association between the incidence of aortic valve calcium and increased levels of lipoprotein (a) compared with controls (SMD = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.04- 2.38, P-value < 0.00001). This meta-analysis showed a statistically significant association between the incidence of aortic valve calcium and increased levels of lipoprotein (a) compared with controls. Patients with high levels of lipoprotein (a) are at increased risk of developing aortic valve calcification. Medications targeting lipoprotein (a) in future clinical trials may be useful in primary prevention of aortic valve calcification in high risk patients.
