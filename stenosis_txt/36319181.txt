Title: [Preliminary results of biportal endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion, decompression and pedicle screw insertion assisted with endoscopic technique for lumbar spinal stenosis combined with spondylolisthesis or instability].

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the preliminary clinical outcomes of biportal endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion (BE-LIF), decompression and pedicle screw insertion assisted with endoscopic technique for lumbar spinal stenosis combined with spondylolisthesis or instability. Methods: The data of 9 patients with single-level lumbar spinal stenosis who underwent BE-LIF, decompression and pedicle screw insertion assisted with biportal endoscopy in Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Hospital from March 1st 2022 to April 30th 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. The visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain in back and legs, and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) of all the patients were collected before operation, on the third day after operation and at the last follow-up. Moreover, the operation time, intra-operation blood loss, radiation shots for pedicle screw insertion, post-operation drainage and ambulation time were recorded. The screw position was checked with CT after the operation. Results: All the patients were female with a mean age of (70.3±8.4) years (ranged 56-84 years); the patients were followed-up for 12-16 weeks. All 9 patients had good clinical results. The VAS scores for back pain on the third day after operation and at the last follow-up were both significantly lower than that preoperatively[(2.9±0.6), (1.8±0.4) vs (6.4±1.1) points, both P&lt;0.05]. The VAS scores for leg pain on the third day after operation and at the last follow-up were both significantly lower than that preoperatively[(1.9±0.3), (1.4±0.5) vs (7.3±1.6) points, P&lt;0.05]. The ODI scores at last follow-up was significantly lower than that before the operation ((24.0%±6.5% vs 55.7%±12.8%, P&lt;0.05). The intra-operative blood loss was (177±103) ml, the drainage amounts post-operation was (122±56) ml, the operation time was (207.8±32.7)min, the ambulation time was (2.3±0.5) days. The total radiation shots for pedicle screw insertion were 20-42 times, the average radiation shots per screw was (6.9±1.5) times. No severe complications or adverse events occurred. No nerve root injury or dural tear occurred in the operation, and no revision surgery needed. Conclusions: The pedicle screw insertion assisted with biportal endoscopic technique can decrease the radiation exposure with good feasibility and safety during the BE-LIF. The BE-LIF combined with the pedicle screw insertion assisted with biportal endoscopy is an effective and safe surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis with good early results.
