Title: Temporal Trends in Pacemaker Implantations Over the Past Decade in France: Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantations.

Abstract: In this study, we assessed the temporal trends of permanent pacemaker implantations in France from 2008 to 2018 using data from the Échantillon Généraliste de Bénéficiaires (EGB) administrative database, a representative sample of the French population. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantations on the overall pacemaker implantation rate. Our data suggest that the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantations in France increased significantly only in patients ≥80 years old, with post-transcatheter aortic valve implantations accounting for at least 2/3 of this increase.
