Title: Severe Stenosis of Mitral Bioprosthetic Valve Thrombosis in a Patient with HCV-Related Cirrhosis and Duodenal Variceal Bleeding: The Deadly Triad.

Abstract: Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis (BPVT) is considered a relatively rare but life-threatening clinical entity. Thus, there is the need of high clinical suspicion in order to make a timely diagnosis and related appropriate therapeutic interventions. In this regard, the management of BPVT is high risk, whatever the option taken (surgery and/or systemic fibrinolysis). The presence of severe comorbidities-as decompensated cirrhosis-further complicates the clinical decision-making process, calling for a patient-tailored integrated multidisciplinary approach. We report a challenging case of a 45-year-old patient with mitral bioprosthetic valve thrombosis and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis complicated by active duodenal variceal bleeding.
