Title: Irreducible L5/S1 Spondyloptosis in Over 20 Years After Neglected Trauma Treated with Modified Grob's Technique - Case Report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Spondyloptosis, characterized by complete slippage of the upper vertebral body relative to the lower vertebral body, is an exceedingly rare condition. Typically, it occurs as a result of a high-energy injury and is promptly managed. It is uncommon for a patient to present to a spinal surgery unit several decades after the initial incident.
CASE REPORT: In this case report, we describe the case of a 62-year-old man who experienced a lumbosacral injury from a fall twenty years prior to seeking treatment. The patient had multiple comorbidities, including obesity and internal medicine conditions. He presented with severe back pain radiating to the lower extremities, accompanied by significant neurogenic chroma and lower extremity weakness. Imaging studies revealed spondyloptosis at the L5/S1 level, along with bony fusion and spinal canal stenosis at the L3/L4 level.
CONCLUSION: The patient underwent surgical intervention using Grob's direct pediculo-body fixation technique. The postoperative period was uneventful, and over the course of one year of follow-up, the patient experienced a resolution of symptoms and significant improvement in functional capacity.
