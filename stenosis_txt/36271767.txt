Title: Usefulness of aliasing phenomenon for diagnosing venous valve stenosis of arteriovenous fistula in a hemodialysis patient.

Abstract: We present venous valve stenosis, which is an uncommon cause of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction. Owing to the thin structure in echography, venous valves are challenging to observe; however, we have found that the aliasing phenomenon is useful for diagnosing venous valve stenosis.
