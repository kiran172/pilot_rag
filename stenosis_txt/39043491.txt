Title: Hypoattenuated Leaflet Thickening: A Comprehensive Review of Contemporary Data.

Abstract: Nearly one-third of patients who undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) develop hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) within a year. HALT typically represents subclinical leaflet thrombosis in asymptomatic patients, and as a result it often is detected incidentally. However, HALT also may worsen in severity, resulting in leaflet immobility and/or valve deterioration. The clinical significance of HALT is a topic of ongoing debate, and currently there is no consensus on the screening and management of HALT in patients following TAVR or SAVR. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the available evidence on risk factors, preventative measures, treatment, and prognosis for this growing patient cohort.
