Title: [A Case of Perforation of the Diverticulum of the Appendix during Chemotherapy with Ramucirumab plus Nab-Paclitaxel for Gastric Cancer].

Abstract: A 65-year-old woman underwent distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection for advanced gastric cancer in November 2016. The histopathological diagnosis was pT3N0M0, pStage â…¡A, HER2-negative. In August 2019, transverse colon stenosis due to peritoneal dissemination was detected, and an ileum-transverse colon anastomosis was performed. Postoperatively, she received chemotherapy with S-1 plus oxaliplatin. After 6 courses, CT revealed an increase in ascites and dissemination nodules. We diagnosed her with progressive disease and initiated second-line chemotherapy, a ramucirumab plus nab-paclitaxel regimen. On the 20th day during the 5th course of treatment, she visited our hospital with acute abdominal pain. CT revealed free air, and we diagnosed acute panperitonitis with a gastrointestinal perforation. Emergency surgery was performed, and perforation of the appendix end and mild cloudy ascites were observed. We performed an appendectomy and intraperitoneal drainage. Histopathological examination revealed perforation of the appendix, possibly as an adverse effect of the ramucirumab. It should be noted that angiogenesis inhibitors may cause the fatal adverse effect of gastrointestinal perforation.
