Title: Semi-embedded valve anastomosis a new anti-reflux anastomotic method after proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a high probability of gastroesophageal reflux after laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction (AEG). Various anti-reflux anastomotic methods are emerging in clinical practice; however, none of them have been widely accepted. We have innovated a new type of anti-reflux anastomotic method, named semi-embedded valve anastomosis. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and anti-reflux effect of the new anastomotic method.
METHODS: The clinical data of 28 patients with Siewert II AEG who were treated by semi-embedded valve anastomosis were collected. The key point of the operation is to reconstruct a simulated valve and form an anti-reflux barrier similar to the physiological mechanism. The gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire (GerdQ) and classification of gastroesophageal reflux under electron microscopy were used to evaluate gastroesophageal reflux after the operation.
RESULTS: The mean operative duration was 164.3 ± 19.0 min, the median intraoperative haemorrhage volume was 65 ml, the average number of lymph nodes dissected was 23 ± 2.6, the time for valve construction was 15.8 ± 3.2 min, the time for anastomotic reconstruction was 35.4 ± 4.8 min, the median time to first flatus was 3 d, and the median hospitalization duration was 12 d. There was one case of postoperative anastomotic stenosis. The GerdQ score [median (range)] was as follows: 2 (0-6), preoperation; 0 (0-8), 1 month postoperation; 2 (0-12), 3 months postoperation; and 3 (0-12), 6 months postoperation. The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test was carried out at different times after the operation and the day before the operation, and the differences were not significant. There was one case of grade B gastroesophageal reflux according to the Los Angeles classification system among the gastrofibroscopic re-examination reports of 28 cases.
CONCLUSION: Semi-embedded valve anastomosis is safe and feasible after proximal gastrectomy for Siewert II AEG and has good anti-reflux effects.
