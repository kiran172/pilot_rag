Title: Ureteral stenosis following iliac artery stenting.

Abstract: Ureteral complications after open aortoiliac reconstruction for aneurysmal and occlusive disease have been reported previously. However, ureteral complications from endovascular interventions for iliac artery disease are relatively rare. We describe a case of left ureteral stenosis resulting in hydroureteronephrosis after multiple endovascular interventions involving the left common and external iliac arteries. The intraoperative findings during robotic ureterolysis revealed significant peri-iliac fibrosis and scarring in the area of the iliac stents. This case illustrates that, although uncommon, ureteral stenosis may occur after iliac stenting owing to peristent fibrosis.
