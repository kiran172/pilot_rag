Title: Diagnostic yield of TOF-MRA for detecting incidental vascular lesions in patients with cognitive impairment: An observational cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The role of three-dimensional (3D) TOF-MRA in patients with cognitive impairment is not well established. We evaluated the diagnostic yield of 3D TOF-MRA for detecting incidental extra- or intracranial artery stenosis and intracranial aneurysm in this patient group.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with cognitive impairment undergoing our brain MRI protocol from January 2013 to February 2020. The diagnostic yield of TOF-MRA for detecting incidental vascular lesions was calculated. Patients with positive TOF-MRA results were reviewed to find whether additional treatment was performed. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the clinical risk factors for positive TOF-MRA findings.
RESULTS: In total, 1,753 patients (mean age, 70.2 Â± 10.6 years; 1,044 women) were included; 199 intracranial aneurysms were detected among 162 patients (9.2%, 162/1,753). A 3D TOF-MRA revealed significant artery stenoses (>50% stenosis) in 162 patients (9.2%, 162/1,753). The overall diagnostic yield of TOF-MRA was 16.8% (294/1,753). Among them, 92 patients (31.3%, 92/294) underwent either medical therapy, endovascular intervention, or surgery. In total, eighty-one patients with stenosis were prescribed with either antiplatelet medications or lipid-lowering agent. In total, fifteen patients (aneurysm: 11 patients, stenosis: 4 patients) were further treated with endovascular intervention or surgery. Thus, the "number needed to scan" was 19 for identifying one patient requiring treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that being female (odds ratio [OR] 2.05) and old age (OR 1.04) were the independent risk factors for intracranial aneurysm; being male (OR 1.52), old age (OR 1.06), hypertension (OR 1.78), and ischemic heart disease history (OR 2.65) were the independent risk factors for significant artery stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the potential benefit of 3D TOF-MRA, given that it showed high diagnostic yield for detecting vascular lesions in patients with cognitive impairment and the considerable number of these lesions required further treatment. A 3D TOF-MRA may be included in the routine MR protocol for the work-up of this patient population, especially in older patients and patients with vascular risk factors.
