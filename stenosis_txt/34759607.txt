Title: Middle Lobe Syndrome in Silicosis.

Abstract: A case of silicosis presenting as middle lobe syndrome is described in a middle-aged female. The diagnosis was confirmed by both bronchoscopy and demonstration of right middle lobe lumen narrowing and compression by calcified hilar lymph nodes on computerized tomographic scan. Simultaneous occurrence of endobronchial silicosis and bronchial stenosis by enlarged calcified peribronchial lymph nodes causing middle lobe syndrome has not been described previously as reported in this case.
