Title: Targeted Knockdown of Hepatic Δ-5 Fatty Acid Desaturase FADS1 Aggravates Atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- Mice.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The endogenous metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids is regulated by the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster and is strongly associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. However, the association between FADS and atherosclerosis remains a subject of debate.
METHODS: In this study, we specifically investigated the physiological role of Δ-5 fatty acid desaturase (FADS1) in aortic and peripheral vessel (namely, the femoral artery) atherosclerosis by targeting the selective knockdown of hepatic Fads1 in apolipoprotein E-null (ApoE-⁣/-) mice with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).
RESULTS: Knockdown of hepatic Fads1 in ApoE-⁣/- mice exacerbated aortic atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), resulting in weight loss. Upregulation of FADS1 mRNA expression in more severe atherosclerosis vascular tissues potentially caused the upregulation of angiopoietin-like 4 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that knockdown of hepatic Fads1 in ApoE-⁣/- mice aggravates spontaneous atherosclerosis and NAFLD but does not affect peripheral atherosclerosis (femoral artery) induced by vascular cuff combined with tandem stenosis.
