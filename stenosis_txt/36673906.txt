Title: Association of Hallux Valgus with Degenerative Spinal Diseases: A Population-Based Cohort Study.

Abstract: Background: Although hallux valgus is known to cause lower-back pain, the association between hallux valgus and spinal degenerative disease remains unclear. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2015 using data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in Taiwan. After propensity score matching for age, sex, and some potential comorbidities, 1000 individuals newly diagnosed with hallux valgus were enrolled in the study group, while 1000 individuals never diagnosed with hallux valgus served as the control group. Both groups were followed up until 2015 to evaluate the incidence of hallux valgus. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine the cumulative incidence of hallux valgus, while the Cox proportional hazard model was adopted to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The incidence densities of spinal degeneration in the hallux valgus and non-hallux valgus groups were 73.10 and 42.63 per 1000 person-years, respectively. An increased risk of spinal degenerative changes was associated with hallux valgus (adjusted HR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.50−2.05). Age- and sex-stratified analyses showed a significantly higher risk of spinal degeneration in the hallux valgus group. Moreover, sub-outcome evaluations revealed significantly higher risks of spondylosis (aHR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.55−2.61), intervertebral disorder (aHR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.62−3.17), and spinal stenosis (aHR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.47−1.76). There was also an increased risk of spinal degenerative change in those with hallux valgus without surgical intervention (aHR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.66−2.99, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Hallux valgus was associated with increased risk of degenerative spinal changes and other spinal disorders.
