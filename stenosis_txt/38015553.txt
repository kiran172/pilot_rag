Title: Effect of plaque morphological characteristics on the outcomes of carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) represents today an accepted option for the treatment of severe carotid artery stenosis. The evolution of materials, techniques, perioperative medical management and patients' selection, has allowed to progressively reduce CAS complications. However, the main drawback of CAS is still represented by the risk of cerebral embolization, that may occur during several steps of the procedure and also in the early postoperative period. Preoperative carotid plaque morphological characteristics may have a great role in determining the risk of embolization during CAS. This review summarizes the current knowledge on carotid plaque characteristics that may influence the risk of complication during CAS. This information may be important for the optimization of CAS patients' selection and adaptation of the materials and techniques.
