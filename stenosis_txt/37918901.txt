Title: Aortic valve perivascular adipose tissue computed tomography attenuation in patients with aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Aortic stenosis (AS) shares pathophysiological similarities with atherosclerosis including active inflammation. CT attenuation of perivascular adipose tissue provides a measure of vascular inflammation that is linked to prognosis and has the potential to be applied to the aortic valve. We investigated perivascular adipose tissue attenuation around the aortic valve in patients with AS.
METHODS: CT attenuation was measured in the perivascular adipose tissue extending 3 mm radially and 10 mm longitudinally around the aortic valve in patients with and without AS. Associations between perivascular adipose tissue attenuation and AS disease severity, activity and progression were investigated.
RESULTS: Perivascular adipose tissue attenuation around the aortic valve demonstrated good intraobserver and interobserver repeatability (interobserver: intraclass correlation coefficient 0.977 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.99)) but was similar between patients with AS (n=120) and control subjects (n=80) (-62.4 (-68.7, -56.5) Hounsfield units (HU) vs -61.2 (-65.3, -55.6) HU, p=0.099). There were no differences between perivascular adipose tissue attenuation in patients with mild (-60.2 (-66.9, -55.1) HU), moderate (-62.8 (-69.6, -56.80) HU) or severe (-62.3 (-69.3, -55.4) HU) AS (all p&gt;0.05), and perivascular adipose tissue attenuation did not demonstrate an association with AS severity as assessed by echocardiography or CT calcium scoring, nor with disease activity assessed by 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography. Moreover, there was no association between baseline aortic valve perivascular adipose tissue attenuation and subsequent AS progression (annualised change in peak velocity: r=0.072, p=0.458). Similar results were found using five other image analysis methods.
CONCLUSIONS: CT-derived aortic valve perivascular adipose tissue attenuation is not associated with AS disease severity, activity or progression suggesting that it has no value in the investigation and management of patients with AS.
