Title: Dynamic myocardial CT perfusion imaging-state of the art.

Abstract: In patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), dynamic myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging combined with coronary CT angiography (CTA) has become a comprehensive diagnostic examination technique resulting in both anatomical and quantitative functional information on myocardial blood flow, and the presence and grading of stenosis. Recently, CTP imaging has been proven to have good diagnostic accuracy for detecting myocardial ischemia, comparable to stress magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography perfusion, while being superior to single photon emission computed tomography. Dynamic CTP accompanied by coronary CTA can serve as a gatekeeper for invasive workup, as it reduces unnecessary diagnostic invasive coronary angiography. Dynamic CTP also has good prognostic value for the prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events. In this article, we will provide an overview of dynamic CTP, including the basics of coronary blood flow physiology, applications and technical aspects including protocols, image acquisition and reconstruction, future perspectives, and scientific challenges. KEY POINTS: • Stress dynamic myocardial CT perfusion combined with coronary CTA is a comprehensive diagnostic examination technique resulting in both anatomical and quantitative functional information. • Dynamic CTP imaging has good diagnostic accuracy for detecting myocardial ischemia comparable to stress MRI and PET perfusion. • Dynamic CTP accompanied by coronary CTA may serve as a gatekeeper for invasive workup and can guide treatment in obstructive coronary artery disease.
