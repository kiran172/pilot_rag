Title: Transthyretin amyloidosis in spinal canal stenosis: A systematic review.

Abstract: We systematically review literature regarding the contribution of transthyretin amyloidosis to spinal stenosis. Amyloidosis is a protein misfolding condition that causes systemic deposition of amyloid and commonly leads to heart failure and nephropathy. A growing body of literature suggests that amyloid deposits within the ligamentum flavum are frequently associated with spinal stenosis with subsequent myelopathy. Our search identified 67 publications from the PubMed database for literature review. After evaluating the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 18 articles were included in the review. Each article was evaluated for country, study type, sample size, amyloidosis subtype, spinal level, systemic symptoms, treatment, patient outcome, and conclusions. Many studies concluded that lumbar ligamentum flavum hypertrophy is more severe in patients with amyloidosis due to associated amyloid deposition. Additionally, patients with systemic amyloidosis are more likely to have recurrence of spinal stenosis. Multiple studies encourage routine screening be performed on spinal stenosis patients to target those needing cardiac surveillance. Amyloid deposition is frequently associated with spinal stenosis, and its presence may provide an earlier opportunity to diagnose or predict systemic amyloidosis. Surgeons should consider obtaining intraoperative biopsy to identify amyloidosis and inform screening postoperatively. Finally, physicians should be aware of this association and counsel patients accordingly on the risks and treatment options available for amyloidosis.
