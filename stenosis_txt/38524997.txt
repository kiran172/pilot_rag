Title: Endovascular Treatment of Postpancreatectomy Hemorrhage from the Retroportal Artery with Compression of the Celiac Trunk by the Median Arcuate Ligament: A Case Report.

Abstract: Retroportal artery is one of the communicating arteries between the hepatic artery and the superior mesenteric artery, but it is often a small artery and usually unrecognized. We report a 60-year-old man that was successfully treated for postpancreatectomy hemorrhage from the retroportal artery with compression of the celiac trunk by the median arcuate ligament. Following the pancreaticoduodenectomy, the bloody discharge was discovered through the drainage catheter. We underwent transcatheter arterial embolization for the bleeding from the retroportal artery associated with a postoperative pancreatic fistula. Additionally, because a stenosis of the common hepatic artery was discovered, we consequently installed a stent-graft on the common hepatic artery to prevent the liver failure due to decreased hepatic blood flow.
