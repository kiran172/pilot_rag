Title: Cerebral and Systemic Stress Parameters in Correlation with Jugulo-Arterial CO<sub>2</sub> Gap as a Marker of Cerebral Perfusion during Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: Intraoperative stress is common to patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA); thus, impaired oxygen and metabolic balance may appear. In this study, we aimed to identify new markers of intraoperative cerebral ischemia, with predictive value on postoperative complications during CEA, performed in regional anesthesia. A total of 54 patients with significant carotid stenosis were recruited and submitted to CEA. Jugular and arterial blood samples were taken four times during operation, to measure the jugulo-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (P(j-a)CO<sub>2</sub>), and cortisol, S100B, L-arginine, and lactate levels. A positive correlation was found between preoperative cortisol levels and all S100B concentrations. In addition, they are positively correlated with P(j-a)CO<sub>2</sub> values. Conversely, postoperative cortisol inversely correlates with P(j-a)CO<sub>2</sub> and postoperative S100B values. A negative correlation was observed between maximum systolic and pulse pressures and P(j-a)CO<sub>2</sub> after carotid clamp and before the release of clamp. Our data suggest that preoperative cortisol, S100B, L-arginine reflect patients' frailty, while these parameters postoperatively are influenced by intraoperative stress and injury. As a novelty, P(j-a)CO<sub>2</sub> might be an emerging indicator of cerebral blood flow during CEA.
