Title: High Risk Percutaneous Coronary Intervention of Left Main Bifurcation Stenosis in a Peritoneal Dialysis Patient.

Abstract: Complex coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease. We report a case of a patient on peritoneal dialysis, preloaded with Prasugrel and acetylsalicylic acid as Ð° potent dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). The patient underwent a high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to bifurcation stenosis of the left main stem branch. A "double kiss crush" bifurcation stenting technique was performed. This case provides additional data about the treatment of this group of patients, a group that is often excluded from randomized control trials, but is frequently encountered in cardiovascular practice. Furthermore, it helps to advance PCI treatment along with exploring the safety of potent DAPT in a group that is susceptible to both ischemia and bleeding, thus presenting a great challenge in the decision for treatment.
