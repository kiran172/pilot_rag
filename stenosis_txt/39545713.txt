Title: Multiple Treatment Strategies of Accessory Renal Artery Related Hypertension: Report of Two Cases and Literature Review.

Abstract: Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is a primary cause of secondary hypertension, primarily driven by the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation. Recently, growing studies suggested accessory renal artery (ARA) might also contribute to RVH. However, the treatment of ARA-related hypertension and whether to take interventional treatment lack consensus. Herein, we report two cases of ARA-related hypertension in our hospital. Imaging studies of both patients showed ARA stenosis. One patient had ARA occlusion well-compensated through tortuous collateral branches, achieving normal blood pressure by medical treatment alone. The other patient had ARA stenosis coexisted with main renal artery stenosis, and revascularization of both arteries led to a significant postoperative reduction in blood pressure. A literature review was conducted to summarize overall treatment strategies for ARA-related hypertension and clarify the relationship between ARA and hypertension. Recent research supported an association between ARA and hypertension. While medical therapy remains the first-line treatment for ARA-related hypertension, interventional procedures should be considered for patients whose blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite conservative management.
