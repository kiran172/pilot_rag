Title: Importance of incidental coronary artery calcification in early diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The early diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) enables early intervention for the modifiable risk factors of the disease. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) detected incidentally on standard noncontrast chest computed tomography (CT) provides an opportunity for the early diagnosis of CAD. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that CAC should be routinely reported when evaluating thoracic CT examinations. Routine reporting of CAC will contribute to the early diagnosis of CAD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study included 279 patients who underwent conventional coronary angiography (CAG) and CT within one month before undergoing CAG. The CAG and CT images of the patients were evaluated retrospectively. The levels of coronary artery stenosis were determined in reference to the CAG images. The CAC scores of the patients were calculated using the Weston method based on their chest CT images.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 63.2 ± 11.5 (range, 41-93) years, and 172 (61.6%) of them were men. The Weston score (WS) was 0 in 18.9% of the patients with obstructive CAD (OCAD), whereas it was ≥ 7 in 27.9% of patients. All patients with a WS of ≥ 7 had OCAD. All patients without luminal stenosis or < 50% stenosis had a WS of < 7.
CONCLUSIONS: The CAC score is useful for the diagnosis of CAD and OCAD. If CAC is identified on standard noncontrast chest CT, it should be scored and reported accordingly. The WS can be used for CAC scoring.
