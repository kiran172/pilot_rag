Title: A New Method for Plastic Closure of an Extensive Laryngotracheal Defect.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Elimination of extensive defects of the larynx and trachea by using musculoskeletal plastics without the use of supporting materials is not always sufficient. Laser modeling of cartilage tissue is a promising technique in modern medicine.
CASE REPORT: This article presents a new method for plastic closure of an extensive defect in the larynx and trachea with the help of costal auto-cartilage modeled by an erbium fiber laser with wavelength of 1.56 Î¼m.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented method allows us to restore the anatomical integrity of the respiratory tract at the final stage of surgical treatment of patients with chronic combined laryngeal and tracheal stenosis. Presented own clinical observation.
