Title: Falsely Raised Gradients After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Obtained with a Nonimaging Probe Due to Brachiocephalic Stenosis.

Abstract: • Elevated gradients after TAVR were seen using a nonimaging CWD probe. • Normal valve function was seen on transesophageal echocardiography. • A retrospective review of CT imaging showed stenosis of the brachiocephalic artery. • Capturing an elevated gradient from another lesion is a pitfall of nonimaging probes.
