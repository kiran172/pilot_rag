Title: Syphilitic ostial coronary artery occlusion treated with percutaneous coronary intervention: Case series and literature review.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Non-atherosclerotic causes of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are important contributors to a substantial number of acute ischemic coronary events. Syphilitic aortitis is a rare complication of tertiary cardiovascular syphilis that may result in ostial coronary artery stenosis, aortic insufficiency, and ascending aortic aneurysm.
METHODS: In this manuscript, we present two Case Reports of patients with bilateral syphilitic coronary artery ostial occlusion, and we review the associated literature. The immunofluorescent test was positive for syphilis in both patients.
RESULTS: Diagnostic coronary angiography revealed bilateral occlusions of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and right coronary artery (RCA), which were successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stents (BMS). After deployment of the stents, arterial blood flow was re-established with TIMI flow grade 3.
DISCUSSION: The angiographic finding of bilateral coronary ostial lesions in young patients should raise the suspicion of cardiovascular syphilis. Options for revascularization should be discussed amongst the patient and the Heart Team. PCI may be an option for treatment of isolated syphilitic coronary stenosis in the setting of acute hemodynamic instability or chronic inflammation.
