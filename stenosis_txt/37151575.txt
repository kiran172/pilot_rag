Title: Posterior decompression and stabilization in a pregnant patient with traumatic lumbar fracture: A case report.

Abstract: Spine fractures with or without spinal cord injury in the pregnant population are rare, with few reported cases. A 25-year-old primigravida at 24 weeks of gestation presented after falling off a fast-moving motorcycle one month prior. She had sustained a severe back injury and had difficulty walking. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute kyphosis secondary to comminuted anterior wedge compression fractures of the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies and L2/3 disc involvement with retropulsion of the fracture fragments into the central canal resulting in severe central canal stenosis. After multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent posterior decompression, reduction and stabilization with pedicle screws. The patient had good neurological recovery at discharge and the pregnancy progressed normally. Three months later, at 39 weeks of gestation, the patient had an uneventful spontaneous delivery of a healthy baby. This case illustrates the importance of multidisciplinary management of spinal cord injury in a pregnant patient.
