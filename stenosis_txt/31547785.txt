Title: Deep Circumflex Iliac Artery as an Inflow Alternative for Surgical Revascularization: A Case Report.

Abstract: The common femoral artery (CFA) is the most widely used inflow in all types of surgical revascularization in patients with peripheral artery disease. However, the CFA cannot always be used because of calcification, obstruction, or previous dissection. Here, we report a rare case of selecting the deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) as a source of inflow to perform a surgical revascularization in a patient with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. A 62-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to necrotized third and fifth toes with pain at rest. Computed tomography showed severe stenosis of the CFA, superficial femoral artery, and deep femoral artery, and an entirely stented external iliac artery. The DCIA was identified as the only patent artery. Considering the condition of the other arteries, we selected the DCIA as a source of inflow. Deep circumflex iliac-popliteal bypass was performed with a saphenous vein. The bypass graft was patent 9 months after surgery and limb salvage had been achieved.
