Title: Switch to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation During Cardiac and Tracheal Repair.

Abstract: Simultaneous repair of congenital tracheal and cardiovascular lesions remains challenging in small patients. We describe two infants weighing less than 3 kg who underwent successful tracheoplasty with concomitant correction of complex heart anomalies. In both operations, cardiopulmonary bypass was switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after cardiac repair to optimize hemostatic function with transfusion and maintain activated clotting time at 200 to 240 seconds. Slide tracheoplasty was performed in a bloodless field, which prevented intraoperative hemorrhage from running down the divided lower trachea into the lung and causing airway obstruction. Both patients were weaned from extracorporeal support during surgery and extubated within 9 days.
