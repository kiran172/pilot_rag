Title: Vessel wall imaging and carotid artery stenting for recurrent cervical internal carotid artery vasospasm syndrome: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recurrent cervical internal carotid artery vasospasm syndrome (RCICVS) causes cerebral infarction, ocular symptoms, and occasionally chest pain accompanied by coronary artery vasospasm. The etiology and optimal treatment remain unclear.
OBSERVATIONS: The authors report a patient with drug-resistant RCICVS who underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS). Magnetic resonance angiography revealed recurrent vasospasm in the cervical segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Vessel wall imaging during an ischemic attack revealed vascular wall thickening of the ICA, similar to that in reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. The superior cervical ganglion was identified at the anteromedial side of the stenosis site. Coronary artery stenosis was also detected. After CAS, the symptoms of cerebral ischemia were prevented for 2 years, but bilateral ocular and chest symptoms did occur.
LESSONS: Vessel wall imaging findings suggest that RCICVS is a sympathetic nervous system-related disease. CAS could be an effective treatment for drug-resistant RCICVS to prevent cerebral ischemic events.
