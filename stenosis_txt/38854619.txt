Title: Tubed myocutaneous pectoralis major flap: A rescue option in esophagus reconstruction.

Abstract: This article presents a complex case of total pharyngoesophageal defect reconstruction in a patient with recurrent supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma. After failed attempts with free microsurgical techniques due to complications, a tubed myocutaneous pectoralis major flap was successfully employed. The procedure aimed to achieve alimentary continuity, speech, and swallowing functionality. Despite initial challenges and concerns about stenosis, the reconstruction of a total pharyngolarygectomy defect resulted in a good functional outcome, although minor deficits in neck mobility and aesthetic donor zone deformities were noted. The case highlights the broad armamentarium of reconstruction techniques that plastic and aesthetic surgery teams must be trained, namely the myocutaneous pectoralis major flap which in selected cases can be the end solution.
