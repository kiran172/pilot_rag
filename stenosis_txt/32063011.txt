Title: Too Much on Your "Plate"? Spectrum of Pathologies Involving the Tectal Plate.

Abstract: The tectal plate comprises the posterior portion of the midbrain, borders the quadrigeminal cistern, and includes the superior and inferior colliculi. Benign and malignant pathologies occurring in this location may lead to aqueductal stenosis, obstructive hydrocephalus, and Parinaud syndrome. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to further characterize lesions involving the tectal plate. In this pictorial essay, we review various tectal plate lesions and their imaging features.
