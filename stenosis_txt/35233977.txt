Title: Functional MRI evaluation of cognitive effects of carotid stenosis revascularization.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Severe internal carotid stenosis, if left untreated, can pose serious risks for ischemic stroke and cognitive impairments. The effects of revascularization on any aspects of cognition, however, are not well understood, as conflicting results are reported, which have mainly been centered on paper-based cognitive analyses. Here, we summarized and evaluated the publications to date of functional MRI (fMRI) studies that examined the mechanisms of functional brain activation and connectivity as a way to reflect cognitive effects of revascularization on patients with carotid stenosis.
METHODS: A PubMed and Google Scholar (covering the relevant literature until November 1, 2021) search yielded eight original studies of the research line, including seven resting-state and one task-based fMRI reports.
RESULTS: Findings demonstrated treatment-related alterations in fMRI signal intensity and symmetry level, regional fMRI activation pattern, and functional brain network connectivity. The functional brain changes were associated largely with improvement in cognitive function assessed using standard cognitive test scores.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the contribution of fMRI to the understanding of brain functional activation and connectivity changes revealing cognitive effects of revascularization in the management of severe carotid stenosis. The review also highlighted the importance of reproducibility through enhancing experimental designs and cognitive task applications with future research for potential clinical translation.
