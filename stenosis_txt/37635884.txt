Title: Glans Anthropometry for Preputial Reconstruction in Hypospadias.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cases of hypospadias present for poor stream or cosmetic appearance. The main aim is to provide a visibly normal phallus. Preputial reconstruction is technical. A properly planned reconstruction based on anthropometry may improve the result. We are presenting our experience of reconstruction based on glans anthropometry.
AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the importance of glans anthropometry in preputial reconstruction in cases of hypospadias.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of hypospadias operated between June 2014 and March 2022 were included. Glans width was measured at the base. The marking sutures for preputial reconstruction were taken at distance thrice the glans width at base. Those requiring religious circumcision along with repair, associated significant chordee, catheter came out before 2 weeks, or history of any previous penile surgery were excluded. All the cases were subjected to urethroplasty, meatoplasty, and preputioplasty. The results obtained were analyzed.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight out of 159 cases formed the study group. There were 31 glanular, 42 distal penile, 58 mid-penile, and 17 proximal penile hypospadias. Mean glans width at base was 16 mm (range: 11-21 mm). Mean distance of marking suture at prepuce was 38 mm (range: 33-63 mm). Mean follow-up was 12 months (range: 1-36 months). Mean age at presentation was 23 months (range: 14-72 months). Mean operating time was 50 min (range: 45-60 min). Fistula at the base of preputioplasty was seen in four. Dehiscence of preputioplasty was seen in six. Meatal stenosis was seen in three cases.
CONCLUSION: Preputial reconstruction improves the cosmetic appearance of the hypospadiac penis. Reconstruction based on glans anthropometry improves the result and avoids complications.
