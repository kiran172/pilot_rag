Title: Complex Aortic, Visceral and Renal Arteries Reconstruction with a Four-Branch Dacron Graft for Middle Aortic Syndrome Secondary to Takayasu's Arteritis.

Abstract: The middle aortic syndrome (MAS) is an uncommon clinical expression as a result of isolated stenosis or complete occlusion of the descending thoracic and/or abdominal aorta; Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is a rare vasculitis and a recognized etiology of MAS. We herein present the case of a 52-year-old woman with refractory renovascular hypertension and progressive bilateral lower extremity claudication; she had known history of TA. A computed tomography angiography demonstrated an aortic occlusive lesion compromising the origin of the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric, and bilateral renal arteries. The patient underwent a complex aortic reconstruction with visceral and renal vessels revascularization utilizing a back-table hand-crafted 4-branch Dacron graft through a left thoracoabdominal approach. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 5, and at 36Â months from her surgery, she remains symptoms-free and without antihypertensive agents.
