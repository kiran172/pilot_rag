Title: Comparison of the self-expanding Evolut-PRO transcatheter aortic valve to its predecessor Evolut-R in the real world multicenter ATLAS registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Evolut PRO self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve has been designed to feature an outer pericardial wrap that aims to reduce paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) rates. Medium-term clinical outcomes, compared to its predecessor Evolut R, in a real-world setting, have not been investigated. The aim of the present study was to compare the two valves with regards to peri-procedural complications, early outcomes and mid-term survival.
METHODS: Consecutive patients, undergoing TAVI with either the Evolut PRO or Evolut R device, from the multicenter ATLAS registry were retrospectively studied. Outcomes studied included periprocedural complications, PVR at discharge, need for new pacemaker implantation and Kaplan-Meier estimated 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Analysis included 673 patients (498 treated with Evolut R and 175 treated with Evolut PRO). At least moderate PVR was numerically lower amongst patients treated with Evolut PRO (7.4% vs 3.8% for Evolut R and Evolut PRO respectively, p = .108). Rates of new permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation (21.1% vs. 11.9%, p = .023), and bail-out valve-in-valve (2.4% vs. 0%, p = .049) were significantly lower amongst the Evolut PRO group. No differences were demonstrated regarding bleeding, stroke or acute kidney injury. One-year Kaplan-Meier estimated survival was similar between groups (93% for Evolut R vs. 91.2% for Evolut PRO, p<sub>log-rank</sub> = 0.806).
CONCLUSIONS: The Evolut PRO self-expanding valve demonstrates similar mid-term survival rates and numerically, yet not significant, lower incidence of PVR compared to its predecessor. Interestingly this new generation valve is associated with a significantly reduced rate for new PPM implantation. Future studies are required to confirm this finding.
