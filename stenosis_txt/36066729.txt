Title: Optimal threshold score of aortic valve calcification for identification of significant aortic stenosis on non-electrocardiographic-gated computed tomography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the association between aortic valve calcification (AVC) and aortic stenosis (AS) by scoring the AVC to determine the threshold scores for significant AS on non-electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated computed tomography (CT).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the AVC scores of 5385 patients on non-contrast non-ECG-gated CT, who underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) from March 1, 2013, to December 26, 2019, at our institution. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify potential risk factors for significant AS. The thresholds for significant AS were computed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, based on the AVC scores after propensity score matching.
RESULTS: A significant association was found between AS and age (p < 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.06), female sex (p < 0.001; OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.75-7.36), bicuspid aortic valve (p < 0.001; OR, 23.2; 95% CI, 7.35-72.9), and AVC score (AVC score/100) (p < 0.001; OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.71-1.95). All sex-specific AVC thresholds for significant AS (moderate and over AS severity, moderate and over AS severity without discordance, discordant severe AS, and concordant severe AS) showed high sensitivity and specificity (AUC, 0.939-0.968; sensitivity, 84.6-96%; specificity, 84.2-97.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: We determined the optimal AVC threshold scores for significant AS, which may aid in diagnosing significant asymptomatic AS on incidental detection of AVC through non-ECG-gated CT for non-cardiac indications.
KEY POINTS: • Increased frequency of non-electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated computed tomography (CT) for non-cardiac indications has led to the increased incidental identification of aortic valve calcification (AVC). • It is important to identify patients with significant aortic stenosis (AS) who require additional echocardiographic assessment on incidental detection of AVC via non-ECG-gated CT. • We determined the AVC thresholds with high sensitivity and specificity to identify significant AS on non-ECG-gated CT, which could lead to early diagnosis of asymptomatic significant AS and improved prognosis.
