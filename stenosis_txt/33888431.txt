Title: The role of the rhinostomy ostium size on functional success in dacryocystorhinostomy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endonasal and external dacryocystorhinostomy procedures have both been used for the treatment of post-saccular obstruction of the lacrimal system. Functional success of these surgeries depends on several factors.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the status of the rhinostomy ostium with endonasal and external approaches in dacryocystorhinostomy operations and to determine the effect of ostium size on postoperative functional success.
METHODS: The charts of the patients operated in our hospital between May 2017 and January 2019 were analyzed retrospectively (ethical approval number: 2018-12.04). The patients that were operated in the ophthalmology and otolaryngology departments were included in the study. Endoscopic rhinostomy ostium measurements, punctum lavage findings and complications were recorded at 8 weeks postoperative at the earliest.
RESULTS: When the 64 patient charts were reviewed (76 operations), the mean ostium width was 1.85±1.11mm in the endonasal approach group and 3.60±2.24mm in the external approach group. The mean ostium areas in endonasal and external group were 14.61±16.66mm2 and 56.05±60.41mm2, respectively. The ostium was anatomically patent and punctum lavages were negative in 11 patients (6 patients in the endonasal approach group and 5 patients in the external approach group) and these cases were considered as functional failures. The rhinostomy ostium was significantly wider in the external approach group, but this was considered ineffective on functional outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Lacrimal duct stenosis can be successfully treated with endonasal and external methods. Tear drainage may be insufficient even in the presence of a patent ostium. Therefore, functional success should also be considered when evaluating the overall success of dacryocystorhinostomy. An anatomically patent ostium is definitely required, while it is believed that ostium size does not affect functional surgical success.
