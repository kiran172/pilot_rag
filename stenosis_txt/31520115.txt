Title: [Masquerade lacrimal duct stenosis: prevalence of lacrimal sac tumors].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tumors of the lacrimal sac are a rare entity. Malignancies are often associated with a high mortality rate. Lacrimal sac tumors often present as lacrimal duct stenosis with dacryocystitis and are often only diagnosed after an intraoperative biopsy. The aim of this study was a retrospective analysis of all cases with lacrimal sac tumors, which presented with a lacrimal duct stenosis at this medical center in the past 10 years.
METHODS: All patients who were treated by external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) at the University Medical Center Münster during the period January 2009-December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of a lacrimal sac tumor. Symptoms, clinical and histopathological findings, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures as well as long-term follow-up were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total number of 878 patients underwent an external DCR at the University Medical Center Münster during the study period. Of these patients 13 were diagnosed with a lacrimal sac tumor and included 9 malignant lymphomas, 2 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 oncocytic adenoma and 1 transitional cell papilloma.
CONCLUSION: Neoplasms of the lacrimal sac can masquerade as lacrimal duct stenosis or dacryocystitis and must be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases with an atypical clinical course. A lacrimal sac biopsy during an (external) DCR with subsequent histopathological examination is strongly recommended in such cases.
