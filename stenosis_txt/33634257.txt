Title: Rapid progression of aortic stenosis after initiation of teriparatide treatment: a case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Teriparatide, a recombinant formulation of endogenous PTH, is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at high risk for fracture including postmenopausal women, men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis and patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old Jewish osteoporotic woman initiated use of Teriparatide (FORTEOTM, 250 µg per 1 ml subcutaneously per day) in April 2018. Prior to therapy initiation, the patient has undergone eight echocardiograms with an aortic valve pressure gradient ranging between 29 and 39 mmHg, defined as mild aortic stenosis (AS), with no clear trend of progression. In two subsequent echo tests conducted 4 and 7 months after treatment initiation, there was a rapid progression of AS with gradient pressures of 55 and 58 mmHg, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Intermittent exposure to PTH analogues may be one of the causes of rapid progression of AS. Studies with sizeable populations are required to assess causal relationship between PTH analogues use and progression of AS.
