Title: Helix-fixation leadless pacemaker as a potential alternative to conventional transvenous pacemaker in post-Mustard baffle stenosis.

Abstract: Obstruction of a systemic venous pathway is relatively common after the Mustard operation. A helix-fixation leadless pacemaker was successfully implanted in the subpulmonic but morphologic LV in a d-TGA patient with post-Mustard baffle stenosis and failure of a previously implanted epicardial lead.
