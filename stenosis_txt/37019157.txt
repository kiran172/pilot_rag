Title: Hemodynamic instability predicts in-hospital and 1-year mortality after transcarotid artery revascularization and transfemoral carotid stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Blood pressure fluctuations are a common hemodynamic alteration following carotid artery stenting either with transfemoral (TFCAS) or transcarotid (TCAR) approach and are thought to be related to alteration in baroreceptor function due to angioplasty and stent expansion. These fluctuations are particularly worrisome in the high-risk patient population referred for CAS. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of patients who required the administration of intravenous blood pressure medication (IVBPmed) for hypotension or hypertension after CAS.
METHODS: All patients undergoing carotid revascularization in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) database between 2016 and 2021 were included. We compared outcomes of patients who required postoperative IVBPmed to treat hyper- or hypotension with normotensive patients. In-hospital outcomes were compared using multivariable logistic regression. One-year outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses.
RESULTS: We identified 38,510 patients undergoing CAS (57.7% TCAR and 42.3% TFCAS), of which, 30% received IVBPmed for treatment of either postoperative hypertension (12.6%) or hypotension (16.4%). In multivariable analysis, postoperative hypotension was associated with a higher risk of stroke, death, or myocardial infarction (MI) (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-3.6; P < .001), stroke or death (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.4-3.5; P < .001), stroke (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1-3.2; P < .001), death (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.6-4.8; P < .001), MI (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.3-6.7; P < .001), and bleeding (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.4-2.7; P < .001) compared with normotensive patients. Postoperative hypertension was associated with a higher risk of stroke, death, or MI (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 3-4.4; P < .001), stroke or death (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.7-4.1; P < .001), stroke (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3-4.7; P < .001), death (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.9; P < .001), MI (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 3.9-8.3; P < .001), and bleeding (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.7; P < .001) compared with normotensive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative hypertension or hypotension requiring IVBPmed after CAS is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital stroke, death, MI, and bleeding. Postoperative hypertension is associated with worse survival at 1 year. This study indicates that the need for IVBPmed after CAS is not benign; therefore, these patients necessitate aggressive perioperative medical management and safe techniques to avoid hypo and hypertension. Close follow-up and continue medical management are needed to maximize these patients' survival.
