Title: The role of the osteoplastic flap in the endoscopic era: a retrospective multicentre experience on revision surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively review the experience of five tertiary-care university hospitals on frontal sinus revision surgery with osteoplastic flap (OPF).
METHODS: Descriptive analysis of patients who underwent frontal sinus surgery with OPF after one or more endoscopic procedures for benign and inflammatory pathologies from 2000 to 2022. Clinical charts were reviewed for demographics, indications, clinical presentation, previous frontal procedures, OPF technique and outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 124 patients who underwent an OPF procedure, 33 met inclusion criteria. With a mean of 2.1 previous endoscopic surgeries, Draf III was the most common former procedure. In 30 (91%) cases OPF was part of a combined procedure. The most common indications were inverted papilloma (61%), mucocele (9%) and chronic rhinosinusitis (6%). Frontal outflow stenosis (36%) and mucocele (9%) were the most frequent complications observed. Improvement of overall symptoms and patient satisfaction after the OPF procedure were recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: Even in the endoscopic era, OPF still represents a paramount procedure that should be included in the rhino-surgeon's armamentarium, in particular in patients with challenging pathologies and anatomy when previous endoscopic endonasal attempts have failed.
