Title: Laryngeal Structural Dysphagia in Children.

Abstract: The upper aerodigestive system is closely intertwined from an embryologic and functional perspective. Laryngotracheal anatomic abnormalities, such as laryngomalacia, stenosis, vocal cord paralysis, and laryngeal clefts, affect not only the respiratory function but also the swallow function. Laryngotracheal pathology can interfere with the suck-swallow-breathe mechanism in infants. It can also exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux. Chronic aspiration secondary to laryngotracheal anomalies can result in respiratory and pulmonary complications. Surgical treatment of laryngotracheal anomalies can also cause transient or long-term swallow dysfunction. Multidisciplinary approaches and clinical assessment of swallowing are important in patients with laryngotracheal pathology.
