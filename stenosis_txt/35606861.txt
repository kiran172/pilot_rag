Title: Concomitant use of Sapien 3 transcatheter valve for severe MAC with Intuity Elite rapid deployment valve for aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Concomitant double valve pathology in the presence of severe MAC poses significant technical challenges when planning surgical intervention. With continued evolution of valve prosthesis, innovative techniques can be considered with the potential for additional therapeutic benefit.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a novel technique of using a rapid deployment surgical aortic valve in combination with open surgical transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) for severe Mitral Annular Calcification (MAC). The Intuity Elite rapid deployment prosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) was used concomitantly with the Sapien 3 (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) transcatheter prosthesis trans-atrially on cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient with critical aortic stenosis and moderate-severe mixed mitral valve disease in the setting of severe MAC (off-label use).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate how both technologies can, not only be accommodated, but indeed complement each other achieving an excellent outcome in a high-risk patient.
