Title: Clinical impact of baseline mitral regurgitation on outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The clinical impact of baseline mitral regurgitation (MR) on the outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is not clear. This study sought to assess the clinical impact of baseline MR on outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: The study was a retrospective analysis. Data was from 120 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAVR at our center from June 2018 and July 2020. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 30-day, 1- and 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 736.0 (interquartile range, 666.0-965.0) days. Overall survival in patients with nonsignificant and significant baseline MR was not significantly different, while patients from the improved MR group after TAVR demonstrated a significantly higher survival than unchanged or worsened MR group during 2-year follow-up. NYHA functional class had generally improved at 1 year, with only 8.3 % of patients with nonsignificant MR and 17.5 % of patients with significant MR in class III or IV. Patients with improved MR at 1 year after TAVR had a significantly higher LVEF, smaller LVEDD and LVESD than those with unchanged or worsened MR. Among the significant baseline MR group, 70.4 % and 80.0 % of patients had improved to nonsignificant MR at 30-day and 1-year follow-up after TAVR, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant baseline MR was not associated with the increased risk of all-cause mortality 2 years after TAVR. Significant baseline MR was improved in most patients at 1 year after TAVR. Patients with unchanged or worsened MR had an increased all-cause mortality.
