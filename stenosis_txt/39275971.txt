Title: Retrospective study of ureteral stenosis after holmium laser lithotripsy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To identify the factors influencing postoperative ureteral stenosis following holmium laser lithotripsy.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 106 patients who underwent ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy. The effects of variables including stone location, stone size, the duration of surgery, water intake, disease duration, and stone-associated polyps were investigated.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis revealed significant associations of ureteral stenosis with stone location, stone size, duration of surgery, water intake, disease duration, and stone-associated polyps. Patients with proximal stones, with large stones, who underwent long surgical procedures, who drank a large amount of water, who had long-term disease, and who had stone-related polyps were more likely to develop postoperative ureteral stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Significant perioperative complications of holmium laser lithotripsy are associated with prolonged disease, large ureteral stones, long incarceration periods, and the presence of polyps. Surgeons should consider these risk factors during the preoperative evaluation of patients and surgical planning to minimize the risk of postoperative ureteral stenosis.
