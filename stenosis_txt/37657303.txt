Title: Clinical characteristics and intracranial arterial lesions of non-young adult ischemic stroke patients with RNF213 p.R4810K variant.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although RNF213 p.R4810K, a genetic susceptibility variant for moyamoya disease (MMD), is associated with intracranial artery stenosis/occlusion (ICASO), the impact of this variant on ischemic stroke patients in non-young adults is unclear. We aimed to determine the characteristics of non-young adult stroke patients with RNF213 p.R4810K.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified acute ischemic stroke patients ≥50 years who were admitted to our hospital and underwent intracranial vascular imaging. We reviewed the patients with RNF213 p.R4810K and compared stroke characteristics and the frequency and location of ICASO between patients with and without the variant.
RESULTS: Among 341 patients, RNF213 p.R4810K was identified in 7 patients (2.1%). Five of the 7 patients with the variant (71%) had multiple ICASO without any finding of MMD and remaining 2 patients had no ICASO. The presumed etiologies of ICASO were atherosclerosis in 3 cases, vasculitis in 1, and undetermined vasculopathy in 1. ICASO in the anterior circulation was more common in patients with the variant than in those without (71% vs. 25%). The internal carotid artery, the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery, the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery, and the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery, which were the most frequently affected arteries in MMD, were more often affected in the variant group.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-young adult stroke patients with RNF213 p.R4810K are more likely to have ICASO in arterial segments commonly affected in MMD. The etiology of their ICASO exhibited diverse mechanisms, possibly depending on vascular risk and other environmental factors.
