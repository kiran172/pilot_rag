Title: [Long-term results of surgical and conservative treatment of patients with occlusive-stenotic lesions of carotid arteries].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare long-term outcomes in patients after carotid endarterectomy and those who refused surgical correction and received only conservative treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 1035 carotid endarterectomies performed at the Kemerovo Regional Clinical Hospital and Kemerovo Regional Clinical Cardiology Dispensary for the period 2014-2017. Surgery was refused by 136 patients for the same time. Thus, two groups of patients were formed: 1 - carotid endarterectomy group; 2 - conservative treatment group.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: significant carotid stenosis, absence of severe neurological deficit (over 25 scores by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), absence of concomitant diseases limiting long-term follow-up.
RESULTS: Lethal outcome (p=0.0038) and fatal acute cerebrovascular accident (p=0.0005) were significantly more common in the 2nd group in long-term follow-up period. Thus, combined endpoint took the greatest values in patients who refused surgery compared with patients who received surgical treatment (p=0.0001). It should be noted that ischemic stroke de novo occurred in 9 (6.6%) patients of the 2nd group after 10.8 Â± 2.5 months. This complication required subsequent hospitalization for carotid endarterectomy.
CONCLUSION: Preventive role of carotid endarterectomy was convincingly proved in comparison with drug therapy regarding mortality and fatal ischemic stroke in patients with significant carotid stenoses within 2.5 years of follow-up period.
