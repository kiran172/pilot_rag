Title: SPECT myocardial blood flow quantitation for the detection of angiographic stenoses with cardiac-dedicated CZT SPECT.

Abstract: PURPOSE: CZT SPECT with the enhanced imaging characteristic facilitates SPECT myocardial blood flow (MBF) quantitation moving toward a clinical utility to uncover myocardial ischemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of stress MBF, myocardial flow reserve (MFR) and myocardial flow capacity (MFC) derived from CZT SPECT in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: One-hundred and eighty patients underwent two-day rest/adenosine-stress scans for SPECT MBF quantitation. All dynamic SPECT images were reconstructed and corrected with necessary corrections. The one-tissue two-compartment kinetic model was utilized to fit kinetic parameters (K1, k2 and FBV) by numeric optimization and converted to MBF from K1. Rest MBF, stress MBF and MFR in left ventricle and coronary territories were calculated from flow polar maps. MFC was assessed by extents of moderately and severely abnormal flow statuses using an integrated flow diagram. Per-patient and per-vessel analyses were performed to determine cutoff values for the detection of angiographically obstructive and flow-limited CAD.
RESULTS: Using the threshold of ≥ 50% stenosis, 149 patients (82.78%) were classified to have obstructive lesions in 355 vessels (65.74%). Using the threshold of ≥ 70% stenosis, 113 patients (62.78%) were classified to have flow-limited lesions in 282 vessels (52.22%). On per-patient analysis, the optimal cutoff values of stress MBF and MFR to detect ≥ 50% stenosis were (1.44 ml/min/g, 1.96) and (1.34 ml/min/g and 1.75) to detect ≥ 70% stenosis. The optimal cutoff values for severely and combined moderately severely abnormal MFC extents were (2.3-2.5%, 23.1%) and (7.5%, 29.4%), respectively. The overall sensitivity of MFC (0.84-0.86, 0.86-0.90) to detect ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% lesions surpassed those of stress MBF (0.78. 0.78) and MFR (0.80, 0.75) (all p < 0.05) with similar specificity (MFC = 0.84-0.90, 0.87-0.91; stress MBF = 0.87, 0.91; MFR = 0.84, 0.89) (all p≥ 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The non-invasive SPECT MBF quantitation using CZT SPECT is a reliable method to detect angiographically obstructive and flow-limited CAD. Myocardial flow capacity can outperform with higher diagnostic sensitivity than stress MBF or MFR alone.
