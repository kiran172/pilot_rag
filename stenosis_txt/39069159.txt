Title: Outcomes of Robot-assisted Appendiceal Ureteroplasty From a Multi-institutional Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the viability of robot-assisted appendiceal ureteroplasty as an innovative surgical approach for the reconstruction of ureteral strictures in cases where traditional methods are unsuitable.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 14 patients who underwent robot-assisted appendiceal ureteroplasty for right-sided ureteral stricture disease at three academic centers between March 2018 and November 2022. Patients were selected based on stricture characteristics, tissue quality, and the need for tissue transfer techniques. Surgical outcomes, including stricture-free rates, renal function, and complication rates, were analyzed.
RESULTS: The median patient age was 63years, with a balanced gender distribution. The median stricture length was 4.75 cm. The majority of strictures were located in the proximal ureter (50%). Surgical approaches included appendiceal onlay flaps (71.4%) and interposition flaps (28.6%). The median operative time was 268 minutes, with an average estimated blood loss of 75 mL. Postoperatively, ureteral patency was achieved in 92.9% of patients. Two patients (14.3%) experienced urinary tract infections requiring readmission. There was no significant change in serum creatinine levels postoperatively. Hydronephrosis grade significantly improved following surgery (P = .025).
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted appendiceal ureteroplasty is a safe and effective technique for managing ureteral strictures. It offers a high success rate with minimal complications, making it a valuable addition to the urologic surgeon's armamentarium for complex ureteral reconstructions.
