Title: Descending aorta translocation for bronchial stenosis caused by shorter interaortic distance.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Numerous anatomic relationships of arteries could cause extrinsic compression of the trachea or bronchus. We report a rare left bronchial stenosis just caused by shorter inter-aortic distance.
METHODS: One patient wih recurrent coughing and wheezing was diagnosed as left emphysema.Cardiac computed tomography (CTA) shows a shorter distance between ascending aorta (AAo) and descending aorta (DAo) caused left bronchial stenosis with extrinsic compression of right pulmonary artery.
RESULTS: A translocation of the descending aorta was performed in this patient, and postoperative CTA showed that the DAo was translocated to the AAo and the left main bronchial stenosis was relieved.
CONCLUSIONS: Translocation of the DAo was necessary for the rare left bronchial stenosis caused by shorter inter-aortic distance and could bring a good outcome.
