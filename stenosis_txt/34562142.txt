Title: Application of the proximal isovelocity surface area method for estimation of the effective orifice area in aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Although the echocardiographic effective orifice area (EOA) calculated using the continuity equation is widely used for the assessment of severity in aortic stenosis (AS), the existence of high flow velocity at the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) potentially causes its overestimation. The proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method could be an alternative tool for the estimation of EOA that limits the influence of upstream flow velocity. EOA was calculated using the continuity equation (EOA<sub>Cont</sub>) and PISA method (EOA<sub>PISA</sub>), respectively, in 114 patients with at least moderate AS. The geometric orifice area (GOA) was also measured using the planimetry method in 51 patients who also underwent three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography. Patients were divided into two groups according to the median LVOT flow velocity. EOA<sub>PISA</sub> could be obtained in 108 of the 114 patients (95%). Although there was a strong correlation between EOA<sub>Cont</sub> and EOA<sub>PISA</sub> (r = 0.78, P &lt; 0.001), EOA<sub>Cont</sub> was statistically significantly larger than EOA<sub>PISA</sub> (0.86 ± 0.33 vs 0.75 ± 0.29 cm2, P &lt; 0.001). Both EOA<sub>Cont</sub> and EOA<sub>PISA</sub> similarly correlated with GOA (r = 0.70, P &lt; 0.001 and r = 0.77, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). However, a fixed bias, which is hydrodynamically supposed to exist between EOA and GOA, was not observed between EOA<sub>Cont</sub> and GOA. In contrast, there was a negative fixed bias between EOA<sub>PISA</sub> and GOA with smaller EOA<sub>PISA</sub> than GOA. The difference between EOA<sub>Cont</sub> and GOA was significantly greater with a larger EOA<sub>Cont</sub> relative to GOA in patients with high LVOT flow velocity than in those without (0.16 ± 0.25 vs - 0.07 ± 0.10 cm2, P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the difference between EOA<sub>PISA</sub> and GOA was consistent regardless of the LVOT flow velocity (- 0.07 ± 0.12 vs - 0.07 ± 0.15 cm2, P = 0.936). The PISA method was applied to estimate EOA in patients with AS. EOA<sub>PISA</sub> could be an alternative parameter for AS severity grading in patients with high LVOT flow velocity in whom EOA<sub>Cont</sub> would potentially overestimate the orifice area.
