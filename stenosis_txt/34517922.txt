Title: Treatment of direct carotid-cavernous fistula with Willis covered stent with midterm follow-up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Willis covered stent is the first stent designed exclusively for intracranial vasculature, and its application in carotid-cavernous fistula is limited. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of this device in treating direct carotid-cavernous fistula.
METHODS: Ten consecutive patients with direct carotid-cavernous fistula were treated in our institution with Willis covered stents from September 2013 to December 2015. The characteristics of these patients and the immediate and follow-up results were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Of the 10 patients, 8 were treated for the first time, and 2 had been treated elsewhere. Willis covered stents were successfully released in 9 patients. Abnormal arteriovenous shunt disappeared in 6 cases immediately after stent deployment and endoleak occurred in 3 cases. Endoleak disappeared at 6-month angiography follow-up in one case and was sealed with coils through a pre-set microcatheter in another case. Parent artery was sacrificed as endoleak remained despite repeated balloon dilation and a second stent deployment in the third case. All patients got clinical follow-ups for at least 24â€‰months and 7 patients received angiographic follow-up. Symptoms were relieved gradually in all cases except for slight oculomotor paralysis and visual acuity in one case, respectively. In-stent stenosis was found in 1 case, and no recurrence was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Willis covered stent is feasible for direct carotid-cavernous fistula.
