Title: [Pneumonia, endocarditis of two valves and pulmonary artery embolism in a 26-year-old male patient].

Abstract: A 26-year-old male patient presented with left-sided pneumonia, endocarditis of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves and a pulmonary artery embolism. In 2004 a Ross operation was performed because of congenital aortic valve stenosis. There was an elevation of the antibody titer for Coxiella burnetii, the pathogen of Q fever. Under antibiotic treatment with levofloxacin and doxycycline there was an improvement of the symptoms and a normalization of the inflammation parameters. The treatment of the endocarditis was successful.
