Title: Assessing the robustness of positive vascular surgery randomized controlled trials using their fragility index.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The fragility index (FI) measures the robustness of statistically significant findings in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by quantifying the minimum number of event conversions required to reverse a dichotomous outcome's statistical significance. In vascular surgery, many clinical guidelines and critical decision-making points are informed by a handful of key RCTs, especially regarding open surgical versus endovascular treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the FI of RCTs with statistically significant primary outcomes that compared open vs endovascular surgery in vascular surgery.
METHODS: In this meta-epidemiological study and systematic review, MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched for RCTs comparing open versus endovascular treatments for abdominal aortic aneurysms, carotid artery stenosis, and peripheral arterial disease to December 2022. RCTs with statistically significant primary outcomes were included. Data screening and extraction were conducted in duplicate. The FI was calculated by adding an event to the group with the smaller number of events while subtracting a nonevent to the same group until Fisher's exact test produced a nonstatistically significant result. The primary outcome was the FI and proportion of outcomes where the loss to follow-up was greater than the FI. The secondary outcomes assessed the relationship of the FI to disease state, presence of commercial funding, and study design.
RESULTS: Overall, 5133 articles were captured in the initial search with 21 RCTs reporting 23 different primary outcomes being included in the final analysis. The median FI (first quartile, third quartile) was 3 (3, 20) with 16 outcomes (70%) reporting a loss to follow-up greater than its FI. Mann-Whitney U test revealed that commercially funded RCTs and composite outcomes had greater FIs (median, 20.0 [5.5, 24.5] vs median, 3.0 [2.0, 5.5], P = .035; median, 21 [8, 38] vs median, 3.0 [2.0, 8.5], P = .01, respectively). The FI did not vary between disease states (P = .285) or between index and follow-up trials (P = .147). There were significant correlations between the FI and P values (Pearson r = 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96), and the number of events (r = 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: A small number of event conversions (median, 3) are needed to alter the statistical significance of primary outcomes in vascular surgery RCTs evaluating open surgical and endovascular treatments. Most studies had loss to follow-up greater than its FI, which can call into question trial results, and commercially funded studies had a greater FI. The FI and these findings should be considered in future trial design in vascular surgery.
