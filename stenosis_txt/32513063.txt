Title: Surgical Closure of Tracheoesophageal Puncture Without a Flap Interposition.

Abstract: Tracheoesophageal puncture for voice prosthesis placement is often used in vocal rehabilitation of patients undergoing total laryngectomy. Although its closure can occur spontaneously, some patients require a surgical procedure. We propose a surgical technique, without flap interposition, that begins with careful separation of the esophagus and trachea and identification of the site of tracheoesophageal fistula. After continuous suture closure of the esophagus, the anterior segment of the first tracheal rings is vertically incised to facilitate tracheal closure in a suture without tension. Finally, a small pectoral skin flap is made and mobilized to suture to the free edges of the sectioned tracheal rings, thus reducing the risk of tracheal stenosis. Four patients underwent this procedure with uneventful postoperative evolution and permanent closure of the fistula.
