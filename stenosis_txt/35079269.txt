Title: Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal chemical burns and post-burn oesophageal stenosis.

Abstract: Post-burn oesophageal stenosis occurs as a result of accidental or intentional ingestion of a corrosive substance. Global estimates indicate tens of thousands of acid or lye ingestion cases per year. In some cases patients in the early post-burn phase require urgent surgical intervention. Endoscopy, along with chest and abdominal computed tomography, form the basis of diagnosis. The need for emergency oesophageal or gastric resection is associated with a high mortality rate of up to 60%. Post-burn oesophageal stenosis is a challenging clinical problem that requires coordinated multispecialty treatment. The treatment of post-burn stenosis may be with endoscopic techniques or reconstructive surgery. Surgical reconstruction is performed once the scar has definitively formed. The extent of the injury, anatomical conditions, previous surgery and the team's expertise determine the optimum reconstructive method. In this article, we present the current knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of oesophageal burns.
