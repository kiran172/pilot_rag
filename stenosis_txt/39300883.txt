Title: [Application of ultrasonic bone scalpel system for laminectomy and posterior longitudinal ligament ossification block release combined with dekyphosis orthopedic surgery in treatment of multisegmental thoracic ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and effectiveness of multisegmental thoracic ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (T-OPLL) treated by laminectomy, posterior longitudinal ligament ossification block release combined with dekyphosis orthopedic surgery using ultrasonic bone scalpel system.
METHODS: The clinical data of 8 patients with multisegmental T-OPLL treated with laminectomy, posterior longitudinal ligament ossification block release combined with dekyphosis orthopedic surgery using ultrasonic bone scalpel system between January 2020 and April 2023 was retrospectively analyzed. There were 3 males and 5 females; the age ranged from 41 to 67 years, with a mean of 57.1 years. The disease duration ranged from 3 to 74 months, with a mean of 33.4 months. Symptoms were progressive numbness and weakness of both lower limbs, unsteady walking, chest and back pain in 3 cases, and urinary and bowel dysfunction in 5 cases; 7 cases showed increased muscle strength of the lower limbs, hyperreflexia of the tendons, and a positive Babinski sign, and 1 case showed decreased muscle strength of the lower limbs, decreased skin sensation, decreased knee and Achilles tendon reflexes, and a negative pathologic sign. Multisegmental posterior longitudinal ligament ossification of thoracic spine was found in 8 cases, with 4-8 segments of ossification, and in 5 cases with multisegmental ossification of the ligamentum flavum. The preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) thoracic spinal function score was 4.3±0.9, the visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 6.9±1.0, and the the kyphotic Cobb angle of the stenosis segment was (34.62±10.76)°. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and complications were recorded. VAS score was used to evaluate the back pain, JOA score was used to evaluate the thoracic spinal cord function and the JOA improvement rate was calculated, and the kyphotic Cobb angle of the stenosis segment was measured and the Cobb angle improvement rate was calculated.
RESULTS: The operation time ranged from 210 to 340 minutes, with a mean of 271.62 minutes; intraoperative blood loss ranged from 900 to 2 100 mL, with a mean of 1 458.75 mL; the number of resected vertebral plates ranged from 4 to 8, with a mean of 6.1; dural tears and cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in 3 cases, and the incisions healed by first intention. All 8 cases were followed up 12-26 months, with a mean of 18.3 months. There was no complication such as loosening of internal fixator, breakage of screws and rods, and no significant progress of ossification. At last follow-up, the VAS score was 1.4±0.7, the JOA thoracic spinal function score was 9.8±0.7, and the the kyphotic Cobb angle of the stenosis segment was (22.12±8.28)°, all of which significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones ( t=11.887, P&lt;0.001; t=13.015, P&lt;0.001; t=7.395, P&lt;0.001). The JOA improvement rate was 81.06%±10.93%, of which 5 cases were rated as excellent and 3 cases as good; the Cobb angle improvement rate was 36.51%±14.20%.
CONCLUSION: Laminectomy, posterior longitudinal ligament ossification block release combined with dekyphosis orthopedic surgery using ultrasonic bone scalpel system is a safe, effective, and simple method for the treatment of multisegmental T-OPLL, which is a feasible option.
