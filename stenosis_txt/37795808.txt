Title: Effect of left paratracheal pressure on left carotid blood flow.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Gautier et al. demonstrated that a compression in the left paratracheal region (left paratracheal pressure, LPP) can be used to seal the oesophagus. However, at this level, the left common carotid artery is very close to the carotid that could be affected during the manipulation. This study aimed to assess the hemodynamic effects of LPP on the carotid blood flow.
METHODS: We prospectively included 47 healthy adult volunteers. We excluded pregnant women and people with anomalies of the carotid arteries. The common and internal carotid arteries were preliminarily studied with ultrasounds to exclude atheromatous plaques or vascular malformation. A planimetry of the common and internal carotid arteries was performed. Doppler echography served to measure the peak systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic velocities (EDV) in the common and internal carotid arteries. All measurements were repeated while applying LPP.
RESULTS: Forty-seven participants were enrolled (32 women; mean [SD] age: 42 [13] years). The mean PSV difference [95% CI] in the left common carotid artery before and after LPP at the group level was -15.30 [-31.09 to 0.48] cm s-1 (p = .14). The mean surface difference [95% CI] in the left common carotid artery before and after LPP was 24.52 [6.11-42.92] mm2 (p = .11). Similarly, the same surface at the level of the left internal carotid artery changed by -18.89 [-51.59 to 13.80] mm2 after LPP (p = .58).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that LPP does not have a significant effect on carotid blood flow in individuals without a carotid pathology. However, the safety of the manoeuvre should be evaluated in patients at risk of carotid anomalies.
