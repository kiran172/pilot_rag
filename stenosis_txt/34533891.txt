Title: Redo-transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the supra-annular, self-expandable Evolut platform: Insights from the Transcatheter valve Therapy Registry.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety profile of redo-TAVR procedures from patients in the transcatheter valve therapy (TVT) Registry.
BACKGROUND: The use of transcatheter aortic valves (TAV) to treat previously implanted failing TAVS (TAV-in-TAV) has been an increasingly important topic as indications for TAVR move to younger and lower-risk patients, but data on the safety and efficacy of redo-TAVR is limited.
METHODS: Patients undergoing redo-TAVR procedures using the Evolut R, Evolut PRO or Evolut PRO+ valve in the TVT Registry between April 2015 and March 2020 were included. In-hospital, 30-day and 1-year outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Redo-TAVR was performed in 292 patients (213 patients received the Evolut R valve and 79 received the Evolut PRO or PRO+ valve). Device success was achieved in 94.5%. In-hospital mortality was 2.1%, stroke occurred in 2.7%, and 77.2% of patients were discharged home. There were no cases of coronary compression/obstruction or myocardial infarction that occurred in index hospitalization. Mean gradient at 30-days was 11.9 ± 6.9 mmHg, and 73.1% had none/trace total aortic regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from the TVT Registry demonstrate good short-term outcomes after redo-TAVR with the supra-annular, self-expandable Evolut platform. Long-term follow-up is necessary to further expand understanding this complex scenario.
