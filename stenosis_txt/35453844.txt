Title: Remodeling Pattern of Spinal Canal after Full Endoscopic Uniportal Lumbar Endoscopic Unilateral Laminotomy for Bilateral Decompression: One Year Repetitive MRI and Clinical Follow-Up Evaluation.

Abstract: Objective: There is limited literature on repetitive postoperative MRI and clinical evaluation after Uniportal Lumbar Endoscopic Unilateral Laminotomy for Bilateral Decompression. Methods: Clinical visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, McNab’s criteria evaluation and MRI evaluation of the axial cut spinal canal area of the upper end plate, mid disc and lower end plate were performed for patients who underwent single-level Uniportal Lumbar Endoscopic Unilateral Laminotomy for Bilateral Decompression. From the evaluation of the axial cut MRI, four types of patterns of remodeling were identified: type A: continuous expanded spinal canal, type B: restenosis with delayed expansion, type C: progressive expansion and type D: restenosis. Result: A total of 126 patients with single-level Uniportal Lumbar Endoscopic Unilateral Laminotomy for Bilateral Decompression were recruited with a minimum follow-up of 26 months. Thirty-six type A, fifty type B, thirty type C and ten type D patterns of spinal canal remodeling were observed. All four types of patterns of remodeling had statistically significant improvement in VAS at final follow-up compared to the preoperative state with type A (5.59 ± 1.58), B (5.58 ± 1.71), C (5.58 ± 1.71) and D (5.27 ± 1.68), p < 0.05. ODI was significantly improved at final follow-up with type A (49.19 ± 10.51), B (50.00 ± 11.29), C (45.60 ± 10.58) and D (45.60 ± 10.58), p < 0.05. A significant MRI axial cut increment of the spinal canal area was found at the upper endplate at postoperative day one and one year with type A (39.16 ± 22.73; 28.00 ± 42.57) mm2, B (47.42 ± 18.77; 42.38 ± 19.29) mm2, C (51.45 ± 18.16; 49.49 ± 18.41) mm2 and D (49.10 ± 23.05; 38.18 ± 18.94) mm2, respectively, p < 0.05. Similar significant increment was found at the mid-disc at postoperative day one, 6 months and one year with type A (55.16 ± 27.51; 37.23 ± 25.88; 44.86 ± 25.73) mm2, B (72.83 ± 23.87; 49.79 ± 21.93; 62.94 ± 24.43) mm2, C (66.85 ± 34.48; 54.92 ± 30.70; 64.33 ± 31.82) mm2 and D (71.65 ± 16.87; 41.55 ± 12.92; 49.83 ± 13.31) mm2 and the lower endplate at postoperative day one and one year with type A (49.89 ± 34.50; 41.04 ± 28.56) mm2, B (63.63 ± 23.70; 54.72 ± 24.29) mm2, C (58.50 ± 24.27; 55.32 ± 22.49) mm2 and D (81.43 ± 16.81; 58.40 ± 18.05) mm2 at postoperative day one and one year, respectively, p < 0.05. Conclusions: After full endoscopic lumbar decompression, despite achieving sufficient decompression immediately postoperatively, varying severity of asymptomatic restenosis was found in postoperative six months MRI without clinical significance. Further remodeling with a varying degree of increment of the spinal canal area occurs at postoperative one year with overall good clinical outcomes.
