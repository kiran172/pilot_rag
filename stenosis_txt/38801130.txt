Title: Critical left main coronary artery stenosis presenting as cardiac arrest in coarctation of the aorta patient.

Abstract: Congenital coronary artery stenosis coexisting with aortic coarctation in nonsyndromic patients has not previously been reported. This report describes a nonsyndromic aortic coarctation patient who experienced intraoperative cardiac arrest due to a previously undiagnosed critical left main coronary artery stenosis. The patient was successfully resuscitated, underwent patch coronary ostioplasty, and was discharged home. He remains well for four months following repair.
