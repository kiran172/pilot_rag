Title: Ureteral amyloidosis in the context of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and systemic amyloidosis.

Abstract: Ureteral amyloidosis is a rare entity and of interest to urologists, hematologists, radiologists, and pathologists because it mimics urothelial cell carcinoma clinically, endoscopically and radiologically. A pre-operative ureteroscopy or surgical biopsy is required, and it is essential to exclude systemic amyloidosis. We report a male who was diagnosed with IIIA stage lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma associating systemic amyloidosis with concomitant hematuria. Urine cytology was negative and computerized tomography urography (CTU) scan evidenced bilateral, proximal and medium, ureteral stenosis and wall thickening. Diagnosis of suspected amyloidosis was confirmed with laparoscopic biopsy due to ureteral stenosis, being positive for Congo red stain. Patient underwent systemic chemotherapy.
