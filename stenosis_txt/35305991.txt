Title: Endovascular Repair of an Ascending Aorta Dissection After Self-expanding TAVR by Suprasternal Approach.

Abstract: Management of rare ascending aortic complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains a poorly defined area of knowledge. Furthermore, because most patients undergoing TAVR are at intermediate to high surgical risk, the treatment of such complications often requires endovascular approaches. Herein, we present a novel technique of endovascular ascending aorta stent graft delivery from the innominate artery for the treatment of a type A aortic dissection after self-expandable TAVR implantation, specifically addressing the landing of the aortic stent within the crown of the TAVR valve.
