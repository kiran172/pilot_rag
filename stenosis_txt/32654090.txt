Title: Long-term results of the edge-to-edge repair for failed mitral valve repair as a bailout option.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of edge-to-edge (E2E) repair combined with mitral annuloplasty in our institute with degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) up to 10 years.
METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients undergoing E2E mitral repair after failure of other conventional mitral repair technique. There were 16 (61.5%) male and the mean age was 52.2 ± 10.4 years. Mitral regurgitation was due to anterior leaflet prolapse in 12 (46.2%) patients, bileaflet prolapse in 9 (34.6%), and multiple segment posterior leaflet prolapse in 5 (19.2%).
RESULTS: There were no perioperative deaths. Follow-up was 100% complete. The mean length of follow-up was 8.7 ± 0.9 years (median 8.4 years, 6.8-10.1 years). Two patients required reoperation of the MV. The freedom from reoperation and ≥ Moderate MR at 10 years was 69.9 ± 11.7%. The freedom from reoperation, ≥ Moderate MR and mitral stenosis (MS) at 10 years was (59.6 ± 10.0) %. The mean transmitral pressure gradient (TMPG) was 6.1 ± 2.5 mmHg, which was significantly elevated compared with preoperative TTE (P = 0.004). The freedom from ≥ Moderate MS at 10 years was 76.9 ± 8.3%. There were no differences between patients with and without MS at follow-up regarding the echocardiographic parameters and clinical status.
CONCLUSION: There is a slowly progressive elevation of TMPG after E2E mitral repair, while mildly elevated TMPG can be tolerated in most patients. In appropriate patients, the E2E repair combined with annuloplasty provides an effective "bailout" choice.
