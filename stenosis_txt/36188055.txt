Title: Treatment of Haemorrhoidal Disease by Laser Haemorrhoidoplasty at Dakar Preliminary Study of 21 Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of haemorrhoidal disease by laser haemorrhoidoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that facilitates the postoperative course. Due to less aggression on the anoderm and the anal canal mucosa, it causes less significant postoperative pain and low morbidity compared with conventional excision according to the Milligan-Morgan or Fergusson procedure. We report, through a preliminary study, our data on laser haemorrhoidoplasty and discuss the indications and results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive prospective study carried out on 21 patients operated on for haemorrhoidal disease by laser haemorrhoidoplasty with or without mucopexy.
RESULTS: The series was composed of 17 men and 4 women with a male/female ratio of 4.25:1. The average age was 39.6 years with a range of 27-62 years. The symptomatology was rectal bleeding in 16 cases (76%) and anal swelling in 18 cases (85.7%). These include grade 2 haemorrhoids in 2 cases (9.5%), grade 3 in 12 cases (57%), and grade 4 in 7 cases (33%). It was associated with an anal fissure in four cases (19%) and an anal fistula in three cases (14.2%). Mucopexy and laser coagulation were performed therapeutically in 13 cases (61.9%) and laser coagulation without mucopexy was performed in 8 cases (38%). The energy delivered was on average 1488 or 496 J per pile. It was associated with skin tag excision in 18 cases (85.7%), fissurectomy, sphincterotomy, anoplasty in 4 cases (19.2%), and fistulectomy for low anal fistula in 2 cases (9.5%). Piles retraction was judged sufficient in 17 patients (81%). The postoperative course was simple with no notable complaints in 16 patients (76%). Complications consisted of minimal bleeding in six cases (28%), significant bleeding in two cases with readmission, residual skin tag in six cases (28.5%), and subcutaneous fistula in two cases (9.5%). No recurrence of the symptoms of the haemorrhoidal disease was noted.
CONCLUSION: Laser haemorrhoidoplasty is a minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of haemorrhoidal disease, especially for grade 2 and 3 haemorrhoids without major prolapse. Postoperative pain is minimal, and the risk of stenosis or incontinence is almost non-existent.
