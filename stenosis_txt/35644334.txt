Title: Intravascular ultrasound correlation of unenhanced magnetic resonance venography in the context of pelvic deep venous disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In the present retrospective, assessor-blinded cross-sectional study, we compared the diagnostic efficacy of the relaxation-enhanced angiography without contrast and triggering (REACT) protocol for magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).
METHODS: All patients without prior lower limb vascular stenting who had undergone MRV with the REACT protocol and IVUS at our institution from January 2018 to May 2020 were included. The REACT protocol for MRV comprises three main phases: the adiabatic-based T2-preparation module, the non-volume-selective short tau inversion recovery pulse sequence, and the three-dimensional, modified two-point chemical-shift water-fat separated turbo-field echo pulse sequence. The IVUS findings served as the reference standard for stenosis and were used in the diagnostic efficacy analysis of the REACT protocol for MRV. The REACT protocol MRV images were reviewed by three board-certified interventional radiologists, and an interrater analysis was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (110 segments with IVUS correlation; 18 men [54.5%] and 15 women [45.5%]) were included. Most patients were Chinese (63.6%), and 24 had had bilateral deep venous disease (72.7%). The mean patient age was 59.0 years (range, 26.0-79.5 years). Moderate agreement was found between the three radiologists' diagnoses of iliac vein pathology using the REACT protocol for MRV (κ = 0.524; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.426-0.623; P < .001). Compared with IVUS, REACT protocol MRV achieved a sensitivity of 96.10% (95% CI, 89.03%-99.19%), specificity of 78.79% (95% CI, 61.09%-91.02%), positive predictive value of 91.36% (95% CI, 84.54%-95.33%), and negative predictive value of 89.66% (95% CI, 73.81%-96.38%). Overall, 78.5% agreement was noted between the REACT protocol MRV and IVUS findings. Good agreement between the index test and reference standard was noted (κ = 0.779; 95% CI, 0.645-0.907; P ≤ .05).
CONCLUSIONS: REACT protocol MRV has the potential to be a highly sensitive and specific screening tool to diagnose deep venous disease.
