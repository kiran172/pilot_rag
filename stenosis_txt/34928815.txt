Title: Acute Real-World Outcomes From the Phoenix Post-Approval Registry.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: An evaluation of the 30-day safety and performance outcomes of the Phoenix atherectomy system (Philips Volcano Corporation) was performed in real-world patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).
METHODS: The Phoenix Post-Approval Registry is an all-comer study that enrolled patients with infrainguinal PAD. Patients treated with the Phoenix atherectomy system were followed for 30 days to observe device-related complications. Outcomes evaluated include procedural (final target lesion(s) residual stenosis of ≤30% after treatment with Phoenix and any other adjunctive therapy) and technical success (defined as achieving a post-Phoenix [prior to any adjunctive therapy] residual diameter stenosis of ≤50%), target-vessel revascularization (TVR), target-lesion revascularization (TLR), target-limb amputation, ankle brachial index, Rutherford clinical category, and wound, ischemia, foot infection (WIfI) classification.
RESULTS: Of the 500 patients enrolled, 259 had CLI, including 26.3% with Rutherford class 6. Procedural success rates were 97.3% for non-CLI patients and 98.2% for CLI patients. Technical success rates were 71.5% for non-CLI patients and 77.9% for CLI patients. Complication rates post Phoenix atherectomy were <1%. Through the 30-day follow-up, there were 6 patients (1.3%; 2 claudicants, 4 CLIs) who underwent TLR and 8 patients who underwent TVR. There were no major amputations in the non-CLI and CLI cohorts. In the CLI cohort, 16/235 (6.8%) underwent minor amputations. Higher stages of Rutherford class and WIfI classification were associated with amputations at 30 days.
CONCLUSION: The Phoenix atherectomy system is a safe and effective treatment option in the acute setting for patients with PAD, including those with advanced Rutherford class. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.
