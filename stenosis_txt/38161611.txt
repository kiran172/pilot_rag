Title: A Case of Symptomatic Common Carotid Artery Occlusion Treated by a Bridging Bypass Using Short Saphenous Vein Graft.

Abstract: An 86-year-old woman with initially asymptomatic severe right common carotid artery stenosis had frequent transient left hemiparesis 2 years after the initial diagnosis. Magnetic resonance angiography and three-dimensional computed tomography angiography demonstrated short-segment occlusion of the right carotid bifurcation with significant circumferential calcification, while magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated no ischemic lesions. No collateral blood flow through the anterior communicating artery and posterior communicating artery was observed. A bridging bypass from the distal common carotid artery to the proximal cervical internal carotid artery using a saphenous vein graft was made. There were no ischemic symptoms following the procedure. Bridging bypass using the short saphenous vein graft might be useful for short-segment common carotid artery occlusion.
