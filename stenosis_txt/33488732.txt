Title: Subglottic Stenosis in Children: Preliminary Experience from a Tertiary Care Hospital.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study describes our experience in the evaluation and management of infants with subglottic stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 10 patients aged between 1â€‰wk and 18 months with 6 cases having congenital subglottic stenosis and 4 cases having acquired subglottic stenosis.
RESULTS: 6 patients had grade I, 3 patients had grade II, and 1 patient had grade III subglottic stenosis. Tracheostomy was required in 4 patients at the time of presentation. 7 patients were treated successfully with Bougie dilation followed by topical application of mitomycin, whereas 1 patient who failed to serial dilation needed open reconstructive procedure. Laser excision of the anterior subglottic web was performed in one patient. Another patient with underlying cerebral palsy could not be operated upon and was managed with tracheostomy.
CONCLUSION: Subglottic stenosis may be effectively man-aged with endoscopic surgical techniques, although the number of such sittings required varies with the type and severity of stenosis. Open surgical procedures need to be individualised as per the needs of the patient only after all the other endoscopic possibilities have been exhausted.
