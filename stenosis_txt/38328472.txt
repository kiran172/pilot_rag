Title: Metagenomic Analysis of Bacterial Microflora in Dental and Atherosclerotic Plaques of Patients With Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Internal carotid artery stenosis is primarily attributed to atherosclerosis in the carotid artery bifurcation. Previous studies have detected oral bacteria in atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting an association between oral bacteria and atherosclerosis. In this study, we compared the bacterial flora of the atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery and dental plaque of patients with internal carotid artery stenosis using 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) metagenomic sequencing.
METHODS: Fifty-four patients who underwent internal carotid endarterectomy for internal carotid artery stenosis at the Showa University Hospital between April 2016 and February 2018 were included. Polymerase chain reaction targeting the 16S rRNA gene detected bacterial DNA in the carotid plaques of 11 cases, of which only 5 could be further analyzed. Thereafter, DNA extracted from the carotid and oral plaques of these 5 cases were analyzed using metagenomic sequencing targeting 16S rRNA. In addition, their general condition and oral conditions were evaluated. The patients were classified into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups based on the presence or absence of symptoms of transient ischemic attack, and their bacterial flora was evaluated.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the microflora of carotid plaques (n = 5) contained bacterial species from 55 families and 78 genera. In addition, 86.5% of the bacteria detected in the carotid plaques were also detected in oral plaques. Cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria accounted for 27.7% and 4.7% of the bacteria in the carotid plaques, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oral bacteria are directly or indirectly involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. More extensive studies of oral commensal bacteria detected in extra-oral lesions are warranted to comprehensively investigate the role of oral bacteria in the pathogenesis of systemic diseases.
