Title: Persistent median artery on computed tomographic arteriovenous fistulograms in patients on haemodialysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cadaveric studies suggest an increasing prevalence of the persistent median artery (PMA) over a prolonged timeframe. The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to evaluate the PMA prevalence in haemodialysis patients who had computed tomographic fistulograms (CTFs), and if present, their calibres and origins.
METHODS: All consecutive adult patients referred for an upper limb CTFs for assessment of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction from 2006 to 2021 were included. Patients whose CTF did not include the forearm were excluded. PMA was identified as an artery running alongside the median nerve between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus. Patient demographics, presence of PMA including size and origin were recorded.
RESULTS: A PMA was found in 91/170 (53.5%) CTFs (7:3 male-to-female ratio, mean age 71-years). When stratified by age, prevalence increased with decreasing age; 51% in >70-year-olds, 54% in 50-70-year-olds and 67% in <50-year-olds. The average PMA diameter was 2.2â€‰mm proximally and 1.8â€‰mm distally. No stenosis was observed in the PMAs.
CONCLUSION: The PMA prevalence appears to increase with decreasing age and is a frequently encountered anatomical variant. Radiologists assessing forearm vasculature need to be aware of this anatomical variant and potentially include it in their future reports. Further research into the PMA may make its potential use as arterial conduits for AVF, potential donor grafts for coronary artery bypass surgery or additional vascular access options possible. Whether the reducing prevalence with age reflects an overall increasing prevalence is yet to be determined.
