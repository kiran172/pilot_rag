Title: Use of trans-biliary rendezvous technique for stenting of an impassable duodenal stricture.

Abstract: Stenting of the gastric outlet is an accepted method for palliation of symptoms secondary to inoperable malignancy and is successful in most cases. Failure of stenting is most commonly due to inability to cross the stricture. We describe a rendezvous technique of duodenal stenting via transhepatic biliary access when conventional endoscopic or fluoroscopic methods fail.
