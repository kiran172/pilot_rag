Title: Vascular Complications in the Era of Transcatheter Treatment of Adult Structural Heart Disease: A Single-Center Early Experience.

Abstract: Transcatheter treatment is becoming the mainstay treatment for structural heart diseases (SHD) in prohibitive surgical risk patients. Recently with the encouraging results, it is being offered to regular risk patients. Peripheral vascular complications (VCs) are still inherent to these procedures due to the nature of this atherosclerotic high-risk group and the profile of the devices. This is a single-center early first year experience with such events occurring after initiating a SHD program treating severe aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation, as well as paravalvular leaks. Out of 33 patients in this time period, 5 developed PV complications which are detailed in this article with their associated risk factors and management. These include access-related complications, closure device issues, arterial rupture post device embolization, and vessel dissection. Vascular complications of those procedures take special interest since they are associated with a worse long-term prognosis. Thus, prevention with proper planning remains of essence along with multidisciplinary management.
