Title: Modeling of aortic valve stenosis using fluid-structure interaction method.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fluid structure interaction (FSI) is defined as interaction of the structures with contacting fluids. The aortic valve experiences the interaction with blood flow in systolic phase. In this study, we have tried to predict the hemodynamics of blood flow through a normal and stenotic aortic valve in two relaxation and exercise conditions using a three-dimensional FSI method.
METHODS: The aorta valve was modeled as a three-dimensional geometry including a normal model and two others with 25% and 50% stenosis. The geometry of the aortic valve was extracted from CT images and the models were generated by MMIMCS software and then they were implemented in ANSYS software. The pulsatile flow rate was used for all cases and the numerical simulations were conducted based on a time-dependent domain.
RESULTS: The obtained results including the velocity, pressure, and shear stress contours in different systolic time sequences were explained and discussed. The maximum blood flow velocity in relaxation phase was obtained 1.62 m/s (normal valve), 3.78 m/s (25% stenosed valve), and 4.73 m/s (50% stenosed valve). In exercise condition, the maximum velocities are 2.86, 4.32, and 5.42 m/s respectively. The maximum blood pressure in relaxation phase was calculated 111.45 mmHg (normal), 148.66 mmHg (25% stenosed), and 164.21 mmHg (50% stenosed). However, the calculated values in exercise situation were 129.57, 163.58, and 191.26 mmHg.The validation of the predicted results was also conducted using existing literature.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that such model are useful tools for biomechanical experts. The further studies should be done using experimental data and the data are implemented on the boundary conditions for better comparison of the results.
