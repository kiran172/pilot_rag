Title: Radical surgical management of perianal giant condyloma acuminatum of Buschke and Löwenstein: long-term results of 11 cases.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Perianal Buschke-Löwenstein tumor (BLT) is characterized by an exophytic cauliflower-like mass surrounding the perianal region. Its tendency to infiltrate the adjacent tissues, its massiveness, and its high recurrence rate cause difficulties in treatment. The aim of this study is to report our strategy with wide local excision and flap reconstruction for BLT.
METHODS: From November 2002 to June 2019, 11 patients (9 men) with a mean age of 33.45 years (range, 19-54 years) were operated on for BLT. All patients underwent wide local excision and V-Y flap reconstruction, supplemented with other flaps whenever needed. No additional modalities were used.
RESULTS: Two patients had a history of anal intercourse while all patients were human immunodeficiency virus-negative. The mean tumor length was 15.54 ± 1.34 cm (range, 10-26 cm). Human papillomavirus 6 was the most common type identified. Partial wound dehiscence developed in 3 patients, while anal stenosis, mucosal ectropion, or local recurrence was not observed during the mean follow-up period of 50.45 ± 1.75 months (range, 10-196 months).
CONCLUSION: In patients with perianal BLT, wide local excision and flap reconstruction result in a high healing rate without significant complications.
