Title: Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange in Laryngotracheal Resection and Reconstruction: A Report of Two Pregnant Cases.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The incidence of tracheal stenosis is progressively increasing. A risk factor for developing this clinical condition is a history of prolonged endotracheal intubation. A transnasal humidified rapid insufflation ventilatory exchange, known as THRIVE, has gained importance in tracheal resection surgeries.
CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we describe the anesthetic management of two obstetric patients, a 19-year-old and 29-year-old, with a history of prolonged endotracheal intubation and a diagnosis of tracheal stenosis. The patients required the resection of the tracheal segment and end-to-end anastomosis. The anesthetic management focused on THRIVE using a high-flow nasal cannula.
CONCLUSIONS: This system proved to be a safe anesthetic technique for pregnant women and the fetus. Furthermore, it allowed surgeons to better visualize the surgical field without the risk of accidental injury to the endotracheal tube.
