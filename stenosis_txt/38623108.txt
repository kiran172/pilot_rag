Title: Sleep-Disordered Breathing in an Infant With Achondroplasia and Foramen Magnum Stenosis.

Abstract: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a frequently recognized comorbidity in infants and children with achondroplasia due to alterations in craniofacial and upper airway anatomy. Foramen magnum stenosis and cervicomedullary compression can be associated with SDB in this population, requiring prompt evaluation by multidisciplinary teams. Untreated SDB is associated with adverse cardiovascular, metabolic, and behavioral effects in children, necessitating early screening and treatment of underlying causes.Â Cervicomedullary compression is also associated with increased mortality and sudden infant death in infants with achondroplasia. Management of SDB in children with achondroplasia may involve a combination of neurosurgical intervention, adenotonsillectomy, and/or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We recognize a need for increased physician awareness of the recommended screening guidelines to optimize health outcomes for children with achondroplasia. In this report, we describe a case of a five-month-old infant with achondroplasia and severe SDB diagnosed by polysomnography and was found to have moderate-to-severe foramen magnum stenosis identified by MRI. Subsequently, this infant underwent foramen magnum decompression, which improved the severe SDB and was followed up for five years. Our case illustrates the importance of early screening in infants with achondroplasia for SDB to prevent further sequelae.
