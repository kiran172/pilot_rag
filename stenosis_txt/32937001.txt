Title: A Breath-Holding Index Applied to the Internal Carotid Artery Siphon in Transcranial Doppler Studies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The breath-holding index (BHI) is a useful method to assess cerebrovascular reactivity. It is calculated based on the mean flow velocities of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) using transcranial Doppler (BHI<sub>MCA</sub> ). Therefore, it is not feasible in patients with poor temporal windows. This study tested the feasibility of a BHI using the internal carotid artery (ICA) siphon flow velocity (BHI<sub>ICA</sub> ).
METHODS: Twenty-four patients (aged 38-79 years) with unilateral or bilateral stenosis of the cervical ICAs were prospectively recruited. The 48 examined bilateral ICAs were divided into three groups according to the stenosis degree: &lt;50%, 50-99%, and occlusion. We investigated the reproducibility of both BHI methods (BHI<sub>MCA</sub> and BHI<sub>ICA</sub> ), the correlation between the two BHI methods, and the tendency for the BHIs to decrease with increasing degree of cervical ICA stenosis.
RESULTS: For the BHI<sub>MCA</sub> , we found a good reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient, r<sub>I</sub><sub> </sub> &gt; .9<sub>)</sub> and a significantly decreased BHI with increasing stenosis of the ICA (P = .001). For the BHI<sub>ICA</sub> , good reproducibility was demonstrated (r<sub>I</sub>  &gt; or ≒ .9), but there was no significant decrease in the BHI related to the increasing degree of ICA stenosis (P = .952). Furthermore, the correlation between the two BHI methods was not robust (kappa coefficient, right .259; left .619).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the BHI<sub>ICA</sub> is not a feasible alternative method to the BHI<sub>MCA.</sub>
