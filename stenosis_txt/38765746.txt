Title: Impact of stage-specific limb function exercises guided by a self-management education model on arteriovenous fistula maturation status.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The exercise of limb function is the most economical and safe method to promote the maturation of arteriovenous fistula (AVF). However, due to the lack of a unified exercise standard in China, many patients have insufficient awareness of the importance of AVF, leading to poor effectiveness of limb function exercise. The self-management education model can effectively promote patients to take proactive health-related actions. This study focuses on the characteristics of patients during the peri-AVF period and conducts a phased limb function exercise under the guidance of the self-management education model to observe changes in factors such as the maturity of AVF.
AIM: To assess the impact of stage-specific limb function exercises, directed by a self-management education model, on the maturation status of AVFs.
METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial involving 74 patients with forearm AVFs from the Nephrology Department of a tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province, China. Patients were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group using a random number table method. The observation group underwent tailored stage-specific limb function exercises, informed by a self-management education model which took into account the unique features of AVF at various stages, in conjunction with routine care. Conversely, the control group was given standard limb function exercises along with routine care. The assessment involves the maturity of AVFs post-intervention, postoperative complications, and the self-management level of the fistula in both groups patients. Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 23.0. Count data were represented by frequency and percentage and subjected to chi-square test comparisons. Measurement data adhering to a normal distribution were presented as mean Â± SD. The independent samples t-test was utilized for inter-group comparisons, while the paired t-test was used for intra-group comparisons. For measurement data not fitting a normal distribution, the median and interquartile range were presented and analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
RESULTS: At the 8-wk postoperative mark, the observation group demonstrated significantly higher scores in AVF symptom recognition, symptom prevention, and self-management compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). However, the variance in symptom management scores between the observation and control groups lacked statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05). At 4 wk after the operation, the observation group displayed a superior vessel diameter and depth from the skin of the drainage vessels in comparison to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). While the observation group did manifest elevated blood flow rates in the drainage vessels relative to the control group, this distinction was not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). By the 8-wk postoperative interval, the observation group outperformed the control group with notable enhancements in blood flow rates, vessel diameter, and depth from the skin of drainage vessels (P &lt; 0.01). Seven days following the procedure, the observation group manifested significantly diminished limb swelling and an overall reduced complication rate in contrast to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The evaluation of infection, thrombosis, embolism, arterial aneurysm stenosis, and incision bleeding showed no notable differences between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). By the 4-wk postoperative juncture, complications between the observation and control groups were statistically indistinguishable (P &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Stage-specific limb function exercises, under the guidance of a self-management education model, amplify the capacity of AVF patients to discern and prevent symptoms. Additionally, they expedite AVF maturation and mitigate postoperative limb edema, underscoring their efficacy as a valuable method for the care and upkeep of AVF in hemodialysis patients.
