Title: [Role of preoperative cardiology consultation in patients undergoing cancer surgery].

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the effects of preoperative cardiology consultation on the risk of perioperative cardiac complications in patients undergoing cancer surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 74 patients with bronchial, lung, mediastinal and gastrointestinal cancer were referred to the cardiologist as a part of the preoperative management. Patients were assigned either to Group 1 (n=21), who required non - invasive testing or invasive coronary angiography (CAG), or to Group 2 (n=53), who did not have any indications to additional testing.
RESULTS: The median age was 65.8 years in Group 1 and 64.5 years in Group 2, p=0.408. Group 1 patients had higher RCRI than Group 2 patients (7.4±4.5 vs. 2.9±4.5, respectively, p=0.002). Four (19.05%) patients in Group 1 underwent minimally invasive examination without any further indications to CAG. 16 (76.2%) patients underwent CAG. Of them, 5 (23.8%) patients had severe coronary artery stenosis, and 4 (19.0%) patients had severe brachycephalic artery stenosis (≥50%). After CAG findings, one carotid artery and three coronary arteries (14.3%) were stented. Drug therapy was prescribed to one patient. One patient required stenting after the treatment of the underlying disease. Group 2 patients were more likely to achieve the endpoints - heart rhythm disturbances, decompensation of chronic heart failure, cardiac death (5.45% in Group 2 vs. 4.76% in Group 1, p>0.05). Multivariate analysis reported that angina pectoris was an independent factor to refer patients to the additional testing (p.
