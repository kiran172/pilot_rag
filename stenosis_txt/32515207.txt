Title: Carotid Stent Restenosis and Thrombosis in Rabbits: The Effect of Antiplatelet Agents.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was the comparative assessment of ticagrelor and clopidogrel effects on carotid post-balloon injury (PBI) and on post carotid artery stenting (CAS) rate of in-stent restenosis (ISR) and in-stent thrombosis in atherosclerotic rabbits.
METHODS: Forty-eight New Zealand white rabbits on high-fat diet were randomized into 4 groups: A1: PBI and clopidogrel (30 mg/kg/d), A2: PBI and ticagrelor (21 mg/kg twice daily), B1: PBI, CAS, and clopidogrel (30 mg/kg/d), B2: PBI, CAS, and ticagrelor (21 mg/kg twice daily). All rabbits received orally aspirin (10 mg/kg/d) and interventions were performed in their right carotid arteries (RCAs). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and carotid angiography were performed at end point, while platelet aggregation and lipid profile were measured. After euthanasia both carotids were obtained for histological examination.
RESULTS: In B1 group, 3 rabbits presented thrombotic total occlusion of the stents, while none such episode was observed in B2 group. The neointimal areas in RCAs, calculated by OCT, did not differ between A1 and A2 groups, and between B1 and B2 groups (P &gt; .05). From the histological findings, the intima/(media + intima) percentage (%) in RCAs of balloon-injured rabbits did not present any difference between groups (P = .812). Similarly, the immunohistochemically determined accumulation of endothelial cells and macrophages on vascular walls was equivalent between groups (P &gt; .05).
CONCLUSION: Following carotid balloon injury and stenting, clopidogrel and ticagrelor did not show any differential effects on the extent of neointimal formation and ISR in atherosclerotic rabbits receiving aspirin. Three thrombotic stent occlusions were noted in the clopidogrel treatment group, but this finding was not statistically significant.
