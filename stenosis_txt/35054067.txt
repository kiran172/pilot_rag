Title: PECAM1, COL4A2, PHACTR1, and LMOD1 Gene Polymorphisms in Patients with Unstable Angina.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a syndrome resulting from myocardial ischaemia of heterogeneous pathomechanism. Environmental and genetic factors contribute to its development. Atherosclerotic plaques that significantly narrow the lumen of coronary arteries cause symptoms of myocardial ischaemia. Acute coronary incidents are most often associated with plaque rupture or erosion accompanied by local activation of the coagulation system with thrombus formation. Plaque formation and stability are influenced by endothelial function and vascular smooth muscle cell function. In this study, we investigated the association between polymorphisms in genes affecting endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function and the occurrence of unstable angina pectoris. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the PECAM1 (rs1867624), COL4A2 (rs4773144), PHACTR1 (rs9349379) and LMOD1 (rs2820315) gene polymorphisms and the risk of unstable angina. The study included 232 patients with unstable angina diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and coronary angiography and 144 healthy subjects with no significant coronary lumen stenosis at coronary angiography. There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of COL4A2 rs4773144 and PECAM1 rs1867624 gene polymorphisms between patients with unstable angina and control subjects. In patients with unstable angina, there was an increased frequency of PHACTR1 rs9349379 G allele carriers (GG and AG genotypes) (GG+AG vs. AA, OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.10-2.66, p = 0.017) and carriers of the LMOD1 rs2820315 T allele (TT and CT genotypes) (TT+CT vs. CC, OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.09-2.51, p = 0.019) compared to the control group. The association between these alleles and unstable angina was confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analysis, in which the number of G (PHACTR1 rs9349379) and T (LMOD1 rs2820315) alleles was an independent risk factor for unstable angina. The results suggest an association between PHACTR1 rs9349379 and LMOD1 rs2820315 polymorphisms and the risk of unstable angina.
