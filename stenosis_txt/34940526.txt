Title: The Role of 2D and 3D Echo in Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: Mitral stenosis is an important cause of heart valve disease globally. Echocardiography is the main imaging modality used to diagnose and assess the severity and hemodynamic consequences of mitral stenosis as well as valve morphology. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is sufficient for the management of most patients. The focus of this review is the role of current two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic imaging for the evaluation of mitral stenosis.
