Title: Optimal Medical Management of Atherosclerotic Intracranial Stenosis.

Abstract: Reducing the high risk of recurrent stroke in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS) has proven to be challenging, but aggressive medical management, with intensive risk factor control and antithrombotic therapy, has been shown to be beneficial. High-intensity statins are recommended for patients with atherosclerotic stroke, including sICAS. Ezetimibe and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors are beneficial for those who fail to reach low-density lipoprotein targets or those with statin intolerance. The treatment target for sICAS is low-density lipoprotein <70 mg/dL. In neurologically stable patients, blood pressure should be treated to goal <140/90 mm Hg with the use of thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers preferentially. For those with diabetes, treat to goal hemoglobin A1C ≤7% for most patients through combination of diet, insulin, and hypoglycemic drugs. Some degree of physical activity (eg, walking, stationary biking with arms or legs, etc) should be encouraged in all patients with sICAS who are not severely disabled. A minimum of 10 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity 4 times a week is recommended for patients who are capable of exercise. For all patients with severe sICAS (70%-99% stenosis), dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 90 days followed by single antiplatelet agent is recommended.
