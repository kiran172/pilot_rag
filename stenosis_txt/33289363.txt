Title: CT and MRI for Repaired Complex Adult Congenital Heart Diseases.

Abstract: An increasing number of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients continue to require life-long diagnostic imaging surveillance using cardiac CT and MRI. These patients typically exhibit a large spectrum of unique anatomical and functional changes resulting from either single- or multi-stage palliation and surgical correction. Radiologists involved in the diagnostic task of monitoring treatment effects and detecting potential complications should be familiar with common cardiac CT and MRI findings observed in patients with repaired complex ACHD. This review article highlights the contemporary role of CT and MRI in three commonly encountered repaired ACHD: repaired tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries after arterial switch operation, and functional single ventricle after Fontan operation.
