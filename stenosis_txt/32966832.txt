Title: Rapid reduction in plaque inflammation by sonodynamic therapy inpatients with symptomatic femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease:A randomized controlled trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inflammation is actively involved in the clinical manifestation of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a novel non-invasive, plaque-based, macrophage-targeted anti-inflammatory regimen for atherosclerosis has the potential to improve walking performance by reducing plaque inflammation.
METHODS: This phase-2, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind clinical trial enrolled 32 participants with symptomatic femoropopliteal PAD. The primary outcome was the 30-day change in the target-to-background ratio (TBR) within the most diseased segment (MDS) of the femoropopliteal artery assessed through positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The secondary outcomes were changes in walking performance, limb perfusion, lesional morphology and quality of life measurements.
RESULTS: The mean age was 64.7 years and 63% were male. Thirty-one completed follow-up. SDT significantly decreased the MDS TBR by 0.53 (95% CI, -0.70 to -0.36, P < 0.001) compared with control. Furthermore, SDT increased peak walking time by 118.6 s (95% CI, 74.3 to 163.0, P < 0.001), increased ankle-brachial index by 0.11 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.14, P < 0.001), decreased lesional diameter and area stenosis by 7.2% (95% CI, -8.6 to -4.5, P < 0.001) and 9.6% (95% CI, -24.5 to -5.3, P = 0.005), respectively, and increased the walking speed score of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire by 16.1 (95% CI, 2.6 to 29.5, P = 0.021) and the physical functioning score of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey by 10.0 (95% CI, 5.0 to 20.0, P = 0.003) compared with control. These improvements were maintained in the SDT group up to 6-month.
CONCLUSIONS: SDT rapidly reduced plaque inflammation and improved walking performance among patients with symptomatic PAD.
