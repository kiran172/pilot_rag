Title: Ileal Interposition for Ureteral Reconstruction Following Treatment for Abdominopelvic Malignancy: Complications and Outcomes From a Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To characterize the outcomes of ileal interposition for the management of ureteral obstruction from tumor and ureteral stricture following treatment for abdominopelvic malignancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was performed for all cases of ileal interposition performed by 5 surgeons from January 2013 to December 2020. Patients were ≥18 years of age and included if undergoing ileal interposition in either the primary setting of a surgical procedure for tumor extirpation or in the delayed setting.
RESULTS: In total, 23 patients who underwent repair of 27 ureteral units were included. The mean age was 60.2 years. Median follow-up was 21.6 months. The most common primary diagnoses were urothelial (35%), colorectal (31%), and cervical (22%) cancer. The etiologies of ureteral obstruction were malignant in 48% and ureteral stricture in 52%. Types of repairs included unilateral interposition in 13 patients, bilateral interposition in 1 patient, interposition to an ileal conduit in 3 patients, and interposition with cystoplasty in 6 patients. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean preoperative (Creatinine 1.05 mg/dL, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 77 ml/min/1.73 m2) renal function and postoperative (Creatinine 1.26 mg/dL, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 67 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal function at the most recent follow-up (P = .024). Eight minor (grade 1-2) and 6 major (grade ≥3) complications developed for a minor and major complication rate of 35% and 26%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Ileal interposition is successfully utilized as a reconstructive technique at the time of enbloc resection involving the ureter and to address ureteral stricture in the delayed setting.
