Title: The potential role of diffusion weighted imaging in the diagnosis of early carotid and vertebral artery dissection.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the role of the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in the acute dissection of internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA) and assessing the length of intramural hematoma (IMH), caused by dissection.
METHODS: We analyzed 28 patients presenting with a dissection of the ICA and/or VA with respect to the presence of high signal intensity areas on DWI suggestive of dissection and 20 control subjects without arterial dissection, some with and some without atherosclerotic lesions. ICA or VA dissection was defined by clinical and imaging, computed tomography angiography (CTA), MR angiography (MRA), and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings. The length of DWI hyperintensity was compared to length of the occlusion or stenosis on the angiographic examination.
RESULTS: In 28 patients, 30 dissected arteries were analyzed. Time intervals from the onset of the first clinical symptoms to the radiological evaluation ranged from 1.5 h to 42 days. In 28 (93%) of the dissections, a high signal intensity of the affected artery was present on DWI. The measurement of the dissection length on DWI compared to DSA showed a mean deviation of 2.7 mm and a standard deviation of 3.7 mm.
CONCLUSION: DWI is a highly sensitive and valuable pulse sequence for the detection of dissected cervical arteries even in the first hours after symptom onset. In contrast to CTA and MRA, DWI can be a potential tool for a reliable measurement of the dissection length.
