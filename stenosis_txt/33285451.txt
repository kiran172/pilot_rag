Title: Novel expandable architected breathing tube for improving airway securement in emergency care.

Abstract: Life-saving interventions utilize endotracheal intubation to secure a patient's airway, but performance of the clinical standard of care endotracheal tube (ETT) is inadequate. For instance, in the current COVID-19 crisis, patients can expect prolonged intubation. This protracted intubation may produce health complications such as tracheal stenosis, pneumonia, and necrosis of tracheal tissue, as current ETTs are not designed for extended use. In this work, we propose an improved ETT design that seeks to overcome these limitations by utilizing unique geometries which enable a novel expanding cylinder. The mechanism provides a better distribution of the contact forces between the ETT and the trachea, which should enhance patient tolerability. Results show that at full expansion, our new ETT exerts pressures in a silicone tracheal phantom well within the recommended standard of care. Also, preliminary manikin tests demonstrated that the new ETT can deliver similar performance in terms of air pressure and air volume when compared with the current gold standard ETT. The potential benefits of this new architected ETT are threefold, by limiting exposure of healthcare providers to patient pathogens through streamlining the intubation process, reducing downstream complications, and eliminating the need of multiple size ETT as one architected ETT fits all.
