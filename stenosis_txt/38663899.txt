Title: Bilateral renal artery revascularisation in heart failure.

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis can complicate the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, as it is a conventional contraindication to the use of ACE inhibitors. We report a case in which bilateral renal artery revascularisation allowed the safe reintroduction of enalapril (and subsequently sacubitril valsartan) in a patient with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. There is a role for renal artery angioplasty in selected patients to allow optimal medical therapy for patients with heart failure due to impaired systolic function.
