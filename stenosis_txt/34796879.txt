Title: Coronary artery cannulation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has revolutionised the treatment of severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis and it is now a proven and effective alternative to surgery for patients regardless of preoperative risk stratification. Nevertheless, the consequent expansion towards younger patients with longer life expectancy focuses attention on long-term considerations. In particular, although the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to decrease with the lowering of estimated risk stratification, the chance of requirement of future coronary interventions after TAVI increases dramatically as a function of patients' life expectancy. To date, however, only a few studies have investigated the feasibility and reproducibility of coronary artery cannulation after TAVI. Different conditions related mainly to aortic root anatomy and specific transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) designs and deployment have been associated with impaired coronary access after TAVI. In the present review, we will examine the conditions that may make coronary access after TAVI more challenging or even impossible.
