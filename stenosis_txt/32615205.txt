Title: Diffuse Cutaneous Manifestations after Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty.

Abstract: We present here a case of an uncommon cutaneous manifestation after paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty. In this case, the patient underwent drug-coated balloon angioplasty for stenosis of a prior vein bypass graft. The patient subsequently developed extensive cutaneous lesions not confined to a single arterial distribution. This case represents a rare complication related to paclitaxel-eluting balloons and provides a cautionary tale as well as clinical acumen for providers in using such devices in their practice.
