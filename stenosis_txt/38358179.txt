Title: Anesthetic management in a huge hydrocephalus.

Abstract: The pediatric age group with massive hydrocephalus posted for ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt presents a lot of confrontation to anesthesiologists due to macrocephalus and associated congenital anomalies. Here, we presented a case report with massive hydrocephalus with aqueduct stenosis, posted for VP shunt placement, and retained a difficult airway.
