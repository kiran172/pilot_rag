Title: Ultrasound assessment of brain supplying arteries (extracranial).

Abstract: Ultrasonography of the brain-supplying arteries is a non-invasive and highly efficient technique for the assessment of a stenosis or a vessel occlusion in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. This article reviews the examination technique for a standardized ultrasound assessment of the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries. It further describes the multiparametric grading criteria of internal carotid artery stenosis and it gives recommendations for a standardised documentation of findings. Additionally, it proposes recommendations for intima-media thickness measurement and for classifying atherosclerotic plaques with B-mode ultrasonography. Moreover, criteria for the diagnosis of in-stent stenoses, vertebral artery dissections and subclavian steal syndrome are provided.
