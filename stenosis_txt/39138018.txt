Title: Sudden death after a mountain bike race.

Abstract: Presented case study deals with the sudden death of a 47 years old male, shortly after a mountain bike race after reported nausea and chest pain followed by loss of consciousness and resuscitation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful. An autopsy was enacted due to the sudden death in a seemingly healthy person. An acute infarction of the anterior cardiac wall on the basis of stenosis of the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery with histopathological findings of eosinophilic coronary periarteritis was assessed. Sudden death during sport activities represents a complex problem which forensic physicians have to face. An external and internal examination of the body is not always sufficient. It is crucial for the forensic physician to have sufficient knowledge and enough information about the circumstances of the death and anamnestic records. Eosinophilic coronary periarteritis occurs rarely, predominantly in males and with uncertain etiology.
