Title: [Serum annexin A2 level is significantly elevated in patients with coronary heart disease].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlation of annexin A2 with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD) and the severity of CAD.
METHODS: We collected data from a total of 200 inpatients admitted in our department between August, 2017 and August, 2019. According to the.
RESULTS: of coronary angiography, the patients were divided into CAD group (n=150) and non-CAD (n=50), and the CAD patients was further divided, according to their clinical stability, into stable angina (SAP) group and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) group. Serum levels of annexin A2, MPO and PON1 were detected in all these patients, and their correlations with CAD, disease severity, and degree of coronary artery stenosis were analyzed.ResultsThe levels of annexin A2 and MPO were significantly higher in CAD patients than in non-CAD patients (P &lt; 0.05). Among the CAD patients, those with ACS had significantly higher levels of annexin A2 (P &lt; 0.05) and lower levels of PON-1 (P &lt; 0.05) than those with SAP, but annexin A2 level was not significantly correlated with coronary lesion count, Gensini score, or the co-morbidity of diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Annexin A2 is significantly elevated in patients with CAD, especially in those with ACS, and can be used as a predictor of clinical instability.
