Title: A New Doppler-Derived Parameter to Quantify Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis: Maximal Systolic Acceleration.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) is used as initial measurement to diagnose and classify carotid artery stenosis. Local distorting factors such as vascular calcification can influence the ability to obtain DUS measurements. The DUS derived maximal systolic acceleration (ACCmax) provides a different way to determine the degree of stenosis. While conventional DUS parameters are measured at the stenosis itself, ACCmax is measured distal to the internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. The value of ACCmax in ICA stenosis was investigated in this study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All carotid artery DUS studies of a tertiary academic center were reviewed from October 2007 until December 2017. Every ICA was included once. The ACCmax was compared to conventional DUS parameters: ICA peak systolic velocity (PSV), and PSV ratio (ICA PSV/ CCA PSV). ROC-curve analysis was used to evaluate accuracy of ACCmax, ICA PSV and PSV ratio as compared to CT-angiography (CTA) derived stenosis measurement as reference test.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 947 carotid arteries and was divided into 3 groups: &lt;50% (710/947), 50-69% (109/947), and ≥70% (128/947). Between these groups ACCmax was significantly different. Strong correlations between ACCmax and ICA PSV (R2 0.88) and PSV ratio (R2 0.87) were found. In ROC subanalysis, the ACCmax had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 89% to diagnose a ≥70% ICA stenosis, and a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 88% to diagnose a ≥50% ICA stenosis. For diagnosing a ≥50% ICA stenosis the area under the curve (AUC) of ACCmax (0.88) was significantly lower than the AUC of PSV ratio (0.94) and ICA PSV (0.94). To diagnose a ≥70% ICA stenosis there were no significant differences in AUC between ACCmax (0.89), PSV ratio (0.93) and ICA PSV (0.94).
CONCLUSIONS: ACCmax is an interesting additional DUS measurement in determining the degree of ICA stenosis. ACCmax is measured distal to the stenosis and is not hampered by local distorting factors at the site of the stenosis. ACCmax can accurately diagnose an ICA stenosis, but was somewhat inferior compared to ICA PSV and PSV ratio to diagnose a ≥50% ICA stenosis.
