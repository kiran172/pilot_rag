Title: Dysregulation of metalloproteinases in spinal ligament degeneration.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Degenerative changes in the spinal ligaments, such as hypertrophy or ossification, are important pathophysiological mechanisms of secondary spinal stenosis and neurological compression. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is one of the major pathological changes in ligament degeneration, and in this remodeling, ECM proteinase-mediated degradation of elastin and collagen plays a vital role. Zinc-dependent endopeptidases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs), and ADAMs with thrombospondin-1 motifs (ADAMTSs) are key factors in ECM remodeling. This review aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these metalloproteinases in the initiation and progression of spinal ligament degeneration.
METHODS: We clarify current literature on the dysregulation of MMPs/ADAMs/ADAMTS and their endogenous inhibitors in degenerative spinal ligament diseases. In addition, some instructive information was excavated from the raw data of the relevant high-throughput analysis.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The dysregulation of metalloproteinases and their endogenous inhibitors may affect ligament degeneration by involving several interrelated processes, represented by ECM degradation, fibroblast proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. Antagonists of the key targets of the processes may in turn ease ligament degeneration.
