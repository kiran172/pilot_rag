Title: Minimally Invasive Revision of Luque Plate Instrumentation: A Case Report.

Abstract: Extension of existing spinal fusions may necessitate the removal of or linkage to prior constructs. Knowledge of previously placed instrumentation is critical to success in these revision scenarios. The Luque spinal instrumentation system, developed in the late 1980s, is a legacy pedicle screw and plate system that may be encountered during revision operations today. A 67-year-old male with a remote history of L4-S1 fusion with Luque instrumentation presented with bilateral lower extremity neurogenic claudication due to adjacent segment disease at L3-4. Decompression and extension of fusion to the L3-4 level were performed using minimally invasive techniques. Of note, posterior instrumentation was extended by removing prior L4 pedicle screws with a 7 mm female hexagonal driver through tubular retractors, leaving the Luque plates in place, placing modern pedicle screws at L4 (through the plates) and L3, and linking these with standard rods. The surgery and post-operative course were uncomplicated, and the patient experienced complete resolution of his pre-operative claudication symptoms. Extension of prior Luque plate instrumented fusion can be accomplished minimally invasively without removing the plates themselves, resulting in greater operative efficiency and less surgical morbidity.
