Title: Local compression of the sciatic nerve by a vascular malformation as a rare cause of sciatica: A case report and review of literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sciatica is typically caused by disc herniations or spinal stenosis. Extraspinal compression of the sciatic nerve is less frequent.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a rare case of sciatica with compression of the sciatic nerve by a low-flow vascular malformation in a 24-year-old female patient. The special feature of this case was sciatica along the S1 dermatome, which only occurred in the sitting position and inclination because of compression of the sciatic nerve between the vascular malformation and the lesser trochanter. Spinal imaging showed no abnormal findings. Surgery was performed interdisciplinary and included neurosurgery, vascular surgery, and trauma surgery. After surgery, the patient became symptom-free.
CONCLUSION: Rare and extraspinal causes of local compression of the sciatic nerve should be considered, especially in cases of lacking spinal imaging correlation and untypical clinical presentation. Interdisciplinary surgical cooperation is of special value in cases of rare entities and uncommon locations.
