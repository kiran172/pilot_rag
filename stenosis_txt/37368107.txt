Title: Impact of new-onset arrhythmia on cardiac reverse remodeling following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: computed tomography-derived left ventricular and atrial strains.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve ﻿replacement (TAVR) are at risk for new-onset arrhythmia (NOA) that may require permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, resulting in decreased cardiac function. We aimed to investigate the factors that are associated with NOA after TAVR and to compare pre- and post-TAVR cardiac functions between patients with and without NOA using CT-derived strain analyses.
METHODS: We included consecutive patients who underwent pre- and post-TAVR cardiac CT scans six months after TAVR. New-onset left bundle branch block, atrioventricular block, and atrial fibrillation/flutter lasting over 30 days after the procedure and/or the need for PPM diagnosed within 1 year after TAVR were regarded as NOA. Implant depth and left heart function and strains were analyzed using multi-phase CT images and compared between patients with and without NOA.
RESULTS: Of 211 patients (41.7% men; median 81 years), 52 (24.6%) presented with NOA after TAVR, and 24 (11.4%) implanted PPM. Implant depth was significantly deeper in the NOA group than in the non-NOA group (- 6.7 ± 2.4 vs. - 5.6 ± 2.6 mm; p = 0.009). Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) and left atrial (LA) reservoir strain were significantly improved only in the non-NOA group (LV GLS,  - 15.5 ± 4.0 to  - 17.3 ± 2.9%; p < 0.001; LA reservoir strain, 22.3 ± 8.9 to 26.5 ± 7.6%; p < 0.001). The mean percent change of the LV GLS and LA reservoir strains was evident in the non-NOA group (p = 0.019 and p = 0.035, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of patients presented with NOA after TAVR. Deep implant depth on post-TAVR CT scans was associated with NOA. Patients with NOA after TAVR had impaired LV reserve remodeling assessed by CT-derived strains.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: New-onset arrhythmia (NOA) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) impairs cardiac reverse remodeling. CT-derived strain analysis reveals that patients with NOA do not show improvement in left heart function and strains, highlighting the importance of managing NOA for optimal outcomes.
KEY POINTS: • New-onset arrhythmia following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a concern that interferes with cardiac reverse remodeling. • Comparison of pre-and post-TAVR CT-derived left heart strain provides insight into the impaired cardiac reverse remodeling in patients with new-onset arrhythmia following TAVR. • The expected reverse remodeling was not observed in patients with new-onset arrhythmia following TAVR, given that CT-derived left heart function and strains did not improve.
