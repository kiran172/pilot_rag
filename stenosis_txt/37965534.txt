Title: Combined Ravitch and Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum with dyspnea following scoliosis repair.

Abstract: Pectus excavatum (PE) is often associated with scoliosis and can elicit cardiovascular disturbances under rare conditions. Here we report a patient who was treated with a combined Ravitch and Nuss procedure for PE with dyspnea following scoliosis repair to improve her symptoms. The patient was a 49-year-old woman with a history of PE and scoliosis. Right inferior pulmonary vein stenosis was caused by posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis prior to the PE repair. We could safely correct the chest wall deformity and treat dyspnea by performing a modified Ravitch repair in combination with the Nuss procedure.
