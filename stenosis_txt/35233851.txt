Title: Study on the value of small dense low-density lipoprotein in predicting cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in the high-risk stroke population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lipid management in people at high risk of stroke is an important measurement to prevent the occurrence of stroke. The study aims to investigate the association between sdLDL and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in high-risk stroke populations.
METHODS: This was a prospective study. Screened from 15,933 individuals aged >40 years in April 2013 and followed up at 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th months, 823 participants met the screening criteria and were investigated for clinical data and biochemical parameters.
RESULTS: A total of 286 subjects had varying degrees of carotid stenosis, and 18 subjects experienced cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events during the two-year follow-up period. There was no positive correlation between sdLDL and carotid stenosis. Carotid stenosis and extent of carotid stenosis involvement did not predict cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with high-risk stroke, while sdLDL did. The sdLDL level in the events group was significantly higher than those in the no event group (p = 0.002). In the events group, the risk of events in the fourth quartile of sdLDL was 10.136 times higher than in the first quartile (HR = 10.136, 95% CI: 1.298-79.180, p = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: sdLDL was positively correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, which can predict the occurrence of an event and provide a scientific basis for early prevention.
