Title: Long-Term Prognosis of Patients Who Underwent Percutaneous Transvenous Mitral Commissurotomy for Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: The long-term prognosis for up to 20 years of patients who have undergone percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) for mitral stenosis (MS) is unknown.We examined 77 of 93 patients (83%) with MS and who underwent PTMC from 1989 to 2002 at our institute, as well as the occurrence of either one of the following clinical endpoints until September 1, 2018: all-cause death or repeat intervention for the mitral valve.The mean follow-up duration was 20.5 ± 7.3 years. The mean age was 51 ± 11 years. Overall, the 20-year survival rate was 71% ± 5%; without any intervention, the 20-year survival rate was 40% ± 6%. In patients who achieved good immediate results (i.e., mitral valve area (MVA) of ≥ 1.5 cm2 without mitral regurgitation (MR) of &gt; 2/4 after PTMC), the 20-year survival rate was 80% ± 6%; without any intervention, the 20-year survival rate was 54% ± 7%.In our 20-year observational study, patients who have undergone PTMC for MS had favorable prognosis, especially in those who achieved good immediate results. In those who had poor immediate results, careful follow-up is needed because they might have more clinical event and any intervention for the mitral valve.
