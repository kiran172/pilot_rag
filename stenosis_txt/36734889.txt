Title: Calcified Fibrin Sheath Embolism of Bilateral Pulmonary Arteries: A Second Case of the Literature.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters, which provide a unique convenience in the management of critical patients, have many advantages, as well as early and late complications. Early complications include pneumothorax, vascular perforation, hematoma formation, air embolism, or catheter malposition that may occur during or shortly after catheter insertion. Late complications include infection, venous stenosis, catheter thrombosis, and catheter tip migration. In the literature, embolization of a calcified fibrin sheath due to a central venous catheter to the pulmonary artery has been reported only in one case.
CASE PRESENTATION: The purpose of this report is to present bilateral pulmonary artery embolism in a patient who presented with cough and chest pain caused by calcified fibrin sheath of the port catheter removed before that was used for regular chemotherapeutic infusions due to liposarcoma, as the second case in the literature with imaging findings. The patient underwent medical treatment, and as a result of the treatment, symptoms regressed.
CONCLUSION: Central venous catheters have many complications, and although it is rare, pulmonary embolism is one of them. The embolism of a calcified sheath is even rare, but it is still possible. However, an embolism can cause significant morbidity and even mortality for a patient if it occurs. As physicians, we should be aware of this entity to diagnose.
