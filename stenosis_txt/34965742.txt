Title: Postoperative Inhaled Steroids Following Glottic Airway Surgery Reduces Granulation Tissue Formation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Transoral laser surgery for glottic stenosis (transverse cordotomy and anteromedial arytenoidectomy (TCAMA)) is often complicated by granulation tissue (GT) formation. GT can cause dyspnea and may require surgical removal to alleviate airway obstruction. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been shown to reduce benign vocal fold granulomas, however its use to prevent GT formation has not been described. We aimed to analyze the effect of immediate postoperative ICS on GT formation in patients undergoing transoral laser surgery for glottic stenosis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients that had transoral laser surgery for glottic stenosis from 2000 to 2019 was conducted. Surgical instances were grouped into those that received postoperative ICS and those that did not. Demographics, diagnosis, comorbidities, intraoperative adjuvant therapy, and perioperative medications were collected. Differences in GT formation and need for surgical removal were compared between groups. A multivariate exact logistic regression model was performed.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included; 16 required 2 glottic airway surgeries (60 surgical instances). Of the 23 instances where patients received immediate postoperative ICS, 0 patients developed GT; and of the 37 instances that did not receive postoperative ICS, 15 (40.5%) developed GT (P &lt; .0001). Eight (53.3%) of these cases returned to the OR for GT removal. ICS use was solely associated with the absence of GT formation (P = .042) in the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate postoperative use of ICS seems to be a safe and effective method to prevent granulation tissue formation and subsequent surgery in patients following transoral laser airway surgery for glottic stenosis.
