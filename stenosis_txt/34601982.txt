Title: Completion Arteriogram Following Carotid Endarterectomy Yields Lower Perioperative Stroke Rate.

Abstract: Introduction: Completion imaging following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains controversial. We present our experience performing routine completion arteriography (CA). Methods: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained institutional database was performed for patients undergoing isolated CEA. Results: 1439 isolated CEAs with CA were performed on 1297 patients. CEA was for asymptomatic lesions in 70% (1003) of cases. There were no complications related to arteriography. An abnormal arteriogram documented significant abnormalities in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and prompted revision in 1.7% (24/1439) of cases: 20 unsatisfactory distal endpoints of the endarterectomy (12 residual stenoses, 7 intimal flaps, and 1 dissection), 3 kinks or stenoses within the body of the patch, and 1 thrombus. Of the 20 distal endpoint lesions, stent deployment was used in 17 cases and patch revision in 3 cases. The other 4 cases were treated by patch angioplasty (3) or thrombectomy (1). None suffered a perioperative stroke. The overall 30-day stroke, death, and combined stroke/death rate for the 1439 patients in our series was 1.5% (22), .5% (7), and 1.9% (27), respectively. The combined stroke/death rate for asymptomatic lesions was 1.1% (11/1003) and for symptomatic lesions was 2.5% (11/436). Of the 22 strokes in the entire series (all with normal CA), 15 were non-hemorrhagic strokes ipsilateral to the CEA; 14 were confirmed to have widely patent endarterectomy sites by CT-A (13) or re-exploration and repeat arteriography (1). The occluded site was re-explored and underwent thrombectomy, but no technical problems were identified. The remaining strokes were hemorrhagic (4 reperfusion syndrome and 1 surgical site bleeding) or contralateral to the CEA (2). Conclusion: Although not all patients in this series who underwent intraoperative revision due to abnormal CA might have suffered a stroke, performing this simple and safe study may have halved our overall perioperative stroke rate from 3.2% to 1.5%.
