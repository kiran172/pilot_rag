Title: Ten-year review of neonatal neurosurgical outcomes and cost analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical interventions in neonates may contribute to increased neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay. The impact of neurosurgical interventions on length of stay (LOS) and cost is not well-documented in the literature. In addition to LOS, other factors may impact overall resource utilization. Our objective was to perform a cost analysis of neonates who underwent neurosurgical procedures.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on NICU patients who underwent ventriculoperitoneal and/or subgaleal shunt placement between January 1, 2010, and April 30, 2021. Postoperative outcomes were analyzed, including LOS, revisions, infections, emergency department (ED) visits following discharge, and readmissions accounting for health care utilization cost.
RESULTS: Sixty-six neonates underwent shunt placement during our study period. Out of our 66 patients, 40% of infants had intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). About 81% had hydrocephalus. Specific diagnoses for our patient population varied and included: 37.9% of patients had IVH complicated by posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, 27.3% had Chiari II malformation, 9.1% had a cystic malformation leading to hydrocephalus, 7.5% had solely hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly, 6.0% had myelomeningocele, 4.5% had Dandy-Walker malformation, 3.0% had aqueductal stenosis, and the remaining 4.5% had varying other pathologies. In our patient population, 11% of patients had an identified or suspected infection within 30 days after surgery. The average LOS was 59 days versus 67 days for patients with a postoperative infection. Number of patients who visited the ED within 30 days of discharge was 21%. Of these ED visits, 57% led to readmission. Complete cost analysis was available for 35 out of 66 patients. The average LOS was 63 days with average cost of admission of $209,703.43. Average cost for readmission was $25,757.02. Average daily cost for neurosurgical patients was $1,672.98 versus $1,298.17 for all NICU patients.
CONCLUSION: Neonates who underwent neurosurgical procedures had longer LOS as well as higher daily cost. LOS for infants with infections following procedures was increased by 10.6%. Further research is needed to optimize health-care utilization for these high-risk neonates.
