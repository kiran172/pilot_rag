Title: Transparent cap adjusted the stent placed for stenosis after endoscopic injection of esophageal varices: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The stent embedded in the esophageal mucosa is one of the complications after stenting for esophageal stricture. We present a case of stent adjustment with the aid of a transparent cap after endoscopic injection of an esophageal varices stent.
CASE SUMMARY: A 61-year-old male patient came to the hospital with discomfort of the chest after the stent implanted for the stenosis because of endoscopic injection of esophageal varices. The gastroscopy was performed, and the stent embedded into the esophageal mucosa. At first, we pulled the recycling line for shrinking the stent, however, the mucosa could not be removed from the stent. Then a forceps was performed to remove the mucosa in the stent, nevertheless, the bleeding form the mucosa was obvious. And then, we used a transparent cap to scrape the mucosa along the stent, and the mucosa were removed successfully without bleeding.
CONCLUSION: A transparent cap helps gastroscopy to remove the mucosa embedded in the stent after endoscopic injection of the esophageal varices stent.
