Title: The role of transcorporal cuff placement in high-risk and ultra-high-risk patients: are they actually helpful?

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the incidence of artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) explant in high-risk patients and to evaluate the relationship between transcorporal cuff (TCC) placement and explant risk in this population.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all AUS insertions performed on high-risk patients by a single surgeon from 2010 to 2020. "High-risk" was defined as having ≥ 1 urethral risk factor: pelvic radiation, urethroplasty, recalcitrant urethral/bladder neck stenosis, urethral stenting, or previous AUS erosion/infection. Patients with ≥ 2 factors were "ultra-high-risk." Time-to-event analyses were used to assess all-cause-, infection/erosion-related-, and mechanical failure-related explant-free survival. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with a history of radiation and urethral dissection.
RESULTS: The final cohort included 68 men, mean age of 67 years (SD 11), and 77 AUS cuffs. Mean follow-up was 32 months (IQR 6-50). 29% of cuffs (n = 22) were transcorporal. 32 cuffs (42%) were explanted. All-cause explant-free survival was 64% at 1 year and 52% at 2 years. Classification as "ultra-high-risk" was not associated with explant risk (all p-values > 0.05). TCC placement was associated with an increased risk of explant for infection/erosion across all patients (HR 2.74, p = 0.03) and in radiated patients (n = 50; HR 4.1, p = 0.04), but not in patients with prior urethral dissection (n = 52; HR 1.98, p = 0.21).
CONCLUSION: High-risk patients have a high rate of AUS explant and TCC placement may not be protective in this population. TCC placement was associated with an increased risk of infection/erosion in radiated patients, but not in those with a history of open urethral surgery.
