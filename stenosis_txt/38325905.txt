Title: Surgical Correction of Left Ventricular Assist Device Outflow Graft Obstruction Caused by a Wrapped Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene Graft: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 70-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, using a HeartWare ventricular assist device, as a bridge to candidacy. After 26 months, computed tomography (CT) angiography indicated stenosis in the LVAD outflow graft; however, the patient was asymptomatic, prompting a decision to manage his condition with close monitoring. Ten months later, the patient presented with dizziness and low-flow alerts. Subsequent CT angiography revealed a critical obstruction involving the entire LVAD outflow graft. The patient underwent emergency surgery, during which an organized seroma causing the graft obstruction was found between a wrapped expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft and a Dacron outflow graft. The covering of the outflow graft was removed, along with the organized seroma. Following removal of the ePTFE wrap and decompression of the outflow graft, normal LVAD flow was reestablished. The practice of wrapping the outflow graft with synthetic material, commonly done to facilitate later redo sternotomy, may pose a risk for outflow graft obstruction.
