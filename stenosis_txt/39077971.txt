Title: A Novel Hybrid Procedure Combining Resection and Tracheoplasty for Complex Laryngotracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Adult airway stenosis is a common condition treated in the otolaryngology clinic. Patients with high-grade, long-segment stenosis often fail endoscopic management. We describe the successful use of a hybrid resection and laryngotracheoplasty procedure that maximizes airway luminal patency in adults with successful decannulation. Laryngoscope, 134:4893-4896, 2024.
