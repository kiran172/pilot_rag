Title: Anesthetic management of Stanford type B acute aortic dissection that occurred during transcatheter aortic valve implantation under monitored anesthesia care: A case report.

Abstract: We report a case involving anesthetic management of Stanford type B acute aortic dissection occurred during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) under monitored anesthesia care (MAC) in a patient with aortic stenosis (AS). An 87-year-old woman was undergoing TAVI under MAC for severe AS. During the surgery, the patient suddenly moved possibly because of pain. This was followed by hemodynamic collapse. She was then transitioned to general anesthesia, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a Stanford type B acute aortic dissection, which was safely managed perioperatively with appropriate interventions.
