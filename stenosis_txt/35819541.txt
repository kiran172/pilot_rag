Title: Radiographic predictors for recurrence of lumbar symptoms after prioritized cervical surgery in patients with tandem spinal stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the current study was to explore radiographic predictors for recurrence of lumbar symptoms after prioritized cervical surgery in patients with tandem spinal stenosis (TSS).
METHODS: The current retrospective cohort study included 74 patients with TSS, who underwent prioritized cervical surgery. Based on presence or absence of improvement in lower limb symptoms, patients were grouped into improved and non-improved groups. Medical records and radiological parameters including age, sex, body mass index, cervical and lumbar parameters were analyzed. In improved group, patients were divided into relapsed and non-relapsed groups based on recurrence in lower limb symptoms.
RESULTS: Lumbar symptoms improved in 70.1% (n = 52) of patients. Comparison between the improved and non-improved group showed that there were no statistically significant differences in cervical parameters while comparisons between the relapsed and non-relapsed groups showed significant differences in redundant nerve roots (RNRs) (p = 0.029), narrow segment (p = 0.042) and lumbar stenosis index (LSI) (p = 0.003). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, LSI > 10 (p = 0.016) was independently associated with recurrence of lumbar symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Finding of the current study indicated that LSI > 10 was associated with recurrence of lumbar symptoms in TSS patients following cervical surgery.
