Title: A Surgical Technique to Preserve the Subvalvular Apparatus in Patients Undergoing Mitral Valve Replacement for Severe Ischemic Regurgitation.

Abstract: Severe functional mitral valve regurgitation should be treated in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. When replacement is considered the best therapeutic option, preservation of the mitral subvalvular apparatus is crucial, especially in the emergency setting, because of its primary role in preserving geometry and function of left and right ventricles. Here we present a simple and quick technique, where subvalvular apparatus is preserved in toto in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthesis.
