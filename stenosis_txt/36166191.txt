Title: Approach to the patient with decompensated cirrhosis and aortic stenosis during liver transplantation evaluation.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease and is reported to be present in 2%-7% of people over the age of 65. Risk factors for aortic stenosis and NASH overlap; thus, as the population ages, there is an increased likelihood that patients undergoing liver transplantation evaluation may have severe aortic stenosis. There is a high mortality rate associated with cardiac surgeries in patients with cirrhosis. Further, there are no guidelines that assist in the decision making process for patients with cirrhosis and AS. In this review, we highlight key studies that compare transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with cirrhosis. We propose an algorithm as to how to approach the patient with aortic stenosis and considerations unique to patients with cirrhosis (i.e., anticoagulation, EGD for variceal assessment; need to determine timing after TAVI before listing).
