Title: Study on the Mechanism of Platelet-Released Clusterins Inducing Restenosis after Carotid Endarterectomy by Activating TLR3/NF-κb p65 Signaling Pathway.

Abstract: This study aimed to explore the role of clusterin released by platelet aggregation in restenosis after carotid endarterectomy. 35 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy due to carotid artery stenosis were enrolled in this study. They were admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical University from January 2018 to January 2019. All the patients were divided into two groups: the restenosis group and the nonrestenosis group, according to the follow-up results within 12 months. Peripheral blood was collected on the first day, 6 months, and 12 months after operation. The expression of CLU in serum of plasma and platelet culture medium was detected by an ELISA experiment. The vascular endothelial cells were cultured in vitro with 100 ng/mL of human recombinant CLU added to the medium. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were detected by CCK8, scratch, and Transwell invasion tests. The expression level of TLR3 and NF-κb p65 proteins in cells was detected by western blot. TLR3 knockout plasmids in vascular endothelial cell lines were transfected. Cell proliferation and migration were detected by CCK8 and the scratch assay. The CLU content in peripheral blood plasma and supernatant of platelet culture medium was significantly higher in the restenosis group than that of the control group (p=0.003) 6 months after operation (p=0.047) and 12 months after operation (p=0.011). When CLU was added to vascular endothelial cell culture medium, the proliferation and migration were significantly enhanced. The TLR3/NF-κb p65 protein expression level in cells also significantly increased. After the transfection of TLR3 knockout plasmids into vascular endothelial cell lines, CLU cannot promote the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells. Platelet-released clusterin can induce vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration by activating the TLR3/NF-kb p65 signaling pathway, leading to carotid artery restenosis after carotid endarterectomy.
