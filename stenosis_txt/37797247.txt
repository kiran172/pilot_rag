Title: Safety, Effectiveness, and Hemodynamic Performance of the Bovine Pericardium Organic Valvular Bioprosthesis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess actual data on the safety, effectiveness, and hemodynamic performance of Bovine Pericardium Organic Valvular Bioprosthesis (BVP).
METHODS: The BIOPRO Trial is an observational, retrospective, non-comparative, non-randomized, and multicenter study. We collected data from 903 patients with symptomatic, moderate, or severe valve disease who underwent BVP implants in the timeframe from 2013 to 2020 at three Brazilian institutions. Death, valve-related adverse events (AEs), functional recovery, and hemodynamic performance were evaluated at the hospital, at discharge, and six months and one year later. Primary analysis compared late (> 30 days after implant) linearized rates of valve-related AEs, such as thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, major hemorrhage, major paravalvular leak, and endocarditis, following objective performance criteria (OPC). Analysis was performed to include at least 400 valve-years for each valve position (aortic and mitral) for complete comparisons to OPC. Kaplan-Meier survival and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: This retrospective study analyzed follow-up data collected from 903 patients (834.2 late patient-years) who have undergone surgery for 455 isolated aortic valve replacement (50.4%), 382 isolated mitral valve replacement (42.3%), and 66 combined valve replacement or other intervention (7.3%). The linearized rates of valve-related AEs were < 2 × OPC. One-year survival rates were 95.1% and 92.7% for aortic and mitral valve replacement, respectively. This study demonstrated an improvement in the New York Heart Association classification from baseline and hemodynamic performance within an expected range.
CONCLUSION: According to this analysis, BVP meets world standards for safety and clinical efficacy.
