Title: Minimally invasive surgical aortic valve replacement through a right anterolateral thoracotomy.

Abstract: In the field of minimally invasive surgical aortic valve replacement, the right anterolateral minithoracotomy is an approach that offers very limited procedural trauma. Our method of right anterolateral minithoracotomy uses femoral percutaneous cannulation, a high-definition thoracoscope and a transthoracic cross-clamp. It allows a minimized skin incision and full preservation of the sternum, sternocostal cartilages, and ribs. The patient we present in this video tutorial is a low-risk male with severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis. We provide detailed insight into our preoperative planning and step-by-step guidance throughout the right anterolateral minithoracotomy aortic valve replacement procedure.
