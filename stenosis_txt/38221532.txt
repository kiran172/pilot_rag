Title: Screening patients requiring secondary lumbar surgery for degenerative lumbar spine diseases: a nationwide sample cohort study.

Abstract: This study aims to identify healthcare costs indicators predicting secondary surgery for degenerative lumbar spine disease (DLSD), which significantly impacts healthcare budgets. Analyzing data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) database of Republic of Korea (ROK), the study included 3881 patients who had surgery for lumbar disc herniation (LDH), lumbar spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis (LSS without SPL), lumbar spinal stenosis with spondylolisthesis (LSS with SPL), and spondylolysis (SP) from 2006 to 2008. Patients were categorized into two groups: those undergoing secondary surgery (S-group) and those not (NS-group). Surgical and interim costs were compared, with S-group having higher secondary surgery costs ($1829.59 vs $1618.40 in NS-group, P = 0.002) and higher interim costs ($30.03; 1.86% of initial surgery costs vs $16.09; 0.99% of initial surgery costs in NS-group, P < 0.0001). The same trend was observed in LDH, LSS without SPL, and LSS with SPL (P < 0.0001). Monitoring interim costs trends post-initial surgery can effectively identify patients requiring secondary surgery.
