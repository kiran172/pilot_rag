Title: A novel technique for invasive aortic valve pressure gradient measurement using a 6 Fr Swan-Ganz catheter: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Simultaneous left ventricular (LV) and aortic (Ao) pressure gradient assessment has been rendered challenging since the recall of the Langston catheter. Here we describe a simple method for simultaneous LV and Ao pressure gradient assessment using a Swan-Ganz catheter.
CASE SUMMARY: We describe two cases where assessment of simultaneous left ventricle and Ao valve gradients was done using a Swan-Ganz catheter to assess the degree of Ao stenosis and dynamic LV outflow obstruction.
DISCUSSION: Using Swan-Ganz catheter assessment of simultaneous left ventricle and Ao valve gradients can simplify the procedure with reduced cost and increased patient safety.
