Title: An Important Association With Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed: A Case of Heyde Syndrome.

Abstract: The association between aortic stenosis and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal bleed is known as Heyde syndrome. It was first described in 1958 and has since received further medical attention. We present a case of an 86-year-old lady with a history of severe aortic stenosis that was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to colonic angiodysplasia. A review of the literature showed mixed opinions with respect to the idea of causation versus coincidence; both theories are valid. However, studies that supported causation had a bigger study population and overall seem to be more plausible.
