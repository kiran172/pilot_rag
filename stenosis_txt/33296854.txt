Title: Circulating antioxidant vitamins and copper in Azorean coronary artery disease patients under preventive medication - A case study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Oxidative stress and inflammation are conditions that are deeply involved in atherosclerosis and consequent coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the relationship among circulating antioxidant vitamins (C, A, E), copper, and other pro- or antioxidant/inflammation markers in patients with and without CAD under preventive medication.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 174 Azorean subjects symptomatic for CAD (age 56 ± 9y; 68 % men) submitted to coronary angiography were split into 2 groups: one formed by CAD patients (≥50 % stenosis in at least one major coronary vessel) and the other by non-CAD patients (<50 % stenosis). Both groups were age-, sex- and BMI-matched. Plasma levels of vitamins or copper were measured by HPLC and AAS, respectively.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Lower vitamin C levels were observed in CAD patients (mainly in women, who exhibited a high rate of diabetes mellitus) as compared to the non-CAD ones. Also, CAD patients (mainly men) exhibited significantly higher concentrations of plasma copper than their non-CAD counterparts (1.17 ± 0.3 mg/L vs. 1.09 ± 0.3 mg/L, p = 0.030). In bivariate analysis, plasma copper levels were positively associated with serum LDL-cholesterol (r=0.22; p = 0.004) and chiefly with C-reactive protein (r=0.40; p < 0.001). Furthermore, they were significantly lower in recurrent vs. non recurrent CAD patients (1.07±0.2 vs. 1.24±0.3 mg/L, p = 0.004). ROC analysis showed that plasma copper, whenever >1.06 mg/L, was an independent risk factor for CAD in primary prevention for men, which suggests that its levels can fluctuate with medical therapy (such as anti-inflammatory), thus indicating that copper is not a reliable marker for CAD. Moreover, plasma copper concentration was not associated with CAD severity. Yet, results do suggest that, even within its reference concentration range, it could be useful as an acute inflammation marker in CAD management.
