Title: Outcomes of patients with active cancer undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the two leading causes of mortality worldwide, and their association presents a therapeutic challenge. Current data regarding the prognosis of active cancer in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement are conflicting.
AIM: To determine the impact and prognosis of active cancer in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: All consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis treated by transcatheter aortic valve replacement between February 2010 and May 2019 were enrolled in a prospective study. The cohort was divided according to the presence or absence of active cancer at baseline. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality 1 year after the procedure.
RESULTS: A total of 1,125 patients were enrolled: 1,037 (92.2%) without and 88 (7.8%) with active cancer. The most frequent cancers were haematological (36.4%), breast (14.8%) and prostate (14.8%), with 79.5% of patients receiving curative treatment and 17.0% receiving palliative treatment. The 1-year mortality rate was higher in patients with active cancer (27.3% vs. 13.9%; P<0.01), mainly driven by non-cardiovascular causes. An increased cardiovascular mortality rate at 2 years was seen in patients with active cancer (27.5% vs. 15.0%; P=0.03) compared with a similar rate at 1-year follow-up. Active cancer was a strong predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.46, 95% confidence interval 1.19-4.68; P=0.02). Major/life-threatening bleeding events at 1 year were more frequent in patients with active cancer (P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement, 1-year all-cause mortality is higher in those with active cancer. We also observed a trend towards increased long-term bleeding events in case of active cancer.
