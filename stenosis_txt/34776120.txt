Title: Relation of Preprocedure Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a novel inflammatory biomarker that has prognostic value in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) treats the inflammatory disease of aortic stenosis. However, the utility of preprocedure PLR in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after TAVI is not clear. Our study population included 470 patients who underwent TAVI at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia from August 2008, to January 2019. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on PLR quartiles. The incidence of 30-day MACE (a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death) was then compared. Outcomes were reported according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. Of 470 patients, median age 84 years, 54% men, and median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 3.5%, 14 (3%) suffered a MACE within 30 days. Rates of MACE were low in all 4 groups (1.7%, 2.5%, 2.6%, 5.1%, respectively) with no statistically significant difference in the different PLR groups (p = 0.46). This nonsignificant association was supported by univariate logistic regression analysis of PLR as a continuous variable (odds ratio 1.01, p = 0.55). Using multivariable logistic regression analysis accounting for age, gender, self-expanding valve, and procedural risk, a higher PLR did not correlate with MACE (odds ratio 1.01, p = 0.60). In this study of a large cohort of TAVI patients, elevated preprocedure PLR was not independently associated with MACE after TAVI. This is a novel finding in comparison with previous studies.
