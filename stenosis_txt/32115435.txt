Title: Robotic assisted carotid artery stenting for the treatment of symptomatic carotid disease: technical feasibility and preliminary results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Robotic-assisted endovascular interventions have been increasingly performed in the coronary and peripheral vascular beds. We aim to describe the feasibility and initial safety of a robotic-assisted platform for treating carotid artery disease.
METHODS: Single-center technical report of the first four consecutive cases of carotid artery stenting for the treatment of severe symptomatic carotid stenosis utilizing the CorPath GRX Robotic System (Corindus Inc, Waltham, MA).
RESULTS: Four patients (one in early 60s and three in early 70s; NASCET degree of stenosis: 88%, 77%, 83% and 82%) with ipsilateral strokes on presentation were treated. All steps of the procedure (including delivery/removal of micro-guidewire, emboli-protection system and angioplasty balloon) could be successfully performed robotically with the exception of navigation/deployment of the stents due to incompatibility with the current robotic platform. Technical success was achieved in all patients resulting in resolution of the stenosis without any complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted carotid artery stenting is technically feasible. Future studies are warranted to properly establish safety and benefits.
