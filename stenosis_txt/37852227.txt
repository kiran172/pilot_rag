Title: Effect of Perioperative Stroke on Survival After Carotid Intervention.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Perioperative stroke is the most dreaded complication of carotid artery interventions and can severely affect patients' quality of life. This study evaluated the impact of this event on mortality for patients undergoing interventional treatment of carotid artery stenosis with three different modalities.
METHODS: Patients undergoing carotid revascularization at participating Memorial Hermann Health System facilities were captured from 2003-2022. These patients were treated with either carotid endarterectomy (CEA), transfemoral carotid stenting (TF-CAS), or transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR). Perioperative outcomes, including stroke and mortality, as well as follow-up survival data at 6-month intervals, were analyzed and stratified per treatment modality.
RESULTS: Of the 1681 carotid revascularization patients identified, 992 underwent CEA (59.0%), 524 underwent TCAR (31.2%), and 165 underwent TF-CAS (9.8%). The incidence of stroke was 2.1% (CEA 2.1%, TCAR 1.7%, and TF-CAS 3.6%; P = .326). The perioperative (30-day) death rate was 2.1% (n = 36). The perioperative death rate was higher in patients who suffered from an intraoperative stroke than in those who did not (8.3% vs 1.9%, P = .007). Perioperative death was also different between CEA, TCAR, and TF-CAS for patients who had an intraoperative stroke (.0% vs 33.3% vs .0%, P = .05). TCAR patients were likely to be older (P &lt; .001), have a higher body mass index (P &lt; .001), and have diabetes mellitus (P &lt; .001). Patients who suffered from an intraoperative stroke were more likely to have a symptomatic carotid lesion (58.3% vs 28.8%, P &lt; .001). The TCAR group had a significantly lower survival at 6 months and 12 months when compared to the other two groups (64.9% vs 100% P = .007).
CONCLUSION: Perioperative stroke during carotid interventions significantly impacts early patient survival with otherwise no apparent change in mid-term outcomes at 5 years. This difference appears to be even more significant in patients undergoing TCAR, possibly due to their baseline higher-risk profile and lower functional reserve.
