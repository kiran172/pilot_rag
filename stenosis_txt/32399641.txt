Title: Long-term Kinetic Papilledema Improvement After Venous Sinus Stenting in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of lateral sinus stenosis (LSS) stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) who are refractory to medical treatment, particularly focusing on visual outcomes including papilledema.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of consecutive patients with IIH refractory to medical treatment who underwent LSS stenting. Clinical features, visual fields and optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) thicknesses were assessed before stenting, at 1 month poststenting and at last follow-up. Complications were also recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 16 women were included, with a mean age of 39 ± 11 years. All patients had papilledema while 15/16 (94%) had headaches. Mean visual acuity was 0.036 logMAR, range (+0.4 to +0.0 logMAR). The mean RNFL thickness prior to stenting was 121.7 µm (±34.7 µm) and mean GCL thickness was 80.2 µm (±8.9 µm). Mean follow-up was 19.7 months (±11.8 months). After stenting, acetazolamide was discontinued in 15/16 (94%) patients. Papilledema improved in 14/16 (88%) of patients. The mean RNFL thickness was significantly decreased 1 month after stenting (96.3 ± 15.6 µm; p < 0.001) and at last visit (93.4 ± 15.3 µm; p < 0.001). The GCL thickness after LSS stenting was moderately decreased at the last visit examination: 80.2 ± 8.9 µm vs. 78.0 ± 10.7 µm; (p < 0.01). No stent-related complication occurred, while there was one case of restenosis.
CONCLUSION: Improvement of papilledema appears to occur relatively rapidly after the LSS stenting. The results further support the role of LSS stenting in the treatment of IIH, especially with respect to visual symptoms.
