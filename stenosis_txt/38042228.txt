Title: Functionally unicuspid aortic valve in an adult: Case report and literature review.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is one of the most prevalent cardiac valvular diseases throughout the world and has a significant impact on quality of life. While there are several etiologies, we will be discussing the case of a male in his mid-thirties of southeast Asian descent with a bicuspid aortic valve which was found to be functionally unicuspid and complicated by aortic dilation. Following a comprehensive review of literature, it appears this subset of aortic stenosis is not commonly encountered. In addition to presenting this fascinating case, we will review the epidemiology, classification and management of aortic stenosis. Furthermore, we will examine the latest evidence-based literature on bicuspid aortic valve and unicuspid aortic valve and discuss interventions and diagnostic tools that may improve clinical prognosis.
