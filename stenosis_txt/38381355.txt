Title: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in India and its electrocardiography (ECG) comparison to myocardial infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Owing to the limited research on Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TCM) in Asia, we aim to evaluate in detail the clinical profiles, lab parameters, investigations, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) seen in patients with TCM in the Indian subcontinent. Additionally, we have compared the electrocardiographic findings of patients with TCM to those of patients with myocardial infarction (MI).
RESULTS: The average age of the patients affected was found to be 60 ± 11 years. Women (87.5%) and patients with hypertension (40%) were found to be at an increased risk of developing the syndrome. The most common presenting symptom was dyspnea (48%) following a trigger most commonly emotional (45%). ST elevation and significant T wave inversions were observed in 40% of patients with TCM. Echocardiography revealed a low left ventricular ejection fraction of 43 ± 9%. Coronary angiography was normal in 60%, the rest had mild/subcritical stenoses. The 6-month MACE was 20% and the mortality rate was 7.5%. Follow-up echocardiography of patients with TCM showed improvement in EF in 75% patients.
CONCLUSIONS: TCM was majorly seen in postmenopausal women following an emotional trigger, but a variety of other triggers were noted. T-wave inversions in TCM follow a diffuse pattern in contrast to specific leads seen in MI. Normal or subcritical stenosis in coronaries at presentation, along with a low EF which improves on follow up provide greater evidence for the diagnosis of TCM.
