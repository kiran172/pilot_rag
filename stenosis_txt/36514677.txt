Title: Computed tomography angiography in the planning of transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a step-by-step approach.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis is the most common acquired valvular heart disease. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation, also known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), is an important treatment option for symptomatic aortic stenosis in patients at any level of surgical risk. The role of computed tomography angiography (CTA) has expanded considerably in recent years, and it has now become the imaging method of choice for the planning of TAVR. Therefore, radiologists should understand the main aspects of this imaging modality, including the appropriate technique and protocol to acquire reliable CTA images and to create a useful radiology report. The aim of this study was to review the most important aspects of CTA for TAVR planning.
