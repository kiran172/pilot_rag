Title: [Analysis of the therapeutic effect of aspiration thrombectomy for early carotid stent thrombosis].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and the efficacy of thrombus aspiration in patients with early intrastent thrombosis (EST) following carotid artery stenting (CAS). Methods: This study is a retrospective case series, collecting clinical data of five patients who developed EST after CAS in the Department of Neurosurgery, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2021 to September 2023.All patients were male, with an age of (64.0Â±11.9) years (range:48 to 77 years), accounting for 2.0% (5/244) of CAS procedures during the same period.Among them, three patients did not receive standard dual antiplatelet therapy before the procedure, and one had an inadequate ADP inhibition rate (45.6%).Four patients received XACT carotid stents, while one received a Wallstent carotid stent.All five patients showed significant residual stenosis ranging from 43% to 55% after CAS.Emergency thrombus aspiration was performed in all cases, and data regarding perioperative conditions, vascular patency, and clinical outcomes were collected. Results: The interval between CAS and the occurrence of EST ranged from 3 hours to 14 days.The main clinical symptoms included sudden onset of consciousness disorders and contralateral limb weakness.None of the patients received preoperative intravenous thrombolysis, and thrombus aspiration was performed during the procedure to restore vascular patency.Four cases underwent balloon angioplasty during the procedure, and two cases utilized overlapping stents.Two patients experienced intraoperative embolization of thrombus to the C<sub>2</sub> segment.In one case, the embolized thrombus was retrieved using an intracranial thrombectomy stent, while in another case, it was aspirated using a guiding catheter.Postoperatively, all patients had a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade of 3, and symptoms improved in four cases.One patient showed no improvement in symptoms, and MRI revealed extensive new infarction in the right frontal and insular regions, adjacent to the right lateral ventricle.Regular follow-up examinations after discharge did not reveal restenosis or embolism within the stent.The follow-up period ranged from 7.6 to 21.2 months, with modified Rankin scale scores of 0 to 1 point in four cases and 2 points in one case, indicating good recovery in all patients. Conclusions: Acute intrastent thrombosis is a rare complication after carotid artery stenting.The combined use of percutaneous thrombus aspiration and endovascular techniques, such as balloon angioplasty and stent overlapping, can rapidly restore vessel patency with favorable outcomes.However, further large-scale clinical studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of these treatments for acute intrastent thrombosis.
