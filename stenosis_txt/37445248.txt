Title: Assessing the Novel Myval Balloon-Expandable Valve with the Evolut Valve: A Propensity-Matched Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Myval balloon-expandable (BE) valve has shown encouraging early clinical data in terms of safety and efficacy. Comparative data with other well-established contemporary valves are nonetheless still scarce. This study aims to compare the performance of the Myval BE valve with the Evolut self-expanding (SE) valve.
METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, 223 patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) were included and treated with the Myval BE valve (n = 120) or with the Evolut SE valve (n = 103). Then, 91 pairs were compared after matching. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at 30 days and 1 year. Echocardiographic follow-up was performed at 30 days.
RESULTS: Procedural complications were rare in both groups. At the 30-day follow-up, no significant difference in cardiac death (Myval: 1% vs. Evolut: 2%, p = 0.56), stroke (2% vs. 4%, p = 0.41) and myocardial infarction (1% vs. 3%, p = 0.31) was observed. A permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) was significantly less needed in the Myval group (4% vs. 15%, p = 0.01). At 1 year, cardiac death (2% vs. 4%, p = 0.41) and the stroke rate (7% vs. 5%, p = 0.76) were similar. Moderate-severe paravalvular leakage (PVL) was also comparable in both groups (1% vs. 4%, p = 0.17).
CONCLUSION: Safety and efficacy outcomes were comparable between the two valves, except for a higher PPI rate for the Evolut SE valve. Up to 1-year follow-up, clinical outcomes showed acceptable rates of stroke and cardiac death with both valves. Valve hemodynamics were excellent with a low rate of moderate-severe PVL in both groups.
