Title: Management of Central Venous Stenoses and Occlusions.

Abstract: Symptomatic central venous stenosis and occlusion remains the gordian knot of vascular access. Advances in techniques, like sharp recanalization, allowed for improved success rates in crossing these difficult lesions. There is also increasing evidence of new devices in treating central venous stenosis and, at the same time, improving the time needed between interventions. High-pressure balloons, paclitaxel-coated balloons, bare metal stents and covered stents have been tested with an aim to offer additional treatment options, although obstacles still exist. In the current review, authors describe relevant techniques and options, provide the evidence and evaluate the actual implementation of these devices in this demanding field.
