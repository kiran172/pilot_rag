Title: The COVID-19 Pandemic Surge and Impact on Rheumatic Valvular Heart Disease Patient Care.

Abstract: The COVID-19 crisis has surged worldwide, putting immense stress on the health care services, leading to institutions deferring elective procedures and struggling to triage the emergency care of cardiac patients. This has affected the management of the rheumatic valvular heart disease patients especially, in developing countries, potentially placing these patients at enormous risk for complications like congestive cardiac failure, stroke and death. This article explores the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on rheumatic valvular heart disease patient care. We try to provide a framework that addresses the procedural considerations of interventions like percutaneous transluminal mitral commissurotomy (PTMC), mitral and aortic valve surgeries. This article also highlights the implications for the outpatient valve clinic, and safety issues of the patient and health care workers during this ongoing pandemic.
