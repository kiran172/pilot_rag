Title: Pregnancy in a Rare and Acquired Mitral Stenosis Different from Rheumatic Mitral Involvement: Mitral Ring Mismatch.

Abstract: There is an increasing incidence of diagnosing both congenital and acquired heart valve diseases in women during pregnancy. Factors such as elevated rates of pregnancy, older maternal age, and coexisting conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity contribute significantly to the symptomatic manifestation and detection of valvular heart diseases in women planning for pregnancy. Pregnancy induces cardiovascular changes across the maternal physiology, posing a heightened risk of morbidity and mortality, especially in women afflicted with valvular heart diseases. In this article, we present a case of a 25-year-old patient who underwent mitral ring annuloplasty surgery at the age of 9. Her echocardiography revealed a mismatch of the mitral ring during a follow-up examination at the age of 20. Despite neglecting further follow-ups, the patient became pregnant and presented to us at the 6th week of pregnancy. She underwent evaluations at the 6th, 10th, and 22nd weeks of pregnancy, as well as before delivery. Following the resumption of follow-up appointments, intervention planning was initiated during the postpartum period. This case exemplifies successful management, resulting in a healthy delivery after navigating through the pregnancy.
