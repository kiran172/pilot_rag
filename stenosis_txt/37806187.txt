Title: Prognostic Implication of Pulmonary Hypertension in Low-Flow Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Prognostic implications of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in low-flow low-gradient (LG) aortic stenosis (AS) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unexplored. We aimed to investigate the impact of baseline and changes in PH after TAVR. In this single-center retrospective study, we included patients who underwent TAVR for low-flow LG AS. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: baseline pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) <46 mm Hg (no-to-mild PH) and PASP ≥46 mm Hg (moderate-to-severe PH). On the basis of changes in PASP after TAVR, patients were stratified into increased (ΔPASP ≥ + 5 mm Hg), no change (-4 to +4 mm Hg), and decreased (≤ -5 mm Hg) groups. Primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalization. In total, 210 patients were included, 148 in the no-to-mild PH group and 62 in the moderate-to-severe PH group. Median follow-up was 13.2 months. The moderate-to-severe PH group was at an increased risk of composite end point (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8 to 6.9), all-cause mortality (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.6), and heart failure rehospitalization (HR 8.3, 95% CI 2.9 to 23.7). There were no differences in clinical outcomes among those with increased (32%), no change (28%), and decreased (39%) PASP after TAVR. In conclusion, moderate-to-severe PH at baseline is an independent predictor of worse clinical outcomes in patients with low-flow LG AS who undergo TAVR, and this cohort of patients do not seem to derive the benefits of postoperative reduction of PASP.
