Title: Aortic Valve Replacement and Exclusion of Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm With Balloon-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve.

Abstract: An 85-year-old female with severe aortic valve stenosis presented with heart failure complicated with cardiogenic shock and was found to have a right coronary cusp sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. We report the first case of successful exclusion of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm during transcatheter aortic valve replacement using a balloon-expandable valve. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
