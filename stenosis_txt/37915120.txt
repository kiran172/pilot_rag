Title: Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography in bacterial meningitis: A systematic review.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Bacterial meningitis remains a global threat due to its high mortality. It is estimated that >1.2 million cases of bacterial meningitis are reported annually. Intracranial vasculopathy is an important, under-documented complication, easily detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography. Following the PRISMA Guidelines, we reviewed the utility of TCD in bacterial meningitis.
METHODS: This is a systematic review of observational studies on the use of TCD in patients with CSF-proven bacterial meningitis. Characteristic changes in TCD parameters along the course of the disease, correlation of TCD findings with neuroimaging, and functional outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included with a total of 492 participants (mean age of 42). The most common TCD finding was intracranial arterial stenosis of the MCA (50%-82%) and ischemia (33%) was the predominant neuroimaging finding. The presence of an abnormal TCD finding increased the risk of poor outcomes as high as 70%.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis who underwent TCD show alterations in cerebral blood flow, correlating with imaging findings and poor outcomes. It aids in the diagnosis of its sequelae and can predict the prognosis of its outcome. TCD is a cost-effective, reliable modality for diagnosing vasculopathy associated with bacterial meningitis. It may prove useful in our armamentarium of management. Large prospective studies with long-term follow-up data may help establish the use of TCD in bacterial meningitis.
