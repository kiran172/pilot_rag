Title: Additional balloon aortic valvuloplasty to overcome the difficult removal of a self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve system due to valve infolding.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a well-established treatment for severe aortic stenosis. Advances in the devices used and operators' technique have reduced the frequency of complications. However, valve infolding is a rare but serious outcome after the implantation of self-expanding prostheses. We report a case of a successful bailout of a device that was difficult to remove because of valve infolding. TAVR using a 26â€‰mm Evolut PRO+ system (Medtronic) was planned for a 91-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis. After the valve was deployed in a satisfactory position on the second release, the system could not be removed because the nose cone was hooked to the basal frame of the deployed valve. To overcome this situation, an additional balloon was inserted from the contralateral femoral side and inflated, and we extracted the system successfully by pulling out the device while simultaneously deflating the balloon. Postoperative computed tomography revealed valve infolding, which was considered to cause the difficulty in system removal. Infoldings of self-expandable prostheses should be considered when faced with difficulty in removing the catheter system, and the method elucidated in this case report can be effective to manage it.
