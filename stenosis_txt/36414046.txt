Title: Relationship between sexual differences and cardiovascular risk factors in the prevalence of asymptomatic coronary disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study investigated the sexual differences of coronary artery disease (CAD) prevalence and its association with cardiovascular risk factors in the asymptomatic population.
METHODS: In total 6434 asymptomatic participants without known CAD (1740 women and 4694 men) underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). The prevalence of significant CAD (diameter stenosis ≥50%) and other CCTA findings were compared by sex, and its influence on CAD was investigated in groups stratified by the number of cardiovascular risk factors, including age (>55 years), hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and current smoking.
RESULTS: The prevalence of current smokers, hypertension, and diabetes were higher in men than women. The mean coronary artery calcium score was 13.1 ± 58.4 for women and 51.1 ± 158.2 for men; the coronary atherosclerosis burden indices were significantly higher in men than women. Significant CAD was identified in 65 women (3.7%) and 429 men (9.1%), showing a significant association (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.38, P < 0.001). The relatively higher risk for significant CAD in men was observed in patients with fewer risk factors, and the risk difference was not significant in patients with many risk factors (adjusted ORs: 7.69, 3.37, 1.71, 1.31, and 0.88 in patients with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4-5 risk factors, respectively). The association between sex and risk factor groups was significant (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the asymptomatic population, a significantly higher CAD prevalence was noted in men than women. However, women with a high number of cardiovascular risk factors showed a CAD prevalence similar to that of men.
