Title: 3D Simulation Analysis of Central Shunt in Patient-Specific Hemodynamics: Effects of Varying Degree of Pulmonary Artery Stenosis and Shunt Diameters.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to compare the effects of different shunt diameters and pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis grades on the hemodynamics of central shunts to determine an optimal surgical plan and improve the long-term outcomes of the operation. A 3D anatomical model was reconstructed based on the patient's clinical CT data. 3D computational fluid dynamics models were built with varying degrees of stenosis (the stenosis ratio α was represented by the ratio of blood flow through the main pulmonary artery to cardiac output, ranging from 0 to 30%; the smaller the value of α, the more severe the pulmonary artery stenosis) and varying shunt diameters (3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 5 mm). Our results show that the asymmetry of pulmonary artery flow increased with increasing shunt diameter and α, which will be more conducive to the development of the left pulmonary artery. Additionally, the pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Q <sub>P</sub>/Q <sub>S</sub>) increases with the shunt diameter and α, and all the values exceed 1. When the shunt diameter is 3 mm and α = 0%, Q <sub>P</sub>/Q <sub>S</sub> reaches the minimum value of 1.01, and the oxygen delivery reaches the maximum value of 205.19 ml/min. However, increasing shunt diameter and α is beneficial to reduced power loss and smoother PA flow. In short, for patients with severe PA stenosis (α is small), a larger-diameter shunt may be preferred. Conversely, when the degree of PA stenosis is moderate, a smaller shunt diameter can be considered.
