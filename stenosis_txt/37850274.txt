Title: [Long-term results of ureteral replacement using small bowel in patients with long strictures: 9-years single-center experience].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: When reconstructing long ureteral strictures, the optimal substitution material is reconfigured pelvis or bladder flaps. However, it is not always possible to use them due to involvement in the pathological process or insufficient length to replace the defect. In such cases, substitution of the ureter by ileal segment is successfully used.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients, 10 men (40%) and 15 women (60%), who undergone to reconstructive procedure during the period from 2012 to 2021 with a follow-up period of at least 6 months (mean 51.26 months) were included in the retrospective analysis. Additionally, a comparative analysis was carried out between the laparoscopic and open access according to a set of criteria. The endpoints in the study were the functional state of the kidneys, repeated procedures and development of metabolic disorders.
RESULTS: The average length of the stricture was 10.7 cm (5-20 cm). Eleven patients underwent open approach (44%), while in 14 cases laparoscopic approach was used (56%). Primary procedure was performed in 16 (64%) patients, repeated intervention due to stricture recurrence was performed in 7 (28%) cases, and two patients (8%) underwent bowel substitution of the ureter, implanted into the ileal conduit after radical cystectomy. The average duration of the procedure was 240 min (Q1-186 min, Q3-307 min). For laparoscopic access it was 230 min (Q1-186 min, Q3-292 min) compared to 240 min (Q1-202 min, Q3- 312 min) for open access. Complications of the Clavien I grade developed in 5 cases (20%). With a minimally invasive approach, the length of stay in hospital was 6 days (5-6), including 0.7 days (0-1) in the intensive care unit. The average number of drains after laparoscopic procedure was 1.3 (0-2), and the drains were removed in average after 4.4 days (3-5). With open access, the median length of stay was 8 (5-11), including 2 days (1-5) in the intensive care unit. The number of drains was 1.6 (1-2), and the drains were removed in average after 4 days (3-5). Thirteen patients were undergone to follow-up examination until discharge. Regression of dilatation of the pelvicaliceal system was noted in 12 patients (92.3%). Among them, renal function stabilized in 8 (61.5%), improved in 4 (30.8%) and deteriorated in 1 case (7.7%). Clinically significant metabolic acidosis was detected in 1 patient (7.7%).
CONCLUSION: Substitution of the ureter by ileal segment showed satisfactory results in long-term follow-up.
