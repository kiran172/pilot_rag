Title: Treatment of chronic lateral ankle instability by double-band anatomical reconstruction of the anterior talofibular ligament's fibular enthesis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) injury is one of the most common injuries in sports medicine, resulting in chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI). The patients' daily life may be seriously affected by ankle osteoarthritis and other irreversible damages, if the ATFL injury is not treated in time and drags on. Patients with ATFL injury who show no significant recovery after 3-6 months of conservative treatment should consider surgical treatment as soon as possible to restore ankle stability and function. This study aims to investigate the effect of double-bands anatomical reconstruction of the ATFL's fibular enthesis for the treatment of CLAI.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 67 patients diagnosed with CLAI in the Department of Sports Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from January 2015 to January 2018, including 42 males and 25 females, aged from 17 to 41 years old, with disease course of (12.6±3.2) months. Of the 67 patients, 29 left ankles and 38 right ankles were included in this study. Patients suffered from repeated sprains which leaded to pain, swelling and obvious ankle relaxation. There were obvious tenderness at the ATFL insertion and the calcaneal fibular ligament insertion. Both the anterior ankle drawer test and the varus stress test were positive. Other ankle disorders were excluded by X-ray. Preoperative color Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance examination were performed to observe ATFL injury. All the patients had surgical indications and no obvious contraindications, and they were treated with arthroscopic debridement and double-bundle anatomical reconstruction of the AFTL's fibular enthesis under anesthesia. Postoperative routine nursing and standardized rehabilitation exercise were recommended. Outpatient follow-up was conducted at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, Karlsson Ankle Functional (KAF) score, and the Japanese Society for Surgery of the Foot (JSSF) scale were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Intraoperative arthroscopic examination of 67 patients showed inflammatory synovial hyperplasia in 52 cases (77.6%), obvious osteophyte hyperplasia in 12 cases (17.9%), talus osteochondral injury of grade II-III in 23 cases (34.3%), and cartilage injury of grade IV in 5 cases (7.5%). All operations were carried out successfully, and both the anterior ankle drawer test and the varus stress test were negative under anesthesia after surgery. The anchors were in good position. Among them, 3 patients (4.5%) got temporary superficial peroneal nerve palsy and skin numbness at ankle joint after surgery, which gradually recovered within 2 weeks. There were no serious perioperative complications such as infection and suppurative arthritis. Postoperative follow-up was conducted for 12-24 (15.64±3.17) months. At the last follow-up, all patients were walking normally. Most patients had no pain or occasionally mild pain. Ankle function and motion were restored without re-instability. Sixty-four patients (95.5%) worked and exercised as before the surgery. Standing X-ray examination indicated normal joint space without stenosis, and the internal fixation was in good position. Postoperative AOFAS scores (94.78±6.37) were significantly better than the preoperative scores (64.17±12.43, P&lt;0.01). Besides, the KAF scores and the JSSF ankle/hindfoot scale before surgery were significantly increased (KAF: 91.04±11.36 vs 59.74±13.63, P&lt;0.01; JSSF: 95.32±10.21 vs 66.92±14.38, P&lt;0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic debridement and double-bands anatomical reconstruction of the ATFL's fibular enthesis for the treatment of CLAI gains beneficial short-term effects for its minimal invasion and quick recovery.
