Title: Epidural steroids following percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) has been widely used in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation and spinal stenosis, epidural steroids following PEID in an effort to reduce the incidence and duration of postoperative pain. Although steroids are widely thought to reduce the effect of surgical trauma, the observation index is not uniform, so the issue is still controversial. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of local epidural steroids application following PEID.
METHODS: We will search the following databases from their inception to August 2020, PubMed, Embase, Medline, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Web of Science, Wan Fang Database, Cochrane Library. The search strategy includes the MeSH terms. Meta-analysis will be performed using Rev Man V.5.3.5 statistical software.
RESULTS: This study will provide a high-quality synthesis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of local epidural steroids following PEID.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review will provide evidence to judge whether local epidural steroids application following PEID is an effective and safe intervention for patients. It will provide reliable evidence for its extensive application.
