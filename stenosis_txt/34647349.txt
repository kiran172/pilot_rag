Title: Long-term laryngotracheal complications following cardiac surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Long-term laryngotracheal complications have not been described in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for laryngotracheal complications following cardiac surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients at high risk for laryngotracheal complications following cardiac surgery between 2006 and 2016 was performed. High-risk patients were reviewed to determine the presence of laryngotracheal complications including laryngotracheal stenosis, keyhole deformity, or vocal cord immobility. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of long-term laryngotracheal complications.
RESULTS: Of 11,417 patients who underwent cardiac surgery, 1099 were identified as at high risk. Of these, 24 (2.2%) developed laryngotracheal complications following their surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Laryngotracheal stenosis and keyhole deformity were present in 13 (1.2%) and 6 (0.5%) patients, respectively. Logistic regression demonstrated older age (age ≥ 70 odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.83) was protective, while readmission to ICU for ventilation (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.17-8.25) and receiving a tracheostomy (OR 7.83, 95% CI 2.22-27.6) were associated with laryngotracheal complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of long-term laryngotracheal complications following cardiac surgery was 2.2%. Readmission to ICU for ventilation and having a tracheostomy performed were associated with laryngotracheal complications.
