Title: Pulmonary artery anastomosis during lung transplantation: a novel technique.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery anastomosis (PAA) is a critical step in lung transplantation. The conventional approach involves end-to-end anastomosis, which can lead to arterial tortuosity, oozing, stenosis, and thrombosis. Here, we present a modified PAA technique for lung transplantation. The anesthesia protocol and the incision for lung transplantation adhere to standard lung transplantation protocols. The primary innovation is the enhanced pulmonary anastomosis technique. The donor and recipient artery stumps are adjusted to restore their natural anatomical alignment. The donor-recipient stump is everted, ensuring precise alignment of the intima of the donor and recipient arteries. Both ends of the anastomosis are secured using 5-0 Prolene sutures to ensure stability and traction, followed by continuous suturing. In this study, seven patients underwent PAA using this novel technique. Notably, no bleeding was observed upon unveiling and deaerating the anastomosis, eliminating the need for additional sutures. Furthermore, no pulmonary artery torsion or significant prolongation of the anastomotic procedure was observed. Postoperative computed tomography of the chest revealed no anastomotic stenosis or mural thrombosis. This novel cuff anastomosis technique can reduce the risk of thrombosis and prevent torsion and stenosis in the reconstructed artery.
