Title: MicroRNA-375-3p is implicated in carotid artery stenosis by promoting the cell proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is the main cause of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) which mostly occurs in the elderly. In this paper, the expression level of miR-375-3p in asymptomatic CAS patients and its diagnostic value for asymptomatic CAS were investigated, and the effects of miR-375-3p on the cell proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was further explored.
METHODS: 98 healthy subjects and 101 asymptomatic CAS patients were participated in this study. qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression level of serum miR-375-3p, and the ROC curve was established to evaluate the predictive value of miR-375-3p for asymptomatic CAS. After transfection with miR-375-3p mimic or inhibitor in vitro, cell proliferation and migration were detected by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and Transwell assay, respectively. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 were detected by ELISA. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of XIAP. Finally, luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to assess the interaction of miR-375-3p with target genes.
RESULTS: The expression level of serum miR-375-3p in asymptomatic CAS patients was significantly higher than that in healthy controls, and the AUC value of ROC curve was 0.888. The sensitivity and specificity were 80.2 and 86.7%, respectively, indicating that miR-375-3p had high diagnostic value for asymptomatic CAS. In vitro cell experiments showed that up-regulation of miR-375-3p significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of VSMCs, and also promoted the generation of inflammatory factors and phenotypic transformation of VSMCs. Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that XIAP was a target gene of miR-375-3p and was negatively regulated by miR-375-3p.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, miR-375-3p may have a clinical diagnostic value for asymptomatic CAS patients which need further validation. Increased miR-375-3p levels in CAS may be associated with increased proliferation and migration of VSMCs via downregulation of the apoptosis inducing gene XIAP.
