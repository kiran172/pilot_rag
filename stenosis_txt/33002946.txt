Title: Valvular Heart Disease in Pregnancy.

Abstract: The number of reproductive age women with valvular heart disease is rising and accounts for one third of all heart disease among pregnant women. Severe, symptomatic left-sided cardiac lesions, particularly mitral and aortic stenosis, and mechanical heart valves, are associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Decreasing maternal and fetal risk requires shared decision-making among patients and the heart team, consisting of obstetricians, maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists, and cardiologists.
