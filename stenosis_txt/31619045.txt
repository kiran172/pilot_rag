Title: Surgical options in rheumatic heart disease: an Indian surgeon's perspective.

Abstract: Rheumatic heart disease is the primary cause of valvular heart disease in India and other Southeast Asian countries. The disease is quite different from that seen in France, USA, and Australia. Poverty, malnutrition, and delayed referral affect the outcomes. Rheumatic heart disease can affect all four heart valves, mitral being the most common, aortic second, tricuspid next, and finally the pulmonary valve. The combinations of mitral and aortic, mitral and tricuspid, and all three valves are the next in frequency. Acute rheumatic fever usually manifests as quadrivalvular involvement. However, chronic rheumatic quadrivalvular heart disease has also been reported. The technical aspects taught and practiced in one institution over the past four decades are described here. Closed mitral valvotomy, mitral valve repair, or replacement with mechanical, bioprosthetic, and autograft valves are the choices. Aortic valve disease is usually treated with valve repair or replacement with mechanical, homograft or pulmonary autograft valves.
