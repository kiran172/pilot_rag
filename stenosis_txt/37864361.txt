Title: Effect of Intralesional Steroid Injections Among Patients with Acquired Laryngotracheal Stenosis Undergoing Endoscopic Balloon Dilation Using Pulmonary Function Tests.

Abstract: Objectives: Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) is characterized by an abnormal decrease in the upper airway diameter. The pulmonary function test (PFT) is an effective adjunctive diagnostic tool for upper airway obstruction. LTS can be managed with either open surgery or less invasive endoscopic approaches, among which endoscopic balloon dilation is the main method; this may include concurrent intralesional steroid injection (ILSI), which has the potential of improving the outcomes. However, the effectiveness of ILSI is unclear. We aimed to compare the improvement in PFT parameters among patients with acquired LTS following endoscopic balloon dilation who received and did not receive ILSIs. We also compared the recurrence times and rates between the 2 patient cohorts. Methods: We retrospectively collected data regarding pre- and postoperative PFTs, as well as inter-dilation interval records, obtained between June 2015 and April 2020. Results: We included 34 patients with acquired etiologies. The most common cause of stenosis was intubation (52.9%), followed by trauma (29.4%). Further, 52.9% of the patients received ILSIs. Symptom recurrence was reported in 23 (67.6%) cases, with no significant between-group difference -0.1389 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.4483, 0.1705]. The mean (standard deviation) duration of the first reintervention was 8.62 (8.00) and 7.38 (3.20) months among patients who did and did not receive ILSIs, respectively (mean difference -1.23, P = .614, 95% CI -6.30, 3.84). Conclusion: Our findings indicated that PFT parameters improved following endoscopic balloon dilation, with forced expiratory volume in 1 second being significantly higher with concurrent ILSI. However, there was no between-method difference in the treatment effectiveness. Additionally, the restenosis recurrence rate was consistent with that reported in the literature.
