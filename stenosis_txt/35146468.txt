Title: Cardiac CT angiography in current practice: An American society for preventive cardiology clinical practice statement✰.

Abstract: In this clinical practice statement, we represent a summary of the current evidence and clinical applications of cardiac computed tomography (CT) in evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD), from an expert panel organized by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC), and appraises the current use and indications of cardiac CT in clinical practice. Cardiac CT is emerging as a front line non-invasive diagnostic test for CAD, with evidence supporting the clinical utility of cardiac CT in diagnosis and prevention. CCTA offers several advantages beyond other testing modalities, due to its ability to identify and characterize coronary stenosis severity and pathophysiological changes in coronary atherosclerosis and stenosis, aiding in early diagnosis, prognosis and management of CAD. This document further explores the emerging applications of CCTA based on functional assessment using CT derived fractional flow reserve, peri‑coronary inflammation and artificial intelligence (AI) that can provide personalized risk assessment and guide targeted treatment. We sought to provide an expert consensus based on the latest evidence and best available clinical practice guidelines regarding the role of CCTA as an essential tool in cardiovascular prevention - applicable to risk assessment and early diagnosis and management, noting potential areas for future investigation.
