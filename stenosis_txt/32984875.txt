Title: Long-term results of large-calibre expanded polytetrafluoroethylene-valved conduits with bulging sinuses.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In Japan, homograft and bovine jugular vein are available in very limited institutions for the reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, and handmade expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-valved conduits have been widely used instead. This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes and the durability of the ePTFE-valved conduits purely by narrowing down to those with large sizes to eliminate the influence of the body growth.
METHODS: Between January 2002 and December 2015, patients who underwent right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction in 34 Japanese institutions using ePTFE-valved conduits with a diameter of ≥18 mm were included. All the valved conduits were made in the authors' institution and delivered to each participating institution.
RESULTS: Overall, 502 patients were included. Early mortality was 1.4% and not related to conduit failure. The overall survival rate was 98.2% at 5 years and 96.6% at 10 years. Freedom from conduit explantation was 99.5% at 5 years and 89.0% at 10 years. Three patients (0.13 per 100 patient-years) developed infective endocarditis of the conduit, and only 1 patient required conduit removal. Pulmonary insufficiency was mild or less in 480 (96%) patients, and conduit stenosis was mild or less in 436 (88%) patients at the latest follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: By narrowing the analyses down to only ePTFE conduits with a large size, satisfactory long-term outcomes of these conduits with a fan-shaped valve and bulging sinuses were shown. These conduits would be among the optimal choices for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction.
