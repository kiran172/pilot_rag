Title: Blood haemoglobin, renal insufficiency, fractional flow reserve and plasma NT-proBNP is associated with index of microcirculatory resistance in chronic coronary syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMVD) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome. We aimed to determine the prevalence of CMVD and factors related to index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) in consecutive patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) undergoing elective coronary angiography.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Non-interventional physicians enrolled 274 patients with CCS before angiography, to minimize selection bias by PCI-operators. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) and IMR were measured in the LAD. Subjects with extensively diseased LAD, no measures due to technical reasons or violation of protocol were excluded from the analysis (n = 54). The proportion of patients with IMR corrected for collateral flow (IMR<sub>corr</sub>) &gt;25 units was 25% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19%-31%) in all 220 patients. In subjects with FFR ≤0.80 in the LAD the proportion of IMR<sub>corr</sub> &gt; 25 units was 21% (95% CI 13%-30%) as compared to subjects with FFR &gt;0.80, 29% (95% CI 21%-36%), p = .268. Haemoglobin (p &lt; .005; r2 = 0.084), FFR in the LAD (p = .001; r2 = 0.049), creatinine clearance (p = .001; r2 = 0.049; inversely), and NT-proBNP (p = .038; r2 = 0.021) were independently associated with IMR<sub>corr</sub> in multivariate linear regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We report that IMR<sub>corr</sub> is associated with renal dysfunction, NT-proBNP, FFR in the LAD and, for the first time, blood haemoglobin. One in four of patients referred for coronary angiography due to CCS have CMVD defined as IMR<sub>corr</sub> &gt; 25 in the LAD.
