Title: Interventional Treatment of Budd-Chiari Syndrome.

Abstract: Medical treatment is regarded as the primary course of action in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Its efficacy, however, is limited, and most patients require interventional treatment during follow-up. Short-segment stenosis or the occlusion (the so-called web) of hepatic veins or the inferior vena cava are frequent in Asian countries. An angioplasty with or without stent implantation is the treatment of choice to restore hepatic and splanchnic blood flow. The long-segment thrombotic occlusion of hepatic veins, common in Western countries, is more severe and may require a portocaval shunting procedure to relieve hepatic and splanchnic congestion. Since it was first proposed in a publication in 1993, the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has gained more and more attention, and in fact it has been so successful that previously utilized surgical shunts are only used for few patients for whom it does not work. Both interventional treatment options can be performed successfully in about 95% of patients even after the complete obliteration of the hepatic veins. The long-term patency of the TIPS, a considerable problem in its early years, has been improved with PTFE-covered stents. The complication rates of these interventions are low and the survival rate is excellent with five- and ten-year survival rates of 90% and 80%, respectively. Present treatment guidelines recommend a step-up approach indicating interventional treatment after the failure of medical treatment. However, this widely accepted algorithm has several points of contention, and early interventional treatment is proposed instead.
