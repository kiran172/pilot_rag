Title: Successful Percutaneous Recanalization of a Chronically Occluded Inferior Vena Cava in a Young Child.

Abstract: Young children with congenital heart disease are undergoing an increasing number of catheter-based interventions. These procedures can lead to obstruction of large central veins, making future interventions more challenging or even impossible. We present a young child with a chronically occluded inferior vena cava (IVC) secondary to prior catheterization-based interventions for congenital heart disease. The IVC was recanalized with serial angioplasty and stent placement with continued patency for over two years. Despite the long duration of obstruction, the IVC was successfully recanalized, eliminating the potential consequences of long-term IVC obstruction and making it easier for future catheter-based interventions, if needed.
