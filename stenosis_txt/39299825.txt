Title: What's next for lipoprotein(a)? A national lipid association report from an expert panel discussion.

Abstract: This is an exciting time in the lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) field. Attention to this important lipoprotein and potent cardiovascular risk marker is transitioning from the purview of the specialist to that of the general practitioner. Its clinical adoption as an important test is increasing in momentum. There is evidence that Lp(a) contributes to the pathology of atherothrombotic disease, aortic valve stenosis, and childhood ischemic strokes. Three large, Phase 3, randomized, cardiovascular outcomes trials in which Lp(a) is specifically and substantially lowered by mRNA-directed therapies in secondary prevention settings are in progress and will start to report results as early as 2025. Regardless of outcomes, there remain many unanswered questions about Lp(a), ranging from fundamental unknowns about Lp(a) biology, to the complexity of its measurement, optimal screening strategies, and clinical management in individuals with high Lp(a) levels both with and without overt cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, The National Lipid Association (NLA) convened an Expert Discussion involving clinicians and fundamental researchers to identify knowledge gaps in our understanding of Lp(a) biology and pathogenicity and to discuss approaches in the management of elevated Lp(a) in different clinical settings.
