Title: Use of oxygen reserve index during bronchoscopic balloon dilation for subglottic stenosis in a patient with left ventricular assist device implantation -a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Monitoring the oxygenation status is crucial during general anesthesia to ensure patient safety. Although noninvasive pulse oximetry is commonly used to monitor percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2), it may not accurately reflect changes in oxygen partial pressure when the latter is excessively high or low. The oxygen reserve index (ORi) provides real-time information about the oxygen reserve status.
CASE: We present a case of successful management of subglottic stenosis using balloon bronchoscopy in an infant with a left ventricular assist device implantation under ORi monitoring to predict hypoxemia during the surgical procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing ORi monitoring during anesthesia for procedures involving apnea in critically ill infants can help predict impending desaturation before a drop in SpO2 occurs, allowing anesthesiologists to effectively anticipate and manage the apnea period. Continuous ORi monitoring offers valuable insights during surgical procedures, especially in infants with compromised respiratory and cardiovascular functions.
