Title: Non-contrast coronary magnetic resonance angiography: current frontiers and future horizons.

Abstract: Coronary magnetic resonance angiography (coronary MRA) is advantageous in its ability to assess coronary artery morphology and function without ionizing radiation or contrast media. However, technical limitations including reduced spatial resolution, long acquisition times, and low signal-to-noise ratios prevent it from clinical routine utilization. Nonetheless, each of these limitations can be specifically addressed by a combination of novel technologies including super-resolution imaging, compressed sensing, and deep-learning reconstruction. In this paper, we first review the current clinical use and motivations for non-contrast coronary MRA, discuss currently available coronary MRA techniques, and highlight current technical developments that hold unique potential to optimize coronary MRA image acquisition and post-processing. In the final section, we examine the various research-based coronary MRA methods and metrics that can be leveraged to assess coronary stenosis severity, physiological function, and atherosclerotic plaque characterization. We specifically discuss how such technologies may contribute to the clinical translation of coronary MRA into a robust modality for routine clinical use.
