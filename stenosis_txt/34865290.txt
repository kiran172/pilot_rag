Title: Closed-PICU perioperative management of congenital tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Perioperative management of congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) is challenging. In the present study, compared the effect of closed-pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) perioperative management by pediatric intensivists and open-PICU management by surgeons. Outcomes in terms of ventilator-free days (VFD) and length of postoperative PICU stay in children with CTS were evaluated.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a PICU in Japan. Children with CTS who underwent slide tracheoplasty were grouped according to whether they were perioperatively managed in an open (January 2015 to April 2016) or a closed (May 2016 to August 2019) PICU. Data were extracted from patients' medical records.
RESULTS: In total, 13 and 38 patients were included in the open- and closed-PICU groups, respectively. Compared to the open-PICU group, the closed-PICU group had shorter duration of muscle relaxant administration (median 4 vs 5 days; P < 0.001), earlier enteral nutrition (34/38 [90%] vs 1/13 [8%]; P < 0.001), more 28-day VFD (median 21 vs 20 days; P = 0.04), and shorter duration of postoperative PICU stay (median 16 vs 36 days; P = 0.002), but mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (0/38 [0%] vs 1/13 [8%]; P = 0.25).
CONCLUSIONS: Closed-PICU perioperative management with pediatric intensivists' participation significantly increased 28-day VFD and reduced the length of postoperative PICU stay in patients with congenital tracheal stenosis.
