Title: Aortic valve neocuspidization: Frequently asked technical questions.

Abstract: Since the first description by Professor Ozaki in 2011, more than 5500 aortic valve neocuspidization procedures have been performed worldwide, with promising short- and mid-term outcomes. We here report the nuances required to master this highly reproducible, standardized technique for the treatment of aortic valve disease.
