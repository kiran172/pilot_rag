Title: [Application of 3D printed nasal vestibular support in the treatment of anterior nostril stenosis].

Abstract: Objective:To evaluate the efficacy of 3D printed nasal vestibular support on the recovery of nasal ventilation function and nostril shape after nostril stenosis treatment. Methods:Thirty-eight patients with unilateral traumatic nasal vestibular stenosis were selected and treated with 3D printed nasal vestibular support after operation. Subjective evaluation indicators, objective nostril local morphological and structural parameters, and nasal airflow dynamics parameters by numerical simulation were used. To evaluate the nostril morphological and nasal functional recovery after treatment. Results:The subjective nasal congestion and nostril symmetry satisfaction VAS scores of the patients after nasal vestibular support treatment were improved to varying degrees compared with those before surgery; The nostril morphological parameters showed that the Δlong-axis ratio and Δ short-axis ratio were significantly decreased after nasal vestibular support therapy （0.09±0.09 and 0.16±0.13） compared with those before surgery（0.21±0.20 and 0.28±0.21） respectively（P&lt;0.01）. And the cross-sectional area of the nasal valve on the stenotic side nasal cavity increased from（0.40±0.27） cm² before operation to （0.71±0.26） cm² after treatment（P&lt;0.01）; The nasal resistance on the stenosis side nasal cavity also decreased from （0.036±0.024） Pa·s/mL before operation to （0.022±0.008） Pa. s/mL after treatment（P&lt;0.01）, and the total nasal resistance was decreased from （0.033±0.02） Pas/mL before operation to （0.021±0.007）Pa. s/mL after treatment（P&lt;0.01） ; It also showed that NWE（nasal warming efficiency） and NHE（nasal humidification efficiency） on the stenotic side nasal cavity were significantly decreased after nasal vestibular support therapy（[95.92±2.8]% and [94.55±4.17]%） compared with those before surgery （[97.94±1.97 ]% and [96.19±2.94]%） respectively（P&lt;0.01）. Conclusion:The 3D printed nasal vestibular support for postoperative support treatment on patients with anterior nostril stenosis can reflect the advantages of personalized treatment and allow patients to obtain satisfactory results, and the use of individually designed 3D printed nasal vestibular support can make the shape of anterior nostrils and nasal cavity normal ventilation function recover well, its clinical application prospect is worth looking forward to.
