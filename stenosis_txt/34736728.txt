Title: Development and assessment of an ex-vivo bench model aimed at laparoscopic ureteric reconstructive techniques.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Reconstructive and ablative urologic techniques require special technical mastery, especially the intracorporeal suturing.
OBJECTIVE: To report the subjective evaluation of a versatile ex-vivo model aimed to practice laparoscopic ureteric reconstructive techniques (LURT) on box-trainer.
STUDY DESIGN: The model is a continuous portion of porcine urinary bladder ("dilated pelvis"), the vesico-ureteral joint ("stenosis") and healthy ureter. All 127 participants (n = 119 urologists and n = 8 paediatric surgeons) performed on the model laparoscopic Anderson-Hynes dismembered pyeloplasty, and then, in the animal model, different LURT procedures (ureteroneocystostomy, ureteric reimplantation and/or dismembered pyeloplasty). The model was subjectively evaluated (face and content validity), through a 12 items questionnaire, based on a Likert scale (1-5 points) and a global question (1-10 points).
RESULTS: The total mean rating for 11/12 items was very high (>4points). Only one was rated under 3 points. The overall total mean rating from 1 to 10 points was very high (9.19 ± 0.82 points). In 10/12 items, expert's feedback (content validity) prevailed over non-experts (face validity).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The model was highly accepted for the practice of LURT techniques. Additionally, it is cost-effective, easy to assemble, ethically considerate, and realistic.
