Title: Utility and safety of airway stenting in airway stenosis after lung transplant: A systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Airway complications seriously affect the clinical outcomes and long-term prognosis of lung-transplantation patients. Airway stenting provides effective palliation for patients with airway stenosis. However, a lack of consensus regarding the efficacy and safety of airway stents in airway stenosis after lung transplantation. This study critically evaluated all available evidence regarding this concern.
METHODS: We retrieved studies from EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases. Studies were included if they reported baseline characteristics of airway complications after lung transplantation, stenting for airway stenosis, or prognosis.
RESULTS: In total, 279 papers were screened and 17 papers were included in final analysis. The short-term efficacy of airway stenting was assessed in almost all studies, with immediate palliation in symptom and improved pulmonary function reported. Eleven of the included studies evaluated the long-term efficacy of stent therapy, with no distinct lung function. The median overall survival time was 1,124 (95% confidence interval 415-1,833) days in stented patients only. Stent-related complications are common regardless of the material; However, serious complications are rare and can be improved with routine management.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that airway stenting is a safe and effective method to treat airway stenosis after lung transplantation. The short-term effect was significant, while the long-term efficacy on survival rate needed further investigations.
