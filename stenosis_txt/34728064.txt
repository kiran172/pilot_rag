Title: Reliability of Fractional Flow Reserve and Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio in Assessing Intermediate Coronary Stenosis in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.

Abstract: Despite the current use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) for guiding revascularization in atrial fibrillation (AF), there is a lack of studies evaluating their reliability in this particular population. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the reliability of FFR and iFR in patients with AF. This retrospective study included all patients with AF undergoing FFR measurements (n = 45 vessels from 36 patients) at Brugmann University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium, between 2012 and 2020 or iFR (n = 18 vessels from 13 patients) and a corresponding number of patients with sinus rhythm (SR) randomly selected from the same period, benefiting from iFR (n = 20 vessels from 17 patients) or FFR (n = 50 vessels from 37 patients). Our main findings indicate that there is an increased beat-to-beat variability of individual iFR measures in patients with AF, compared with SR. In addition, the reproducibility of iFR on test-retest is low in patients with AF, leading to increased lesion reclassification (53.8% of lesions reclassified on 2 consecutive iFR measurements in AF vs 6.6% lesions reclassified in SR, p <0.05). In contrast, FFR seems to be more robust in evaluating coronary lesions in AF in terms of equivalent variability, reproducibility, and lesion reclassification observed in the SR population. In conclusion, this is the first study to evaluate the reliability of iFR and FFR in AF. Our findings raise caution in using iFR to guide revascularization in patients with AF, whereas FFR seems to be more robust in this population.
