Title: Reconstructing forked corpus spongiosum to correct glans droop in distal/midshaft hypospadias repair.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We reviewed our experience and efficacy of reconstruction of a forked corpus spongiosum (FCS) to correct glans droop in distal/midshaft hypospadias repair.
METHODS: Eighty-five consecutive patients who underwent distal/midshaft hypospadias repair by the same surgeon in our center from October 2015 to June 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All cases were accompanied by different degrees of glans droop, which we corrected by cutting off and reconstructing the FCS along the plate. We recorded the degrees of glans droop, development of the FCS, and postoperative complications including residual chordee, fistula, diverticulum, glans dehiscence, meatus stenosis, and urethral stricture.
RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 5 to 37 months (mean, 19.7 months). Two patients (2.3%) developed a coronal fistula and underwent a second repair. Two patients (2.3%) developed a mild urethral diverticulum and underwent continued observation. One patient (1.2%) developed a meatus stenosis that resolved after 1 month of meatus expansion combined with external mometasone furoate. No patients developed postoperative residual chordee or urethral stricture.
CONCLUSIONS: The degree of glans droop is closely associated with the development of an FCS. Reconstructing the FCS to correct the glans droop can yield satisfactory outcomes and should be popularized in distal/midshaft hypospadias repair.
