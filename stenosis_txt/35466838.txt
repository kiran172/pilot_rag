Title: Peri-procedural variables and outcomes of long-period hemodynamic instability after carotid artery angioplasty and stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to identify the peri-procedural risk factors and outcomes of hemodynamic instability (HI) after carotid artery stenting (CAS).
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study was performed in 168 patients who underwent CAS procedure between September 2017 and September 2020. The presence of HI, as defined by hypertension (systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg), and/or bradycardia (heart rate <60 bpm), was recorded. Long-period HI was defined as persistent HI lasting more than 24 h. Patient demographics, comorbidities, peri-procedural variables, and risk factors were recorded. Clinical outcomes including cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality within 30 days of the procedure were evaluated. Logistic regression was used to analyze the independent risk factors of long-period HI following CAS.
RESULTS: Among 168 patients (mean age, 68.2 ± 8.3 years; 81.5% male), the frequency of post-procedural long-period HI was noted in 42 patients (25.0%). Male was prone to experience HI (odds ratio, 9.156, p = 0.021). Aggressive inflation pressure (&gt;7 atm) and 5 mm balloon for pre-dilatation were risk factors of long-period HI (OR, 7.372, p = 0.035; OR, 3.527, p = 0.023). Intraoperative peak blood pressure and larger-sized stents remained independent predictors for the development of HI (OR, 1.043, p = 0.027, and OR, 1.973, p = 0.015). Patients with prolonged HI were more likely to suffer TIA and stroke compared to other patients and significant difference was found in the occurrence of TIA (p &lt; 0.05). Non-significance was found in mortality rate and other outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: CAS-induced HI occurs in a considerable percentage while several peri-procedural variables are determined as independent predictors to develop long-period HI. Patients with prolonged HI are associated with increased risk of neurologic events and thus standardized intervention as well as management of long-period HI are of critical importance during clinical process.
