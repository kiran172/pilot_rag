Title: Management of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Using an Arteriovenous Fistula: An Intraoperative Change in the Preoperative Plan.

Abstract: Regarding coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients on hemodialysis, in situ internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) improves survival and freedom from cardiac events. Although a problem with the ITA can possibly occur, using the ITA ipsilateral to an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the upper extremity of patients on hemodialysis can cause coronary subclavian steal syndrome (CSSS). CSSS is a condition of myocardial ischemia caused by the diversion of blood flow from the ITA following coronary artery bypass surgery. CSSS has been reported to occur in cases of subclavian artery stenosis, AVF, and low cardiac function. A 78-year-old man with end-stage renal disease experienced angina pectoris during hemodialysis. The patient was scheduled for CABG, including anastomosis of the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) and LAD. After completion of all anastomoses, the LAD graft demonstrated retrograde blood flow, suggestive of ITA anomalies or CSSS. The LITA graft was transected at the proximal part and anastomosed to the saphenous vein graft with sufficient flow to the high lateral branch eventually.
