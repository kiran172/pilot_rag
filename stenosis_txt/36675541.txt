Title: The Effects of Body Composition Characteristics on the Functional Disability in Patients with Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: Several research studies suggest that obese patients are at a higher risk of developing lumbar spinal disorder, including degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), compared to normal-weight individuals. However, there are few investigations of how obesity affects functional disability in activities of daily living (ADL) in patients who were diagnosed with LSS. This prospective observational study aimed to determine if an association exists between body composition parameters, such as body fat and skeletal muscle, and functional disability in ADL of LSS patients. In the results of the current study, there were significant differences in percent body fat between the mild/moderate and severe disability groups. However, there were no differences in skeletal muscle mass or index between the two groups. Furthermore, we found a positive linear relationship between percent body fat and functional disability in male sex. This study suggests that increased percent body fat predicts potential severe functional disability in ADL in LSS patients. Body composition analysis may provide useful information for predicting the disease severity of various lumbar spinal disorders in clinical practice.
