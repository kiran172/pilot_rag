Title: [Advances in the role of infection in the development of benign tracheal stenosis].

Abstract: Benign tracheal stenosis (BTS) is a refractory disease with a complex pathogenesis and limited therapeutic drug effects. The management of benign tracheal stenosis remains a major challenge for the interventional physiologist. In recent years, the role of infection in the occurrence and development of tracheal stenosis has attracted some attention, but there is still some controversy. A clear understanding of the relationship between infection and tracheal stenosis is essential to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of BTS, and then to improve early prevention and management of BTS. This article reviewed the research progress on BTS associated with infection to explore new effective interventions that can reduce the BTS.
