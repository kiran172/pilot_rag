Title: Use of a self-expanding transcatheter valve for a degenerated INTUITY valve.

Abstract: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement for degenerated surgical bioprosthesis is becoming a more common therapeutic option. Rapid-deployment valves are novel, have distinct structural differences from standard surgical valves, and are increasingly used in minimal-access surgery. We report the case of a 61-year-old man who developed severe stenosis of an Edwards INTUITY Elite rapid-deployment valve and who subsequently underwent successful valve-in-valve placement of a self-expanding transcatheter valve. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the technical aspects of and considerations for using the self-expanding transcatheter platform in the Edwards INTUITY Elite valve.
