Title: Nonmalignant tracheal stenosis: presentation, management and outcome in limited resources setting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nonmalignant tracheal stenosis is a potentially life threatening conditions that develops as fibrotic healing from intubation, tracheostomy, caustic injury or chronic infection processes like tuberculosis. This is a report of our experience of its management with tracheostomy, rigid bronchoscopic dilation and surgery.
METHODS: Retrospective study design was used. 60 patients treated over five years period were included.
RESULTS: Mean age was 26.9 ± 10.0 with a range of 10-55 years. Majority (56 patients (93.3%)) had previous intubation as a cause for tracheal stenosis. Mean duration of intubation was 13.8 days (range from 2 to 27 days). All patients were evaluated with neck and chest CT (Computed Tomography) scan. Majority of the stenosis was in the upper third trachea - 81.7%. Mean internal diameter of narrowest part was 5.5 ± 2.5 mm, and mean length of stenosed segment was 16.9 ± 8 mm. Tracheal resection and end to end anastomosis (REEA) was the most common initial modality of treatment followed by bronchoscopic dilation (BD) and primary tracheostomy (PT). The narrowest internal diameter of the tracheal stenosis (TS) for each initial treatment category group was 4.4 ± 4.3 mm, 5.1 ± 1.9 mm and 6.7 ± 1.6 mm for PT, tracheal REEA and BD respectively, and the mean difference achieved statistical significance, F (10,49) = 2.25, p = 0.03. Surgery resulted in better outcome than bronchoscopic dilation (89.1% vs. 75.0%).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Nonmalignant tracheal stenosis mostly develops after previous prolonged intubation. Surgical resection and anastomosis offers the best outcome.
