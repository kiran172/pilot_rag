Title: Preservation or removal of the lateral nasal wall in endoscopic management of maxillary sinus neoplasia: A comparison of approach related morbidity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The endoscopic modified medial maxillectomy (MMM) and prelacrimal approach (PLA) are two routinely performed endoscopic approaches to the maxillary sinus when access via a middle meatal antrostomy is insufficient. However, there is no data in the literature that has compared outcomes and complication profile between the two procedures to determine which approach is superior.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the approach related morbidity of PLA and MMM.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all consecutive adult patients undergoing either MMM or PLA from 2009 to 2023 were identified. The primary outcome was development of epistaxis, paraesthesia, lacrimal injury, iatrogenic sinus dysfunction within a minimum of 3 months post-operative follow up.
RESULTS: 39 patients (44 sides) underwent PLA and 96 (96 sides) underwent MMM. There were no statistically significant differences between the rates of paraesthesia (9.1 % vs 14.6 %, p = 0.367) or prolonged paraesthesia (2.3 % vs 5.2 %, p = 0.426), iatrogenic maxillary sinus dysfunction (2.3 % vs 5.2 %, p = 0.426) or adhesions requiring removal (4.5 % vs 4.2 %, p = 0.918). No cases of epiphora or nasal cavity stenosis occurred in either arm in our study.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, the endoscopic modified medial maxillectomy and prelacrimal approach are both equally safe approaches with their own benefits to access.
