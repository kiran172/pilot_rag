Title: Reducing Length of Hospital Stay Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as a safe and effective treatment for severe aortic stenosis across the spectrum of surgical risk cohorts. Subsequently, the dramatic increase in procedural volume worldwide has placed significant financial and logistical pressures on healthcare institutions, particularly regarding hospital length of stay (LOS), which can adversely affect patient flow. In this review article, we discuss different peri-procedural strategies developed to reduce LOS and facilitate early discharge after TAVI.
