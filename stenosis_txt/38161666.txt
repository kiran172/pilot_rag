Title: Optimal Surgical Management of Tetralogy of Fallot.

Abstract: Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis has a diverse clinical spectrum with the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO) and size of the branch pulmonary arteries driving clinical management. Optimal surgical management involves consideration of patient clinical status and degree and location (subvalvar, valvar, and supravalvar) of RVOTO. Timing of repair requires multidisciplinary decision-making and complete surgical repair with relief of RVOTO by either transannular patch or valve sparing repair techniques. The central goals of contemporary surgical management of tetralogy of Fallot incorporate maximizing survival, minimizing reintervention, and preserving right ventricular function across the lifespan.
