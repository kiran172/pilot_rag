Title: Astragalus polysaccharides affects multidrug resistance gene 1 and P-glycoprotein 170 in adriamycin nephropathy rats via regulating microRNA-16/NF-κB axis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Nephrotic syndrome is a common disease of the urinary system. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of astragalus polysaccharides (APS) on multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) and P-glycoprotein 170 (P-gp170) in adriamycin nephropathy rats and the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: A total of 72 male Wistar rats were divided into a control group, a model group, an APS low-dose group, an APS high-dose group, an APS+micro RNA (miR)-16 antagomir group and an APS+miR-16 antagomir control group, with 12 rats in each group. Urine protein (UP) was detected by urine analyzer, and serum cholesterol (CHOL), albumin (ALB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (SCr) were detected by automatic biochemical analyzer; serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels were detected by ELISA kit; the morphological changes of kidney tissues were observed by HE staining; the levels of miR-16 and MDR1 mRNA in kidney tissues were detected by real-time RT-PCR; the expression levels of NF-κB p65, p-NF-κB p65, and P-gp170 protein in kidney tissues were detected by Western blotting; and dual luciferase was used to verify the relationship between miR-16 and NF-κB.
RESULTS: The renal tissue structure of rats in the control group was normal without inflammatory cell infiltration. The renal glomeruli of rats in the model group were mildly congested, capillary stenosis or occlusion, and inflammatory cell infiltration was obvious. The rats in the low-dose and high-dose APS groups had no obvious glomerular congestion, the proliferation of mesangial cells was significantly reduced, and the inflammatory cells were reduced. Compared with the high-dose APS group and the APS+miR-16 antagomir control group, there were more severe renal tissue structure damages in the APS + miR-16 antagomir group. Compared with the control group, the levels of UP, CHOL, BUN, SCr, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MDR1 mRNA, and the protein levels of p-NF-κB p65 and P-gp170 in the model group were significantly increased (all P&lt;0.05); the levels of ALB and miR-16 were significantly decreased (both P&lt;0.05). Compared with the model group, the levels of UP, CHOL, BUN, SCr, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MDR1 mRNA, and the protein levels of pNF-κB p65 and P-gp170 in the low-dose and high-dose APS groups were significant decreased (all P&lt;0.05); and the levels of ALB and miR-16 were significantly increased (both P&lt;0.05). Compared with APS+miR-16 antagomir control group, the UP, CHOL, BUN, SCr, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels, MDR1 mRNA, and the protein levels of p-NF-κB p65 and P-gp170 were significantly increased (all P&lt;0.05). The levels of ALB and miR-16 were significantly decreased in the APS+miR-16 antagomir group compared with the APS+miR-16 antagomir control group (both P&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: APS can regulate the miR-16/NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby affecting the levels of MDR1 and P-gp170, and reducing the inflammation in the kidney tissues in the adriamycin nephropathy rats.
