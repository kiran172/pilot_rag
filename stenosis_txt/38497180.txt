Title: Middle Cerebral Artery Ischemic Complications After Flow Diverter Deployment from Internal Carotid Artery Extending into M1 Segment.

Abstract: AIM: To gain a better understanding of ischemia risk related to in-stent stenosis (ISS) or in-stent thrombosis (IST) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and lenticulostriate arteries after flow-diverting devices (FDD) deployment from the internal carotid artery (ICA) to proximal middle cerebral artery (M1).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using data from a prospectively maintained database, we retrospectively evaluated patients who were treated with FDD between January 2015 and 2020 at a single academic center. Only patients with unruptured ICA aneurysms where the FDD was extended into M1 were included.
RESULTS: In total, 89 patients with 94 ICA aneurysms were treated with FDD. A total of 34 patients with 36 aneurysms had FDD extending into M1. Of the 34 patients, four experienced MCA, and lenticulostriate territory ischemia. Three patients had in-stent thrombosis (IST), and one patient had severe in-stent stenosis (ISS). The overall ischemic complication rate was 17.6%, which resulted in a permanent neurological deficit in 11.7% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: If the distance of the distal neck of the aneurysm to the ICA terminus (ICAT) is â‰¤5 mm, or if the aneurysm is located directly at the ICAT, FDD should be considered only as a last option when other treatment modalities are not suitable. In addition, in the treatment of distal ICA aneurysms, extra effort should be exerted during the procedure to deploy the FDD without extending into M1. However, when traditional microsurgical clipping and other endovascular procedures are not suitable, the use of FDD is effective in terms of high aneurysm occlusion rates and preventing aneurysm rupture.
