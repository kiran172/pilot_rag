Title: Role of galectin-3 in diagnosis and severity assessment of epicardial artery lesions in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the possible role of serum galectin-3 (Gal-3) levels in the diagnosis and assessment of significant epicardial artery lesions in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: This was a single-center cross sectional cohort study including 168 subjects with suspected CAD and indications for coronary angiography divided into three groups: percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) group (N 64), coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) group (N 57), and group with no coronary stenosis (N 47). Gal-3 levels were measured and the syntax score (Ss) was calculated.
RESULTS: The mean value of Gal-3 in the PCI and CABG group was 19.98 ng/ml, while in the control group, it was 9.51 ng/ml (p < 0.001). The highest value of Gal-3 was found in the group of subjects with three-vessel disease (p < 0.001). When subgroups were analyzed by Gal-3 levels (< 17.8 ng/ml low, 18.8-25.9 ng/ml intermediate, > 25 ng/ml high risk) there was a significant difference between at least two Gal-3 groups for the arithmetic mean of Syntax score (p < 0.001). The syntax I's arithmetic mean at low and intermediate-risk Gal-3 levels was significantly lower than at high-risk Gal-3 levels (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Gal-3 could be used as an additional tool for diagnosis and severity assessment of atherosclerotic disease in patients with suspected CAD. Furthermore, it could help identify high-risk subjects in patients with stable CAD.
