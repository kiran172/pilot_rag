Title: Norwood Operation With Partial Left Ventriculectomy for Neonatal Dilated Cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: The combination of severe fetal mitral regurgitation diagnosed in utero, aortic stenosis, left ventricular dilatation, and dysfunction is associated with extremely poor prognosis. We report a neonate who underwent Norwood operation and left ventricular exclusion using partial left ventriculotomy and Alfieri mitral valve stitch. Left ventricular exclusion eliminated right ventricular compression and allowed survival and progression to subsequent second-stage palliation.
