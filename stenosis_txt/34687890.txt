Title: Gender, racial and ethnic disparities in index hospitalization operations for symptomatic carotid stenosis in Texas hospitals.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent literature and societal recommendations support early revascularization of symptomatic carotid patients over the traditional six-week period. Nonetheless, the timing of these interventions can vary widely among populations. The goal of this study is to identify any factors influencing carotid revascularization during the index hospitalization for patients with symptomatic disease.
METHODS: The Texas Department of State Health Services database was queried to identify all patients > 45 years old admitted to nonfederal Texas Hospitals between 2009 to 2013 with an admission diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis and either transient ischemic attack (TIA), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or amaurosis fugax. Diagnoses codes and demographic data were also used to adjust for clinical, social, and demographic factors (including area of residence and treatment). Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify significant factors for index admission revascularization.
RESULTS: A total of 29,046 symptomatic patients were identified among the 153,484 patients who had an eligible admission diagnosis. This included 16,244 (55.9%) males and 12,802 (44.1%) females. Only 4,594 (15.8%) patients were revascularized during the index hospitalization. The majority of these patients presented with amaurosis (OR 5.58; 95% CI 4.84-6.44) instead of CVAs (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.45-0.51) or TIAs . Adjusting for hospital volume, insurance coverage, residence, and other clinical factors, rates of index admission carotid intervention remained significantly lower for women (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.79-0.91), persons categorized as black (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.53-0.69), and persons categorized as Hispanic (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.70-0.86).
CONCLUSIONS: Gender, race and ethnicity appear to correlate with rates of carotid intervention at index hospitalization despite thorough risk adjustment for clinical, social and demographic factors. Efforts should be directed towards reducing these disparities.
