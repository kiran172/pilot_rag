Title: The "Bevel drilling" for degenerative cervical myelopathy: A technical note with illustrative video.

Abstract: Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a pathology frequently encounterd in the neurosurgical practice. Posterior ostophytes located at the posterior part of the vertebral endplate are frequently involved in the reduction of the cervical canal. We propose a description of the technique used in our department to drill this posterior part of the endplate safely with the help of modern instruments and microscope magnification.The bony resection being performed with diamond burr, we believe this technique less traumatic on the spinal cord than repeated insertions of rongeur. Radiological result shows a nice enlargment of the cervical canal. This technique offers a less invasive alternative to corporectomy in cases of two-level stenosis.
