Title: Efficacy and toxicity of re-irradiation for esophageal cancer patients with locoregional recurrence: a retrospective analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is no standard treatment for locoregional recurrent (LR) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) previously. This retrospective study aimed to examine the efficacy and toxicity of re-irradiation (re-RT) for ESCC patients with LR.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 252 patients were enrolled. Gross tumor volumes for re-RT were defined using contrast enhanced computed tomography and/or positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Overall survival (OS), after recurrence survival (ARS) and toxicities were assessed.
RESULTS: Through a median follow-up of 38 months, the median OS and ARS were 39.0 and 13.0 months, respectively. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month ARS rates were 81.9%, 50.5%, and 21.8%, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that chemotherapy, esophageal stenosis and recurrence-free interval (RFI) may be independent prognostic factors for ARS. The incidence of esophageal fistula/perforation (EP), radiation-induced pneumonitis and esophagorrhagia was 21.4%, 12.8% and 9.1%, respectively. RFI ≤ 12 months, esophageal stenosis and fat space between tumor and adjacent tissue disappeared were independent risk factors for the development of EP after re-RT.
CONCLUSIONS: Re-RT was feasible for LR ESCC patients after RT initially, the complication occurred in re-RT is acceptable. Patients with RFI ≤ 12 months, esophageal stenosis and fat space between tumor and adjacent tissue disappeared should be closely observed during and after re-RT.
