Title: Effects of YM155 on the proliferation and apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells in a rat model of high pulmonary blood flow-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Proliferation and apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) play an important role in the occurrence and development of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of survivin inhibitor YM155 on the proliferation and apoptosis of PASMCs in rats with PAH induced by high pulmonary blood flow.
METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control, model, and YM155 intervention groups. A rat model of PAH induced by high pulmonary blood flow was established, and it was confirmed by assessments of right-ventricular pressure (RVP) and right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI). Immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of survivin, and the proliferation and apoptosis of PASMCs. Lastly, the effects of in vivo treatment of YM155 were tested.
RESULTS: The increased expression of survivin mRNA and protein were observed in the model group, accompanied by pulmonary arteriolar wall thickening, lumen stenosis, and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. Elevated expression of survivin and pulmonary vascular remodeling were significantly mitigated after YM155 treatment. Specifically, the YM155 intervention group had a significantly lower PASMC proliferation rate and a higher PASMC apoptotic rate.
CONCLUSION: YM155 suppressed PASMC proliferation and promoted PASMC apoptosis by inhibiting survivin expression and thereby reducing pulmonary vascular remodeling in high pulmonary blood flow-induced PAH in vivo.
