Title: A First-in-Man Clinical Evaluation of Sirolimus and Ascorbic Acid-Eluting Stent Systems: a Multicenter, Subject-Blinded, Randomized Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of D+Storm™ drug-eluting stent (DES) and BioMatrix Flex™ DES.
METHODS: This study was a multicenter, subject-single-blind, randomized, and confirmed comparative clinical trial. According to the inclusion criteria, those diagnosed with stable angina, unstable angina, silent ischemia, or non-ST-segment myocardial infarction were selected among patients with coronary artery stenosis as subjects. Among the subjects with 50% stenosis on coronary angiography, the experiment was performed on those who had a lesion with reference vessel 2.5-4.0 mm in diameter and ≤40 mm in length. The primary endpoint was an in-segment late loss and the secondary endpoints were in-stent late lumen loss, stent malapposition, the incidence of mortality, myocardial infarction, reoperation, and stent thrombosis at 36 weeks.
RESULTS: 57 patients in the D+Storm™ DES group and 55 patients in the BioMatrix Flex™ DES group were enrolled in the study. Fifty-seven patients in the D+Storm™ DES group and Fifty-five patients in the BioMatrix Flex™ DES group were enrolled in the study. An average of in-segment late lumen loss was 0.08±0.13 mm in the D+Storm™ DES group and 0.14±0.32 mm in the BioMatrix Flex™ DES group with no significant difference between the 2 groups (p=0.879). In addition, there was no significant difference in adverse events between D+Storm™ DES and BioMatrix Flex™ DES.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the clinical effectiveness and safety of D+Storm™ DES implantation in patients with coronary artery disease over a 36-week follow-up period.
