Title: Left atrium reservoir function is central in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.

Abstract: We investigated the relationship between Left Atrium strain reservoir function and symptoms and its impact on modulating Left Ventricular mechanics, diastolic filling, stroke volume, mean trans-mitral gradient and pulmonary pressure in mitral stenosis (MS) patients. We examined 195 full spectrum MS patients which were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 109) included patients with NYHA I &amp; II functional class and group 2 (n = 86) included patients with NYHA III &amp; IV functional class. LA strain reservoir function and classical echocardiographic parameters were calculated. LASr was significantly higher in group 1 versus group 2 in patients with MVA ≤ 1cm2 [8.8(6.0-12.6) vs 6.8(4.1-8.9), p = 0.03) and when 1cm2 &lt; MVA ≤ 1.5 cm2 [10.0 (5.4-13.8) vs 6.7(4.5-9.0), p = 0.02). In patients with Pulmonary Hypertension, group 1 had significantly higher LASr than group 2 [11.1(6.6-14.8) vs 5.9(4.3-9.0), p = 0.002) By multivariate analysis, diabetes (OR = 4.11, 95%CI: 1.6-10.4), stroke (OR = 2.9, 95%CI: 1.1-7.9), LASr (OR = 0.9, 95%CI: 0.80-0.99) and LV ejection fraction (LVEF)(OR = 0.9, 95%CI: 0.91-0.99) were independently associated with NYHA functional class. LASr was significantly and positively correlated to MVA (r = 0.3, p &lt; 10-3), stroke volume (r = 0.25, p = 10-3), mitral inflow (r = 0.4, p &lt; 10-3) and LVEF(r = 0.14, p = 0.05). It was significantly and negatively correlated to left ventricular strain (r = -0.65, p &lt; 10-3), LA indexed volume (r = -0.40, p &lt; 10-3), maximum tricuspid regurgitation velocity (r = -0.25, p = 0.003), MTMG (r = -0.25, p = 10-3), and heart rate (r = -0.4, p &lt; 10-3). We demonstrated a large range of interaction between LASr and mitral valve echocardiographic parameters. This may explain the reasons we identified LASr as an independent factor for MS functional tolerance.
