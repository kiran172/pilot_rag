Title: Tetralogy of Fallot and subglottic stenosis surgery with holmium laser in the same session.

Abstract: The incidence of subglottic stenosis after pediatric cardiac surgery is around 0.57-2.3%. An 11-year-old female patient, who underwent modified Blalock-Taussig shunt surgery at the age of 4 months, was interned for total repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Subglottic stenosis was revealed in preoperative examination with indirect laryngoscopy. Total repair of tetralogy of Fallot was performed under cardiopulmonary bypass support. While the patient was still on cardiopulmonary bypass support, subglottic stenosis was treated by holmium laser successfully without a complication. In suitable patients, cardiac and endoscopic laryngeal operations can be successfully and safely performed under cardiopulmonary bypass with a holmium laser.
