Title: The bicuspid aortic valve: Still a toothy problem.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an acceptable treatment alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in selected patients with a bicuspid aortic valve. TAVR appears to have acceptable mid-term outcomes in patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis. A large-scale, randomized, clinical trial is necessary to better define the role of TAVR for patients with bicuspid aortic stenosis.
