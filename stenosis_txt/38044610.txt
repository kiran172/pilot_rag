Title: [Treatment strategy of congenital tracheal stenosis associated with non-vascular ring cardiac malformations].

Abstract: Objective: To examine the treatment strategy of congenital tracheal stenosis associated with non-vascular ring cardiac malformations. Methods: This is a retrospective case series. Clinic data from 24 children with tracheal stenosis who underwent surgical treatment in the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University from February 2017 to March 2023 were retrospectively collected. There were 16 males and 8 females, aged (M(IQR)) 6.5 (19.6) months (range: 2.2 to 66.3 months) and weighted 5.95 (4.76) kg (range: 3.2 to 20.0 kg). All patients had obvious respiratory symptoms. Eighteen patients underwent cardiac malformation correction and tracheoplasty at the same time (simultaneous group). Six patients in the staged operation group were treated with cardiac malformation correction in the first stage operation and tracheoplasty in the second stage operation due to missed diagnosis or delayed diagnosis of tracheal stenosis or no condition for tracheoplasty. Slide tracheoplasty was used to correct tracheal stenosis in both groups. The recovery of the children was followed. Wilcoxon sign rank test was used for comparison between the two groups. Results: There was no death during the perioperative period and hospitalization. In the simultaneous group, 1 case with delayed chest closure underwent bedside chest closure after 52 hours, 2 cases were intubated again after operation, and 1 case was implanted with an endotracheal stent. The duration of mechanical ventilation was 40.5 (39.6) hours (range: 19.0 to 438.8 hours). In the staged group, there was 1 case of re-intubation after operation, combined with left vocal cord paralysis and respiratory multidrug-resistant bacterial infection (Acinetobacter baumanii). One patient underwent 3 times of bronchoscopic balloon dilatation of the right middle bronchus, and heart rate returned to normal range. The duration of mechanical ventilation was 19.0 (21.4) hours (range: 17.1 to 96.7 hours). During follow-up, a patient in the simultaneous group was prone to respiratory infection and had good exercise tolerance, 1 patient in the staged group still had sputum stridor in the throat 3 months after the operation, and symptoms improved significantly 6 months after the operation. The other children didn't have obvious respiratory symptoms. Conclusions: The diagnosis of tracheal stenosis may be delayed or missed when tracheal stenosis is complicated by non-vascular ring cardiac malformations. One-stage correction of tracheal stenosis and cardiac malformation can achieve a good outcome.
