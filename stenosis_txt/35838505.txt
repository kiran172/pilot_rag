Title: Ventral onlay glanuloplasty for treatment of fossa navicularis strictures.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Management of fossa navicularis (FN) strictures balances restoring urethral patency with adequate cosmesis. Historically, FN strictures are managed via glans cap or glans wings, and in severe cases, multi-stage procedures. Ventral onlay glanuloplasty (VOG) is an easily reproducible technique that involves a single-stage augmentation with buccal mucosal graft. We have been applying this technique for several years and present early promising outcomes of this novel approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with FN strictures who underwent VOG at our institution. Treatment success was designated by the absence of extravasation on voiding cystourethrogram and no need for further urethral instrumentation on follow up. Glans cosmesis was assessed by patients providing binary (yes/no) response to the satisfaction in their appearance. We also noted stricture length, stricture etiology, demographic characteristics and any post-operative complications and reported median, interquartile range (IQR) and count, frequency (%), accordingly.
RESULTS: Ten patients underwent VOG and fit our inclusion criteria. Median stricture length was 2.0 cm (IQR 1.6 -2). Success rate was 90% (9/10) with a median follow up of 30 months (IQR 24.3 - 36.8). The one recurrence was treated by dilation combined with triamcinolone injection at 419 days post-op. Stricture etiology included primarily iatrogenic causes such as transurethral prostate resection (4/10), greenlight laser vaporization (2/10), cystolitholapaxy (1/10), and traumatic catheterization (3/10). All patients were satisfied with penile cosmesis.
CONCLUSION: VOG is a simple technique for treating FN strictures. Based on our preliminary series, VOG provides sustained distal urethral patency and patients are pleased with the appearance.
