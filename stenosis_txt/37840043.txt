Title: Atrial electrical remodeling and function after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis.

Abstract: To examine reverse atrial electrical remodeling in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) after trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In 65 consecutive patients with severe AS (83 ± 4 years, 47 (72.3%) females), we analyzed ECG records for the P wave duration (PWD) in lead II and P-terminal force (PTFV1) in V1, and measured cardiac dimensions and function by echocardiography (ECHO) following TAVR. Biomarkers were measured to assess myocardial injury by TAVR. TAVR was successfully performed without major complications: the aortic valve area increased from 0.62 ± 0.14 cm2 to 1.52 ± 0.24cm2, and the trans-aortic pressure gradient decreased from 58.4 ± 15.9 mmHg to 15.0 ± 19.6 mmHg. PWD and PTFV increased immediately after TAVR and returned to the pre-TAVR levels on the next day. Then, the PWD declined toward 6 months after TAVR non-significantly in all patients, but significantly in 25 patients with baseline PWD ≥ 130 ms (P = 0.039). PTFV1 showed no long-term change. Improvement was observed in the ejection fraction, all thickness of the left ventricle and in the left atrial dimensions on ECHO. After recovery from transient aggravation by TAVR procedure, PWD reversed slowly, and the change was significant in those with baseline PWD ≥ 130 ms while change in PTFV1 was not significant at 6 months of follow-up. ECHO showed a reversal of remodeling in the left ventricle and in the left atrial dimension after TAVR.
