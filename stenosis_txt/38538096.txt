Title: Open bypass revascularisation for endovascular-resistant transplant renal artery stenosis secondary to mechanical renal artery kinking.

Abstract: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) represents a significant vascular complication subsequent to renal transplantation. This pathology is associated with grave implications including graft dysfunction and mortality. Early identification and therapeutical intervention are imperative for preserving graft longevity and achieving optimal clinical outcomes. We detail the case of a male in his 20s, following renal transplantation, who encountered recurrent TRAS, aetiologically linked to mechanical arterial kinking. Initial management using endovascular techniques yielded insufficient resolution. Consequently, the persistence of endovascular-resistant stenosis necessitated a surgical bypass intervention using the great saphenous vein, granting a 2-year period devoid of restenosis. The existing literature emphasises the indispensability of discerning the appropriate juncture for transitioning from endovascular to surgical management in TRAS cases. The robustness and durability of bypass grafts present an efficacious therapeutical strategy in contemporaneous practice.
