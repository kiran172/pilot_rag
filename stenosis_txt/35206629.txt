Title: A Case of Successful Use of the "Anchoring Technique" for Percutaneous Treatment of Left Ventricular Assist Device Graft Occlusion.

Abstract: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) obstruction can be a dramatic and life-threatening complication in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). Despite surgical redo is often required in these patients, it is associated with a high risk of periprocedural negative outcome. We report the case of a 68-year-old male with a thrombotic stenosis of the LVAD proximal outflow-graft. Following Heart Team debate, a percutaneous intervention was planned during veno-arterial Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) assistance. To achieve the needed catheter support, we used the "distal balloon anchoring technique" through the outflow-graft and managed to implant a covered stent, rapidly restoring the flow through the LVAD. The patient was discharged without further complications. Our case shows that, in selected cases, percutaneous treatment of LVAD obstructions can be feasible, especially using advanced techniques derived from the experiences in coronary interventions and under ECMO assistance. More cases and prospective studies are mostly needed to explore long-term patency of the LVADs and clinical outcomes in these high-risk patients.
