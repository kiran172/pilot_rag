Title: Outcomes of Modified Tissue Selection Therapy Stapler in the Treatment of Prolapsing Hemorrhoids.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Tissue selection therapy staplers (TSTs) are widely used to treat prolapsing hemorrhoids; however, some disadvantages exist. We describe a modified technique for the treatment of prolapsing hemorrhoids, with the aim of minimizing the risk of anal stenosis and anal incontinence and reducing the impact of postoperative complications from the stapling technique. We applied a modified TST procedure, and the preliminary data were used to test the efficacy and safety of this new technique.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent modified TST for prolapsing hemorrhoids at our department between January 2018 and January 2020. All patients received a modified TST. Most prolapsing hemorrhoids were not segmentally resected and were instead selectively removed. The demographics, preoperative characteristics, postoperative complications, therapeutic effects, and patient satisfaction were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were included in the study; 53 were men and 53 women (mean age, 49.24 years). The mean operative time was 55.01 min, and the mean hospital stay was 7.82 days. After surgery, three patients experienced bleeding (2.83%), 2 patients experienced anal discharge (1.89%), 2 patients experienced tenesmus (1.89%), and 5 patients experienced anal tags (4.72%). Anal incontinence, persistent post stapler pain, rectovaginal fistula and anal stenosis did not occur. Two patients developed recurrent symptomatic hemorrhoids (1.89%). The total effective rate of the surgery and the total satisfaction rate of the patients was 97.17%.
CONCLUSIONS: The modified tissue selection therapy stapler technique was a satisfactory and economical treatment for prolapsing hemorrhoids at a follow-up period of 1 year. The modified TST was associated with reduced anal stenosis and anal incontinence, less persistent post stapler pain and a minimal risk of rectovaginal fistula.
