Title: Right ventricular function in severe aortic stenosis assessed by echocardiography and MRI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) is increasing due to an ageing population. Despite that right ventricular function has prognostic value for postoperative outcome, the right ventricle (RV) is not extensively studied and often not routinely assessed in AS. Our aim was to explore the relation between severe AS and RV function in a surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) cohort, comparing two imaging modalities for RV evaluation.
METHODS: Patients with severe AS, underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) before SAVR. RV dysfunction was defined as one or more of the following: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) < 17 mm, RV free wall strain (RVFWS) > -20% by TTE and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) <50% by CMR.
RESULTS: Sixteen (33%) patients were found to have RV dysfunction. Patients with RV dysfunction showed significantly lower indexed aortic valve area, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction as well as RV and LV stroke volumes compared to patients with maintained RV function. All patients with reduced RVEF also had changes in TAPSE or RVFWS and a larger number of patients had a reduced longitudinal RV function despite a normal RVEF.
CONCLUSION: In a SAVR cohort one-third of the patients had RV dysfunction, defined by RVEF, TAPSE or RVFW strain. Echocardiography detected subtle changes in RV function before RVEF was reduced. It is likely that the more pronounced the AS, the more frequent the occurrence of RV dysfunction.
