Title: Cerebral hemorrhage due to intracranial venous reflux associated with left brachiocephalic vein occlusion in a hemodialysis patient.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although central venous occlusion is sometimes seen in hemodialysis (HD) patients, neurological symptoms due to intracranial venous reflux (IVR) are extremely rare.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a 73-year-old woman with cerebral hemorrhage due to IVR associated with HD. She presented with lightheadedness and alexia, and was diagnosed with subcortical hemorrhage. Venography through the arteriovenous graft showed occlusion of the left brachiocephalic vein (BCV) and IVR through the internal jugular vein (IJV). It is extremely rare that IVR occurs and causes neurological symptoms. This is because that there is the presence of a valve in the IJV and the communication between the right and left veins through the anterior jugular vein and thyroid vein. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for the left obstructive BCV was performed, but the obstructive lesion was only slightly improved. Hence, shunt ligation was performed.
CONCLUSION: When IVR is found in HD patients, central veins should be confirmed. Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention are desirable when neurological symptoms are present.
