Title: Postmortem magnetic resonance imaging findings of tricuspid atresia with ventricular and atrial septal defects and subvalvular pulmonic stenosis in a Japanese native Noma horse.

Abstract: The necropsy of a 2-day-old Noma horse that died of weakness showed an enlarged cardiac base and a narrow cardiac apex, suggesting cardiac malformation. The excised heart underwent imaging to investigate its luminal structure. On three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging, the right atrium and right ventricle were discontinuous. The right atrium communicated with the left atrium and the left ventricle communicated with the right ventricle. The lumen narrowed near the pulmonary artery valve. Since the same findings were observed on gross examination, the foal was diagnosed with tricuspid atresia with ventricular and atrial septal defects, along with subvalvular pulmonic stenosis.
