Title: Risk factors for irreversible unilateral loss of renal function in patients with deep endometriosis.

Abstract: Deep endometriosis (DE) can be more aggressive than other types of endometriosis, and may even lead to irreversible severe complications such as complete unilateral loss of renal function. We aimed to describe the clinical and radiologic characteristics of DE patients diagnosed with irreversible unilateral loss of renal function due to unilateral ureteral stenosis and evaluate risk factors for developing this loss. This retrospective cohort study included 436 patients who underwent laparoscopic DE surgery. We evaluated two groups of patients according to preserved (Non-Renal Loss Group; n = 421) or irreversible unilateral damaged renal function (Renal Loss Group; n = 15). Preoperative epidemiologic variables, clinical characteristics, radiologic findings and surgical treatments of all the patients were collected. The Renal Loss Group had a higher infertility rate and a higher proportion of asymptomatic patients. The following radiological variables showed statistically significant differences between the two groups: mean endometrioma diameter, the presence of intestinal DE and negative sliding sign. Multivariate analysis showed that infertility, being asymptomatic, having intestinal DE or torus uterinus/uterosacral ligament DE and a negative sliding sign significantly increased the risk of loss of renal function. Therefore, among patients with these clinical and/or radiological variables, severe urinary tract obstruction should be specifically ruled out.
