Title: Associations of Increased Red Cell Distribution Width Levels with the Severity of Carotid Artery Stenosis: Cross-sectional Study Results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is being actively studied as a biomarker in various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The aim of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of RDW in patients with carotid atherosclerosis, comparing it with an assessment of the severity of carotid artery stenosis (CAS).
METHODS: The Duplex registry database was used to conduct this retrospective cross-sectional study. The study participants underwent a complete blood count test, analysis for lipid profile, and carotid ultrasound. The patients were divided into 5 groups depending on CAS degree: none; 20%-49%; 50%-69%; 70%-99%; and occlusion.
RESULTS: Data from 2548 patients were included in the final analysis (mean age: 57.9 Â± 12.3 years; 51% males [n = 1301]). The analysis confirmed the relationship between the increase in the RDW index and CAS gradation increase in men (Kr-W H = 16.43; P = 0.0009), but was not confirmed in women (Kr-W H = 4.32; P = 0.22). Significantly higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and platelets and lower levels of red blood cell and white blood cells were registered in female patients without CAS and with CAS &lt; 50% compared with men (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed that RDW is an indicator whose increase is associated with an increase in the degree of carotid atherosclerosis in men, but not in women. This allows to discuss the role of the RDW index as a possible new laboratory biomarker of inflammation and progression of atherosclerosis, which can make an additional contribution to the formation of increased morbidity and mortality in men from atherosclerotic CVD.
