Title: First Report of Evolut Pro+ Transcatheter Aortic Valve-in-Valve in a Degenerated Lotus Valve.

Abstract: The increasing use of transcatheter aortic valves in patients with aortic stenosis has led to a higher number of valve-in-valve procedures due to gradual valve degeneration. We present a case of a 72-year-old woman who received transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using a Lotus valve due to severe aortic stenosis, which showed valve degeneration several years after the initial procedure. After heart-team discussion, TAVI-in-TAVI was planned using an Evolut pro+ valve, which allowed for full coverage of the Lotus valve and maintenance of coronary flow, resulting in a well-functioning valve with no regurgitation and normal performance. Despite high-risk anatomic features, valve-in-valve using an Evolut pro+ in a degenerated Lotus valve is feasible and overcomes pitfalls such as entanglement or coronary obstruction.
