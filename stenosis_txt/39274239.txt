Title: Temporal Trends in Patient Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes of TAVR: Over a Decade of Practice.

Abstract: Background/Objective: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is indicated for severe aortic stenosis patients with a prohibitive surgical risk. However, its use has been expanding in recent years to include intermediate- and low-risk patients. Thus, registry data describing changes in patient characteristics and outcomes are needed. The aim of this study was to analyse the temporal changes in patient profiles and clinical outcomes of all-comer TAVR. Methods: Baseline characteristics and VARC-3 outcomes of 1632 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR between 2008 and 2021 were analysed. Results: The annual rate of TAVR increased from 30 procedures in 2008-2009 to 398 in 2020-2021. Over the follow-up period, patient age decreased from 85 ± 4 to 80 ± 6.8 (p &lt; 0.001) and the STS score decreased from 5.9% to 2.8% (p &lt; 0.001). Procedural characteristics significantly changed, representing a shift into a minimally invasive approach: adoption of local anaesthesia (none to 48%, p &lt; 0.001) and preference of transfemoral access (74% in 2011-2012 vs. 94.5% in 2020-2021, p &lt; 0.001). The rates of almost all procedural complications decreased, including major vascular and bleeding complications, acute kidney injury (AKI) and in-hospital heart failure. There was a striking decline in rates of complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) and the need for a permanent pacemaker (PPM). PPM rates, however, remain high (17.8%). Thirty-day and one-year mortality significantly declined to 1.8% and 8.3%, respectively. Multivariable analysis shows that AKI, bleeding and stroke are strong predictors of one-year mortality (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The TAVR procedure has changed dramatically during the last 14 years in terms of patient characteristics, procedural aspects and device maturity. These shifts have led to improved procedural safety, contributing to improved short- and long-term patient outcomes.
