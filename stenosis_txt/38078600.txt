Title: Measuring lipoprotein(a) for cardiovascular disease prevention - in whom and when?

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study is to summarize major cardiovascular guideline recommendations on lipoprotein(a) and highlighting recent findings that emphasize how measuring lipoprotein(a) once in all adults is meaningful regardless of age, sex, comorbidities, or ethnicity.
RECENT FINDINGS: Many international guidelines now recommend once in a lifetime measurement of lipoprotein(a) in all adult individuals to facilitate accurate risk prediction. Lipoprotein(a)-lowering therapy to reduce cardiovascular disease is on the horizon, with results from the first phase 3 trial expected in 2025.
SUMMARY: Elevated lipoprotein(a) is an independent causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis and measuring lipoprotein(a) once in all individuals regardless of age, sex, comorbidities, or ethnicity is meaningful to aid in risk stratification.
