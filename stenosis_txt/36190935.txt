Title: Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis: a summary of current state of evidence for revascularization and emerging high-risk features.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenosis is a leading cause of ischemic stroke. While management of symptomatic carotid stenosis is well established, the optimal approach in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (aCAS) remains controversial. The rapid evolution of medical therapies within the time frame of existing landmark aCAS surgical revascularization trials has rendered their findings outdated. In this review, we sought to summarize the controversies in the management of aCAS by providing the most up-to-date medical and surgical evidence. Subsequently, we compile the evidence surrounding high-risk clinical and imaging features that might identify higher-risk lesions. With this, we aim to provide a practical framework for a precision medicine approach to the management of aCAS.
