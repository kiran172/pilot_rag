Title: Fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio is related to the severity of coronary artery disease in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing coronary angiography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study was to explore the potential relationship between the fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR) and the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in stage 3-5 predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
DESIGN: This study included 978 patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG). CAD was defined as the presence of obstructive stenosis>50% of the lumen diameter in any of the four main coronary arteries. Gensini scores (GSs), left main coronary artery (LMCA) and three-vessel coronary artery disease (TVD) were used to elevate the severity of CAD.
RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratios of CAD were 3.059 (95% CI: 1.859-5.032) and 2.670 (95% CI: 1.605-4.441) in the third and fourth quartiles of FAR compared with the first quartile, respectively. Among 759 patients diagnosed with CAD, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that FAR (at the 0.01 level) was significantly positively associated with the presence of LMCA (adjusted OR=1.177, 95% CI 1.067-1.299, P=0.001) or TVD (adjusted OR=1.154, 95% CI 1.076-1.238, P<0.001), and a higher GS (adjusted OR=1.152, 95% CI 1.073-1.238, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: FAR levels were independently associated with the presence and severity of CAD in stage 3-5 predialysis CKD patients.
