Title: Congenital Nasal Pyriform Aperture Stenosis in Association With Polymalformative Syndrome of the Midline.

Abstract: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) is a rare neonatal entity characterized by a reduction in the pyriform orifice of the nasal cavity. Because of its nonspecific clinical presentation as respiratory distress symptoms, it can mimic choanal atresia. Although isolated forms have been described, CNPAS is often associated with other congenital midline malformations. A single median incisor is usually found, with or without other cervical and maxillofacial malformations. The existence of hypothalamic-pituitary axis malformations with endocrine disorders is also possible and, in some cases, a moderate to severe intellectual deficit in association with other brain malformations. Radiological investigation is a central point in the multidisciplinary management of this type of polymalformative syndrome.
