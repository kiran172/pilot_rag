Title: Flurpiridaz F-18 PET Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in Patients With Suspected Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Flurpiridaz F-18 (flurpiridaz) is a novel positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging tracer.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to further assess the diagnostic efficacy and safety of flurpiridaz for the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) defined as ≥50% stenosis by quantitative invasive coronary angiography (ICA).
METHODS: In this second phase 3 prospective multicenter clinical study, 730 patients with suspected CAD from 48 clinical sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe were enrolled. Patients underwent 1-day rest/stress flurpiridaz PET and 1- or 2-day rest-stress Tc-99m-labeled single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) before ICA. PET and SPECT images were read by 3 experts blinded to clinical and ICA data.
RESULTS: A total of 578 patients (age 63.7 ± 9.5 years) were evaluable; 32.5% were women, 52.3% had body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, and 33.6% had diabetes. Flurpiridaz PET met the efficacy endpoints of the study; its sensitivity and specificity were significantly higher than the prespecified threshold value by 2 of the 3 readers. The sensitivity of flurpiridaz PET was higher than SPECT (80.3% vs 68.7%; P = 0.0003) and its specificity was noninferior to SPECT (63.8% vs 61.7%; P = 0.0004). PET area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves were higher than SPECT in the overall population (0.80 vs 0.68; P &lt; 0.001), women, and obese patients (P &lt; 0.001 for both). Flurpiridaz PET was superior to SPECT (P &lt; 0.001) for perfusion defect size/severity evaluation, image quality, diagnostic certainty, and radiation exposure. Flurpiridaz PET was safe and well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: This second flurpiridaz PET myocardial perfusion imaging trial shows that flurpiridaz has utility as a new tracer for CAD detection, specifically in women and obese patients.
