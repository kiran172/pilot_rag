Title: Risk Prediction of Coronary Artery Stenosis in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease Based on Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is considered an inflammatory relative disease. This study is aimed at analyzing the health information of serum interferon in CHD based on logistic regression and artificial neural network (ANN) model.
METHOD: A total of 155 CHD patients diagnosed by coronary angiography in our department from January 2017 to March 2020 were included. All patients were randomly divided into a training set (n = 108) and a test set (n = 47). Logistic regression and ANN models were constructed using the training set data. The predictive factors of coronary artery stenosis were screened, and the predictive effect of the model was evaluated by using the test set data. All the health information of participants was collected. Expressions of serum IFN-γ, MIG, and IP-10 were detected by double antibody sandwich ELISA. Spearman linear correlation analysis determined the relationship between the interferon and degree of stenosis. The logistic regression model was used to evaluate independent risk factors of CHD.
RESULT: The Spearman correlation analysis showed that the degree of stenosis was positively correlated with serum IFN-γ, MIG, and IP-10 levels. The logistic regression analysis and ANN model showed that the MIG and IP-10 were independent predictors of Gensini score: MIG (95% CI: 0.876~0.934, P &lt; 0.001) and IP-10 (95% CI: 1.009~1.039, P &lt; 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the logistic regression and the ANN model (P &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The logistic regression model and ANN model have similar predictive performance for coronary artery stenosis risk factors in patients with CHD. In patients with CHD, the expression levels of IFN-γ, IP-10, and MIG are positively correlated with the degree of stenosis. The IP-10 and MIG are independent risk factors for coronary artery stenosis.
