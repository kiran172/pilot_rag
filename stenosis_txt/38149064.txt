Title: Acute Aortic Regurgitation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Procedure.

Abstract: This study reports the case of a 75-year-old woman who developed aortic regurgitation (AR) a few hours after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The patient underwent the TAVI procedure for aortic stenosis and became hypotensive in recovery. A transthoracic echo revealed cardiac tamponade and around 1500 ml of blood was drained over several hours. Further advice was sought from the surgical team, and a transoesophageal echo revealed significant AR, which was confirmed by a transthoracic echo performed the next day. The patient underwent an emergency surgical aortic valve replacement. This case study demonstrates one of the complications of the TAVI procedure, acute AR, which was diagnosed a few hours after the procedure.
