Title: Thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with a cervical incision to extract specimen.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment is the most important and effective therapy for resectable esophageal cancer. Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) can reduce surgical trauma. A neck incision can be performed for extraction of surgical specimen. This study was performed to investigate the safety and feasibility of neck incision to extract surgical specimen in thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients who experienced thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer and a neck incision for extraction of surgical specimen were enrolled. The clinical, surgical and follow-up data were analyzed.
RESULTS: The procedure was successful in all patients (100%), with a neck incision to extract the surgical specimen. The median surgical time was 309 min, and the median blood loss was 186 ml, with the mean length of hospital stay of 11.5 days. Pulmonary complications occurred in 8 patients (23.5%). Anastomotic leakage occurred in 5 patients (14.7%), with one patient being treated conservatively to recover and four (11.8%) who received interventional drainage. One patient with interventional drainage died of severe infection, resulting in a 30-day surgical mortality of 2.9% (n = 1). Gastrointestinal complications happened in 5 patients (14.7%), including ileus in three patients and anastomotic stenosis in two patients. Follow-up was performed at a median time of 20 months (interquartile range, 14-32 months), with no death during this period. No recurrence was found in the first 12 months after radical resection.
CONCLUSION: The cervical incision to extract surgical specimen is safe and feasible with improved cosmetic effect in thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.
