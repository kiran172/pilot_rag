Title: Asymptomatic endobronchial tuberculosis represented as a solitary airway stenosis without tree-in-bud appearance on computed tomography.

Abstract: Bronchoscopy is a crucial tool for diagnosing endobronchial tuberculosis in patients with airway stenosis. Early diagnosis and treatment may reduce airway sequelae and prevent the spread of infection.
