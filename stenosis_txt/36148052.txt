Title: Relation of quantitative flow ratio with transit time coronary artery bypass graft flow measurement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a new functional index to assess the functional significance of coronary stenosis. While whether there is an association between QFR and transit-time flow measurement (TTFM) parameters of the target coronary artery has not been well addressed.
METHODS: A total of 89 patients receiving the in situ left internal thoracic artery (LITA) grafts to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and 19 patients undergoing the saphenous vein grafts (SVG) were enrolled in this retrospective study. The QFR value of the LAD was evaluated preoperatively. According to the QFR values, patients with the LITA to the LAD bypass grafts were divided into two groups (group A1: QFR &lt; 0.75, group A2: QFR ≥ 0.75), and SVG patients were divided into two groups (V1 group: QFR &lt; 0.75, V2 group: QFR ≥ 0.75).
RESULTS: In groups A1 and A2, respectively, median graft flow (Qm) was 44 (34) mL/minute and 26.5 (30.0) ml/minute; median pulsatility index (PI) was 2.00 (1.00) and 2.65 (0.90). Significant differences were observed in Qm (P = 0.034) and PI (P = 0.030). And the correlation coefficients of the TTFM variables with QFR were Qm: r = r = -0.226, (P = 0.036), PI: r = 0.265 (P = 0.012) among the LITA to LAD population.
CONCLUSION: TTFM variables, especially the PI, of the LITA in situ graft to the LAD during Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are strongly affected by preoperative QFR values. Moreover, in functionally mild coronary stenosis, the chance of competitive flow increases.
