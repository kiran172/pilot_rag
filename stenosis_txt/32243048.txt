Title: The impact of increased pulmonary arterial pressure on outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) on outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: A total of 242 patients who underwent TAVR were retrospectively reviewed. Transthoracic echocardiography estimated PASP. The cohorts were divided into three groups according to the numerical change of PASP; Increased (post-TAVR PASP at 1 month minus pre-TAVR PASP, ≥ + 5 mmHg; n = 52), No change (-5 to +5 mmHg; n = 86) and Decreased (≤ -5 mmHg; n = 104). Patient demographics and clinical outcomes until 1 year were evaluated. Logistic regression model was used for multivariate risk analysis.
RESULTS: At 1 year, the Increased group showed higher mortality (21 ± 6%) than the No change group (5 ± 2%) (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-13.5; p < .01) and the Decreased group (8 ± 3%) (HR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1-6.7; p = .02). Rehospitalization rate for valve-related or heart failure was also higher in the Increased group (21 ± 6%) than the No change group (10 ± 3%) (HR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-6.0; p = .04). Predictors of PASP deterioration were hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.1-13.8; p = .04) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter >50 mm (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.6; p = .04), and the increased PASP remained an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (HR; 2.7, 95% CI: 1.0-6.8; p = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the baseline PASP, patients with increased PASP at 1 month after successful TAVR were at higher risk of mortality and rehospitalization within 1 year. Strict medical management should be considered for patients who showed dilated left ventricle preoperatively.
