Title: [The prognostic evaluation of coronary artery calcification score and CT fractional flow reserve for patients with stable coronary artery disease].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: The data for this prospective study were derived from a prospective clinical trial at a single center. This trial enrolled stable CAD patients who underwent coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in General Hospital of Eastern Theater Command from April 2018 to March 2019 and had coronary artery stenosis of 25%-80%. Patients were assigned to either the control group or trial group according to CCTA time. Patients in control group were provided with only a standard CCTA report, while patients in trial group were provided with both a standard CCTA report and the corresponding CT-FFR results. The study included patients who underwent ECG-gated calcium scoring CT scans in this trial. CT-FFR value at 2 cm distal to the narrowest stenosis of each vessel was calculated. The minimum CT-FFR value was recorded as the patient level and CT-FFR≤0.80 was defined as a positive result. All patients were followed up for MACE, including all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and acute coronary syndrome leading to unplanned revascularization. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with MACE occurrence, and the Concordance index (C-index) was used to represent the performance of the models for predicting MACE occurrence based on clinical, anatomical, and CT-FFR parameters. Results: A total of 783 patients were finally statistically analyzed, with a age of (62.0±10.8) years, of whom 64.6% (506 cases) were male. There were 383 patients in the trial group and 400 patients in the control group, with a median follow-up time of 35.3 months. A total of 81 MACE cases occurred during the follow-up. The incidence of MACE in trial group (8.1%, 31/383) was significantly lower than that in control group (12.5%, 50/400)(χ2=4.095, P=0.043). CACS≥300, stenosis≥70% and CT-FFR≤0.80 [HR (95%CI) were 2.14 (1.01-4.52), 5.38 (3.44-8.42) and 16.91 (9.21-31.04), all P&lt;0.05] showed predictive value for MACE. The predictive ability of the CT-FFR model is significantly better than that of the CACS model and the stenosis degree model [C-index (95%CI) were 0.850 (0.823-0.874), 0.653 (0.618-0.686) and 0.718 (0.685-0.749), all P≤0.001]. The comprehensive model with added CACS and stenosis degree did not significantly improve the predictive value of the CT-FFR model [C-index (95%CI) were 0.867 (0.841-0.890), 0.850 (0.823-0.874), P=0.584]. Conclusions: CT-FFR has a high predictive value for MACE in patients with stable CAD, the combination of CT-FFR and CACS did not increase the predictive power of CT-FFR.
