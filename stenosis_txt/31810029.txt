Title: Hemiballism: Unusual clinical manifestation in three patients with frontoparietal infarct.

Abstract: The term hemiballism-hemichorea refers to a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements, often violent, described as uncontrollable jerking, flinging, flailing or kicking, involving proximal muscles of a limb and it is often associated with lesions in the subthalamic nucleus. In this report, we described three cases of hemiballism-hemichorea as the first manifestation of acute ischemic stroke with lesion in the frontoparietal region on brain MRI and no involvement of the subthalamic nucleus. One patient was treated with thrombolysis and recovered within one hour. The other patients recovered within 48â€‰h from symptoms onset. The impairment of the recently described "hyperdirect way", in which the cortical signal reach directly the subthalamic nucleus, may underlie the symptoms. We support, with a clinical point of view, the role of the frontoparietal region in the genesis of the hemiballism-hemichorea. An acute onset of this symptom should lead to think to an acute stroke.
