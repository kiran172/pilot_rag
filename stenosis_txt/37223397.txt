Title: The Therapeutic Outcome of Sialendoscopy in Patients with Sialoadenitis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Recent advances have led to the development of sialendoscopy, an accurate, minimally invasive procedure with high diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in treating sialolithiasis. This study aimed to evaluate the results and complications of sialendoscopy in patients suffering from sialoadenitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective interventional case series study on patients with sialoadenitis due to sludge or stone formation preoperatively confirmed by sonography or computed tomography (CT) scanning. Diagnostic sialendoscopy was performed, and the presence of stenosis, sludge, or stones inside the gland or duct was examined, and surgery was done. During follow-up time (18.8 Â± 7.4 months), recurrence of symptoms, the need for reoperation, and postoperative complications were also assessed.
RESULTS: The sialendoscopy was performed in 51 patients, including 55 glands. Forty-five Patients (88.2%) reported pain relief, and 46 patients (90.2%) reported that the treatment using sialendoscopy was better than conservative methods. The duct restenosis also occurred in one patient requiring open surgery. In assessing the main factors predicting the need for reoperation, the site of involvement (parotid versus submandibular glands) and the size of the stone were identified as the main determinants. The best cut-off value for stone size in predicting reoperation requirement was 7.0mm, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 85.7%.
CONCLUSION: Intraoperative sialendoscopy is a successful diagnostic and therapeutic tool with minimal postoperative complications in salivary gland duct involvement patients.
