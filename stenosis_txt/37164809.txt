Title: [Hypertension as a common element of renal transplantation with pressor kidney and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome].

Abstract: Secondary arterial hypertension accounts for only 5-10% of cases of arterial hypertension, hence the importance of its clinical suspicion for diagnosis. One of the most common causes of secondary hypertension is renovascular hypertension, caused by renal hypoperfusion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In addition to arterial hypertension being one of the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factors in the population, its poor control can cause acute neurological disorders such as Posterior Reversible Leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES), being characteristic the appearance of visuals alterations. Next, we present the case of a kidney transplant patient with well-controlled arterial hypertension with worsening secondary to renal artery stenosis and development of PRES.
