Title: Long-Term Outcomes of Revascularization Compared to Deferral in Stable Coronary Artery Disease: a Review.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study is assessing the long-term outcomes of revascularization compared to deferral in stable coronary artery disease with available literature.
RECENT FINDINGS: The overall safety of stable coronary artery disease using IFR has been well established. There have been very few studies that have examined the safety of deferral of revascularization vs revascularization. As seen in listed literature, there appears to be no difference between revascularization compared to deferral in stable coronary artery disease.
