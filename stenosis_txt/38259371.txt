Title: Superior Mesenteric Artery Stenosis Presenting as Chest Pain: Danger in Disguise.

Abstract: Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI), often known as abdominal angina, is a syndrome caused by a severe reduction in arterial flow to the digestive loops. It is an uncommon and underdiagnosed entity with potential severe adversities, such as acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are shown to also have mesenteric artery stenosis (MAS). By identifying risk variables, it may be possible to screen for mesenteric artery involvement in patients with CAD who exhibit an elevated risk. Here, we present a unique case of a person with severe retrosternal chest pain with postprandial angina, which turned out to be superior mesenteric artery (SMA) ostial stenosis.
