Title: Navigation-guided endoscopic lumbar decompression on foramen and lateral recess in advanced scoliosis.

Abstract: An 84-year-old woman presented with left leg radiating pain for 18 months and a numeric rating scale score of 8. From examination, motoric on left knee extension was grade 4, with dysesthesia and numbness along the left anterolateral thigh. Imaging showed left L3-4 foraminal and lateral recess stenosis with severe-degree scoliosis. The patient underwent navigation-guided endoscopic transforaminal foraminotomy and lateral recess decompression on the left L3-4 level with a good outcome. Three-years' follow-up showed a well-maintained clinical outcome and coronal sagittal balance. This video explores navigation-guided endoscopic lumbar decompression for neural compression in advanced scoliosis. Further research is encouraged to establish long-term efficacy.
