Title: Ventricular septal defect closure using radial incision of the tricuspid valve for exposure: is it really necessary?

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the effects of radial incision of the tricuspid valve in patients who had undergone ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure.
METHODS: Overall 173 patients were included in this study between 2012 and 2019. In 44 individuals, a tricuspid valve radial incision (TVRI) was included in the surgical process.
RESULTS: There were no mortalities. The demographic data did not differ between the groups. The mean ages of the TVRI and non-TVRI groups were 2.92 ± 3.88 and 2.69 ± 2.80 years, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass aortic cross-clamp, postoperative intubation time and intensive care unit stay. Mild tricuspid valve regurgitation was detected in only two patients in the TVRI and six patients in the non-TVRI groups. There was no tricuspid valve stenosis and all patients were in New York Heart Association functional class 1.
CONCLUSION: This technique, which can facilitate exposure and closure of VSDs, did not compromise the tricuspid valve function at mid-term, therefore proving to be safe.
