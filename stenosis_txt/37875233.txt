Title: Prevalence and Clinical Outcomes of Noncardiac Surgery After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is a prevalent valvular heart disease, especially in the older people. They often coexist with other co-morbidities, and noncardiac surgery carries a higher risk because of the underlying valve condition. Despite the growing concern about the safety and optimal management of noncardiac surgery post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), there is limited evidence on this matter. This study aims to assess the clinical outcomes of noncardiac surgeries after TAVR. This retrospective study included 718 patients who underwent TAVR. Of these, 36 patients underwent noncardiac surgery after TAVR. The primary end point was the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events post-TAVR and the secondary end point was the incidence of structural valve deterioration. Composite end points included disabling stroke, heart failure requiring hospitalization, and cardiac death as defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium 3. Most of these surgeries were orthopedic and classified as intermediate risk. All noncardiac surgeries were performed without perioperative adverse events. There was no observed structural valve deterioration, and the incidence of composite end points did not significantly differ between the surgical and nonsurgical groups during the follow-up period. Noncardiac surgery after TAVR can be performed safely and does not have a negative impact on prognosis. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal strategy for noncardiac surgery after TAVR.
