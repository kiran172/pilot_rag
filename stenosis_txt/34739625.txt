Title: Perforations from Endoscopic Dilation of Corrosive Strictures in Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic dilation is an important therapeutic option for treatment of corrosive strictures. Its safety is unclear with variable perforation rates in previous studies. We aimed to evaluate its safety with regard to perforations and the effect of dilator type to perforation risk.
METHODS: A systematic review of published literature from inception to April 24, 2021, using PubMed and EMBASE databases was conducted. Studies in adult subjects (mean age ≥ 18 years) reporting perforation rates of endoscopic dilation of corrosive esophageal and/or gastric strictures were included. Pooled cumulative perforation rates were computed as primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included, perforation with each dilator subtypes, surgical or conservative modes of management and mortality. Random effect meta-analysis was used to estimate the frequency of each of these outcomes. Variables were reported as percentages with 95% CI.
RESULTS: A total of 712 subjects (N) who underwent 4840 dilations (n) were noted in the 15 studies that were included. Of which, eight were retrospective, while the remaining seven were prospective. On meta-analysis, the cumulative pooled perforation rate was 1% (1-2%) of the number of dilations (n%). The perforation rates with SG (1%, 0-3%) and balloon (1%, 0-5%) dilators were similar (p value < 0.01). 45/64 (59%, 11-94%) perforations were subjected to surgery while the remaining 14/64 (41%, 6-89%) was managed conservatively. Choice of management strategy was biased to the norms of the treating team. About 3/712 patients (0%, 0-2%) succumbed following perforation.
CONCLUSION: Perforation from endoscopic dilation of corrosive strictures occurs rarely, and there is no significant difference in perforation risk related to the type of dilator.
