Title: Endovascular management of transplant renal artery stenosis: A single-center retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and complications of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)/stenting in the treatment of transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS).
BACKGROUND: TRAS is a relatively rare condition, and currently, there is not enough study about interventional therapy for TRAS.
METHODS: Between April 2011 and July 2018, 33 patients with TRAS underwent interventional therapy. Analysis of parameters was as follows: technical success, pretreatment and posttreatment serum creatinine, and blood pressure, and vessel patency via ultrasound at 1, 6, and 12 months posttreatment and once a year thereafter.
RESULTS: One procedure failed. The success rate of PTA/stenting placement was 97.0%. Fourteen PTAs with 16 stents were primary interventions, with 2 stent procedures performed subsequently due to restenosis; the restenosis rate was 6.3%. During the follow-up period, two patients progressed to graft renal failure and three patients were lost to follow-up. The rest of the patients still had stable graft function and blood pressure. Compared with preoperative conditions, blood pressure and serum creatinine significantly decreased (p < .05). No treatment-related deaths or serious complications occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: PTA/stenting is a safe and effective treatment for TRAS. For selected TRAS patients, PTA or PTA with stent may achieve good therapeutic outcomes. Selecting appropriate puncture pathways may help improve the success rate and affect the operation results, and open surgery may be avoided.
