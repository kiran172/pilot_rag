Title: Multiple mycotic aneurysms of the aortic root after aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: A 74-year-old woman with severe aortic valve stenosis underwent aortic valve replacement with a pericardial bioprosthesis. Histological analysis of the excised valve showed dystrophic calcification associated with signs of healed infective endocarditis. Two months later, the patient died due to congestive heart failure. Autopsy revealed a bowel infarction and the presence of multiple mycotic aneurysms of the aortic root with mural thrombosis, which were unnoticed during the patient hospital stay and surgical window.
