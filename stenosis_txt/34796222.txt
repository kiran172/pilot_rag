Title: Case Report: Sapien 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve Embolization: Cause, Management, and Redo.

Abstract: The transcatheter heart valve (THV) embolization is a rare but challenging complication in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We report the case of an 81-year-old man with Sapien 3 embolization caused by interrupted rapid pacing. In this setting, we describe the embolized THV management and the technique of the second Sapien 3 implantation.
