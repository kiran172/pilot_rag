Title: Prospective evaluation of acute cerebral injury by DW-MRI following transcarotid artery revascularization using a double-layer micromesh stent.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcervical carotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has demonstrated a low overall stroke rate in carotid artery stenting (CAS). Furthermore, the use of a double-layer micromesh stent is expected to reduce embolization and plaque prolapse. The combination of TCAR and the double layer stent may lead to improved results compared to previously reported outcomes. The objective of this study is to present the findings of a prospective study including patients treated with the Roadsaver stent and TCAR.
METHODS: Between January 2017 and May 2022, 85 patients were enrolled. Every patient underwent TCAR with the Roadsaver stent. As per our protocol, a neurological examination and an ultrasound were performed within 24 hours before and after the procedure, and again 30 days after. A diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) was conducted 24 hours before the procedure and 48-72 hours after the procedure. The primary endpoint was the detection of new ischemic lesions on postoperative DW-MRI. The secondary endpoint was a composite of all strokes, death, and myocardial infarction within 30 days.
RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (75.29%) were symptomatic, out of which 25 were treated within 14 days of the onset of the symptoms. Pre and postprocedural DW-MRI were performed in 83 patients. Postprocedural lesions were found in nine patients (10.84%). There were no strokes or death within 30 days, but two patients experienced a myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of TCAR and the Roadsaver stent could be a safe alternative to carotid endarterectomy because it entails a low incidence of cerebral embolization, even in recently symptomatic and elderly patients.
