Title: Successful treatment of cholesterol crystal embolism with anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibody: a case report.

Abstract: Background: We report a unique case of renal cholesterol crystal embolism (CCE) induced by carotid artery stenting that was successfully treated with evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9).Case presentation: A 77-year-old man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease was referred to our department for decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-from 32.0 to 13.9 mL/min/1.73 m2-5 weeks after carotid artery stenting. Further examination revealed livedo reticularis in the bilateral toes and eosinophilia (723/μL). Skin biopsy from livedo reticularis tissue in the bilateral toes showed cholesterol clefts in the small arteries. The patient was therefore diagnosed with CCE. After 25 weeks' administration of evolocumab at a dose of 140 mg subcutaneously administered every 2 weeks, his eGFR had improved from 10.7 to 18.1 mL/min/1.73 m2.Conclusion: Evolocumab may have a beneficial effect on renal involvement in patients with CCE.
