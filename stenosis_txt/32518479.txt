Title: Robotic Surgery for Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament results in median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS). Using a consecutive cohort of patients with MALS, this study evaluated the efficacy and safety of robotic median arcuate ligament release (MALR).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who underwent robotic MALR from August 2012 to April 2018. Patient workup included history and physical examination, mesenteric Doppler ultrasound, and CT (Computed Tomography) scan. Outcomes included pain improvement, length of stay, operation duration, narcotic use, and postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Two thirds of the cohort were female and the mean age was 49 Â± 15.5 years. Postprandial abdominal pain was the most common preoperative symptom (25/27, 93%). CT (Computed Tomography) was performed in 24 (89%), and celiac stenosis > 70% was observed in all. Operative duration was 95 minutes on average (range, 53-358 minutes), and in 24/27 (89%) patients, estimated blood loss was < 100 mL. Eighty-one percent of patients were discharged the day of surgery (22/27). Two cases were converted to open, with only one major complication occurring. At 30 or more days postoperation, 17 patients (68%) had full, 1 (4%) partial, and 1 (4%) no symptom resolution, 6 (24%) had symptom recurrence after initially having resolution. Fifty-six percent achieved narcotic liberation 9/16 (56%).
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic MALR is a safe option for treatment of MALS with high response rates, early hospital discharge, and opportunity for narcotic liberation.
