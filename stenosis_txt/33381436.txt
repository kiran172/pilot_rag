Title: Narrative review of cardiac computed tomography perfusion: insights into static rest perfusion.

Abstract: Cardiac or left ventricular perfusion performed with cardiac computed tomography (CCT) is a developing method that may have the potential to complete in a very straight forward way the assessment of ischemic heart disease by means of CT. Myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) can be achieved with a single static scan during the first-pass of the iodinate contrast agent, with the monoenergetic or dual-energy acquisition, or as a dynamic, time-resolved scan during stress by using coronary vasodilator agents. Several methods can be performed, and we focused on static perfusion. CTP may serve as a useful adjunct to coronary CT angiography (CTA) to improve specificity of detecting myocardial ischemia. Technological advances will reduce the radiation dose of myocardial CTP, such as low tube voltage imaging or new reconstruction algorithms, making it a more viable clinical option. The advantages of static first-pass non-stress perfusion are several; the main one is that it can be done to each and every patient who undergoes CCT for the assessment of coronary artery tree. Future advances in CTP will likely improve the diagnostic accuracy of CTP + CTA, and will better estimate the severity of ischemia Therefore, it is simple and comprehensive. However, it has several limitations. In this review we will discuss the technique with its advantages and limitations.
