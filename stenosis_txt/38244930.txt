Title: Subretinal drusenoid deposits, age-related macular degeneration, and cardiovascular disease.

Abstract: Decades of studies on age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cardiovascular disease and stroke have not found consistent associations between AMD and systemic vascular disease. This study suggests that there is in fact no general relationship, but instead a strong, specific association between only the subretinal drusenoid deposit (SDD) phenotype of AMD on retinal imaging and certain co-existent vascular diseases that are high risk for compromised cardiac output or internal carotid artery stenosis. Future screening initiatives for these high -risk vascular diseases (HRVDs) with fast, inexpensive retinal imaging could make a significant contribution to public health and save lives. Likewise, screening patients with known HRVDs for unrecognized AMD of the SDD form could enable needed treatment and save vision.
