Title: Best Practices of Aortic Valve Replacement With the Edwards Intuity Elite Valve.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The Edwards Intuity Elite (EIE; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) valve system is a recent surgical aortic valve designed to expedite implantation, facilitate minimally invasive approaches, and provide low gradients, particularly in smaller valve sizes. The report reviews various best practices learned through experience with the EIE valve system.
DESCRIPTION: With its sealing frame designed to anchor and seal the valve after resection of the diseased native aortic valve, EIE use differs from that of conventional sutured valves.
EVALUATION: Critical technical aspects include patient selection, aortotomy and debridement, valve sizing, guiding suture technique and valve seating and deployment. In addition, special anatomic and pathologic conditions are considered, as well as intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and postimplantation cardiac rhythm monitoring.
CONCLUSIONS: These best practices simplify and standardize the use of the EIE valve system and may benefit surgeons adopting this valve.
