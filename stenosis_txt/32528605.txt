Title: Transient global amnesia following carotid artery stenting: A case report.

Abstract: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a neurological disorder characterized by sudden onset of anterograde and retrograde amnesia. TGA following angiography is rare and its possible etiologies have not been determined definitively. Herein, I report a case of TGA after carotid artery stenting with DWI findings, which, to date, has not been reported. The patient was a 71-year-old man who developed TGA following carotid artery stenting. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrated a focal restricted diffusion lesion in the left medial temporal lobe. Left carotid artery stenting was performed via the common femoral artery, and the procedural course was uneventful. However, the patient suffered an amnestic event 1 hour after the procedure. DWI performed 1 hour after amnesia onset revealed a small punctate restricted diffusion lesion in the left hippocampus. One day later, his amnesia spontaneously resolved. Although TGA after endovascular procedure is rare and usually has a favorable prognosis, clinicians and interventionists should be aware of this rare complication.
