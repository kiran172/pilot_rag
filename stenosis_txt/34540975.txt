Title: Geleophysic dysplasia caused by a mutation in FBN1: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) presents the characterized clinical manifestations of acromelic dysplasia, including extremely short stature, short limbs, small hands and feet, stubby fingers and toes, joint stiffness and others. It is clinically distinct from the other acromelic dysplasia in terms of symptoms such as cardiac valvular abnormalities, progressive hepatomegaly and tracheal stenosis.
CASE SUMMARY: We report on a Chinese 9-year-old girl with GD with the c.5243G&gt;T (p.C1748F) mutation in FBN1 (fibrillin 1, OMIM 134797). She was born in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. The patient presented with typical clinical features of GD and recurrent respiratory tract infections over 6 years. Laboratory studies and chest computed tomography (CT) scan indicated bronchopneumonia. Her echocardiography revealed mild mitral valve thickening with regurgitation. Laryngopharyngeal CT and electronic bronchoscopy revealed severe glottic stenosis. Echocardiography examination displayed mild mitral valve thickening and regurgitation. Ophthalmic examination did not reveal myopia or lens dislocation. Treated with ceftriaxone sodium and methylprednisolone sodium succinate for injection as well as methylprednisolone orally, patient's symptoms had improved.
CONCLUSION: GD is a rare genetic condition that can cause life-threatening cardiovascular and respiratory problems. This study also found that the identified genotype of GD could be related to different clinical phenotypes.
