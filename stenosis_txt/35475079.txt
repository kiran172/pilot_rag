Title: Anesthetic Management of a Patient With Common Carotid Artery Stenosis Undergoing Laryngeal Carcinoma Surgery: A Case Report.

Abstract: Laryngectomy is a common surgery for an oncosurgeon, but underlying carotid compromise is a serious concern for anesthesiologists, making this routine procedure a high-risk one. The utmost vigilance of the anesthesiologist is demanded by the surgery to prevent morbidities such as hemiplegia, hemiparesis, or speech abnormalities that may occur due to perfusion insufficiency secondary to the mechanical blockage of the carotid arteries. Hence, an undiagnosed case of carotid artery block may result in disastrous consequences for the patient, surgeon, and anesthesiologist. Hence, it is imperative to perform all the pre-operative investigations with due diligence. We present the case of a 74-year-old male who was admitted to our set-up for laryngeal carcinoma surgery. The patient had received chemoradiotherapy (CRT) six months earlier. He complained of hoarseness in his voice and a painless neck mass. He was a known case of hypertension for 14 years, controlled by oral medication, and had a history of stroke five years ago, when he was also diagnosed with a completely blocked right common carotid artery (CCA) and a partially blocked left common carotid artery.
