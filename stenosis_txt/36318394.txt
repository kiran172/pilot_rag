Abstract: Esophageal cancer has poor prognosis and high letality. With yearly 600,000 new cases worldwide it ist he sixt most common cancer worldwide and the eight most deadly. Squamous cell carcinoma is more common in Africa and Asia, whereas incidence of adenocarcinoma ist increasing in Norh America and Europe. Riskfactors include alcohol, smoking, obesity, esophageal stenosis or achalasia. Currently there are no recommendations for prevention strategies or cancer screening. Symptoms in early stages are unspecific, so diagnosis is made late. Diagnostics include gastroscopy, CT, PET and endosonography. Therapeutic approaches are depending on disease stage and patients general condition. In early stages endoscopic resection is the treatment of choice. In higher stages theraoy consists of surgical resection and radiochemotherapy. Generalised stade ist treated with palliative systemic therapy and local interventions.
