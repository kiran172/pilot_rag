Title: Psoas Muscle Area as a Predictor of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Frailty is a well-recognised predictor of outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Psoas muscle area (PMA) is a surrogate marker for sarcopaenia and is a validated assessment tool for frailty. The objective of this study was to examine frailty as a predictor of outcomes in TAVI patients and assess the prognostic usefulness of adding PMA to established frailty assessments.
METHODS: Frailty assessments were performed on 220 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI. These assessments used four markers (serum albumin, handgrip strength, gait speed, and a cognitive assessment), which were combined to form a composite frailty score. Preprocedural computed tomography scans were used to calculate cross-sectional PMA for each patient. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 1-year and post-procedure length of hospital stay.
RESULTS: Frailty status, as defined by the composite frailty score, was independently predictive of length of hospital stay (p=0.001), but not predictive of 1-year mortality (p=0.161). Albumin (p=0.036) and 5-metre walk test (p=0.003) were independently predictive of 1-year mortality. The PMA, when adjusted for gender, and normalised according to body surface area, was not predictive of 1-year mortality. Normalised PMA was associated with increased post-procedure length of stay within the female population (p=0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: A low PMA is associated with increased length of hospital stay in female TAVI patients but does not provide additional predictive value over traditional frailty scores. The PMA was not shown to correlate with TAVI-related complications or 1-year mortality.
