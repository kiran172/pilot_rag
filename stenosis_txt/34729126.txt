Title: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome revealing Takayasu's arteritis in a child.

Abstract: Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a rare complication of Takayasu's Arteritis. We report the case of an 11-year-old girl who presented with a tonic-clonic seizure and loss of consciousness, without fever. Imaging revealed characteristic white matter edema of the occipital and parietal lobes, in keeping with PRES. Further imaging demonstrated right renal artery stenosis and wall thickening of the abdominal aorta. The combination of hypertension, the discrepancy of blood pressure recordings between upper limbs, and imaging abnormalities of the aorta and the left renal artery led to the diagnosis of PRES secondary to Takayasu's Arteritis. Treatment with oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, amlodipine, and propranolol resulted in the complete resolution of the patient's symptoms and imaging abnormalities.
