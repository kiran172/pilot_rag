Title: Can double J stent complications be reduced in pediatric patients?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The use of double J (DJ) stents is frequent in urological pediatrics, but it is not exempt from morbidity. The objective of this study was to describe the risk factors (RF) of DJ complications in pediatric patients, and to analyze the quality of the information provided to the families with respect to the stent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of patients undergoing surgery with DJ placement in the urology department from 2017 to 2022 was carried out. Study patients were divided into two groups -complicated (C) and non-complicated (NC). A multivariate analysis was performed to identify complication-related RFs, and a quality analysis as perceived by the families was conducted by means of a satisfaction survey (0 = total dissatisfaction; 10 = maximum satisfaction).
RESULTS: 180 patients were included (236 DJs). The main diagnoses included renal transplantation (29.8%), ureteropelvic stenosis (26%), and urolithiasis (20.7%). Complication rate was 21.9%, with a mean comprehensive complication index (CCI) of 26.8. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was not associated with fewer complications (97.3% vs. 98.1%; p= 0.727). Complication RFs included more than one stent (p< 0.001; OR= 6.628) and bilateral placement (p< 0.05; OR= 4.871). Poor registration in the medical records was associated with greater complications (p= 0.025). In the information quality survey, 20% reported a score lower than 7/10.
CONCLUSIONS: DJ-associated morbidity has a direct relationship with DJ duration, bilaterality, and carrying more than one stent in a lifetime. Adequate registration in the medical records is associated with shorter DJ duration, and therefore, fewer complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce complications, which means its routine use should be reconsidered.
