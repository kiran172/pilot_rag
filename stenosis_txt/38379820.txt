Title: Tracheopathia osteochondroplastica-A benign disorder with a daunting appearance.

Abstract: Tracheopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) is a rare and benign condition. It typically manifests as multiple osteocartilaginous nodules in the submucosa of the central airway. TO-related clinical symptoms and physical signs are nonspecific. The bronchoscopic examination is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Treatment for TO is mostly conservative and symptom-oriented. The prognosis of TO is generally good, although cases of associated airway stenosis have been reported. In this case report, we describe the clinical, imaging, and histological features, and videoed bronchoscopic findings, of a middle-aged male patient with incidentally diagnosed TO.
