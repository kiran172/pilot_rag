Title: Sigmoid Sinus Wall Anomalies Can Progress and May Not Be Congenital.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Sigmoid sinus wall anomalies (SSWA) are closely linked to venous pulsatile tinnitus (PT). This study aims to demonstrate that SSWA develops progressively rather than being congenital.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 42 PT patients with SSWA who had at least two non-operative CT scans at our clinic. CT images were longitudinally assessed to track SSWA progression, while MRI and Doppler ultrasound evaluated transverse sinus stenosis and venous hemodynamics. Changes in PT perception were tracked using the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) questionnaire.
RESULTS: Among the 42 SSWA patients, 12 (28.6%) exhibited progression. Anastomosis between diploic vein and diverticulum was significantly higher compared to the dehiscence cohort (p &lt; 0.01). Within the diverticulum group, seven individuals (30.4%) experienced enlargement, with a mean diverticular wall expansion of 5.9% ± 11.4%. Progressive erosion was observed in two cases (12.5%) in the dehiscence cohort, with a mean sigmoid plate erosion of 3.8% ± 10.1%. In cases progressing from dehiscence to diverticulum, three subjects transitioned, with a mean sigmoid sinus wall length expansion of 43.8% ± 31.9%. SSWA progression showed a significant negative correlation with Q<sub>BILATERAL</sub> (r = -0.857, p = 0.014), and there was a significant difference between initial and revisit THI scores (p &lt; 0.01).
CONCLUSION: SSWA can undergo morphological progression, indicating it is a progressive clinical condition rather than congenital.
