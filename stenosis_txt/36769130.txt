Title: The Association between Apolipoprotein B, Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Subclinical Atherosclerosis-Findings from the SEPHAR National Registry on Hypertension in Romania.

Abstract: The present study aimed to investigate the association between apolipoprotein B (Apo B) and classical features associated with clinical or subclinical atherosclerosis. A total of 811 adult patients from the general Romanian population, included in the national SEPHAR registry on hypertension, were divided into two groups based on Apo B value (low versus high Apo B with a cut-off established at 130 mg/dL) and subsequently into four subgroups according to the cut-offs recommended by the 2021 ESC Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. In all patients, lipid profile, uric acid, full blood count and presence of significant carotid plaques were assessed. Apo B levels were positively correlated with proatherogenic lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol, p &lt; 0.0001) and negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol (all p &lt; 0.05). In comparison with patients with low Apo B levels, those with elevated Apo B levels more frequently presented significant carotid plaques (17% vs. 19% vs. 28% vs. 46%, p &lt; 0.0001). Univariate regression analysis identified a strong association between the level of uric acid and increased value of Apo B in the four subgroups (uric acid 4.8 +/- 1.3 vs. 5 +/- 1.6 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.5 vs. 5.8 +/- 1.6, r = 0.2, p &lt; 0.0001). The results of this nationwide registry on hypertension in Romania indicate that high Apo B may be considered as a risk factor for CVD, promoting atherosclerosis and associated with increased expression of classical markers of clinical or subclinical CVD.
