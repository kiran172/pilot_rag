Title: Considerations in the Diagnosis and Management of Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Left Heart Disease.

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease (PH-LHD) remains the most common cause of pulmonary hypertension globally. Etiologies include heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction and left-sided valvular heart diseases. Despite the increasing prevalence of PH-LHD, there remains a paucity of knowledge about the hemodynamic definition, diagnosis, treatment modalities, and prognosis among clinicians. Moreover, clinical trials have produced mixed results on the usefulness of pulmonary vasodilator therapies for PH-LHD. In this expert review, we have outlined the critical role of meticulous hemodynamic evaluation and provocative testing for cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Therapeutic strategies-pharmacologic, device-based, and surgical therapies used for managing PH-LHD-are also outlined. PH-LHD in advanced heart failure, and the role of mechanical circulatory support in PH-LHD is briefly explored. An in-depth understanding of PH-LHD by all clinicians is needed for improved recognition and outcomes among patients with PH-LHD.
