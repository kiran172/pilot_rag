Title: Diagnostic performance of high and ultra-high-resolution photon counting CT for detection of coronary artery disease in patients evaluated for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: We assessed the diagnostic performance of both ultra-high-resolution (UHR) and high-resolution (HR) modes of photon-counting detector (PCD)-CT within the confines of standard pre-TAVI CT scans, as well as the performance of UHR mode adjusted specifically for coronary imaging, using quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) as the reference. We included 60 patients undergoing pre-TAVI planning CT scans. Patients were divided into 3 groups: 20 scanned in HR mode, 20 in UHR mode, and 20 in adjusted UHR mode, on a dual-source PCD-CT. The adjusted UHR mode employed a lower tube voltage (90 kV vs. 120 kV) and a higher image quality level (65 vs. 34) to enhance coronary artery visualization. Patients underwent invasive coronary angiography as part of clinical routine. CCTA and QCA were reviewed to assess CAD presence defined as stenosis ≥ 50% in proximal and middle coronary segments. We included 60 patients (mean age 79 ± 7 years; 39(65%) men). Mean heart rate during scanning was 72 ± 13 bpm. Median coronary calcium score was 973 [379-2007]. QCA identified significant CAD in 24 patients (40%): 9 patients scanned with HR mode, 10 patients with the UHR mode, and 5 patients with the UHR adjusted mode. Per-patient area under the curves were 0.57 for HR, 0.80 for UHR, and 0.80 for adjusted UHR, with no significant differences between the scan modes, and per-vessel the area under the curves were 0.73 for HR, 0.69 for UHR, and 0.87 for adjusted UHR, with significant differences between UHR and adjusted UHR (p = 0.04). UHR and adjusted UHR modes of dual source PCD-CT show potential for improved sensitivity and negative predictive value for detecting CAD in patients undergoing pre-TAVI scans, however, no statistically significant difference from HR mode was observed.
