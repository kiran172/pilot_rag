Title: Identifying the Cause of Acute Left-Sided Visual Loss: A Clinical Dilemma.

Abstract: Given the global increase in the incidence of head and neck cancers over the last decade, the use of chemoradiation has also increased. It is well known that chemotherapy/radiation are established standard therapies in head and neck cancers, especially in patients who are not candidates for surgery. Despite this increase in chemoradiation therapies in head and neck cancers, there is a lack of established guidelines on the surveillance and screening of these patients for long-term complications. We present an interesting case of acute left eye blindness in a veteran patient with a history of laryngeal cancer status post chemoradiation and in the setting of a left ventricular (LV) thrombus on anticoagulation resulting in a diagnostic challenge determining the etiology. This case emphasizes the need for thorough patient-centered annual evaluation, thus providing an opportunity for early noninvasive or minimally invasive intervention.
