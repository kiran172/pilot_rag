Title: Complications of TAVR From an Anesthesia Perspective.

Abstract: Description Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the predominant technique for aortic valve replacement in the United States. Initially approved for high surgical risk patients, TAVR is now approved for most patients requiring valve therapy, including younger, lower-risk patients. The procedure is ideally performed in a hybrid operating room equipped with fluoroscopic equipment and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) imaging that can be viewed simultaneously by the operating team. The operating room should also be equipped to allow initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, if necessary. Cardiac anesthesia teams are often involved with the management of these patients. This mini-review is designed to summarize potential complications that anesthesiologists may contend with during TAVR.
