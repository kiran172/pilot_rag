Title: Cardiac MR imaging of cor triatriatum sinister in an elderly man: A rare case report.

Abstract: Cor triatriatum sinister an interesting and relatively rare congenital condition in which the left atrium is bisected by a fibromuscular membrane into 2 distinct chambers. Classically, patients are diagnosed at an early age, although in some cases they remain asymptomatic until adulthood and this is mainly due to differences in the degree of obstruction to pulmonary venous return and the presence of associated lesions. However, some patients may remain asymptomatic into adolescence or late adulthood due to incomplete membranes or other favorable circumstances. Although there are only a few cases where cardiac MRI has been used to diagnose cor triatriatum sinister, it is very suitable for making the diagnosis. important to carefully evaluate cases of cor triatriatum sinister, as it resembles the physiology of mitral stenosis. Such cases in elderly individuals accompanied by mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are very rare. We want to present a case of a diagnosed cor triatriatum with mitral and tricuspid regurgitation in a 73-year-old male, who was hospitalized due to signs of heart failure. The diagnosis was made using MRI.
