Title: Congenital Stenosis of the Spine-A Cross-Sectional Study of 1019 Whole-Spine Computed Tomography Scans to Determine Prevalence and Association Among Multilevel, Tandem, and Triple Region Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGOUND: Patients with congenital stenosis of the spine (CSS) present with clinical symptoms at an early age and fewer degenerative hypertrophic changes than the more common degenerative cohort. Literature is lacking in the true prevalence of CSS affecting the 3 segments of the spine in isolation, as well as in tandem in the Indian subcontinent.
METHODS: Anteroposterior spinal canal diameter in axial plane computed tomography at the midvertebral level was measured in asymptomatic patients with whole-spine computed tomography. Spinal canal stenosis was defined as a diameter of <12 mm for the cervical region, <12 mm for the thoracic region, and <13 mm for the lumbar region. Single-level and multilevel stenosis, as well as tandem and triple-region stenosis, were evaluated.
RESULTS: The results show the prevalence of CSS as 16.6%, 11.5%, and 20.1% involving the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, respectively. Single-level stenosis affected 90.6%, 94%, and 79.8% of the patients with cervical, thoracic, and lumbar CSS, respectively. Tandem stenosis affected 10.4% of the population (n = 104), with cervicolumbar stenosis being the most prevalent (n = 51, 5%). The presence of CSS in any one segment of the spine was significantly associated with the presence of stenosis at one of the other segments (P < 0.05). Triple-region stenosis was seen in 0.3% (n = 3) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cervical, thoracic, lumbar and tandem stenosis from our study is established at 16.6%, 11.5%, 20.1%, and 10.4%. Additionally, our study demonstrates the association between stenosis of the different regions of the spine.
