Title: Potential of circulating pro-angiogenic microRNA expressions as biomarkers for rapid angiographic stenotic progression and restenosis risks in coronary artery disease patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the correlation of pro-angiogenic microRNA (miRNA) expressions with rapid angiographic stenotic progression (RASP) and restenosis risks in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES).
METHODS: A total of 286 CAD patients underwent PCI with DES were consecutively recruited in this study. Plasma samples were collected before PCI operation, and 14 pro-angiogenic miRNAs were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Rapid angiographic stenotic progression at nontarget lesions and restenosis at stented lesions were evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography at 12Â months after PCI operation.
RESULTS: The occurrence rates of RASP and restenosis were 39.5% and 22.4%, respectively. Let-7f, miR-19a, miR-19b-1, miR-92a, miR-126, miR-210, and miR-296 were decreased in RASP patients than non-RASP patients, among which let-7f, miR-19a, miR-126, miR-210, and miR-296 independently correlated with lower RASP occurrence by multivariate analysis, followed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve exhibited that these five miRNAs showed great value in predicting RASP risk with area under curve (AUC) 0.879 (95% CI: 0.841-0.917). Besides, let-7f, miR-19a, miR-92a, miR-126, miR-130a, and miR-210 were reduced in restenosis patients than non-restenosis patients, among them miR-19a, miR-126, miR-210, and miR-378 independently correlated with lower restenosis occurrence by multivariate analysis, followed by ROC curve disclosed that these four miRNAs had good value in predicting restenosis risk with AUC 0.776 (95% CI: 0.722-0.831).
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating let-7f, miR-19a, miR-126, miR-210, and miR-296 independently correlate with reduced RASP risk, while miR-19a, miR-126, miR-210, and miR-378 independently correlate with decreased restenosis risk in CAD patients underwent PCI with DES.
