Title: Current Endovascular Approach in Adult Patients with Pulmonary Vein Stenosis: A State-of-the-Art Approach.

Abstract: Regarding to more invasive treatment of atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation ablation) and pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), the rate of acquired pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is increasing and at present, PV ablation for AF has become the principal cause of PVS in adult patients. On the other way, by improvement in procedural techniques, equipment, and the experience of the operators, the incidence of PVS has been decreased. There is some controversy about the manner of follow-up of these patients and in most centers, just symptomatic patients are considered for imaging and treatment. Almost always, those with PV stenosis more than 70% or multiple PV involvement become symptomatic and if give them up without treatment, pulmonary symptoms and finally irreversible pulmonary hypertension will occurred. So, intensive pursue after the procedure is highly recommended. Whereas in pediatric patients with congenital or acquired PVS, the best treatment approach is surgery, in adult patients, the preferred type of treatment is the transcatheter intervention with high acute success rate. In this present review, we have scrutinized about the diagnostic modalities, the indications for intervention, the diverse treatment strategies, and principally clarify an accurate stepwise approach during transcatheter procedure.
