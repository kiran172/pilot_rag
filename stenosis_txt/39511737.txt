Title: Temporal Bone Gunshot Wounds: A Multi-institutional Retrospective Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate management practices and outcomes in a retrospective cohort of patients who have sustained temporal bone gunshot wounds (TBGSW).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Five participating hospitals.
PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients met inclusion criteria: experienced a TBGSW, survived ≥30 days following the injury, and were evaluated and managed by a neurotologist between 2019 and 2023.
INTERVENTIONS: No specific interventions were performed for the purposes of this study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characteristics, evaluation, management, and outcomes of TBGSW survivors.
RESULTS: Patients were found to have a mean age of 33 ± 18 years and were predominantly male (18/22, 81.8%). Majority of patients (17/22, 77.3%) had mastoid injury. Most patients (14/22, 63.6%) had some evidence for vascular injury, most frequently the internal carotid artery (9/22, 40.9%). Almost three-quarters (17/22, 77.3%) of patients had clinical exam findings of facial nerve injury, which was the most common indication for surgery. Otologic surgery was performed in 72.7% (16/22), with delayed adverse events most commonly including cholesteatoma and external auditory canal stenosis. Though evidence for hearing impairment was clinically present in at least 15 of 22 patients (68.2%), hearing rehabilitation was pursued in only two patients.
CONCLUSION: With increasing numbers of TBGSW survivors, there is a growing need for practicing neurotologists to be familiar with the wide spectrum of injury patterns and possible complications to inform clinical management in these patients. Early neurotologic assessment and follow-up beyond the acute period is crucial to minimize morbidity in this high-risk cohort.
