Title: Natural history of subaortic stenosis in 166 dogs (1999-2011).

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Subaortic stenosis (SAS) is one of the most common congenital cardiac diseases in dogs. The objective of this study was to provide survival times on a large population of dogs with SAS and to propose a redefined pressure gradient (PG) scale to include a mild, moderate, severe and very severe disease group.
ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dogs were divided into four groups based on the Doppler-derived PG across the stenosis. Disease severity was defined as follows: mild = PG < 50 mmHg; moderate = PG range 50-80 mmHg; severe = PG range 80-130 mmHg; and very severe = PG > 130 mmHg. Over the study period (1999-2011), 166 client-owned dogs were diagnosed with SAS of which 129 had follow-up information available.
RESULTS: Unadjusted median survival time for severity groups were as follows: mild 10.6 years; moderate 9.9 years; severe 7.3 years; and very severe 3.0 years. Univariable analysis examining the effect of the PG, age at diagnosis and sex found only the PG and age at diagnosis had a significant effect on survival. Adjusted survival curves showed that the survival time in the very severe group was decreased compared with all other groups.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, a revised SAS classification system with four PG groups is appropriate. Dogs with a PG > 130 mmHg were identified as those with the lowest median survival time.
