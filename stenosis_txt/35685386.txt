Title: [Ogilvie´s syndrome as a rare complication of lumbar stenosis surgery: report of two cases and literature review].

Abstract: Ogilvie´s syndrome is an acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, characterized by massive colonic distension in the absence of mechanical cause. It is a very rare pathology after spinal surgery. We report two cases in the neurosurgery department of the University Hospital of Guadeloupe. A 79-year-old woman overweight (BMI= 27kg/m2) and a 56-year-old man experienced history of non-systematized bilateral lumbar and sciatic pain with reduction in walking perimeter for few months. MRI of lumbar spine had revealed a lumbar stenosis with disc herniation. They had undergone decompression surgery with laminectomy. The surgical intervention was uneventful perioperatively. By 48 hours after surgery, they had complained of constipation with cessation of fecal and flatus with resultant abdominal distension. Abdominal CT scan and X-rays showed significant bowel distension with no mechanical obstruction, suggestive of Ogilvie´s syndrome. Conservative treatment had been sufficient to treat this syndrome and the patients completely recovered. In the occurrence of Ogilvie´s syndrome, the most frequent pathology is the lumbar disc herniation. The clinical presentation is typical with a cessation of fecal and gas elimination, and abdominal distension. Conservative treatment remains the treatment of choice when diagnosis is made early.
