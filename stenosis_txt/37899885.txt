Title: Microarray Expression Profile and Bioinformatic Analysis of Circular RNA in Human Arteriosclerosis Obliterans.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) is the leading cause of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations. Multiple researches have suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) played vital regulatory functions in cancer and cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, the underlying effect and pathological mechanism of circRNAs in the formation and progression of ASO are still indistinct.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study used microarray analysis to investigate the expression portrait of circRNAs in normal lower extremity arteries and ASO arteries. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using the KEGG database to study the enrichment of differentially expressed circRNAs (DE circRNAs) and predict their functions. The accuracy of microarray assay was verified by evaluating expression of the top 5 upregulated and 5 downregulated circRNAs (raw density of normal group â‰¥200) using RT-qPCR. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network was further predicted using software. Compared to the normal lower extremity group, the ASO arteries with HE and EVG staining presented hyperplastic fibrous membrane and luminal stenosis. A total of 12,735 circRNAs were identified, including 1196 DE circRNAs with 276 upregulated and 920 downregulated in ASO group based on |log2(FC)| &gt; 1 and padj &lt; 0.05. Among selected 10 circRNAs, RT-qPCR confirmed that hsa_circ_0003266, hsa_circ_0118936 and hsa_circ_0067161 were upregulated while hsa_circ_0091934 and hsa_circ_0092022 were downregulated in ASO group (p &lt; 0.05). GO analysis presented that the DE circRNAs were primarily enriched in protein binding, intracellular part and organelle organization. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that MAPK signaling pathway, human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, proteoglycans in cancer were associated with the DE circRNAs. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactive network revealed that both mRNAs and miRNAs linked to circRNAs played an indispensable role in ASO.
CONCLUSION: This study described the expression portrait of circRNAs in human ASO arteries, and revealed the molecular background for further investigations of the circRNA regulatory mechanism in the formation and progression of ASO.
