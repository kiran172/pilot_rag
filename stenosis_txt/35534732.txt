Title: Safe oesophageal stent deployment using a checklist system instead of fluoroscopy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stenting is the management of choice for many benign and malignant oesophageal conditions and in the interest of safety stent insertion has traditionally been performed under fluoroscopic guidance. But this incurs additional expense, time, radiation risk and for the foreseeable future, an increased risk of Covid infection to patients and healthcare personnel. We describe a protocol that obviates the need for fluoroscopic guidance, relying instead on a systematic checklist to ensure safe positioning of the guidewire and the accurate positioning of the stent. The aim of this retrospective study was to review our experience of stent insertion employing a checklist system and compare our outcomes with outcomes using fluoroscopy in the literature.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected dataset of all patients undergoing oesophageal stent insertion between December 2007 and October 2019. The primary end points were patient safety parameters and complications of stent insertion.
RESULTS: Total of 163 stents were deployed of which 93 (57%) were in males and the median age was 67.9 years (25-92 years). Partially covered self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) were used in 80% of procedures (130/163). One hundred nineteen stents (73%) were for malignant strictures and 127 (78%) were deployed for strictures in the lower third of the oesophagus. There was no stent misplacement, injury, perforation or death associated with the procedure. Vomiting was the main post-operative complication (14%). Severe odynophagia necessitated stent removal in 3 patients. Stent migration occurred in 17 (10%) procedures with a mean time to stent migration of 6.4 weeks (range 1-20 weeks).
CONCLUSIONS: Oesophageal stent placement without fluoroscopy is safe provided that a strict checklist is adhered to. The outcomes are comparable to the results of fluoroscopic stent placement in the literature, with considerable saving in time, cost, personnel, and risks of radiation and Covid exposure.
