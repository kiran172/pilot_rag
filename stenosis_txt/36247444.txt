Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with quadricuspid aortic valve in a single center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is a rare congenital malformation that can present with aortic regurgitation or aortic stenosis (AS)), requiring surgical treatment. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative treatment for older patients and its prognosis for QAV therapy remains challenging. We sought to examine our early experience with TAVR in patients with QAV.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospectively collected data were retrospectively reviewed in patients with QAV undergoing TAVR in our institution.
RESULTS: Five patients with QAV and AR or AS were treated with TAVR between January 2016 and January 2022. The mean age was 73.8 years (range 69-82 years), and the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 7.51% (range 2.668-18.138%). Two patients had type B and three had either type A, D, or F according to the Hurwitz and Roberts classification for QAV. Four patients with pure aortic regurgitation underwent transapical TAVR using the J-Valve system, and the patient with severe AS underwent transfemoral TAVR using the Venus-A system. Procedural success was achieved in all five patients. Trivial paravalvular leak was only detected in one case after the procedure, and one patient received a permanent pacemaker due to high-degree atrioventricular block three days later. The median follow-up period was 18 (12-56) months. After discharge, no deaths occurred during the 1 year follow-up. All patients improved by ≥1 New York Heart Association functional class at 30 days; four patients were in functional class ≤II later in the follow-up period. All patients' heart failure symptoms improved considerably.
CONCLUSION: Our early experience with TAVR in QAV demonstrates these procedures to be feasible with acceptable early results. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the long-term outcomes of this modality.
