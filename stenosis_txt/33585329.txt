Title: Self-Expandable Transcatheter Aortic Valve Frame Infolding: An Increasingly Recognized Complication.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with either a balloon-expandable or a self-expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) is an approved therapy for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and high or intermediate surgical risk. Here we present a case of severe valve frame infolding of a CoreValve Evolut PROÂ® self-expandable THV (Medtronic Inc.), which was restored to optimal geometry with balloon post-dilation.
LEARNING POINTS: Clinicians should be aware of the rare complication of frame infolding during deployment of a self-expanding transcatheter valve.Multimodality cardiac imaging is important to optimize transcatheter valve deployment.
