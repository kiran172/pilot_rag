Title: Robotic hepaticojejunostomy: surgical technique and risk factor analysis for anastomotic leak and stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A variety of techniques have been described for the construction of the HJ (hepaticojejunostomy). Due to its technical challenges, HJ is rarely performed in a pure laparoscopic setting. In stark contrast, the increasing availability of the robotic platform has sparked new interest in pursuing this procedure in a minimally invasive fashion. The aim of our study was to describe our surgical technique and to identify risk factors for anastomotic leak and stenosis following robotic surgery.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database, including all consecutive HJ carried out for different indications over a 10 year period.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients undergoing robotic HJ performed by the same surgeon were analyzed. Bile leak occurred in 2.6% of the patients. Stricture rate was 3.3%. The median follow up was 25.5 months. There was no mortality related to anastomotic complications. On univariate analysis, patient's age less than 65 years was the only risk factor for anastomotic stricture. On multivariate analysis, no predictor factors for leak or stenosis were identified.
CONCLUSION: HJs carried out in a robotic fashion allow highly satisfactory results. No independent risk factors for bile leak of stenosis were identified on multivariate analysis.
