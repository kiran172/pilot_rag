Title: Minimally Invasive Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy with Linear Stapled Anastomosis Associated with Low Leak and Stricture Rates.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive foregut surgery is increasingly performed for both benign and malignant diseases. We present a retrospective series of patients who underwent minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIE) with linear stapled anastomosis performed at two centers in the USA, with a focus on evaluating leak and stricture rates.
METHODS: Patients treated from 2007 to 2018 were included, and data on demographics, oncologic treatment, pathology, and outcomes were analyzed. The surgical technique utilized laparoscopic and thoracoscopic access, with an intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis using a 6-cm linear stapled side-to-side technique.
RESULTS: A total of 124 patients were included and 114 resections (91.9%) were completed in a minimally invasive fashion with a 6-cm linear stapled side-to-side anastomosis. Patients were predominantly male (90.7%) with a median age of 66.0 years and body mass index of 28.8 kg/m2. Of 121 patients with malignancy, negative margins were obtained in 94.3% and median lymph node yield was 15 (IQR 12-22). In the intention to treat analysis, median operative time was 463 min (IQR 403-515), blood loss was 150 mL (IQR 100-200), and length of stay was 8 days (IQR 7-11). Postoperative complications were experienced by 64 patients (51.6%) including respiratory failure in 14 (11.3%) and pneumonia in 12 (9.7%). In patients who successfully underwent a 6-cm stapled side-to-side anastomosis, anastomotic leaks occurred in 6 patients (5.1%) without need for operative intervention, and anastomotic strictures occurred in 6 patients (5.1%) requiring endoscopic management.
CONCLUSIONS: Ivor Lewis MIE with a 6-cm linear stapled anastomosis can be completed with a high technical success rate, and low rates of anastomotic leak and stricture.
