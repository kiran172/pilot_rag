Title: Changes in Serum Copeptin and Sphingosine 1-Phosphate in Patients with Restenosis after Stent Implantation of Symptomatic Intracranial Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the changes of serum copeptin and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in patients with restenosis after stent implantation of symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis.
STUDY DESIGN: An observational study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Changyi people's Hospital, China, from February 2016 to November 2019.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 76 patients with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis and stent implantation were divided into the restenosis group (n = 16) and the non-restenosis group (n=60) according to the intracranial artery restenosis occurred after the follow-up of 1 year. Levels of serum copeptin and S1P were compared between the groups.
RESULT: There were significant differences in diabetes mellitus and hypertension between the two groups (p<0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). There were no significant differences in serum copeptin and S1P levels between the two groups before and 3 days after the operation (p = 0.927, 0.792, 0.776, and 0.906, respectively). Postoperative follow-up of one year, levels of serum copeptin in the restenosis group were higher than those in the non-restenosis group (p<0.001), and levels of serum S1P in the restenosis group were lower than those in the non-restenosis group (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: High serum copeptin level, low serum S1P level, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are independent risk factors promoting restenosis after stent implantation in patients with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis.
