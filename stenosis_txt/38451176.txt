Title: Prevalence and Associated Factors of Atherosclerotic Plaque and Stenosis in Renal Arteries: A Community-Based Study.

Abstract: The epidemiology of renal artery atherosclerosis in community populations is poorly documented. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of renal artery plaque (RAP) and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS), and the association of plaque and stenosis with vascular risk factors and kidney disease markers among community-dwelling adults. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the Polyvascular Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and Vascular Events (PRECISE) study. RAP and ARAS were evaluated by thoracoabdominal computed tomography angiography. A total of 3045 adults aged 50-75 years were included. The prevalence of RAP and ARAS was 28.7% and 4.8%, respectively. The prevalence of RAP and ARAS was 41.3% and 7.7% in individuals aged ≥60 years, 42.9% and 8.7% in hypertensives, and 45.4% and 8.5% in individuals with chronic kidney disease. Older age, hypertension, higher total cholesterol level, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were independently associated with RAP and ARAS. A higher urinary albumin-creatinine ratio was independently associated with RAP, whereas a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate was independently associated with ARAS. In conclusion, there was a non-negligible prevalence of RAP and ARAS among the older, community population in China.
