Title: A minimally invasive all-in-one approach for patients with left anterior descending artery disease and atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: The efficacy and safety of thoracoscopic atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting have been previously reported. Herein, we describe the successful combination of both procedures in a high-risk patient with symptomatic drug-refractory paroxysmal AF and a proximal left main stenosis. This innovative procedure offers patients an all-in-one, truly minimally invasive approach to treat AF and left anterior descending artery disease. Based on our initial experience, the procedure is safe and feasible.
