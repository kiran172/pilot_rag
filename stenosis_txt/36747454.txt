Title: Assessment of Right Ventricular Systolic Function with 3-Dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography in Isolated Mild Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In rheumatic severe mitral stenosis, right ventricular mechanics deteriorate with the increasing severity of mitral stenosis. Therefore, we aimed to investigate right ventricular mechanics in patients with mild mitral stenosis using 3-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography.
METHODS: In total, 40 patients with mild mitral stenosis and 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. Conventional echocardiographic examination was performed and 3-dimensional data sets were acquired for strain analysis. Besides conventional echocardiographic parameters, right ventricular volume and function and 3-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography-derived right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain were compared between patients with mild mitral stenosis and healthy controls.
RESULTS: Although 3-dimensional right ventricular volumes and ejection fraction were similar between the groups, 3-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography-derived right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain was significantly lower in patients with mild mitral stenosis than in controls (25.57 ± 4.39% vs. 27.90 ± 4.71%, P =.028). Significant correlations were observed between right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain and mitral valve area and estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.597, P <.001; r = -0.508, P =.003, respectively). Another significant positive correlation was observed between planimetric mitral valve area and 3-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography-derived right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (r = 0.597, P <.001).
CONCLUSION: The degree of severity of mild mitral stenosis in terms of mitral valve area can help in the early detection of subclinical right ventricular systolic function impairment which can be easily detected by 3-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. Right ventricular contractile performance could decrease even in mild mitral stenosis.
