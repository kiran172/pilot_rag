Title: German Experience with a Novel Balloon-Expandable Heart Valve Prosthesis for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation-Outcomes of the MYLAND (MYvaL germAN stuDy) Study.

Abstract: Background: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the initial experience in Germany with the Meril Myval™ (MM) transcatheter heart valve (THV) system for the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. The MM THV is a novel balloon-expandable valve with an expanded sizing matrix. Contemporary patients undergoing TAVI with the established Edwards Sapien™ (ES) THV served as the comparator group. Methods: Between 1st March and 31 August 2020 a total of 134 patients (33% female, 80.1 ± 6.7 years; EuroScore II 4.7 ± 4.8) underwent TAVI with an MM (95% transfemoral) for severe aortic stenosis at six German tertiary care centers. Results: Correct positioning of the THV was achieved in 98.5% (n = 132). Mean aortic gradients (MPG) were reduced from 42 ± 14 mmHg to 11 ± 5 mmHg. Mild postprocedural paravalvular leak (PVL) was observed in 62% (n = 82) patients, whereas only one patient had more than mild PVL. New permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) was indicated in 15 patients (11%). Major vascular complications occurred in 6.7% (n = 9) patients. The in-hospital combined incidence of all-cause death and stroke was 4.5% (n = 6). In the comparator group that included 268 patients, the 30-day incidences of PPI, major vascular complications, and the composite of all-cause death and stroke were 16%, 1.9%, and 7.1%, respectively; MPGs were reduced from 44 ± 15 mmHg to 12.8 ± 4.6 mmHg and the more than mild PVL occurred in 0.7%. Conclusions: The MM is a promising novel THV system, with performance comparable to the established ES THVs. These findings await confirmation by ongoing randomized trials.
