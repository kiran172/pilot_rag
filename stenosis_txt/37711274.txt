Title: Comprehensive Management of Takayasu Arteritis Using Immunologic and Antithrombotic Interventions With Cerebral Circulation Support: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 20-year-old woman with bilateral common carotid artery stenosis was diagnosed with Takayasu arteritis (TA). She suffered from a recurrent stroke, and repeated transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) occurred due to middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis. The clinical course indicated that TA contributed to MCA stenosis despite the negative results for serological inflammation markers. Immunotherapy with tocilizumab and methotrexate effectively reduced disease activity and improved symptoms. Bed rest and hydration prevented further TIAs and ischemic stroke progression. Long-term monitoring of neurological symptoms and angiography findings is essential to evaluate disease severity and treatment efficacy in TA patients with negative inflammatory markers.
