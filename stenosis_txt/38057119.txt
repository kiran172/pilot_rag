Title: Serum Exosomal MicroRNA-186-5p Positively Correlates with Lipid Indexes, Coronary Stenosis Degree, and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Coronary Heart Disease.

Abstract: Our previous study finds that exosomal microRNA (miR)-186-5p promotes viability and invasion of vascular smooth muscle cells to accelerate atherosclerosis via inactivating phosphoinositide 3 kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Subsequently, this study aimed to identify the linkage of serum exosomal miR-186-5p with clinical features and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Serum exosomal miR-186-5p was quantified in 175 CHD patients and 50 healthy controls (HCs) via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Our study revealed that serum exosomal miR-186-5p was enhanced in CHD patients vs. HCs (P < 0.001). In CHD patients, serum exosomal miR-186-5p was positively correlated with total cholesterol (P = 0.002) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.003). Elevated serum exosomal miR-186-5p was linked with increased Gensini score (P = 0.028) and stenosis degree categorized by the Gensini score (P = 0.018). Regarding MACE, the 1-year and 2-year accumulating MACE rate was 6.6% and 15.6%, respectively. Serum exosomal miR-186-5p was elevated in CHD patients with MACE vs. those without (P = 0.042). By Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analyses, serum exosomal miR-186-5p > 1.000 (P = 0.404) and > 1.610 (P = 0.328) was not related to accumulating MACE. While serum exosomal miR-186-5p > 3.390 exhibited a correlative trend with increased accumulating MACE, but not achieving statistical significance (P = 0.071). The 1-year and 2-year accumulating MACE rate of patients with serum exosomal miR-186-5p > 3.390 was 11.5% and 21.5%, respectively; while the rate was 3.3% and 11.5% in patients with serum exosomal miR-186-5p â‰¤ 3.390, accordingly. Conclusively, serum exosomal miR-186-5p positively associates with lipid level, coronary stenosis degree, and the risk of MACE in CHD patients.
