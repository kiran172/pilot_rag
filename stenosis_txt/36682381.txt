Title: Effectiveness of 1 and 2 per cent acetic acid solutions in the 2-week treatment of granular myringitis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Granular myringitis is characterised by de-epithelialisation of the tympanic membrane. Patients present with intermittent otorrhoea, otalgia or itching. With improper or inadequate treatment, granular myringitis could cause ear canal fibrosis and stenosis. There are no standard topical ear drops for granular myringitis. Treatments have inconsistent success rates and variable timelines. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of treating granular myringitis with 1 and 2 per cent acetic acid solutions for two weeks.
METHOD: This double-blind, randomised, controlled trial enrolled and randomly allocated 47 participants to 2 groups between October 2021 and June 2022.
RESULTS: After two weeks, the groups' treatment success rates did not differ significantly. There was a 10 per cent recurrence rate 8 weeks after treatment completion. All patients tolerated the diluted vinegar.
CONCLUSION: There is no difference in the efficacy of 1 and 2 per cent diluted vinegar in treating granular myringitis for two weeks.
