Title: Initial Experience of ERCP-Guided Radiofrequency Ablation as the Primary Therapy for Inoperable Ampullary Carcinomas.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ablation of duodenal ampullary malignancy has not been fully assessed.
AIMS: The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograpy (ERCP)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for inoperable ampullary cancer.
METHODS: Patients with inoperable ampullary cancer underwent ERCP-guided RFA from January 2012 to August 2017. RF energy (7-10 W) was delivered using bipolar RFA electrodes under endoscopic guidance. RFAs were repeated every 1-3 months until visible tumor was eliminated. All patients were followed up till June 2018, during which any biliary event was noted and managed endoscopically.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients underwent a median of two RFA sessions (range 1-6) at a median interval of 56 (range 35-90) days. Among 18 (78.3%) patients who received endoscopic re-evaluations, nine patients showed no remaining lesion and nine showed more than 50% tumor size reduction. During a median follow-up duration of 517 days (range 60-1836 days), eight (34.8%) patients required endoscopic re-interventions. The re-intervention rate at 6 months after RFA was 36.8%. Twelve patients were alive, among whom six required no biliary stenting. The accumulative mean survival was 1081 (95% CI 757.8-1404.0) days. RFA-related adverse events occurred in four cases (7.7%) including mild pancreatitis (1), bleeding (1), and late distal biliary stenosis (2).
CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that ERCP-guided RFA is safe to use and able to reduce tumor volume and re-interventions in patients with inoperable ampullary cancer.
