Title: Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient with Heyde syndrome with elevated factor VIII levels: A case report.

Abstract: Heyde syndrome is the association between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from intestinal angiodysplasia (IA) and aortic stenosis (AS). Although the course of disease progression that links AS and GI bleeding has not been determined, overlaps among AS, intestinal dysplasia, and acquired von Willebrand's syndrome is thought to result in GI bleeding. Proper repair of the aortic valve can result in significant improvement of GI bleeding and its recurrence. Herein, we are reporting this rare case, in which a patient with moderate AS on echocardiogram presents with recurrent GI bleeding from multiple IA in the setting of elevated factor VIII levels, to propose a theory that angiodysplasia could potentially develop due to intermittent, recurrent low-grade obstruction of submucosal veins at the level of the muscularis propria secondary to venous thrombosis related to elevated factor VIII levels.
