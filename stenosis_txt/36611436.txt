Title: Subtypes of the Completely Reversed Flow Waveform in Vertebral Artery Can Help to Differentiate Subclavian Artery Occlusion from Severe Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of subtypes of completely reversed flow (CRF) waveform in vertebral artery (VA) on Doppler ultrasound in differentiation occlusion from severe stenosis of the ipsilateral proximal subclavian artery (SA).
METHODS: A total of 357 patients with CRF in the VA on Doppler US were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, 49 patients (mean age, 68.2 ± 7.8 years) confirmed by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were included. According to the status of diastolic flow, the CRF was divided into continuous CRF (CCRF, n = 27) and intermittent CRF (ICRF, n = 22). The correlation of subtypes of CRF waveform and VA parameters with the severity of SA stenosis was evaluated. The severity of SA stenosis was determined by DSA.
RESULTS: Of those 49 patients, SA occlusion was observed in 33 patients (67%, occlusion group) and severe stenosis in 16 patients (33%, stenosis group). The subtypes of CRF waveforms showed a significant between-group difference (p = 0.005). CCRF exhibited an accuracy of 85.2% (23/27) in diagnosing SA occlusion. The diameter of the target VA with ICRF showed a significant between-group difference (p = 0.041). The target VA diameter ≥ 3.8 mm in ICRF achieved an accuracy of 81.8% (18/22), and its combination with CCRF achieved an accuracy of 83.7% (41/49) in the differentiation of SA occlusion from severe stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Subtypes of CRF in VA can help to differentiate SA occlusion from severe stenosis. CCRF has higher accuracy in diagnosing SA occlusion. The CCRF waveform plus VA diameter in ICRF is more accurate for differentiating SA occlusion from severe stenosis.
