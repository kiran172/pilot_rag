Title: Outcomes of percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in congenital pulmonary valve stenosis.

Abstract: Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (PBPV) is the primary treatment for pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS). The study consisted of 228 children with PVS who underwent PBPV from January 2004 to October 2019 at a single center. The risk factors for ≥moderate pulmonary regurgitation (PR), residual stenosis, and restenosis were analyzed based on the baseline patient characteristics and measured value of corresponding inspection results. Among 228 patients, follow-up results were obtained in 193 patients. The univariate analysis demonstrated that young age, low weight, small pulmonary annulus diameter, higher initial RV-PA PSEG, increased RV/systemic pressure ratio, and severe PVS were associated with ≥moderate PR. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that higher initial RV-PA PSEG and low weight were independently associated with ≥moderate PR, while higher initial RV-PA PSEG was independently associated with residual stenosis and restenosis. PBPV is a preferred tre atment in PVS children with a higher success rate. Higher initial RV-PA PSEG was a significant factor for ≥moderate PR, residual stenosis, and restenosis.
