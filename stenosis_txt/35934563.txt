Title: Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Men Versus Women.

Abstract: Gender-based differences in outcomes after successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation have not been well studied. We aim to evaluate gender-based differences in clinical outcomes after TAVI. In the present analysis of the GALILEO (Global study comparing a rivaroxaban-based antithrombotic strategy to an antiplatelet-based strategy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement to optimize clinical outcomes) trial, patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and who underwent successful TAVI were stratified by gender. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), a composite of all-cause mortality or thromboembolic events (including any stroke, myocardial infarction, symptomatic valve thrombosis, systemic embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism). Major bleeding was defined as a composite of major, life-threatening, or disabling Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 bleeding. Of 1,644 patients, 813 were female, and 831 were male. At baseline, female patients were older and at higher surgical risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score: 4.7 ± 3.6 versus 3.6 ± 3.0, p &lt;0.0001) than male patients. After adjustment for differences in baseline clinical and procedural parameters, female patients had lower rates of MACCE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 0.96), all-cause mortality (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.87), and noncardiovascular mortality (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75) at a median of 17 months of follow-up. By landmark analyses, these differences appeared to emerge with a longer follow-up time. No significant differences in major, life-threatening, or disabling bleeding, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke were noted. In conclusion, compared with male patients, female patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis had a lower risk of MACCE and mortality but a similar risk of bleeding events after TAVI.
