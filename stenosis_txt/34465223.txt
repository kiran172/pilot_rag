Title: Percutaneous Femoropopliteal Bypass: 2-Year Results of the DETOUR System.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study investigated the 2-year safety and effectiveness of the PQ Bypass DETOUR system as a percutaneous femoropopliteal bypass.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with 82 long-segment femoropopliteal lesions were enrolled in this prospective, single-arm, multicenter study. The DETOUR system deployed Torus stent grafts directed through a transvenous route. Eligible patients included those with lesions of >10 cm and average of 371±55 mm. Key safety endpoints included major adverse events (MAEs) and symptomatic deep venous thrombosis in the target limb. Effectiveness endpoints included primary patency defined as freedom from ≥50% stenosis, occlusion, or clinically-driven target vessel revascularization (CD-TVR), primary assisted, and secondary patency.
RESULTS: Chronic total occlusions and severe calcium occurred in 96% and 67% of lesions, respectively. Core laboratory-assessed total lesion length averaged 371±51 mm with a mean occlusion length of 159±88 mm. The rates of technical and procedural success were 96%, with satisfactory delivery and deployment of the device without in-hospital MAEs in 79/82 limbs. The MAE rate was 22.0%, with 3 unrelated deaths (4%), 12 CD-TVRs (16%), and 1 major amputation (1%). Deep venous thrombosis developed in 2.8% of target limbs, and there were no reported pulmonary emboli. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates by the Kaplan-Meier analysis were 79±5%, 79±5%, and 86±4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The PQ Bypass DETOUR system is a safe and effective percutaneous alternative to femoropopliteal open bypass with favorable results through 2 years. The DETOUR system provides a durable alternative to conventional endovascular modalities and open surgery for patients with long, severely calcified, or occluded femoropopliteal lesions.
