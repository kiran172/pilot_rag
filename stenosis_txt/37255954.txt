Title: The application of simultaneous mainstem bronchus dilation with pulmonary artery stenting in the context of hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

Abstract: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a congenital diagnosis that necessitates immediate intervention at the beginning of life to ensure survival past infancy and to optimize left-side cardiac function. Often, these required procedures can lead to deleterious side effects and resultant complications. In this case report, we present a 15-month-old patient with HLHS who underwent multiple procedures, including two aortic arch surgeries. After the interventions, the patient experienced left main pulmonary bronchus compression along with pulmonary artery stenosis. In this case, we outline an approach to performing vascular dilation without compromise of airway patency.
