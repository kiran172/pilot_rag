Title: Laser hemorrhoidoplasty for hemorrhoidal disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: Laser hemorrhoidoplasty (LHP) is known as a new minimally invasive and painless procedure for symptomatic hemorrhoids. However, Milligan-Morgan (MM) may offer the best result of long-term cure rates. In this study, we aim to compare the efficacy between LHP and MM for hemorrhoidal disease treatment. Using specific keywords, we comprehensively go through the potential articles on PubMed, Europe PMC, and Google Scholar sources until April 19, 2022. All published studies on LHP and MM hemorrhoidectomy were collected. Statistical analysis was done by using Review Manager 5.4 software. Twelve studies with a total of 1756 patients with hemorrhoid grades II-IV were included for the analysis. Our pooled analysis revealed that LHP was associated with shorter operative time (p < 0.00001), shorter length of hospital stay (p = 0.0005), lower risk of urinary retention (p = 0.005) and anal stenosis (p = 0.0004), and lower VAS 24-h post-operative (p < 0.00001) when compared with MM. However, LHP and MM did not differ in terms of recurrence rate (p = 0.70). LHP was superior to MM procedure in terms of shortening the recovery time and minimizing post-operative complications for patients with hemorrhoidal disease.
