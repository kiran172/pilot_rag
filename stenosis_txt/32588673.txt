Title: Plasma P-selectin level is associated with severity of coronary heart disease in Chinese Han population.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between plasma P-selectin levels and the severity of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a Chinese Han population.
METHODS: We enrolled 219 patients with CHD and 168 healthy individuals without CHD as a control group. Coronary stenosis was evaluated based on the number of diseased coronary arteries and the Gensini scoring system. P-selectin levels were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the association between CHD and plasma P-selectin level was analyzed.
RESULTS: P-selectin levels were significantly higher in CHD patients compared with controls. Levels were highest in patients with three-vessel disease and lowest in those with one-vessel disease, with significant differences among the groups. P-selectin levels were also highest in the high-score and lowest in the low-score group according to Gensini score, with significant differences among the groups. P-selectin level was significantly positively correlated with Gensini score and C-reactive protein level. Elevated P-selectin was identified as an independent risk factor for CHD.
CONCLUSION: P-selectin levels were increased in Chinese Han patients with CHD. P-selectin level is an independent risk factor for CHD and may serve as a biomarker reflecting the severity of CHD in the Chinese Han population.
