Title: Influence of preoperative aortic regurgitation on long-term autograft durability and dilatation in children and adolescents undergoing the Ross procedure.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Primary aortic insufficiency (AI) is a risk factor for autograft reintervention in adults undergoing the Ross procedure. We sought to examine the influence of preoperative AI on autograft durability in children and adolescents.
METHODS: From 1993 to 2020, 125 consecutive patients between ages 1 and 18 underwent a Ross procedure. The autograft was implanted using a full-root technique in 123 (98.4%) and included in a polyethelene terephthalate graft in 2 (1.6%). Patients with aortic stenosis (aortic stenosis group) (n = 85) were retrospectively compared with those with AI or mixed disease (AI group) (n = 40). Median length of follow-up was 8.2 years (interquartile range, 3.3-15.4 years). The primary end point was the incidence of severe AI or autograft reintervention. Secondary end points included changes in autograft dimensions analyzed using mixed-effect models.
RESULTS: The incidence of severe AI or autograft reintervention was 39.0% ± 13.0% in the AI group and 8.8% ± 4.4% in the aortic stenosis group at 15 years (P = .02). Annulus z scores increased in both aortic stenosis and AI groups over time (P < .001). However, the annulus dilated at a faster rate in the AI group (absolute difference, 3.8 ± 2.0 vs 2.5 ± 1.7; P = .03). Sinus of Valsalva z scores increased in both groups as well (P < .001), but at similar rates over time (P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with AI undergoing the Ross procedure have higher rates of autograft failure. Patients with preoperative AI have more pronounced dilatation at the annulus. Akin to adults, a surgical aortic annulus stabilization technique that modulates growth is needed in children.
