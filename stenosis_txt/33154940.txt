Title: Coronary Artery Ectasia with Acute Myocardial Infarction, A Case Report.

Abstract: Coronary artery ectasia (CAE), also known as aneurysmal coronary artery disease, is defined as an abnormal diffuse (ectasia) or segmental (aneurysmal) dilatation of any branch of the coronary arteries. It is a well-recognized entity with 1.2-4.9% prevalence. Our case is a 46 year old male with no prior medical problem who presented to the ER with inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The Coronary angiogram revealed multiple ectatic segments in the right coronary artery (RCA) with 100% stenosis in the middle segment. Upon wiring the RCA a big clot burden was noted on the ectatic segment. We planned to keep him on aggrastat infusion for 24 hours then re-cath him. The second cath showed complete resolution of the clot and the lesion was stented with drug eluting stent showing excellent final result. We found that our case is interesting and unique in exploring the association of CAE that presents with STEMI and how to treat it safely in the cath lab, knowing that CAE is an uncommon finding during coronary angiography. CAE is associated with many coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors and etiologies as well as pathologic progression. Patients with CAE are usually asymptomatic but can still present with symptoms of coronary artery occlusion. There is still no standard treatment specific for CAE itself, but when presenting with occlusive symptoms, management is guided by the extent of occlusion similar to CAD.
