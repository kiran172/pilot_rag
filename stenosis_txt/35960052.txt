Title: Which factor can predict the effect of indirect decompression using oblique lumbar interbody fusion?

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between various factors of indirect decompression. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of indirect decompression. There is no consensus regarding the predictive factors for indirect decompression. Facet joint gap (FJG) and bulging disc thickness (BDT) have never been considered as factors in other studies. We retrospectively reviewed 62 patients who underwent OLIF L4/5 between April 2018 and September 2020. The relationships between cross-sectional area (CSA) change, CSA change ratio, spinal stenosis grade, and various factors were studied. Various factors related to indirect decompression, such as ligament flavum thickness (LFT), foraminal area (FA), disc height (DH), bulging disc thickness(BDT), and facet joint gap (FJG), were measured. CSA increased from 69.72 mm2 preoperatively to 115.95 mm2 postoperatively (P < .001). BDT decreased from 4.97 mm preoperatively to 2.56 mm postoperatively (P < .001). FJG (Right) increased from 2.99 mm preoperatively to 4.38 mm postoperatively (P < .001). FJG (Left) increased from 2.95 mm preoperatively to 4.52 mm postoperatively (P < .001). The improvement of spinal stenosis grade was as follows: 1 point up group, 38 patients; 2 point up groups, 19 patients; and 3 point up groups, 3 patients. The correlation factors were prespinal stenosis grade (0.723, P < .00), CSA change (0.490, P < .00), and FJG change ratio (left, 0.336, P < .008). FJG showed statistical significance with indirect decompression. Indirect decompression principles might be utilized in patients with severe spinal canal stenosis (even grade 4).
