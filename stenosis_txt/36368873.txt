Title: K+ channels in the coronary microvasculature of the ischemic heart.

Abstract: Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death and a major public health and economic burden worldwide with expectations of predicted growth in the foreseeable future. It is now recognized clinically that flow-limiting stenosis of the large coronary conduit arteries as well as microvascular dysfunction in the absence of severe stenosis can each contribute to the etiology of ischemic heart disease. The primary site of coronary vascular resistance, and control of subsequent coronary blood flow, is found in the coronary microvasculature, where small changes in radius can have profound impacts on myocardial perfusion. Basal active tone and responses to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors are paramount in the regulation of coronary blood flow and adaptations in signaling associated with ion channels are a major factor in determining alterations in vascular resistance and thereby myocardial blood flow. K+ channels are of particular importance as contributors to all aspects of the regulation of arteriole resistance and control of perfusion into the myocardium because these channels dictate membrane potential, the resultant activity of voltage-gated calcium channels, and thereby, the contractile state of smooth muscle. Evidence also suggests that K+ channels play a significant role in adaptations with cardiovascular disease states. In this review, we highlight our research examining the role of K+ channels in ischemic heart disease and adaptations with exercise training as treatment, as well as how our findings have contributed to this area of study.
