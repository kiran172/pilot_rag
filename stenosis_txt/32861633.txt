Title: 1-Month Results From a Prospective Experience on CAS Using CGuard Stent System: The IRONGUARD 2 Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate 30-day safety and efficacy of dual-layer mesh-covered carotid stent systems for carotid artery stenting (CAS) in the clinical practice.
BACKGROUND: When compared with carotid endarterectomy, CAS has been associated with a higher rate of post procedural neurologic events; these could be related to plaque's debris prolapsing through stent's mesh. Consequently, the need for increased plaque coverage has resulted in the development of dual-layer mesh-covered carotid stent systems.
METHODS: From January 2017 to June 2019, a physician-initiated, prospective, multispecialty registry enrolled 733 consecutive patients undergoing CAS using the CGuard embolic prevention system in 20 centers. The primary endpoint was stroke up to 30 days; secondary endpoints were technical and procedural success; external carotid artery occlusion; and in-hospital and 30-day transient ischemic attack (TIA), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and death rates.
RESULTS: Symptoms were present in 131 (17.87%) patients. An embolic protection device was used in 731 (99.72%) patients. Procedural success was 100%, technical success was obtained in all but 1 (99.86%) patient, who died in hospital due to a hemorrhagic stroke. Six TIAs, 2 minor strokes, and 1 AMI occurred during in-hospital stay, and external carotid artery occlusion was evident in 8 (1.09%) patients. Between hospital discharge and 30-day follow-up, 2 TIAs, 1 minor stroke, and 3 AMIs occurred. Therefore, the cumulative stroke rate was 0.54%.
CONCLUSIONS: This real-world registry suggests that use of CGuard embolic prevention system in clinical practice is safe and associated with a minimal occurrence of adverse neurological events up to 30-day follow-up.
