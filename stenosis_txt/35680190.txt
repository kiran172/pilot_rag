Title: Long-Term Follow-Up of Hypoattenuated Leaflet Thickening After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) occurs in at least 10% of all transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients. The long-term prognostic impact of HALT is uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the long-term risk of early HALT post-TAVR.
METHODS: We report outcome data from our prospective observational registry with post-TAVR computed tomography angiography performed between May 2012 and December 2017. The outcomes were survival, cardiovascular mortality, ischemic cerebrovascular events, and symptomatic hemodynamic valve deterioration.
RESULTS: Early HALT was diagnosed in 115 (16.0%) of 804 patients. During a median follow-up of 3.25 years, survival rates did not differ significantly between patients with and without HALT (Kaplan-Meier 3-year estimates for survival 70.1% vs 74.0%, P = 0.597). The 3-year cardiovascular mortality rate was 13.2% versus 11.3% (with vs without HALT, P = 0.733). The 3-year event rate for cerebrovascular events was 2.0% versus 4.4% (with vs without HALT, P = 0.246), and the 3-year event rate of symptomatic hemodynamic valve deterioration was 9.4% versus 1.5% (with vs without HALT, P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed the following predictors of symptomatic hemodynamic valve deterioration: HALT (HR: 6.10; 95% CI: 2.59-14.29; P < 0.001), the mixed valve-type group (HR: 6.51; 95% CI: 2.38-17.81; P < 0.001), and prosthesis diameter (HR valve size per 3 mm [HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.17-0.79]; P = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: During a median follow-up of more than 3 years, HALT was not associated with mortality or cerebrovascular events. However, we observed an association of HALT with symptomatic hemodynamic valve deterioration.
