Title: Research progress in apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) is one of the main cell types in blood vessel wall, and the VSMC apoptosis is involved in the development of atherosclerosis (AS). In early AS, the apoptosis of VSMC is regarded as a compensatory mechanism for neointimal hyperplasia and lumen stenosis. However, this process will also accelerate the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in serious cardiovascular complications. More studies on the related genes, RNA, and inducing factors of VSMCs apoptosis in occurrence and development of AS can provide scientific strategies for prevention and treatment of AS in different periods.
