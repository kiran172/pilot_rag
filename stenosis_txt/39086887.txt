Title: Rates, predictors, and causes of readmission after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a revolutionary procedure for severe aortic stenosis. The coexistence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and TAVR introduces a challenge that significantly impacts patient outcomes.
AIM: To define readmission rates, predictors, and causes after TAVR procedure in CKD stage 1-4 patients.
METHODS: We used the national readmission database 2018 and 2020 to look into readmission rates, causes and predictors after TAVR procedure in patients with CKD stage 1-4.
RESULTS: Out of 24758 who underwent TAVR and had CKD, 7892 (32.4%) patients were readmitted within 90 days, and had higher adjusted odds of being females (adjusted odds ratio: 1.17, 95%CI: 1.02-1.31, P = 0.02) with longer length of hospital stay &gt; 6 days, and more comorbidities including but not limited to diabetes mellitus, anemia, and congestive heart failure (CHF).
CONCLUSION: Most common causes of readmission included CHF (18.0%), sepsis, and complete atrioventricular block. Controlling readmission predictors with very close follow-up is warranted to prevent such high rate of readmission.
