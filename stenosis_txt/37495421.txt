Title: [Clinical characteristics of sudden sensorineural hearing loss with acute cerebral infarction].

Abstract: Objective: To analyze the clinical and imaging features of patients with sudden sensorineural deafness and acute cerebral infarction in order to provide evidence for early recognition of such diseases. Methods: This was a case series reporting study. A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical and imaging data of 29 patients with sudden hearing loss (SHL) who admitted to the Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Department of Beijing Tiantan Hospital from January 2017 to December 2021 and diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction using MRI-DWI. Results: The patients were aged 31-71 years, with an average age of 56Â±12 years, and 82.8% (24/29) were men. In total, 82.8% (24/29) of the patients had three or more atherosclerotic risk factors, and 24.1% (7/29) had a history of SHL. The hearing types were flat and total deafness: 86.2% (25/29) of the patients had severe hearing loss, 27.6% (8/29) had bilateral SHL, 17.2% (5/29) had further hearing loss during hospitalization, and 82.8% (24/29) had dizziness or vertigo at the onset. The signs of central nervous system involvement mainly included speech impairment, diplopia, dysphagia, central facial paralysis, facial and limb hypoesthesia, ataxia, and decreased muscle strength. Imaging evaluation showed that 21 cases were located in the posterior circulation supply area and 8 cases in the anterior circulation supply area. Additionally, 82.8% (24/29) patients had vertebrobasilar artery stenosis, and 58.6% (17/29) patients had severe vertebrobasilar artery stenosis or occlusion. Conclusions: Patients with SHL who progress to cerebral infarction often have multiple atherosclerotic risk factors and SHL. Most of the patients are middle-aged and older men who often complain of dizziness or dizziness accompanied by severe flat and total deafness with unilateral or bilateral SHL. Imaging findings suggest that most patients have posterior circulation infarction, often accompanied by severe stenosis or occlusion of the vertebrobasilar artery.
