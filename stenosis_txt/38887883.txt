Title: Impact of leaflet splitting on coronary access after redo-TAVI for degenerated supra-annular self-expanding platforms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary access (CA) is a major concern in redo-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for failing supra-annular self-expanding transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs).
AIMS: This ex vivo study evaluated the benefit of leaflet splitting (LS) on subsequent CA after redo-TAVI in anatomies deemed at high risk of unfeasible CA.
METHODS: Ex vivo, patient-specific models were printed three-dimensionally. Index TAVI was performed using ACURATE neo2 or Evolut PRO (TAV-1) at the standard implant depth and with different degrees of commissural misalignment (CMA). Redo-TAVI was performed using the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 Ultra (TAV-2) at different implant depths with commissural alignment. Selective CA was attempted for each configuration before and after LS in a pulsatile flow simulator. The leaflet splay area was assessed on the bench.
RESULTS: In matched comparisons of 128 coronary cannulations across 64 redo-TAVI configurations, the overall feasibility of CA significantly increased after LS (60.9% vs 18.7%; p<0.001). The effect of LS varied according to the sinotubular junction height, TAV-1 design, TAV-1 CMA, and TAV-2 implant depth, given TAV-2 alignment. LS enabled CA for up to CMA 45° with the ACURATE neo2 TAV-1 and up to CMA 30° with the Evolut PRO TAV-1. The combination of LS and a low TAV-2 implant provided the highest feasibility of CA after redo-TAVI. The leaflet splay area ranged from 25.60 mm2 to 37.86 mm2 depending on the TAV-1 platform and TAV-2 implant depth.
CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk anatomies, LS significantly improves CA feasibility after redo-TAVI for degenerated supra-annular self-expanding platforms. Decisions on redo-TAVI feasibility should be carefully individualised, taking into account the expected benefit of LS on CA for each scenario.
