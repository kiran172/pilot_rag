Title: Emergency Department Presentation and Outcome of Children With Cyanotic Congenital Heart Diseases.

Abstract: Objective This study aimed to assess the outcome and see the spectrum of presenting symptoms of children with cyanotic congenital heart diseases (CHDs) admitted through the emergency department in Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) in Peshawar, Pakistan. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study included 104 children with cyanotic CHD admitted through the emergency department in the pediatric cardiology unit of LRH from February 2019 to January 2020. Diagnosis of cyanotic CHD was confirmed through two-dimensional echocardiography. Patients were treated according to standard protocols for their presenting symptoms. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and frequencies were expressed as percentages. Results The study included 65 male cases (62.5%) and 39 female cases (37.5%), and participant ages ranged from 10 days to 15 years (mean, 2.7 Â± 3.4 years). Of 104 patients, 70 presented with cyanotic spells (84.5%), 53 with fever (10.7%), 28 with respiratory distress (26.5%), 11 with loose stools (10.5%), 10 with hemiplegia (9.6%), and eight with seizures (7.6%). Pneumonia was a precipitating factor in 13 patients (12.5%), infective endocarditis in 12 patients (11%), gastroenteritis in 11 (11%), brain abscess and cerebrovascular accidents in seven patients each (6% each), meningitis in six patients (6%), and tuberculous pericardial effusion in one patient (<1%). The primary CHD was tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) in 52 patients, tricuspid atresia in 14 patients, pulmonary atresia in 13 patients, double outlet right ventricle in 10 patients, transposition of great arteries (TGA) in seven patients, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), truncus arteriosus, congenitally corrected TGA, and critical pulmonary stenosis in two patients each. Twenty-six patients received treatment of the acute problem and instructions for follow-up monitoring. Twelve patients died during their hospital stay, and three left against medical advice. Fifteen patients received patent ductus arteriosus stenting, and six received right ventricular outflow tract stenting. One patient received a Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt stent, and one received a left pulmonary artery stent. Two patients received a balloon pulmonary valvotomy, and one received pericardial effusion drainage. Eleven patients received surgical correction of TOF, 11 received surgical correction for BT shunt, four received surgical correction for brain abscess drainage, and two received TAPVR repair. Conclusion TOF was the most common cyanotic heart disease in our study. Cyanotic spells or increased cyanosis was the most common presenting concern. Cyanotic CHDs present with variable extracardiac signs and symptoms in emergencies. Appropriate assessment, immediate management of the acute problem, and timely intervention or surgical management result in good outcomes.
