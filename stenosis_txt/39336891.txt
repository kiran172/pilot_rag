Title: Zero-Contrast Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation vs. Standard Practice: Periprocedural and Long-Term Clinical Outcomes.

Abstract: Background: We aimed to compare the procedural efficacy and long-term clinical results of a totally contrast-free Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) procedure (i.e., contrast dye was not used for either the pre-procedural assessment or during the procedure) to those of standard practice in patients with severe renal dysfunction. Methods: All consecutive patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≤ 35 mL/min and severe aortic stenosis who were treated with transfemoral TAVI at our Institution were included in the registry. The zero-contrast patients underwent carbon dioxide angiography and a non-contrast CT scan for assessment of vascular access suitability, and aortic annulus sizing was performed by a TEE, and the procedural guidance was fluoroscopic and echocardiographic. Procedural outcomes were evaluated, and clinical long-term follow-up was performed for all included patients. Results: A total of 44 patients (median age, 85 (IQR, 80.75-87.00)) were included in the zero-contrast group (TEE guidance and general anesthesia in 37 (84%) patients), while 63 patients were included in the standard practice arm (82 ± 78 mL of contrast dye used). Procedural success was obtained in 100% of cases. There were no differences in procedural outcomes, including final mean aortic gradients (5.5 (IQR, 5.0-10.0) mmHg in the zero-contrast group vs. 6.0 (IQR, 5.0-10.0) mmHg in the standard practice group) and rate of at least a moderate paravalvular leak (0% vs. 1.6% in the zero-contrast and standard practice groups, respectively; p = 0.31). No differences in AKI during the hospital stay were observed. Over a median follow-up of 3.3 years, there was a significantly lower rate of AKI (1.2% vs. 25.9%, p &lt; 0.001) and rehospitalizations (1.6% vs. 35.5%, p &lt; 0.00) in standard practice group. Conclusions: We showed for the first time the feasibility and efficacy of a totally contrast-free strategy compared to standard practice in TAVI patients with severe renal dysfunction. Besides achieving comparable procedural results, the zero-contrast strategy showed a better long-term clinical outcome in reducing hospital readmissions for kidney function deterioration.
