Title: Fetal ductus arteriosus constriction associated with citronella maternal use.

Abstract: Constriction of the fetal ductus arteriosus is a condition that narrows the ductus arteriosus and can lead to death, so the importance of prior diagnosis. Citronella, due to its anti-inflammatory properties, should be avoided during pregnancy as it may cause constriction of the fetal duct.
