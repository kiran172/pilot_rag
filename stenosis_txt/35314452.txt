Title: Evolution of the burden of aortic stenosis by sex in the province of Quebec between 2006 and 2018.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the evolution of the burden of aortic stenosis (AS) by sex in the province of Quebec from 2006-2007 to 2018-2019 and compare the percentage of mortality between people who underwent aortic valve intervention and those who did not.
METHODS: Persons aged ≥20 years were identified from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System using International Classification of Diseases and intervention codes in the hospital files.
RESULTS: In 2018, the crude prevalence and incidence of AS were 0.89% (99% CI 0.89 to 0.90) (n=59 025) and 1.39 per 1000 (1.35 to 1.43) (n=9105), respectively. Age-standardised prevalence and incidence of AS diagnosis increased between 2006 and 2018 from 0.67% (0.66 to 0.68) to 0.75% (0.74 to 0.76) and from 0.91 per 1000 (0.88 to 0.95) to 1.20 per 1000 (1.17 to 1.23), respectively. Among incident AS, the age-standardised percentage of valve interventions increased from 11.7% (10.9 to 12.6) to 14.5% (13.9 to 15.3). This increase was only observed in men. The 30-day mortality was stable among patients with incident AS treated conservatively, from 6.9% (6.5 to 7.4) to 7.3% (6.9 to 7.6), and decreased from 7.6% (6.1 to 9.3) to 3.8% (3.1 to 4.7) among operated patients with incident AS. This decrease was only observed in women. However, from 2010, the age-adjusted mortality among prevalent AS tended to be higher in women.
CONCLUSIONS: In the province of Quebec, age-standardised prevalence and incidence of AS diagnosis increased between 2006 and 2018. Among incident AS, there was an increase in valve intervention in men and a decrease in 30-day mortality in women who underwent valve intervention. Overall and age-standardised mortality remained higher in women.
