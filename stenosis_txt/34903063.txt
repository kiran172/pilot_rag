Title: Bailout stenting in femoropopliteal arterial segment.

Abstract: Background: Disabling peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of femoropopliteal segment is usually treated with percutaneous balloon dilatation, and when this is not successful, stent is placed. Long-term patency of stent is often compromised due to in-stent restenosis (ISR). We aimed to identify factors associated with bailout stenting, and to recognise risk factors for ISR in procedures without paclitaxel application. Patients and methods: We analysed 592 consecutive successful femoropopliteal interventions performed in patients with either disabling intermittent claudication or chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI). In patients with stent implantation, clinical and ultrasound (US) examination were performed one year after the intervention to establish the presence of ISR, defined as &gt;50% stenosis on US imaging. Results: Bailout stenting was required in 133 (22.5%) procedures. Patients with stent placement were younger (70±10 vs 72±11 years, p=0.007) and less often presented with CLI (29.3% vs 40.5%, p=0.019). They more often reported smoking (63.2% vs 49.2%, p=0.005), less often had diabetes mellitus (35.3% vs 47.5%, p=0.013) and arterial hypertension (82.0% vs 90.8%; p=0.004). Stenting was also dependent on lesion complexity (TASC II C&gt;B&gt;A; p&lt;0.001). Subgroup analysis of 110 procedures with bare metal stent (BMS) placement performed in 107 patients revealed ISR in 46.4% of stents, in half of cases it was symptomatic. Neither clinical nor lesion characteristics proved to differ between the group of procedures with ISR and group of procedures without ISR. Conclusions: Factors associated with bailout stenting were age, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, smoking, clinical picture of PAD and complexity of treated lesions. We did not find any risk factors influencing development of ISR in BMS.
