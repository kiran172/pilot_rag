Title: Turbo-Power™ Laser Atherectomy Combined with Drug-coated Balloon Angioplasty is Associated with Improved One-Year Outcomes for the Treatment of Tosaka II and III Femoropopliteal In-stent Restenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Femoropopliteal (FP) artery in-stent restenosis (ISR) is associated with high rates of re-intervention and occlusion. The combined use of laser atherectomy (LA) with balloon angioplasty (BA) is superior to conventional balloon angioplasty (BA). Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) when combined with LA have provided additional efficacy for the treatment of FP-ISR. The aim of this study was to investigate the combination of DCB + LA with the recently approved Turbo-Power™ (Spectranetics Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA) LA device.
METHODS: This was a dual-center retrospective study enrolling 78 consecutive patients with Tosaka type II (n = 18) or III (n = 60) FP-ISR. The lesions were treated with either Turbo-Power™ LA followed by DCB (n = 27) or with other LA devices followed by plain BA (LA + BA; n = 51) from 2015 to 2017. A Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the association between the two groups in terms of target lesion revascularization (TLR) and occlusion rates over a follow up period of 12 months. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated and compared with the log-rank test.
RESULTS: The overall procedural success was 90%. Eight periprocedural complications occurred without any difference between the two groups (Turbo-Power™ + DCB: 7.4% vs LA + BA: 11.8%, p = .7). The 12-month KM estimates for freedom from TLR were 90.9% in the Turbo-Power™ + DCB group vs 55.7% in the LA + BA group (p = .005). Among Toasaka III lesions, the 12 m-KM survival estimates for freedom from TLR were 88.9% in the Turbo-Power™ + DCB group vs 54.2% in the LA + BA group (p = .009). The 12 m-KM estimates for freedom from re-occlusion were 89.0% in the Turbo-Power™ + DCB group vs 58.9% in the LA + BA group (p = .070).
CONCLUSIONS: Turbo-Power™ laser atherectomy combined with DCB exerted synergistic mechanism of actions and improved 12-month TLR rates for the treatment of complex FP-ISR lesions.
