Title: Hiatal Hernia: A Possible Trigger for Atrial Fibrillation.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation is a commonly encountered clinical entity with various cardiovascular consequences. Common risk factors include alcohol abuse, hyperthyroidism, mitral stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Another risk factor, yet under scientific scrutiny, is hiatal hernia. This anatomical abnormality, due to its proximity to the heart and high prevalence in atrial fibrillation patients, has merited scientific investigation to determine if an association truly exists between this gastrointestinal pathology and atrial fibrillation. The case herein is of an 81-year-old hospitalized female with a hiatal hernia who was recorded to have recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation in the absence of traditional risk factors for arrhythmogenesis.
