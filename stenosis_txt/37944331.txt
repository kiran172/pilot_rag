Title: Relationships of pericoronary and epicardial fat measurements in male and female patients with and without coronary artery disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Although pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) is a component of the epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) depot, they may have different associations to coronary artery disease (CAD). We explored relationships between pericoronary adipose tissue mean attenuation (PCAT<sub>MA</sub>) and EAT measurements in coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in patients with and without CAD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: CCTA scans of 185 non-CAD and 81 CAD patients (86.4% &gt;50% stenosis) were included and retrospectively analyzed. PCAT<sub>MA</sub> and EAT density/volume were measured and analyzed by sex, including associations with age, risk factors and tube voltage using linear regression models.
RESULTS: In non-CAD and CAD, mean PCAT<sub>MA</sub> and EAT volume were higher in men than in women (non-CAD: -92.5 ± 10.6HU vs -96.2 ± 8.4HU, and 174.4 ± 69.1 cm3 vs 124.1 ± 57.3 cm3; CAD: -92.2 ± 9.0HU vs -97.4 ± 9.7HU, and 193.6 ± 62.5 cm3 vs 148.5 ± 50.5 cm3 (p &lt; 0.05)). EAT density was slightly lower in men than women in non-CAD (-96.4 ± 6.3HU vs -94.4 ± 5.5HU (p &lt; 0.05)), and similar in CAD (-98.2 ± 5.2HU vs 98.2 ± 6.4HU). There was strong correlation between PCAT<sub>MA</sub> and EAT density (non-CAD: r = 0.725, p &lt; 0.001, CAD: r = 0.686, p &lt; 0.001) but no correlation between PCAT<sub>MA</sub> and EAT volume (non-CAD: r = 0.018, p = 0.81, CAD: r = -0.055, p = 0.63). A weak inverse association was found between EAT density and EAT volume (non-CAD: r = -0.244, p &lt; 0.001, CAD: r = -0.263, p = 0.02). In linear regression models, EAT density was significantly associated with PCAT<sub>MA</sub> in both non-CAD and CAD patients independent of risk factors and tube voltage.
CONCLUSION: In CAD and non-CAD patients, EAT density, but not EAT volume, showed significant associations with PCAT<sub>MA</sub>. Compared to women, men had higher PCAT<sub>MA</sub> and EAT volume independently of disease status, but similar or slightly lower EAT density. Differences in trends and relations of PCAT<sub>MA</sub> and EAT by sex could indicate that personalized interpretation and thresholding is needed.
