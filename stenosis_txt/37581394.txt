Title: Amyloid Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy in Elderly Patients With Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Background The prevalence of calcific aortic stenosis and amyloid transthyretin cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) increase with age, and they often coexist. The objective was to determine the prevalence of ATTR-CM in patients with severe aortic stenosis and evaluate differences in presentations and outcomes of patients with concomitant ATTR-CM undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Methods and Results Prospective screening for ATTR-CM with Technetium99-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid bone scintigraphy was performed in 315 patients referred with severe aortic stenosis between August 2019 and August 2021. Myocardial Technetium99-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid tracer uptake was detected in 34 patients (10.8%), leading to a diagnosis of ATTR-CM in 30 patients (Perugini ≥2: 9.5%). Age (85.7±4.9 versus 82.8±4.5; P=0.001), male sex (82.4% versus 57.7%; P=0.005), and prior carpal tunnel surgery (17.6% versus 4.3%; P=0.007) were associated with coexisting ATTR-CM, as were ECG (discordant QRS voltage to left ventricular wall thickness [42% versus 12%; P&lt;0.001]), echocardiographic (left ventricular ejection fraction 48.8±12.8 versus 58.4±10.8; P&lt;0.001; left ventricular mass index, 144.4±45.8 versus 117.2±34.4g/m2; P&lt;0.001), and hemodynamic parameters (mean aortic valve gradient, 23.4±12.6 versus 35.5±16.6; P&lt;0.001; mean pulmonary artery pressure, 29.5±9.7 versus 25.8±9.5; P=0.037). Periprocedural (cardiovascular death: hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.04-12.53]; stroke: HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.03-7.77]; pacemaker implantation: HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 0.69-3.43]) and 1-year clinical outcomes (cardiovascular death: HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.37-2.96]; stroke: HR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.02-5.63]; pacemaker implantation: HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 0.67-3.34]) were similar between groups. Conclusions Coexisting ATTR-CM was observed in every 10th elderly patient with severe aortic stenosis referred for therapy. While patients with coexisting pathologies differ in clinical presentation and echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters, peri-interventional risk and early clinical outcomes were comparable up to 1 year after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
