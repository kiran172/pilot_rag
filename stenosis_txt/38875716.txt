Title: Intracranial Aneurysms Managed by Parent Artery Reconstruction Using Tubridge Flow Diverter study: 1-year outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Previous randomized controlled trials have reported a significantly higher occlusion rate of large and giant aneurysms when utilizing the Tubridge flow diverter (FD). In the present trial, the safety and efficacy of the Tubridge FD in treating unruptured internal carotid artery (ICA) or vertebral artery (VA) aneurysms were assessed in a real-world setting.
METHODS: The Intracranial Aneurysms Managed by Parent Artery Reconstruction Using Tubridge Flow Diverter (IMPACT) study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial assessing the efficacy of the Tubridge FD in the management of unruptured aneurysms located in the ICA or VA. The primary endpoint was the complete occlusion (Raymond-Roy class 1) rate at the 1-year follow-up. The secondary endpoints included the technical success rate, the successful occlusion rate of the aneurysm, which is the degree of aneurysm embolization scored as Raymond-Roy class 1 or 2, major (> 50%) in-stent stenosis, and incidence of disabling stroke or neurological death associated with the target aneurysms.
RESULTS: This study included 14 interventional neuroradiology centers, with 200 patients and 240 aneurysms. According to angiographic core laboratory assessment, 205 (85.4%) aneurysms were located in the ICA, 34 (14.2%) in the VA, and 1 (0.4%) in the middle cerebral artery. Additionally, 189 (78.8%) aneurysms were small (< 10 mm). At the 12-month follow-up, the total occlusion rate was 79.0% (166/210, 95% CI 72.91%-84.34%). Additionally, the occurrence of disabling stroke or neurological death related to the specified aneurysms was 1% (2/200).
CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year results from the IMPACT trial affirm the safety record of use of the Tubridge FD in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms in real-world scenarios. These results reveal low morbidity and mortality rates of 3.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Furthermore, they provide evidence of the effectiveness of the Tubridge FD, as demonstrated by the complete occlusion achieved in 166 of 210 (79%) cases.
