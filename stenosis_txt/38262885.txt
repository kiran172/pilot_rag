Title: Evaluation of Turbulence Index and Flow Pattern for Atherosclerotic Carotid Stenosis: A High-Frame-Rate Vector Flow Imaging Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The emerging high-frame-rate vector flow imaging provides a new way of hemodynamic evaluation for complex blood flow. This study was aimed at exploring quantitatively the characteristics of complex flow with turbulence (Tur) index and analyzing flow patterns in atherosclerotic internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) using high-frame-rate vector flow imaging.
METHODS: This study prospectively included 60 patients with ICAS. Tur values in different segments of stenosis and cardiac phases were compared. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between clinical plaque characteristics with turbulence grading by ln(Tur). Three complex flow patterns were qualitatively drawn on vector flow mode, and the rates of detection of flow patterns in different stenosis groups and ulceration groups were compared.
RESULTS: Highly disordered blood flow was observed in the stenotic (Tur [M, QR] = 12.5%, 21.5%) and distal segment (15.4%, 27.2%), particularly during systole (21.0%, 30.7%, 33.3%, 38.7%, p < 0.05). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that stenosis rate was correlated with turbulence grading in the stenotic (ρ = 0.65, p < 0.05) and distal segment (ρ = 0.79, p < 0.05), and ulcer formation was correlated with turbulence grading in the stenotic segment (ρ = 0.58, p < 0.05). The overall rate of detection of three flow patterns was higher in the severe stenosis group (22/22) versus the mild to moderate stenosis group (21/38) (p < 0.001) and in the ulcer group (21/23) versus the non-ulcer group (23/37) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: High-frame-rate vector flow imaging was helpful in assessing the severity and characteristics of flow turbulence. Lumen geometric factors could affect flow turbulence and blood flow patterns around the plaque. This would provide important hemodynamic information for the detection of high-risk plaque.
