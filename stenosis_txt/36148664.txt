Title: Hilar cholangiocarcinoma presenting with hematochezia due to metastases to the rectum.

Abstract: An 84-year-old female, with history of endometrial and gallbladder adenocarcinomas, both submitted to curative surgeries, was admitted to the emergency room with obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography and subsequent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a common hepatic duct stenosis with intrahepatic biliary dilatation. She underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with successful biliary drainage. During the same admission, the patient experienced episodes of hematochezia. Rectosigmoidoscopy showed a 20 mm ulcer in the distal rectum and congestion of the rectal mucosa. Computed tomography revealed rectal wall circumferential thickening. Ulcer biopsies were compatible with a neoplasia of biliary origin.
