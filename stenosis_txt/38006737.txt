Title: The hypertrophy of the cervical ligamentum flavum results in incomplete paralysis of both lower limbs: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The occurrence of cervical spinal stenosis caused by single-segment hypertrophic folds of the non-calcified ligamentum flavum (LF) at a single level is exceedingly rare, with previous surgical interventions predominantly employing posterior approaches and open procedures. This case report presents an exceptional instance wherein a patient achieved satisfactory outcomes following endoscopic surgery, thereby furnishing valuable evidence supporting the feasibility of endoscopic treatment for cervical LF hypertrophy.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 66-year-old male, presented to our hospital with chronic cervical pain, bilateral lower limb weakness, and gait instability. Physical examination revealed significant tenderness in the cervical region, diminished muscle strength in both lower limbs with poor resistance against resistance testing, and unsteady ambulation even with the assistance of a walking aid.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The primary diagnosis considered was cervical spinal stenosis caused by hypertrophy of the LF at the C4/5 level. The patient underwent treatment using the "key-hole" technique under spinal endoscopy. Postoperative treatment included detumescence of the nerve and improvement of circulation.
CONCLUSIONS: LF hypertrophy could be the principal factor of cervical spinal stenosis inducing neurological symptoms. Endoscopic surgery can get satisfactory clinical effects on single-segment cervical LF hypertrophy, including a minimally invasive approach, less bleeding, reduced cervical spine stability, and rapid recovery, especially for elderly patients with diabetes.
