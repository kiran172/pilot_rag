Title: Dominant stricture in paediatric-onset primary sclerosing cholangitis is associated with impaired prognosis in a long-term follow-up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The impact of dominant stricture (DS) on the outcomes of paediatric-onset primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is unknown. This study was aimed at investigating the impact of DS on the clinical course and prognosis of patients with paediatric-onset PSC.
METHODS: Patients with paediatric-onset PSC diagnosed between January 1993 and May 2017 were identified from hospital records or our PSC registry. Data including clinical, laboratory, cholangiography, and cytology at diagnosis and during follow-up (until July 2023) were reviewed. We graphed the Kaplan-Meier failure function and fitted crude and multivariable Cox model to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for selected variables. In these analyses, DS was treated as a time-varying variable.
RESULTS: We identified 68 patients (42 males) with paediatric-onset PSC (median age at diagnosis 15 years). The median follow-up was 13 years and the median age at the last follow-up was 27 years. In total, 35 (51%) had concomitant autoimmune hepatitis. DS was diagnosed in 33 patients (48%): in eight at the time of PSC diagnosis (12%) and in 25 (37%) by the end of follow-up. In patients with DS, two developed cirrhosis, seven were transplanted and one patient was operated for a biliary mass with low-grade dysplasia. In patients without a DS, two developed cirrhosis, and four were transplanted; one female was excluded from survival analysis because she already had cirrhosis at the time of PSC diagnosis. Cirrhosis or biliary dysplasia or needing liver transplantation for these indications were more frequent after the development of DS (10/33, adjusted HR 4.26, 95%CI: 1.26-14.4). No cholangiocarcinomas or deaths occurred during the follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: DS was present at diagnosis or developed during follow-up in about half of the patients with paediatric-onset PSC and was associated with impaired outcome.
