Title: Pseudocoarctation of the Arch and the Abdominal Aorta: A Review.

Abstract: Pseudocoarctaion of the aorta is a rare congenital anomaly occurring in isolation or with other congenital heart diseases. The anatomical basis of the condition is linked to an elongated, redundant aorta which may affect the arch, or the abdominal aorta rarely giving rise to kink and buckling without causing any significant functional stenosis. It should be carefully differentiated from the common true coarctation of the aorta. No clinical features are specific to pseudo coarctation and are often diagnosed incidentally. Although asymptomatic in the majority, few patients can have nonspecific symptoms and complications due to aneurysm formation, dissection, or rupture of the aorta. Hence Pseudocoarctaion should be closely followed for the onset of symptoms or possible complications. Without recommendations, no specific therapy is indicated in asymptomatic patients, although symptoms and complications warrant definitive treatment. As the natural history of the disease is unknown, the condition, when diagnosed, should be closely followed up for the occurrence of any complications. This article reports a pseudo aortic coarctation involving the arch and a brief literature review of this rare congenital anomaly.
