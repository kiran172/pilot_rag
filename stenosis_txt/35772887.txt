Title: Intraoperative neuromonitoring during surgery for lumbar stenosis.

Abstract: The indications for neuromonitoring during lumbar stenosis surgery are defined by the risks associated with patient positioning, the approach, decompression of neural elements, deformity correction, and instrument implantation. The routine use of EMG and SEP alone during lumbar stenosis surgery is no longer supported by the literature. Lateral approach neuromonitoring with EMG only is also suspect. Lumbar stenosis patients often present with multiple co-morbidities which put them at risk during routine pre-surgical positioning. Frequently encountered morbid obesity and/or diabetes mellitus may play a role in monitorable and preventable brachial plexopathy after "superman" positioning or femoral neuropathy from groin pressure after prone positioning, for example. Deformity correction in lumbar stenosis surgery often demands advanced implementation of multiple neuromonitoring modalities: EMG, SEP, and MEP. Because the bulbocavernosus reflex detects the function of the conus medullaris and sacral somato afferent/efferent fibers of the cauda equina, it may also be recorded. The recommendation to record pedicle screw thresholds has become more nuanced as surgeon dependence on 3D imaging, navigation, and robotics has increased. Neuromonitoring in lumbar stenosis surgery has been subject mainly to uncontrolled case series; prospective cohort trials are also needed.
