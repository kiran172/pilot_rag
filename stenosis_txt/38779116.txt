Title: Impact of the Alberta Stroke Program CT Score subregions on long-term functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke: Results from two multicenter studies in China.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Alberta Stroke Program CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used rating system for assessing infarct extent and location. We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of ASPECTS subregions' involvement in the long-term functional outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with AIS and anterior circulation large-vessel stenosis and occlusion between January 2019 and December 2020 were included. The ASPECTS score and subregion involvement for each patient was assessed using posttreatment magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to identify subregions related to 3-month poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale scores, 3-6) in the reperfusion and medical therapy cohorts, respectively. In addition, prognostic efficiency between the region-based ASPECTS and ASPECTS score methods were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and DeLong's test.
RESULTS: A total of 365 patients (median age, 64 years; 70% men) were included, of whom 169 had poor outcomes. In the reperfusion therapy cohort, multivariable regression analyses revealed that the involvement of the left M4 cortical region in left-hemisphere stroke (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-19.02) and the involvement of the right M3 cortical region in right-hemisphere stroke (aOR 4.21, 95% CI 1.05-16.78) were independently associated with poor functional outcomes. In the medical therapy cohort, left-hemisphere stroke with left M5 cortical region (aOR 2.87, 95% CI 1.08-7.59) and caudate nucleus (aOR 3.14, 95% CI 1.00-9.85) involved and right-hemisphere stroke with right M3 cortical region (aOR 4.15, 95% CI 1.29-8.18) and internal capsule (aOR 3.94, 95% CI 1.22-12.78) affected were related to the increased risks of poststroke disability. In addition, region-based ASPECTS significantly improved the prognostic efficiency compared with the conventional ASPECTS score method.
CONCLUSION: The involvement of specific ASPECTS subregions depending on the affected hemisphere was associated with worse functional outcomes 3 months after stroke, and the critical subregion distribution varied by clinical management. Therefore, region-based ASPECTS could provide additional value in guiding individual decision making and neurological recovery in patients with AIS.
