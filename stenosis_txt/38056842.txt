Abstract: Congenital severe peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is usually associated with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collateral artery. Complications mainly related to respiratory system frequently occur after peripheral pulmonary artery patch augmentation with or without uniforcalization. Pulmonary hemorrhage and airway bleeding can be fatal. Airway compression from surrounding structures such as reconstructed central pulmonary artery, pulmonary hypertension, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary ischemia reperfusion injury are also life-threating complications. Long mechanical ventilator support with positive airway pressure under the deep sedation is a key to success to prevent major complications. Extra corporeal membrane oxygen support should not be hesitated if respiratory and/or hemodynamic conditions are critical. Chylothorax is a risk factor for prolonged intensive care unit stay. Several treatment options are reported, then multidisciplinary treatment with nil per oral and total parenteral nutrition is recommended.
