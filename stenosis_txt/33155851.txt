Title: Thoracoscopy Versus Thoracotomy in the Repair of Esophageal Atresia with Distal Tracheoesophageal Fistula.

Abstract: Background/Objective: Thoracoscopic repair of esophageal atresia (EA) is gaining popularity, but it is a highly technically demanding procedure. The aim of our study is to evaluate our outcomes in the management of type C EA comparing the thoracoscopic and the open (thoracotomy) approaches. Methods: This is a retrospective bicentric study of two major pediatric surgery centers, reviewing all the patients operated for EA with distal tracheoesophageal fistula. Only patients who underwent primary anastomosis were included. From 2008 to 2018, 187 patients were included. Results: Forty-seven patients were operated thoracoscopically (TS group) and 140 by the open approach (TT group). Mean gestational age was 38 ± 2.4 weeks in TS group and 36.4 ± 3.3 weeks in TT group (P = .005) with a mean birth weight of 2785 ± 654 g and 2404.9 ± 651 g in TS and TT groups, respectively (P = .003). The mean operative time was 127.6 ± 35 minutes in TS group and 105.7 ± 23 minutes in TT group (P = .0005). The mean postoperative ventilation time and the mean length of stay were significantly shorter in the thoracoscopic group (P = .004 and P &lt; .0001, respectively). The incidence of anastomotic leak was 8.9% in TS group versus 16.4% in TT group (P = .33). Anastomotic stenosis occurred in 33.3% of TS group and in 22.4% of TT group (P = .17). Conclusions: Surgical outcome of thoracoscopic repair of EA is comparable to the open repair with no higher complication rate with the expected skeletal and cosmetic benefits. However, possible bias regarding prematurity, weight at surgery, and associated anomalies must be taken into consideration.
