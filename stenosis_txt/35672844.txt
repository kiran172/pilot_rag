Title: Transumbilical single-site two incision laparoscopic pyloromyotomy for pediatric hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: A new novel technique for the treatment of pediatric hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), transumbilical single-site laparoscopic pyloromyotomy with a single instrument (TUSSLP), was introduced. TUSSLP was compared with the transabdominal three-site laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (TATSLP) procedure.
METHODS: Patients with HPS who underwent TUSSLP and TATSLP between January 2016 and September 2020 were assigned to group A and group B, respectively. The descriptive variables, perioperative clinical characteristics and postoperative follow-up results were retrospectively analyzed and compared between the 2 groups. The primary outcome of this study was the rate of switching to conventional pyloromyotomy.
RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, 29 (22 males, 7 females, 54.4 ± 22.6 days) who received TUSSLP were assigned to group A. The remaining 35 (28 males, 7 females, 54.5 ± 27.6 days) who received TATSLP were assigned to group B. The data of preoperative patient variables were comparable between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The mean operative time (ORT) was 28.1 ± 5.6 min in group A, which was not significantly different from 25.8 ± 3.1 min in group B (P = 0.25). The other perioperative features were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). During follow-up (39.1 ± 14.7 m in group A and 35.4 ± 16.1 m in group B, P = 0.51), no significant difference was observed in the overall incidence of vomiting between the 2 groups (P = 0.26).
CONCLUSIONS: TUSSLP is a feasible and reliable minimally invasive method for HPS. It has the advantages of an improved cosmetic appearance. The postoperative follow-up results of TUSSLP are comparable with those of TATSLP.
