Title: Real-time angiography in endovascular revascularization of intracranial atherosclerotic internal carotid artery stenosis under proximal balloon protection: "Retrograde suction-injection" technique and literature review.

Abstract: Intracranial angioplasty/stenting is a treatment option for patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease refractory to aggressive medical treatment. However, it carries a risk of procedure-related embolism as well as reperfusion hemorrhage and in-stent thrombosis. We have devised a new embolic protection system which can achieve both total ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) embolic protection and real-time visualization of the target lesion during endovascular revascularization of intracranial atherosclerotic disease below the carotid T junction. Herein, we describe a case of medically refractory symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic ICA stenosis successfully treated with this method.
