Title: Serum Levels of Growth Differentiation Factor-15 as an Inflammatory Marker in Patients with Unstable Angina Pectoris.

Abstract: Background: Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a member of transforming growth factors, is a stress-responsive marker whose levels may significantly increase in response to pathological stresses associated with inflammatory tissue injuries such as unstable angina pectoris (USAP). This study evaluated the diagnostic value of GDF-15 in patients with USAP. Methods: The present cross-sectional study recruited 39 patients with USAP criteria and 30 patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP), referred to Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, Iran. All the patients with USAP had at least 1 coronary artery stenosis (&gt;50%) in angiography. The control group comprised 42 healthy individuals. The serum levels of GDF-15 were measured in all the participants by ELISA. Also analyzed were the relationship between GDF-15 levels and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk scores in the patients with USAP to determine the severity of the disease. Result: The study population consisted of 111 subjects, 62 women and 49 men, divided into 3 groups of USAP (n=39, mean age=60.07±14.10 y), SAP (n=30, mean age=67.56±9.88 y), and control (n=42, mean age=61.21±7.76 y). The mean serum level of GDF-15 in the USAP group was significantly different from the other 2 groups (P&lt;0.001), while no significant difference was observed in this regard between the SAP and control groups (P=0.797). No correlation was found between the mean GDF-15 serum level and the GRACE (P=0.816) and TIMI (P=0.359) risk scores in the USAP group. Conclusion: The mean serum level of GDF-15 exhibited a rise in our patients with USAP. GDF-15 may be a diagnostic biomarker of USAP and its severity.
