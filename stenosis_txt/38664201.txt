Title: [Contralateral endoscopic approach for lumbar foraminal stenosis using unilateral biportal endoscopic surgery].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and imaging outcomes of unilateral biportal endoscopic technique in the treatment of lumbar foraminal stenosis through contralateral approach.
METHODS: The clinical data of 33 patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis treated with unilateral biportal endoscopic technique from January 2021 to July 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 17 males and 16 females;age ranging from 34 to 72 years old with an average of (56.00±7.89) years old;operation time and perioperative complications were recorded;visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain was recorded, to evaluate the degree of low back pain and lower extremity pain, and Oswestry disability index (ODI) to evaluate the lumbar spine function. At the latest follow-up, the modified Macnab score was used to evaluate the clinical efficacy.
RESULTS: All patients successfully completed the operation. The operation time ranged from 47 to 65 minutes, with an average of (56.10±5.19) minutes. The postoperative follow-up ranged from 12 to 18 months, with an average of (14.9±2.3) months. The VAS of low back and lower extermity pain before operation were (7.273±1.442) and (7.697±1.447) scores, ODI was (69.182±9.740)%. Postoperative lumbocrural pain VAS were (3.394±0.966) and (2.818±0.727) scores, ODI was (17.30±4.78) %. At the latest follow-up, VAS of back and lower extermity pain was (2.788±0.650) and (2.394±0.704) scores, ODI was (14.33±350)%. There were significant differences in VAS of low back and lower extremity pain and ODI before and after operation(P&lt;0.05). At the latest follow-up, according to the modified Macnab criteria, 24 patients got excellent result, 5 as good, 2 as fair, and 2 as poor.
CONCLUSION: Unilateral biportal endoscopic treatment of lumbar foraminal stenosis through the contralateral approach is a safe and efficient method, with few complications, quick postoperative recovery, and satisfactory clinical outcomes. During the follow-up period, no iatrogenic lumbar instability was observed.
