Title: Stents With Torsional Strength for Superficial Femoral Artery Disease: The Prospective Q3-Registry.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This postmarketing surveillance study aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of a peripheral self-expanding stent with high torsional strength (POLARIS stent) for the treatment of de novo superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions in the routine clinical practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with symptomatic de novo SFA occlusive disease who underwent POLARIS stent implantation were enrolled into the prospective, multicenter, observational postmarket surveillance study. Primary outcome measure was freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (cdTLR) at 12 months. Main secondary outcomes were procedural success, primary clinical improvement, and freedom from major adverse cardiovascular and limb events (MACLE) throughout 24 months.
RESULTS: A total of 199 participants (70±11 years, 70.4% men) were included in the study at 9 German sites from December 2014 to August 2018. Half of them (52.6%) were current smokers, 37.6% had diabetes, and 25.0% were obese. Most participants suffered from intermittent claudication (88.4%). Mean lesion length was 98±83 mm, 43.5% of lesions were occluded, and 27.3% were severely calcified. Freedom from 12 months cdTLR was 94.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.6-98.2). At 24 months, freedom from cdTLR was 88.7% (95% CI, 83.0-94.4). Procedural success was achieved in 96.2% of participants. Primary clinical improvement occurred in 87.5% and 85.4% of participants at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Freedom from MACLE was 94.8% (95% CI, 91.4-98.1) and 93.8% (95% CI, 89.9-97.6) at 12 and 24 months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of SFA occlusive disease in a real-world setting using the POLARIS stent with high bidirectional torsional strength is efficacious and does not raise any safety concern in the medium term. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02307292).
