Title: Carotid Micromesh Stent for the Cervical Carotid Artery Dissecting Aneurysm in a Patient with Vascular Eagle Syndrome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: An elongated styloid process may cause vascular Eagle syndrome that includes cervical carotid artery (CCA) dissection with stenosis and aneurysm formation. There are only four reported cases with vascular Eagle syndrome-related CCA dissecting aneurysm treated with carotid artery stenting (CAS). This is the first report of applying a dual-layer nitinol micromesh stent (CASPER) for vascular Eagle syndrome-related CCA dissecting aneurysm.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old man presented with a sudden onset of aphasia and right hemiplegia. Cerebral angiography demonstrated the left CCA dissecting aneurysm. The superior trunk of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was also occluded, and emergent thrombectomy was performed. Computed tomography with angiography (CTA) revealed that a 33Â mm-long styloid process compressed the CCA at the aneurysm formation. Three weeks later, a CASPER stent was applied for the CCA aneurysm under the flow reversal system. Immediately after stent placement, blood flow in the aneurysm became stagnant, and postoperative CTA demonstrated regression of the aneurysm. The aneurysm did not recur for 6 months with no styloid process resection.
CONCLUSIONS: The dual-layer nitinol micromesh stent (CASPER) was useful to treat vascular Eagle syndrome-related CCA dissecting aneurysm.
