Title: Infolding of Self-Expandable Transcatheter Heart Valve: Case Report and Review of Literature.

Abstract: Transcutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a widely accepted minimally invasive approach for treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Self-expandable prostheses are commonly the device of choice, with excellent procedural success and durability. However, there have been several recent case reports of infolding of the self-expandable prosthesis during development with subsequent malfunction and need for further intervention. We present a case of self-expandable valve prosthesis infolding managed by balloon postdilation, and summarize the cases reported in the literature to date in an attempt to increase awareness of this serious technical problem and the factors associated with it.
