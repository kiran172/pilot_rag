Title: Predictors of Mid-Term AVNeo Insufficiency.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease and the most common indication for aortic valve replacement in adults. Aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) with fixed autologous pericardium, also known as the Ozaki procedure, is a possible alternative treatment of AS. Autopericardial valves save the dynamics and physiological anatomy of the aortic root, however, the service life of autopericardial leaflets is limited. There is no data about factors that may influence the development of AVNeo insufficiency. Here, we assessed the effect of autopericardial leaflet symmetry on the development of aortic insufficiency after Ozaki procedure.
METHODS: This study included 381 patients with AS who underwent Ozaki procedure. Patients were divided into group 1 (171 patients with symmetric aortic root) and group 2 (210 patients with asymmetric aortic root).
RESULTS: The maximum observation period was up to 65 months. Sixteen cases of aortic insufficiency were detected in group 1, and 33 cases were detected in group 2. Based on the results of Cox regression, the predictors of aortic insufficiency in the late postoperative period are age and asymmetry of neocusps. According to results of Kaplan-Meier analysis, insufficiency of AVNeo in the maximum follow-up period after surgical correction of AS for group 1 patients was significantly lower than for group 2 patients (P=0.006).
CONCLUSION: Asymmetric neocusps increase the risk of aortic insufficiency in the mid-term period after Ozaki procedure. And the older the patients at the time of surgery, the less likely they develop AVNeo insufficiency.
