Title: Associations of Lifelong Exercise Characteristics With Valvular Function and Aortic Diameters in Patients With a Bicuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The potential impact of exercise on valvular function and aortic diameters in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed the association between lifelong exercise characteristics, valvular dysfunction, and aortic dilatation in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this cross-sectional study, exercise volume (metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week), exercise intensity, and sport type were determined from the age of 12 years to participation using a validated questionnaire. Echocardiography was used to assess aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation and to measure diameters at the sinuses of Valsalva and ascending aorta. Aortic dilatation was defined as a Z-score ≥2. Four hundred and seven patients (42±17 years, 60% men) were included, of which 133 were sedentary (&lt;500 metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week), 94 active (500-1000 metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week), and 180 highly active (≥1000 metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week). Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation was present in 23.7% and 20.0%, respectively. Sinuses of Valsalva and ascending aorta diameters were 34.8±6.6 and 36.5±8.1 mm, whereas aortic dilatation was found in 21.6% and 53.4%, respectively. Exercise volume was not associated with valve dysfunction or aortic dilatation. Vigorous intensity and mixed sports were associated with a lower prevalence of aortic stenosis (adjusted odds ratios, 0.43 [0.20-0.94] and adjusted odds ratios, 0.47 [0.23-0.95]). Exercise intensity and sport type were not associated with aortic regurgitation and aortic dilatation.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no deleterious associations between lifelong exercise characteristics, valvular dysfunction, and aortic dilatation in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve. Vigorous intensity and exercise in mixed sports were associated with a lower prevalence of moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis. These observations suggest that lifelong exercise does not appear to induce adverse cardiovascular effects in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve.
