Title: Tracheal Transplantation.

Abstract: Airway stenosis and malignant tumors are the 2 main reasons to perform a surgical resection of part of the trachea. Tracheal lesions with a length shorter than 5Â cm can be resected and primary reconstruction can be safely effected. Excessive anastomotic tension should be avoided because it may lead to restenosis or dehiscence at the anastomosis. Reconstruction of a longer defect may be attempted with a tracheal allotransplant or with autologous tissue.
