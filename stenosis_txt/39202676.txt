Title: Von Willebrand Factor Dynamics in Patients with Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Surgical and Transcatheter Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a prevalent valvular disorder that poses a significant burden on healthcare systems due to its debilitating symptoms and high mortality rates if left untreated. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are the primary interventions for severe AS, but perioperative complications such as bleeding remain a concern. Von Willebrand factor (VWF), a crucial player in hemostasis, is known to be altered in AS and may contribute to the hemostatic imbalance observed in these patients. This prospective study aimed to investigate the association between prosthetic valve type, size, and postprocedural VWF levels in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe AS. This study involved 39 consecutive patients diagnosed with severe AS who underwent SAVR or TAVR. By elucidating the VWF dynamics associated with different prosthetic valves, this study sought to provide valuable insights into personalized valve selection and perioperative management strategies.
