Title: [Tarlov cyst and faecal incontinence: A case report and literature review].

Abstract: Tarlov, or perineural cysts, are lesions of the nerve root usually located at the sacral level of the spine. Their cause is unclear. These cysts are generally identified as an incidental finding and are usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic cysts are infrequent, with symptoms usually consisting of pain, radiculopathy and, less frequently, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction. We report the case of a 70-year-old woman with Tarlov cyst, provoking faecal incontinence, and review the aetiology, pathophysiology and management of this particular case.
