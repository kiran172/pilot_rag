Title: Bilateral Ischemic Strokes Secondary to Moyamoya Syndrome Associated With Graves Thyrotoxicosis in a Patient of Amerindian Descent From Peru: A Case Report.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is characterized by progressive stenosis of the distal portion of the internal carotid artery and its two main branches, the middle cerebral artery, and the anterior cerebral artery. Clinically, MMD can present with ischemic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events. The term Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) is used when the characteristic Moyamoya vasculopathy presents in association with other conditions such as Graves' disease (GD). We report a case of a 34-year-old, right-handed male patient of Amerindian descent. He presented to the emergency room with a two-month history of palpitation, fatigue, and weight loss associated with sudden-onset left hemiparesis, facial asymmetry, and dysarthria. His workup was remarkable for elevated levels of thyroid hormones with the presence of autoantibodies and radiological findings typical of MMS. Moyamoya syndrome in association with Graves' disease has increasingly been noted in Latin American patients and should be considered in the differential diagnosis in the appropriate clinical context.
