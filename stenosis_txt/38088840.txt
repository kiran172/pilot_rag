Title: [Histological evaluation of esophageal stricture in children with caustic burn].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze histological features of esophageal strictures in children with chemical burn following ingestion of household products containing sodium (potassium) hypochlorite, sodium (potassium) hydroxide.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 3 children with complicated caustic esophageal burns. Children at the time of swallowing the caustic were 26.3Â±4.1 months. Multiple dilatations of esophageal stricture were ineffective. Therefore, extirpation or subtotal resection of the esophagus and esophagocoloplasty were performed. We stained specimens using hematoxylin and eosin, as well as Masson's trichrome.
RESULTS: Severe esophageal burns caused by sodium (potassium) hydroxide and/or sodium hypochlorite are followed by irreversible tissue lesions and non-dilatable stricture. Strictures are localized in the areas of physiological narrowing of the esophagus. The longest stricture follows ingestion of liquid substance. Histological properties include atrophy of glands and mucous membrane, muscle layer substitution by connective tissue and diffuse sclerosis of esophageal wall.
CONCLUSION: Non-dilatable esophageal stricture following caustic burn in children is due to irreversible morphological lesion of esophageal wall with mucous layer atrophy and sclerosis of all layers.
