Title: Intravascular Ultrasonography (IVUS)-A Tool for Imaging the Eustachian Tube?

Abstract: The Eustachian tube (ET) has a key role in the pathogenesis of otitis media. Until now, there has been a lack of meaningful imaging methods to investigate the ET and its surrounding tissue. The aim of the current study was to investigate the possibilities of imaging the ET using Intravascular Ultrasonography (IVUS). ETs from sheep were scanned ex vivo and in vivo with different IVUS probes. In addition to native ETs, water was also used to improve coupling. Scans were subsequently compared with histological sections and a 3D model of the ET. In addition, ETs with a stenosis induced by a hyaluronic acid depot, after stent insertion, and during lower jaw movement were examined. The IVUS catheter was inserted into the ET lumen without any problems or injuries in all cases. The surrounding structures of the ET were identified in the ultrasound image. In addition, a change in size of the ET lumen due to movement was observed, and the position of the stent and the depot of hyaluronic acid could be examined. With the use of IVUS, a non-invasive possibility to examine the ET over its course with the adjacent structures as well as after different treatments is presented.
