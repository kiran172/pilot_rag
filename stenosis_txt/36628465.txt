Title: Efficacy and Safety of Radiofrequency Ablation Plus Stent Versus Stent-alone Treatments for Malignant Biliary Strictures: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: Malignant biliary strictures (MBS) are very aggressive and cannot be diagnosed in the early stages due to their asymptomatic nature. Stenting the stricture area of the biliary tree is palliative treatment but has poor survival time. Radiofrequency ablation plus stent (RFA+S) have been recently used to improve the survival and stent patency time in patients with MBS. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we tried to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study search up to December 2021 was performed in different medical databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane library, etc. We selected eligible studies reporting survival time, stent patency time, and adverse events in patients with MBS. We compare the outcomes of RFA+S and stent-alone treatment groups.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies (6 randomized controlled trials and 9 observational studies) with 1815 patients were included for meta-analysis of which 701 patients were in RFA+S group and 1114 patients in the stent-alone group. Pooled mean difference of survival time was 2.88 months (95% CI: 1.78-3.97) and pooled mean difference of stent patency time was 2.11 months (95% CI: 0.91-3.30) and clinical success risk ratio was 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.09). Risk ratios for adverse events are given; Bleeding 0.84 (95% CI: 0.34-2.11), abdominal pain 1.06 (95% CI: 0.79-1.40), pancreatitis 0.93 (95% CI: 0.43-2.01), cholangitis 1.07 (95% CI: 0.72-1.59), and stent dysfunction 0.87 (95% CI: 0.70-1.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation is involved in increased survival and stent patency time for MBS patients. With the help of better techniques, adverse events can be limited.
