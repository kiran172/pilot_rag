Title: Five cases of endoscopically noted esophageal stenosis due to abnormal aortic angiogenesis.

Abstract: Right aortic arch is caused by a malformation of the aorta while Kommerell's diverticulum is a saccular aneurysm arising at the origin of the subclavian artery. Both diseases are caused by malformations during embryonic development and can subsequently cause compression of the esophagus and trachea due to abnormal arterial migration. Here, we report five cases of esophageal stenosis due to aortic angiogenesis anomalies. Three of the five cases had aortic running abnormalities, noted on computed tomography (CT). However, until it was observed for the first time, esophageal stricture was not recognized as an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) finding due to the lack of knowledge of diseases such as Kommerell's diverticulum even when EGD was performed during regular follow-up after treatment for esophageal cancer or other conditions. Symptoms include dysphagia and dyspnea due to stenosis of the esophagus and trachea, however, regardless of symptomatic presentation, the presence of esophageal stenosis on EGD should be considered as an effect of aortic travel abnormality or Kommerell's diverticulum. Although there have been no reports of Kommerell's diverticulum rupture due to endoscopic manipulation, gastroenterologists should consider the possibility of Kommerell's diverticulum during clinical decision making.
