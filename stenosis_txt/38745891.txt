Title: Airway stenosis secondary to mediastinal lymph node metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma treated with AERO stent and osimertinib: A case report.

Abstract: A woman in her mid-50s was admitted to our hospital with airway stenosis secondary to mediastinal lymph node enlargement. An AERO stent was placed under rigid bronchoscopy. Immediately after stent placement, tissue sampling was performed on the lymph nodes. Metastatic lesions were found to have an EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion). Consequently, osimertinib treatment was initiated 15 days after stent placement. The tumour partially responded to osimertinib, and the airway stenosis improved. The patient underwent stent removal 66 days after stent placement. Our findings indicate that temporary oncological emergencies due to airway stenosis may be bridged by airway stenting.
