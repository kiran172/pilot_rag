Title: Procedural Outcomes of Pulmonary Atresia With Intact Ventricular Septum in Neonates: A Multicenter Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multicenter contemporary data describing short-term outcomes after initial interventions of neonates with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) are limited. This multicenter study describes characteristics and outcomes of PA-IVS neonates after their initial catheter or surgical intervention and identifies factors associated with major adverse cardiac events (MACE).
METHODS: Neonates with PA-IVS who underwent surgical or catheter intervention between 2009 and 2019 in 19 centers were reviewed. Risk factors for MACE, defined as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical circulatory support, stroke, or in-hospital mortality, were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models.
RESULTS: We reviewed 279 neonates: 79 (28%) underwent right ventricular decompression, 151 (54%) underwent systemic-to-pulmonary shunt or ductal stent placement only, 36 (13%) underwent right ventricular decompression with shunt or ductal stent placement, and 11 (4%) underwent transplantation. MACE occurred in 57 patients (20%): 26 (9%) received mechanical circulatory support, 37 (13%) received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, stroke occurred in 16 (6%), and 23 (8%) died. The presence of 2 major coronary artery stenoses (adjusted odds ratio, 4.99; 95% CI, 1.16-21.39) and lower weight at first intervention (adjusted odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.01-2.27) were significantly associated with MACE. Coronary ischemia was the most frequent presumed mechanism of death (n = 10).
CONCLUSIONS: In a multicenter cohort, 1 in 5 neonates with PA-IVS experienced MACE after their initial intervention. Patients with 2 major coronary artery stenoses or lower weight at the time of the initial procedure were most likely to experience MACE and warrant vigilance during preintervention planning and postintervention management.
