Title: A rare case of malignant biliary stenosis due to retroperitoneal metastasis from breast invasive ductal carcinoma.

Abstract: A 50-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for elevated hepatobiliary enzymes. She had a medical history of mastectomy for left breast invasive ductal carcinoma about 10Â years ago, and no apparent recurrence had been observed. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed soft-tissue shadows surrounding the portal vein, celiac artery, and other vessels. The lesions involved the hilar bile duct, and the upstream bile ducts were dilated. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed an obstruction in the hilar bile duct, and biopsies were taken at the site of biliary stenosis. H&E staining showed that cells with strong nuclear atypia and prominent chromatin staining infiltrated in the stroma. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the cells were positive for CK7, GATA3 and weakly positive for CK20. Based on these results, we made the diagnosis of biliary stenosis due to retroperitoneal metastasis from breast invasive ductal carcinoma. Biliary inside stents were placed across the biliary stricture, and she received chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy for breast cancer. So far, the partial response has been maintained for 1 year since the diagnosis of retroperitoneal metastasis. Although retroperitoneal metastasis from breast cancer, especially breast invasive ductal carcinoma, is extremely rare, it could be a differential diagnosis for biliary stenosis.
