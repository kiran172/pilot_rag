Title: Intradural T12-L1 disc herniation in a patient with achondroplasia: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are very few reports of intradural disc herniations associated with achondroplasia described in the literature.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient with achondroplasia presented with progressive paraparesis attributed to a magnetic resonance-documented intradural disc herniation at the T12-L1 level occupying more than 90% of the spinal canal. It was successfully removed through a T12 laminectomy with durotomy; note a laminectomy would have been contraindicated if this had been an extradural anterior/anterolateral disc. Postoperatively, the patient progressively improved and, within 6 months, had 4/5 proximal/distal function and full sphincter control.
CONCLUSION: A patient with achondroplasia and an intradural T12/L1 disc herniation (i.e., unlike an extradural anterior/anterolateral thoracic disc) successfully underwent a decompressive laminectomy with near full resolution of their preoperative paraparesis.
