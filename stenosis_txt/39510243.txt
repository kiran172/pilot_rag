Title: Automatic motion correction for myocardial blood flow estimation improves diagnostic performance for coronary artery disease in 18F-flurpiridaz PET-MPI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Motion correction (MC) is critical for accurate quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and flow reserve (MFR) from 18F-flurpiridaz PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). However, manual correction is time consuming and introduces inter-observer variability. We aimed to validate an automatic MC algorithm for 18F-flurpiridaz PET-MPI in terms of diagnostic performance for predicting coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: In total, 231 patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography and rest/pharmacologic stress 18F-flurpiridaz PET-MPI from phase III Flurpiridaz trial (NCT01347710) were enrolled. For manual MC, two operators (Reader 1 and Reader 2) shifted each frame's images in three directions. The automatic MC algorithm, initially developed for 82Rb-chloride PET-MPI, was optimized for 18F-flurpiridaz. Diagnostic performance was compared using minimal segmental MBF/MFR with and without MC to predict CAD â‰¥70% stenosis by angiography.
RESULTS: Manual MC took 10 minutes per case (both stress and rest) on average, while automatic MC required <17 seconds. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for significant CAD using minimal segmental MBF were comparable between automatic and manual MC (AUC=0.877 automatic, AUC=0.888 Reader 1 and AUC=0.892 Reader 2; all p>0.05). AUCs of minimal segmental MBF with manual and automatic MC were significantly higher than without MC (p<0.05 for both). Similar findings were observed with minimal segmental MFR.
CONCLUSIONS: Automatic MC can be performed rapidly, with diagnostic performance for predicting obstructive CAD comparable to manual MC. This method could be utilized for analysis of MBF/MFR in patients undergoing 18F-flurpiridaz PET-MPI.
