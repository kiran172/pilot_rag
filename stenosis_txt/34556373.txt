Title: Standardized Classification of Lumbar Spine Degeneration on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Reduces Intra- and Inter-subspecialty Variability.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of standardized definitions of degenerative change in reducing variability in interpretation of lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging within and between groups of subspecialty-trained neuroradiologists (NR) and musculoskeletal radiologists (MSK).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six radiologists, three from both NR and MSK groups were trained on a standardized classification system of degenerative change. After an 11-month washout period, they independently re-interpreted fifty exams at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels. Responses were converted to a six-point ordinal scale for the assessment of neural foraminal stenosis and spinal canal stenosis (SCS), three-point scale for lateral recess stenosis, and four-point scale for facet osteoarthritis (FO). Intra-subspecialty and inter-subspecialty analysis was performed using the weighted Cohen's kappa with a binary matrix of all reader pairs.
RESULTS: Inter-subspecialty agreement improved from k=0.527 (moderate) to k=0.602 (substantial) for neural foraminal stenosis, from k=0.540 (moderate) to k=0.652 (substantial) for SCS, from k=0.0818 (slight) to k=0.337 (fair) for lateral recess stenosis, and from k=0.176 (slight) to k=0.495 (moderate) for FO. The NR group demonstrated improved intra-subspecialty agreement for the assessment of SCS, from k=0.368 (fair) to k=0.638 (substantial). The MSK group demonstrated improved intra-subspecialty agreement for the assessment of FO, from k=0.134 (slight) to k=0.413 (moderate). Intra-subspecialty agreement was similar for other parameters before and after training.
CONCLUSIONS: As result of the standardized definitions training, the NR and MSK groups each improved in one of the four parameters, while inter-subspecialty variability improved in all four parameters. These definitions may be useful in clinical practice across radiology subspecialties.
