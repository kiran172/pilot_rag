Title: Medium-to Long-term Outcomes of Rex Shunt in 105 Children With Extrahepatic Portal Vein Obstruction in China.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to analyze the medium-to long-term outcomes of Rex shunts in a large series of children with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO).
METHODS: The clinical data of 105 children aged between 6 months and 16 years with EHPVO who underwent Rex shunt between October 2014 and June 2021 at our center were retrospectively reviewed after more than 2 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: The overall patency rate of the Rex shunt was 91.43% (96/105) during a median follow-up of 41 months (range, 24-98 months). Eighty-seven (82.86%) of the 105 patients underwent classical Rex shunt with internal jugular vein (IJV) bypass, and the remaining 18 patients (17.14%) underwent modified Rex shunt with intra-abdominal vein bypass. Patients with a patent shunt experienced portal hypertension resolution, which was characterized by a reduction in portal pressure, disappearance of variceal bleeding, relief of gastroesophageal varices, and relief of splenomegaly or hypersplenism. The rate of Rex shunt thrombosis in our center was 8.57% (9/105), and a repeat Rex shunt was effective for the treatment of graft thrombosis. Anastomotic stenosis occurred in 14.26% (15/105) of the children, 38.46% (5/13) of whom received successful endovascular intervention therapy and experienced remission of portal hypertension symptoms. The patency rate of the classical Rex shunt was higher than that of the modified Rex shunt (97.70% vs. 61.11%), whereas the rate of vascular complications, including anastomotic stenosis and graft thrombosis, of the classical Rex shunt was lower than that of the modified Rex shunt (11.49% vs. 77.78%). Further comparison revealed that the risk of vascular complications was substantially greater in the modified Rex shunt group than in the classical Rex shunt group in the nonadjusted model, minimally adjusted model, and fully adjusted model (RR ranged from 6.77 to 7.07, all p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The Rex shunt provides medium-to long-term benefits for children with EHPVO. The classical Rex shunt with IJV bypass provides the best patency rate and the fewest vascular complications.
