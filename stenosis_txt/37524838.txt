Title: Feasibility and outcome of third-generation transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with extra-large aortic annulus.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many patients in need for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) present with an aortic annulus size larger than recommended by the manufacturer's instructions for use (IFU).
AIMS: To investigate procedural and short-term safety and efficacy of TAVI in patients with extra-large annuli (ELA).
METHODS: 30-day clinical outcome and valve performance as defined by VARC 3 of 144 patients with an aortic annulus size exceeding the permitted range were compared to a propensity-score matched control cohort of patients with an aortic annulus size consistent with the IFU.
RESULTS: Area and perimeter was 730.4 ± 53.9 mm2 and 96.7 ± 6.5 mm in the ELA group. Technical (96.5% vs. 94.4%) and device success (82.3% vs. 84.5%) were comparable in patients with ELA (annulus area 730.4 ± 53.9 mm2) and matched controls (annulus area 586.0 ± 48.2 mm2). There was no significant difference in 30-day mortality rate, major intraprocedural complications, type 3 or 4 bleedings, major vascular complications, or stroke. Moderate paravalvular leakage (PVL) occurred more frequent in the ELA group (8.9% vs 2.2%; p = 0.02). The rate of new pacemaker implantation was 7.0% in the ELA cohort and 15.0% in the control cohort, respectively (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Treatment of ELA patients with third-generation TAVI prostheses is feasible and safe, providing similar device success and complication rates as in matched controls with regular-sized aortic annulus. Post-interventional pacemaker implantation rates were low compared to the control group, yet incidence of moderate PVL remains problematic in ELA patients.
