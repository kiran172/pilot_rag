Title: Reliability of Fractional Flow Reserve in Non-Infarct-Related Arteries in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients Undergoing a Pharmaco-Invasive Approach.

Abstract: Objectives We investigated the reproducibility of fractional flow reserve (FFR) of significant stenoses (≥70% narrowing) in the non-infarct related artery (NIRA) during the pharmaco-invasive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 24 hours of thrombolysis and at a follow up of 2-3 weeks. Background STEMI with multivessel disease has worse outcomes. The benefits of FFR-directed PCI of NIRA at the time of primary PCI are yet controversial. Assessing the hemodynamic severity of the NIRA may help in deciding the management strategy of these lesions, save time, and avoid complications. Methods Thirty-one patients undergoing PCI for STEMI under a pharmaco-invasive approach were prospectively recruited. The FFR measurements in 34 stenoses (≥70% diameter stenosis) were obtained immediately after PCI of the culprit stenosis and were repeated at a mean follow-up of 17.6 ± 3.55 (14-21) days. In addition, time to thrombolysis, time from symptom onset to PCI, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), quantitative coronary angiographic measurements of the non-culprit stenoses, and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow were recorded. Results There was a significant change in FFR values at follow-up as compared to baseline (0.78 ± 0.08 (0.68-0.93) to 0.77 ± 0.08 (0.67-0.93)) (p = 0.014). In four of the lesions, the FFR values differed by >0.05 at follow-up. The follow-up FFR values led to a change in the management strategy in 5 out of 31 patients (15%) of the lesions. The TIMI flow, percentage diameter stenosis, minimum lumen diameter, and LVEF did not change. There were no predictors of this change in FFR values. Conclusions During the acute phase of STEMI, the severity of non-culprit coronary artery stenoses can not be reliably assessed by FFR. The prolonged jeopardized state of myocardium in pharmaco-invasive PCI as compared to primary PCI seems to be responsible.
