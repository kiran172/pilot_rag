Title: The hidden role of the Sigma1 receptor in muscle cells.

Abstract: This review describes the very specific role of Sigma1 receptor in different types of muscle cells. Sigma1 receptor is a transmembrane protein residing in such structures like MAM. It has chaperoning activity supporting function of many proteins, particularly ion channels, including Ca2+ channels. This latter function is of particular meaning for muscle cells, due to their calcium-based/regulated metabolism. Here we discuss new reports pointing to participation of Sigma1 receptor in muscle specific processes like contraction, EC-coupling, calcium currents and in diseases like left ventricular hypertrophy, transverse aortic stenosis and hypertension-induced heart dysfunction.
