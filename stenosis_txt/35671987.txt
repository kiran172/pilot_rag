Title: Vascular Pathology and Impact of Stent Eccentricity for Stent Restenosis in Femoropopliteal Endovascular Therapy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the clinical features associated with stent eccentricity and reveal the impact of stent eccentricity on the risk of 1-year restenosis after femoropopliteal stent implantation for symptomatic atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease (PAD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical database of a multicenter prospective study was used. It registered 2,018 limbs of 1,766 patients in whom intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-supported femoropopliteal endovascular therapy (EVT) for symptomatic atherosclerotic PAD was planned from November 2015 to June 2017. The study included 1,233 limbs of 1,088 patients implanted with a bare nitinol stent, drug-eluting stent (DES), or stent graft and administered ≥2 antithrombotic drugs. The stent eccentricity was evaluated using IVUS, calculated as [(maximum diameter) / (minimum diameter) - 1] at the cross-sectional segment with the lowest lumen area after stent implantation.
RESULTS: Chronic total occlusion and bilateral arterial calcification (peripheral artery calcification scoring system Grades 3 and 4) were positively associated with stent eccentricity, whereas renal failure while receiving dialysis, DES use, and stent graft use were negatively associated with stent eccentricity (all P < .05). Stent eccentricity was associated with an increased risk of 1-year restenosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.37; P = .034). However, after adjustment for lesion severity and implanted stent types, the association was no longer significant (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91-1.24; P = .43).
CONCLUSIONS: Stent eccentricity was not significantly associated with the risk of 1-year restenosis after femoropopliteal EVT.
