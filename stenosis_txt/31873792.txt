Title: Surgery of degenerative thoracic spinal stenosis-long-term outcome with quality-of-life after posterior decompression via an uni- or bilateral approach.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The rate of degenerative thoracic spinal stenosis (TSS) as underlying pathology for myelopathy is not precisely known, and larger case series are only available for the Asian region. We present one of the largest European series to evaluate rate and clinical outcome after dorsal decompression via a uni- or bilateral approach.
METHOD: We investigated patients' characteristics, imaging/surgical parameters, and outcomes with quality-of-life (QOL) in all patients who underwent surgical treatment for TSS between 2013 and 2018 in a university neurosurgical clinic.
RESULTS: From 645 patients with surgery for degenerative spondylotic myelopathy within 6 years, 28 patients (4.3%) suffered from TSS. Median age was 70.4 years with a slight predominance of the female sex (m:f = 1:1.3). The most frequent symptoms (mean duration 7.6 months) were ataxia (61%) and sensory changes (50%). The stenoses (median Naganawa score 3) mostly resulted from a combined osseous/ligamentous hypertrophy and disc prolapse, the majority located below Th8 (75%). Nineteen patients with lateralized compression underwent bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach (fenestration/hemilaminectomy with "undercutting" procedure), and 9 patients with circular pathology underwent bilateral-approached decompression (laminectomy). There were no significant differences of patients' characteristics, blood loss, operation time, and in-patient stay between both surgical groups. Independent from the mode of surgery, the spinal canal was significantly (p < 0.001) widened (median Naganawa score 0), and pain (p = 0.04), myelopathy (mJOA score p = 0.01), and QOL (Oswestry Disability Index, p = 0.03; SF-36-MCS, p = 0.01) were significantly improved at long-term follow-up (mean 35.1 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Non-tumorous myelopathy is caused in about 4% of patients by TSS and can be effectively treated by surgical decompression via both a uni- or bilateral approach.
