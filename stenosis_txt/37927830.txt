Title: Refractory Deep Vein Thrombosis Caused by Femoral Vein Stenosis Due to Suture-Medicated Vascular Closure Device.

Abstract: Vascular closing devices (VCDs) are widely used to replace manual compression at the femoral puncture site after catheter insertion. Perclose ProGlide is a suture-medicated VCD that is indicated for both arterial and venous access sites. However, there are few reports of complications related to venous use of ProGlide. Here, we describe a case of femoral vein stenosis caused by a suture-medicated VCD after an ablation procedure, which developed refractory deep vein thrombosis even after surgical vascular repair.
