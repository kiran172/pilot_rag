Title: Mechanical failure of the Mobi-C implant for artificial cervical disc replacement: report of 4 cases.

Abstract: Cervical spondylosis is one of the most commonly treated conditions in neurosurgery. Increasingly, cervical disc replacement (CDR) has become an alternative to traditional arthrodesis, particularly when treating younger patients. Thus, surgeons continue to gain a greater understanding of short- and long-term complications of arthroplasty. Here, the authors present a series of 4 patients initially treated with Mobi-C artificial disc implants who developed postoperative neck pain. Dynamic imaging revealed segmental kyphosis at the level of the implant. All implants were locked in the flexion position, and all patients required reoperation. This is the first reported case series of symptomatic segmental kyphosis after CDR.
