Title: Glycoprotein inhibitors as a first line rescue treatment after unsuccessful recanalization of endovascular thrombectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a major cause of stroke with a high rate of re-occlusion following mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Among the available rescue options, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) have shown promise as a potential therapeutic strategy. This systematic review and meta-analysis examine studies exploring the use of glycoprotein inhibitors as a first-line treatment for refractory occlusion or high-grade stenosis following EVT in the setting of ICAD.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Studies using GPI as the first-line rescue treatment (GPI-rt) after failed thrombectomy or in the setting with high-grade stenosis (>50%) were included. The primary outcome of interest was good clinical outcomes (defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 90 days). Secondary outcomes of interest were successful recanalization (TICI 2b-3), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality by 90 days.
RESULTS: Our study processed 2111 articles, which yielded eight relevant studies for review, four single and four double arm. These studies comprised 763 patients, divided into GPI-rt (535 patients) and non-GPI-rt (228 patients) cohorts. The GPI-rt group had higher rates of mRS ≤ 2 at 90 days (58.5% vs 38.9%, p = 0.002) and lower mortality rates (7.8% vs 17.5%, p = 0.04) compared to the non-GPI-rt cohort. mTICI 2b-3 rates and rates of sICH were not significantly different between the cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: First line GPI-rt demonstrates significant clinical benefit and significantly lower mortality without a rise in rates of sICH. GPI are a potential first line rescue treatment of ICAD.
