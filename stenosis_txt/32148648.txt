Title: The Association of Paraoxonase-1 Polymorphism with Carotid Artery Stenosis among Elderly Chinese Population.

Abstract: Elderly population is in high risk of carotid atherosclerosis and artery stenosis (CAS). It has been proved that PON1 polymorphism is associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, which plays an important role in artery atherosclerosis. CAS is an important cause of ischemic stroke. This study is aimed at investigating the association of PON1 (rs662) polymorphism with the risk of CAS among elderly Chinese population. Consecutive elderly patients with CAS were enrolled into the study. Genotyping for PON1 (rs662) polymorphism was performed on all participants. There were 310 CAS patients in this study, with 88 symptomatic CAS and 222 asymptomatic CAS. G allele had a frequency of 59.66% in symptomatic CAS (sCAS); and A allele had an incidence of 36.93% in asymptomatic CAS (aCAS) (P &lt; 0.05). In all CAS patients with and without symptom, no associations were found in any genotype comparison. However, among aCAS subjects, based on GA phenotype, the odds ratio (OR) of the mutant GG with stenosis severity was 0.20 (P = 0.01). The OR of GG+GA mutation was 0.28 for moderate/severe severity, compared with GA type (P = 0.03). This study indicates that PON1 (rs662) polymorphism is not associated with the presence of symptom among CAS patients. Moreover, PON1 (rs662) polymorphism correlates with stenosis severity among aCAS.
