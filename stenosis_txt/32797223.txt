Title: Successful repair of critical bronchial stenosis with coexisting bronchomalacia and congenital heart defects in infants by slide bronchoplasty.

Abstract: Isolated bronchial stenosis in infancy is rare, difficult to manage and becomes more complex when associated with congenital heart defects. Given the small luminal diameter and the proximity of the lung parenchyma to the bronchial lesion in infants, reconstruction of the bronchial stenosis is surgically challenging. We present 2 infant cases having isolated critical bronchial obstruction with congenital heart defects, which were successfully managed by primary one-stage slide bronchoplasty with concomitant heart repair. Both cases had excellent results after the surgery and did well at home without requiring respiratory support.
