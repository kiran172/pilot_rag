Title: Impact of gastrectomy for incurable advanced gastric cancer in urgent situations in the elderly.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for incurable advanced gastric cancer; however, its indications are limited in elderly patients. Furthermore, the efficacy of chemotherapy and surgery as well as the treatment strategy for incurable gastric cancer in elderly patients with urgent conditions are unclear. In these situations, palliative gastrectomy or gastrojejunostomy is often performed. Less invasive surgical procedures should be performed on elderly patients in consideration of their condition; however, gastrectomy may be preferable if it can improve the prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the significance of palliative gastrectomy in elderly patients with incurable advanced gastric cancer who underwent surgery due to stenosis or bleeding.
METHODS: Fifty-six patients aged >80 years with stage IV incurable advanced gastric cancer who underwent surgery at our department between February 1992 and July 2021 were included in the study. The patients underwent gastrectomy (distal and total gastrectomy) or gastrojejunostomy. We examined the association between the clinicopathological factors and overall survival after surgery.
RESULTS: The subjects included 43 men and 13 women. Twenty-nine patients underwent distal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy, and 27 underwent gastrojejunostomy. The median follow-up duration for all patients was 297 days. The univariate analysis indicated significant differences in the surgical procedure and blood loss. Multivariate analysis showed a significant difference only in the surgical procedure (hazard ratio, 5.32; 95% confidence interval, 2.43-11.6; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Gastrectomy as a palliative surgery for incurable advanced gastric cancer in elderly patients may improve their prognosis.
