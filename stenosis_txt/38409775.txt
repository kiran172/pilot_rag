Title: Results of the Italian Collaborators for Evar Registry on Acute Kidney Injury After Elective Endovascular Aortic Repair of Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To analyze the incidence and predictive factors of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) after elective standard endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in a large recent, multicenter cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a multicenter, retrospective, financially unsupported physician-initiated observational cohort study. Between January 2018 and March 2021, only patients treated with elective standard EVAR for infrarenal non-infected abdominal aortic aneurysm were analyzed. Patients already on hemodialysis (HD) were excluded. AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (sCr) ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or an increase in sCr to ≥1.5 times baseline known or presumed to have occurred within 7 days, or a urine volume of <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours. Primary outcomes of interest were AKI incidence at 30 days and freedom from HD at 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were freedom from severe postoperative complication, and freedom from aorta-related mortality (ARM) at 1 year.
RESULTS: The final cohort analyzed 526 (29.8%). There were 489 (93%) males and 37 (7%) females: the median age was 76 years (interquartile range [IQR], 71-81). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was present in 86 (16.3%) patients. Early mortality was observed in 8 (1.5%) patients, none was aorta-related. Complication rate was 17.1% (n=89). AKI was observed in 17 (3.2%). Renal replacement therapy was needed in 4 (0.8%). HD was transitory in 2 cases and definitive in 1. Binary logistic regression analysis identified CKD (odds ratio [OR]: 4.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.10-10.45, p<0.001), and the presence of renal artery stenosis (OR: 3.80, 95% CI: 1.35-10.66, p=0.011) to be associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI. Estimated freedom from ARM was 94.9% at 1 year. Estimated freedom from HD rate at 1 year was 94%: This was significantly different between patients with preoperative CKD and those who did not have preoperative CKD (log-rank, p=0.042).
CONCLUSION: AKI after elective standard EVAR still occurs but with an acceptably low incidence rate. Preoperative CKD is the most important predictor for postoperative AKI, which was not associated with the need for HD at 1-year follow-up but with a higher propensity of mortality.
CLINICAL IMPACT: This "real world" experience confirm that EVAR performed with standard contrats agent protocol remains safe for acute kidney injury development. Therefore, only patients presenting with preoperative borderline or ascertained chronic kidney disease will take the most advantage from the use of carbon dioxide contrast.
