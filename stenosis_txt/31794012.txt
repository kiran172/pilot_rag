Title: Chronic Hydrocephalus Following Mumps Encephalitis: Neuropathological Correlates and Review.

Abstract: Hydrocephalus is a rare and devastating complication of mumps encephalitis. The histopathological correlates of mumps infection in central nervous system tissues are not well-characterized. We present the case of a 54-year-old patient who suffered long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae and hydrocephalus as a consequence of a childhood mumps infection. Brain autopsy revealed significant dilation of the lateral and third ventricles. Aqueductal stenosis was not observed on premortem imaging or on gross examination. Histology revealed loss of ependymal epithelium throughout the aqueduct and ventricular system. Macrophage conglomerates were identified within the cerebral aqueduct at the level of the pons in addition to subjacent periaqueductal gliosis and scattered Rosenthal fibers. Together, these findings support primary ependymal injury as a pathophysiological mechanism in the development of chronic hydrocephalus following mumps infection. Finally, we review the existing literature and discuss potential mechanisms of disease.
