Title: A novel self-inflatable balloon for treating refractory benign esophageal strictures: a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Current treatments for refractory benign esophageal strictures (BESs) often take several years and have poor effects. The authors propose a novel method of self-help inflatable balloon (SHIB) and evaluate its efficacy and safety.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter study was conducted from January 2019 to March 2022. All enrolled patients were diagnosed with refractory BESs and received SHIB. The primary endpoint was the clinical success rate at 12 months after removing SHIB. The secondary endpoints were the number of days of placing SHIB, and changes from baseline in BMI and health-related quality of life at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
RESULTS: The clinical success rate was 51.2% (21/41) with the median days of placing SHIB being 104.0 days (range: 62.0-134.5 days), which was higher in the endoscopic group compared to the caustic and surgery groups (63.3 vs. 28.6% vs. 0, P=0.025). All patients (100%) showed significant improvement in dysphagia scores during placing SHIB. Although 20 patients (48.8%) experienced recurrent stricture, the median stricture length was decreased (P<0.001) and the median intervention-free interval was prolonged (P<0.001). In all patients, the mean BMI at and health-related quality of life at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were significantly increased compared with baseline (P<0.05). On multivariate analysis, stricture etiology and wearing time were independent predictors of recurrent stricture.
CONCLUSIONS: The SHIB has high efficacy and safety in treating refractory BESs of different origins, especially for endoscopic resection. Stricture etiology and wearing time were independent predictors of recurrent stricture.
