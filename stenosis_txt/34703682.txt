Title: Re-pancreaticojejunostomy for Necrosis of the Roux-en-Y Limb Tip 14 Years After Partington-Rochelle Procedure.

Abstract: Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy for chronic pancreatitis, the Partington-Rochelle (PR) procedure, is a good option to control pain caused by dilation of the main pancreatic duct. However, long-term complications related to anastomosis are still unclear. Here, we present a case of a 78-year-old patient with sudden necrosis of the Roux-en-Y limb tip in a PR procedure performed 14 years ago. During emergent laparotomy, we resected the necrotic limb and re-anastomosed the remaining Roux-en-Y limb to the main pancreatic duct. Postoperatively, we managed the inflammation caused by the pancreatic fistula and successfully saved the patient by long-term drainage. Although the cause of necrosis is still unclear, mild kinking and stenosis of the Roux-en-Y limb might be associated with this situation.
