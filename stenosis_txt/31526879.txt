Title: Risk Factors for Symptomatic Contralateral Foraminal Stenosis After Unilateral Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The most common cause of contralateral symptoms after unilateral transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) is contralateral foraminal stenosis (FS). This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the cause of and risk factors for contralateral FS after unilateral TLIF with a single cage.
METHODS: Patients with degenerative lumbar spinal disorders who underwent unilateral TLIF at L4-5 were divided into 2 groups: those without contralateral radicular symptoms after surgery (group A; n = 340) and those with contralateral radicular symptoms after surgery (group B; n = 16). We investigated the influence of various radiological and cage-related factors on postoperative contralateral FS with radicular symptoms. The cage location indicates whether the cage's anterior tip crosses the disc midline-exceeding 50%-and in such a case, how far.
RESULTS: Group B showed significantly increased postoperative coronal angle and sagittal angle and decreased contralateral foraminal height and foraminal area. Statistically significant (P < 0.01) factors according to the multivariate logistic regression analysis were the preoperative sagittal range of motion (odds ratio [OR]: 1.562, P = 0.004) and cage location (OR: 2.047, P = 0.015). The cutoff values for the sagittal range of motion and the cage location were 9.0° and 50.5%, respectively. The preoperative and postoperative 6-month visual analog scale scores and Oswestry disability index values were not significantly different between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2 most meaningful risk factors were the preoperative sagittal range of motion and cage location. Inserting the cage beyond the disc midline, especially in patients with a high preoperative sagittal range of motion (≥9.0°), would help reduce postoperative complications.
