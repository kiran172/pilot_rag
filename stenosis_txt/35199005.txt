Title: Multidisciplinary Approach to Isolated Pulmonary Vein Compression by an Enlarging Vertebral Osteophyte.

Abstract: Compression of mediastinal structures by vertebral osteophytes is rare. We report a case of pulmonary vein compression by a vertebral osteophyte that failed stenting. A minimally invasive approach to osteophyte removal with subsequent re-expansion angioplasty yielded an optimal outcome, negating the need for cardiopulmonary bypass, stent removal, and pulmonary venoplasty. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
