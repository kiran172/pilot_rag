Title: The Emergent Evaluation and Treatment of Neck and Back Pain.

Abstract: Neck and back pain are among the most common symptom-related complaints for visits to the emergency department (ED). They contribute to high levels of lost work days, disability, and health care use. The goal of ED assessment of patients with neck and back pain is to evaluate for potentially dangerous causes that could result in significant morbidity and mortality. This article discusses the efficient and effective evaluation, management, and treatment of patients with neck and back pain in the ED. Emphasis is placed on vertebral osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, acute transverse myelitis, epidural compression syndrome, spinal malignancy, and spinal stenosis.
