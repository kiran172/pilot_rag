Title: Medial Sural Artery Musculocutaneous Perforator (MSAP) Flap for Reconstruction of Pharyngoesophageal Defects.

Abstract: We describe the use of the medial sural artery musculocutaneous perforator (MSAP) flap at our institution. It is a relatively new flap, originally described in 2001 for lower extremity defects, that has become increasingly popular for head and neck reconstruction due to its versatility, thinness, pliability, long pedicle, and particularly favorable donor site. It has been described for reconstruction of oral defects, but there is little published on its use in pharyngeal reconstruction. We suggest that the MSAP is an ideal flap for addressing defects caused by pharyngoesophageal stenosis, pharyngeal fistulas, or laryngopharyngectomies. We review 5 cases at our institution from June 2016 to November 2017.
