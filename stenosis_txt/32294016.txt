Title: Single-Stage Repair of Interrupted Aortic Arch With Aortopulmonary Window and Bovine-Type Aortic Arch Complicated by Left Subclavian Artery Origin Stenosis-A Case Report.

Abstract: An aortopulmonary window is known to be associated in 5% of interrupted aortic arch cases. The combination of these lesions with a bovine-type aortic arch is much more uncommon. We report its embryological explanation and successful single-stage surgical repair in a three-month-old infant.
