Title: Dolichoectasia of the internal carotid artery terminus, posterior communicating artery, and posterior cerebral artery: The embryonic caudal ramus internal carotid segmental vulnerability legacy.

Abstract: Dolichoectasia of the distal internal carotid artery, posterior communication artery (PCoA) and posterior cerebral artery is an extremely rare abnormality. Dolichoectasia of the internal carotid artery, PCoA and the P1 segment of posterior cerebral artery can be postulated its pathogenesis by the embryological perspective basis from caudal ramus of the internal carotid artery terminus. The pathogenesis and treatment strategy are not well established. We reviewed and proposed embryological perspective, pathogenesis, clinical setting, radiological findings and management of this rare malformation.
