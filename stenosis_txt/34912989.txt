Title: Evaluation of a portable assembly catheter simulator using a 3D-printed heart model for percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy in developing countries: Catheter simulator for PTMC.

Abstract: AIMS: We developed a catheter simulator for percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) based on the data from a patient with mitral valve stenosis. The simulator has the following characteristics: 1) the simulator is portable and easy to assemble and disassemble, 2) the cardiac portion is created using a 3D-printer, based on patient computed tomography data, 3) the simulator uses a foot-operated water pump to create pulsatile flow, and 4) the fossa ovalis in the atrial septum of the heart model is made of a thin polyurethane membrane and is interchangeable. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of this novel simulator for training in PTMC using the Inoue balloon in developing countries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used this simulator for training in the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases in Bangladesh (13 physicians), and in Kenyatta National Hospital in Kenya (11 physicians). The effectiveness of training was evaluated by questionnaire and the procedure time in simulation. The questionnaire obtained from the trainees showed that the model scored 4.7±0.5 for realism, utility of pulsatile flow scored 4.7±0.5, simulator utility scored 4.9±0.3, and the effect of training on PTMC performance scored 4.9±0.5. The procedure time in simulation was shortened from 30.0±12.6 min (first time), to 23.4±11.9 min (second time) and to 20.4 ± 11.1 min (third time) (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The novel portable assembly catheter simulator using a 3D-printed heart model for PTMC received positive comments and improved the skills of trainees.
