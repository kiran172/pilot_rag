Title: Cognition, Frailty, and Functional Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment and frailty are highly prevalent in older adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of cognitive impairment and frailty with functional recovery after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: This was a single-center prospective cohort study of 142 patients who were ≥70 years old and underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. Prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement, cognitive impairment was defined as Mini-Mental State Examination score <24 points (range: 0-30), and moderate-to-severe frailty was defined as a deficit-accumulation frailty index ≥0.35 (range: 0-1). The functional status composite score, the number of 22 daily and physical tasks that a patient could perform independently, measured at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively were analyzed using linear mixed-effects model.
RESULTS: The mean age was 84.2 years; 74 subjects were women (51.8%). Patients with moderate-to-severe frailty and cognitive impairment (n = 27, 19.0%) had the lowest functional status at baseline and throughout 12 months, while patients with mild or no frailty and no cognitive impairment (n = 48, 33.8%) had the best functional status. Patients with cognitive impairment alone (n = 19, 13.4%) had better functional status at baseline than those with moderate-to-severe frailty alone (n = 48, 33.8%), but their functional status scores merged and remained similar during the follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative cognitive function plays a vital role in functional recovery after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, regardless of baseline frailty status. Impaired cognition may increase functional decline in the absence of frailty, whereas intact cognition may mitigate the detrimental effects of frailty. Cognitive assessment should be routinely performed prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
