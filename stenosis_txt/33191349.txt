Title: Outcomes and Associated Factors of Discrepant Coronary and Carotid Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Some patients exhibit discrepancies in carotid and coronary artery atherosclerosis. This study aimed to define the characteristics and prognosis of these discrepant patients and determine the best strategy to detect pan-vascular atherosclerosis. A database of 5,022 consecutively registered patients who underwent both coronary angiography and carotid ultrasonography, along with clinical and blood laboratory tests, echocardiography, and pulse wave velocity (PWV), was analyzed. The development of cerebro-cardiovascular (CV) events during the follow-up period was also evaluated. A significant proportion of patients (n = 1,741, 35%) presented with a discrepancy between carotid artery plaque and coronary artery disease (CAD). In patients without carotid plaque, male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.41; P = 0.003), older age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P = 0.002), smoking history (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-2.20; P = 0.008), lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol level (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.98; P < 0.001), and lower common carotid artery end-diastolic velocity (CCA-EDV) (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = 0.005) were independently related to the presence of CAD. In patients without CAD, increased PWV was independently related to the presence of carotid plaque. In survival analysis, patients with isolated CAD had a higher probability of composite CV events; those with isolated carotid plaque had a higher probability of heart failure (HF) and mortality than their counterpart groups (P < 0.05). Even in patients without carotid artery plaque, careful coronary evaluation is needed in older or male patients with smoking history, lower HDL-cholesterol level, or lower CCA-EDV. Carotid plaque may be a potential risk factor for HF.
