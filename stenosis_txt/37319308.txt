Title: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in the Pediatric Spine Requiring Stabilization: A Literature Review and Report of 3 Cases.

Abstract: CASE: This report describes 3 cases of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) of the cervical and thoracic spine in patients aged 4 to 10 years. Each patient had painful lytic spinal lesions with vertebral body collapse and posterior involvement suggesting instability requiring corpectomy, grafting, and fusion. All 3 patients were doing well at their most recent follow-up without pain or recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Although LCH of the pediatric spine is usually successfully treated non-operatively, we recommend corpectomy and fusion when there is instability of the spinal column and/or severe stenosis. Posterior element involvement occurred in all 3 cases and may lead to instability.
