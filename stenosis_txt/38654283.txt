Title: Incidental finding of thyroglossal duct cyst in a neonate during endotracheal intubation: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Thyroglossal Duct Cyst (TDC) is a common lesion of the midline neck, originating from an incomplete involution of the thyroglossal duct. It is typically observed in pre-scholar patients and surgery is the treatment of choice to prevent infections. Here reported a case of incidental diagnosis in a newborn patient.
CASE PRESENTATION: a 3-week-old male baby was admitted to our hospital for weight loss and projectile vomits after breastfeeding. After a diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, the baby underwent pyloromyotomy. During the endotracheal tube placement, the anesthetist noticed the presence of a midline neck mass. The suspect of TDC was confirmed by an intraoperative ultrasound, so, despite the age of the patient, we proceeded with the excision of the lesion according to Sistrunk's procedure to avoid future complications and anesthesia.
CONCLUSIONS: even if TDC is a common lesion of pediatric patients, anecdotical neonatal cases were described in the literature, all of them symptomatic. An accurate physical examination and ultrasound are essential diagnostic tools to distinguish TDC from other middle neck lesions, particularly ectopic thyroidal tissue. Sistrunk's procedure is the most effective surgical approach. When diagnosis is made in a newborn, we suggest postponing surgery, unless the baby requires general anesthesia for other surgical procedures, such as in our case.
