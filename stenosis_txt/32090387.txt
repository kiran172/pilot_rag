Title: Revisiting the prevalence and diversity of localized thinning of the left ventricular apex.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The left ventricular apex commonly has a paper-thin structure. However, available data about its structure are limited to variable samples, methodologies, and results.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the structural anatomy of the left ventricular apex using living heart datasets with the latest computed tomography scanner.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-one consecutive patients (median age, 73 years; 58% men) who underwent cardiac computed tomography were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with severe aortic stenosis were analyzed separately. Thickness and diameters of the thinnest part of the left ventricular apex during mid-diastole were measured using orthogonal multiplanar reconstruction images. The area of thinning was estimated using the formula for the ellipse.
RESULTS: In 88 patients without severe aortic stenosis, the median thickness of the thinnest area of the left ventricular apex was only 0.9 mm. Among them, 74%, 99%, and 100% of cases displayed a left ventricular apex thinner than 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mm, respectively. The median area of the thinnest region was 5.6 mm2 . In 43 patients with severe aortic stenosis, the median thickness of the thinnest area of the left ventricular apex was 1.2 mm. Among them, 51%, 93%, and 100% of cases displayed a left ventricular apex thinner than 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 mm, respectively. The median area of the thinnest region was 3.9 mm2 .
CONCLUSIONS: Localized thinning of the left ventricular apex is unexceptional, regardless of aortic stenosis with concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, thus highlighting the need for a reappreciation of this feature to avoid inadvertent catastrophic complications.
