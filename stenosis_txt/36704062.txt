Title: Management of Severe Coarctation of the Aorta and Bilateral Carotid Artery Stenosis: An Interventional Catch-22.

Abstract: We present a case of an adult with concurrent severe aortic coarctation, bilateral carotid artery stenosis, and anomalous right subclavian artery, posing the interventional dilemma of accepting potential cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome vs hypoperfusion ischemic injury. Transcatheter stenting of the aortic coarctation was successfully performed without any neurological deficits. (Level of Difficulty: Beginner.).
