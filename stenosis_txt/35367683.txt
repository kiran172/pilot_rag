Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement complications: A narrative review for emergency clinicians.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is present in up to 10% of individuals over age 80 years. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the most common method to replace the aortic valve in patients with AS. TAVR-related complications may occur.
OBJECTIVE: This narrative review evaluates the emergency department (ED) assessment and management of patients with TAVR complications.
DISCUSSION: Post-TAVR complications can be conceptualized as occurring peri-procedurally and after the peri-procedural period. Peri-procedural complications include device landing zone rupture, coronary artery obstruction, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, and valve embolization. Complications beyond the peri-procedural window include vascular access/bleeding, mechanical valve issues, electrical conduction complications, and end-organ damage.
CONCLUSIONS: Emergency clinicians are more likely to encounter TAVR complications after the initial procedural hospitalization and must be prepared to diagnose and manage these complications.
