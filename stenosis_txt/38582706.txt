Title: Antenatally Detected Choledochal Malformation: What Are We Waiting For?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: An increasing proportion of congenital choledochal malformation (CCM) are being detected on antenatal ultrasound. However, the actual timing of its surgical correction remains controversial with some series showing an excess of complications the earlier the operation. The aim of this study was to characterize the pathophysiological aspects of this cohort from the perspective of age at surgery in order to inform a more rational basis for clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We analysed a prospective database of CCM acquired over a 26-year period (Jan. 1997 to Dec. 2022) for patient demography; details of pre- and post-natal imaging; age at surgical intervention; operative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification) and outcome. Data are quoted as median (IQR). All comparisons are non-parametric. A P value of 0.05 was accepted as significant.
RESULTS: There were 58 (72% female) children with an antenatally-detected CCM from a total of 265 (21.8%) in the series. These were classified as Type 1C (n = 47; 81%), type 4C (n = 3; 5%) and Type 5 (n = 8; 14%). There were no Type 1F lesions in this cohort. Median age at surgery was 113 (IQR 57-198) days. Postnatal cyst (US) size varied from 12 to 130 mm but there was little evidence of a relationship between this and post-natal liver biochemistry (e.g. bilirubin r<sub>S</sub> = 0.01, P = 0.44; AST r<sub>S</sub> = 0.14, P = 0.19). Choledochal pressure measurements (n = 46) showed resting pressures of 12 (9-21) mmHg with no significant correlation with age (P = 0.4) or aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.2) or γ-glutamyl transferase (P = 0.06). The cohort was divided into 2 groups (Early and Late) based on the median age at surgery (all open) (113 days). Biliary obstruction was more common in the Early group (10 vs. 2; P = 0.01). Two perforations occurred, both in the Early group. With a deliberate policy of regular ultrasound-based follow-up we have seen no anastomotic complications (leak, stenosis, persistent intrahepatic biliary dilatation or stones) or post-operative cholangitis in any child [median follow-up 3.42 (1.30-8.05) years].
CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest series documenting the outcomes of antenatally-detected CCMs, certainly in Europe and North America. Such lesions are invariably cystic in nature, and either Types 1C, 4C or 5. The absence of complications using a policy of early intervention (where possible) in experienced hepatobiliary units was shown.
