Title: Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty in the Modern Era: A Review of Outcomes, Indications, and Technical Advances.

Abstract: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) improves the hemodynamics and symptoms of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the short term with low rates of complications, but has not been shown to be an effective destination therapy. Our pooled analysis of >14,300 patients from studies published between January 1, 1991, and April 31, 2022, reported intraprocedural mortality and in-hospital mortality rates as 1.94% (95% CI, 1.39%-2.59%) and 6.02% (95% CI, 4.83%-7.32%), respectively. Hence, BAV is primarily indicated as a bridge to aortic valve replacement/decision with secondary uses as bridge to noncardiac surgery and palliative therapy. Recent advancements in alternative access sites, balloon catheters, and lithotripsy for BAV have opened opportunities for expanded use and further improvements in complication rates. As the utilization of BAV has continually increased since the advent of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, reexamining the role and outcomes of BAV in the era of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become increasingly important. This review focuses on the outcomes, indications, advances, and technical considerations for BAV.
