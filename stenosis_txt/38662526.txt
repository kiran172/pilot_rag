Title: In-stent restenosis estimation following carotid artery stenting: The robust predictive value of atherogenic index of plasma and other non-traditional lipid profiles.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis is a significant contributor to ischemic strokes, and carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as a pivotal treatment option. However, in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a concern, impacting the long-term patency of CAS. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of non-traditional lipid profiles, including the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), in ISR development.
METHODS: This retrospective single-center study involved patients presenting at a tertiary healthcare facility with severe carotid artery disease between 2016 and 2020 who subsequently underwent CAS. A total of 719 patients were included in the study. The study cohort was divided into ISR and non-ISR groups based on restenosis presence, confirmed by angiography following ultrasonographic follow-up assessments. Non-traditional lipid indices, such as AIP, atherogenic index (AI), and lipoprotein combined index (LCI), were evaluated along with traditional risk factors.
RESULTS: During a 24-month follow-up, ISR occurred in 4.03% of patients. To determine the predictors of restenosis, three different models were constructed in multivariate analysis for non-traditional lipid indices. Multivariate analysis revealed AIP as a robust independent predictor of ISR (OR: 4.83 (CI 95 % 3.05-6.63, p &lt; .001). Notably, AIP demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to AI and LCI, with a higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.971.
CONCLUSION: Non-traditional lipid profiles, especially AIP, were found to be associated with an increased risk of ISR and may serve as predictors of ISR in patients undergoing CAS.
