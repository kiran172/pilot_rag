Title: Prognostic Risk Stratification of Patients with Moderate Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Currently risk stratification of moderate aortic stenosis (AS) is still incipient. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors in patients with moderate AS.
METHODS: The prognosis of patients with moderate AS (1 &lt; aortic valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2) stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; 50%), stroke volume index (SVI; 35 mL/m2), and elevated E/e' ratio (average, 14) was compared with that of the age- and sex-matched general population.
RESULTS: Of 696 patients (median age, 77 years; aortic valve area 1.3 cm2; 57% men), 279 (40%) died during a median follow-up period of 3.4 years. Mortality was higher in patients with moderate AS than reference (mortality ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.17-2.72). LVEF &lt; 50%, SVI &lt; 35 mL/m2, and elevated E/e' ratio were present in 113 (17%), 54 (8%), and 330 (54%) patients; mortality ratios were 3.89 (95% CI, 3.07-4.85), 6.40 (95% CI, 4.57-8.71), and 2.58 (95% CI, 2.21-3.00), respectively. Even if LVEF or SVI was preserved, the mortality ratio was more than twice than reference (P &lt; .001), but elevated E/e' ratio could discriminate additional patients at higher risk (hazard ratio [HR], 2.71; 95% CI, 1.88-3.91). Two hundred one patients (29%) underwent aortic valve replacement at a median of 2.3 years after the diagnosis of moderate AS. LVEF &lt; 50% (HR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.39-6.56), SVI &lt; 35 mL/m2 (HR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.02-10.90) and elevated E/e' ratio (HR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.26-5.94) were all associated with worse prognosis even if aortic valve replacement was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate AS, those with decreased LVEF and/or SVI are at high risk. Even if these parameters are preserved, patients with elevated E/e' ratios are at intermediate risk. Further investigation is warranted to assess whether earlier intervention could improve outcomes and reduced cardiac-related death among patients at high and intermediate risk.
