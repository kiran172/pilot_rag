Title: Nonhypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis in a Neonate: A Rare Presentation.

Abstract: Gastric outlet obstruction in neonates due to nonhypertrophic pyloric stenosis (NHPS) is a rare cause. We report the case of a 37-day-old baby boy who presented with complaints of vomiting for the last 2 weeks and an inconsolable cry over the last 2 days. He has been vomiting seven to eight times a day, a few hours after breastfeeding. On ultrasonography, the stomach was distended, while the pylorus was not hypertrophied. An upper gastrointestinal (GI) contrast study was done, which was suggestive of gastric volvulus. We performed a laparoscopy for the same. Intraoperatively, the volvulus was already resolved. We performed gastropexy. Postoperatively, he had persistent symptoms, for which an upper GI endoscopy was performed. It demonstrated a narrow pylorus, consistent with the NHPS. We performed a laparoscopic Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty. The patient's symptoms had improved postoperatively. He was discharged after 5 days.
