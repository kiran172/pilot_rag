Title: Evaluation of a novel mesh-covered stent for treatment of carotid stenosis in patients at high risk for endarterectomy: 1-year results of the SCAFFOLD trial.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The SCAFFOLD trial evaluated the GORE® Carotid Stent (GCS), a novel, mesh-covered device and evaluated outcomes at 1 year.
BACKGROUND: SCAFFOLD was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis (angiographically defined as symptomatic ≥50% or asymptomatic ≥80%) at increased risk for adverse events from carotid endarterectomy. Interim 30-day analysis demonstrated low rates of death/stroke/myocardial infarction (DSMI; 3.0%) and stroke (1.1%) in a high surgical risk population.
METHODS: The rate of DSMI within 30 days plus ipsilateral stroke between 31 days and 1 year (primary endpoint) was compared to a predetermined performance goal. Secondary outcomes of freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR; diameter stenosis ≥80% by core lab angiography, or ≥50% with clinical symptoms) and restenosis (≥80% diameter stenosis by core lab angiography) are reported as Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates.
RESULTS: Of the 312 patients enrolled and treated, 264 were eligible per protocol and evaluable for major adverse events at 30 days, and 244 (92%) of these were evaluable at 1 year. The proportion of patients with DSMI at 1 year was 4.5% and was significantly lower than the prespecified performance goal of 16.9% (p < .00001). The proportion with ipsilateral stroke from 31 to 365 days was 1.2%. The KM estimates of 1-year event probability were 1.6% for CD-TLR and 1.2% for restenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the mesh-covered GCS in the SCAFFOLD trial demonstrated 100% technical success and low rates of both periprocedural and late stroke, with durable patency at 1 year. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01901874 (redacted).
