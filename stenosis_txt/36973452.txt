Title: Recurrent reversible in-stent-stenosis after flow diverter treatment.

Abstract: Flow diverter stents (FDS) are well established in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms which are difficult to treat with conventional endovascular techniques. However, they carry a relatively high risk of specific complications compared to conventional stents. A minor but frequent finding is the occurrence of reversible in-stent-stenosis (ISS) that tend to resolve spontaneously over time. Here, we report the case of a patient in their 30s who was treated with FDS for bilateral paraophthalmic internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms. ISS were found at the respective early follow-up examinations on both sides and had resolved at the 1-year follow-up examinations. Surprisingly ISS reoccurred at both sides in later follow-up examinations and again resolved spontaneously. The recurrence of ISS after resolution is a finding that has not been described previously. Its incidence and further development should be investigated systematically. This might contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effect of FDS.
