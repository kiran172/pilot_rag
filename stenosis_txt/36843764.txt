Title: Fascinating Case Presentation of Moyamoya Disease in Children and Adults.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is a rare idiopathic disease characterized by progressive stenosis and collateral development of the distal internal carotid arteries. It is mainly seen in East Asia and is the most common cause of stroke in Asian children. However, it is rare in the Indian subcontinent. We present three exciting cases of moyamoya disease with varied clinical presentations in one pediatric, one young adult, and one older patient.
