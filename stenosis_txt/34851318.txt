Title: [Late kidney transplant complications treatment.].

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Late kidney transplant complication might compromise graft durability, thus the need for early detection and treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A PubMed review including the following MeSH terms was included: kidney transplant¨, ¨complications¨, ¨vascular complications¨,¨transplant renal artery stenosis¨, ¨ureteral obstruction¨,¨urologic complications¨, ¨forgotten stent¨, ¨vesicoureteralreflux¨, ¨urinary lithiasis¨ e ¨incisional hernia¨. Metanalysis and systematic review in spanish and English were included from January 2015 till February 2021, as well as relevant selected manuscripts. RESULTS: We defined as late complications those appearing at 3 months from kidney transplant. Those include vascular complications (renal artery stricture), urinary tract (ureteral stricture, permanent double Js, pyelonephritis due to reflux, urinary stones) and abdominal wall (incisional hernia).
CONCLUSIONS: Late kidney transplant complications remain high still with advancement on surgical technique and immunotherapy. Those complication might compromise the graft durability and so early detection is or primary importance.
