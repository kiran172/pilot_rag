Title: Management of preeclampsia with severe features in a patient with relapsing polychondritis affecting the tracheobronchial tree.

Abstract: Relapsing polychondritis is a rare disease that affects cartilaginous structures throughout the body. Progressive destruction of the laryngeal structures and the tracheobronchial tree occurs in 50% of patients, potentially leading to loss of patency and collapse of the airway. Respiratory involvement in relapsing polychondritis includes airway stenosis, tracheomalacia and recurrent lung infections due to chronic inflammation caused by the destruction of upper and lower airway cartilage. Pregnancy and preeclampsia can worsen pharyngolaryngeal oedema, while treatment with magnesium sulphate can affect neuromuscular function, exacerbating the degree of airway collapse in the most serious cases of relapsing polychondritis, possibly altering obstetric outcomes. Here, we present the management of a pregnant woman with relapsing polychondritis who presented with features of severe preeclampsia at 29 weeks and 6 days gestation. We believe that this is the first published case of the combination of the two disorders, complicated by acute respiratory failure after treatment with magnesium sulphate.
