Title: Trends in diagnosis of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis: 3-year analysis of scintigraphic studies: Prevalence of myocardial uptake and its predictor factors.

Abstract: To determine the prevalence of myocardial uptake (MU) and to identify predictors of MU in patients undergoing scintigraphy. Retrospective single-center series of technetium-99 m-labelled 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD) scans performed from March 2017 to March 2020. All patients undergoing scintigraphy were included, except those with preexisting amyloidosis. The features of MU, patients' characteristics and comorbidities were documented. Multivariate analysis was used to find items predicting MU. A total of 3,629 99mTc-DPD scans (total 11,444) were performed in patients aged > 70. The overall prevalence of MU was 2.7% (82/3,629); 1.2% in 2017-2018, to 2% in 2018-2019, and to 3.7% in 2019-2020. The prevalence of MU in patients without suspected cardiomyopathy was 1.2%; 1.1% in 2017-2018, 1.5% in 2018-2019 and 1% in 2019-2020. There is an increase in the number of requests due to suspected cardiomyopathy from 0.2% in 2017-2018 to 1.4% in 2018-2019 and to 4.8% in 2019-2020. Age, male sex, hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, aortic stenosis, and carpal tunnel syndrome were found to be predictors of MU. In patients without heart failure, only age, atrial fibrillation, and carpal tunnel syndrome were predicted MU. The prevalence of MU in scintigraphic studies surged over time due to the incremental referrals under the indication of cardiomyopathy workup. Atrial fibrillation and carpal tunnel syndrome were predictors for MU in patients without heart failure. Identifying patients with MU and no heart failure for extended screening for ATTR can lead to an earlier diagnosis and application of novel treatments.
