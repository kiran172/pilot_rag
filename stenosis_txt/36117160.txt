Title: Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerine can prevent unnecessary percutaneous coronary intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite the recommendation of the current guidelines, intracoronary administration of nitroglycerine during coronary angiography is often neglected. We investigated the effect of intra-coronary nitroglycerin on the relief of coronary artery stenosis in the candidates for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: We included patients with angina pectoris or myocardial infarction who were candidates for PCI. In the coronary angiography, the culprit vessel involved was evaluated, and bolus nitroglycerin at a dose of 25-200 mcg was injected into the affected coronary artery. A significant change in the percentage of coronary artery stenosis was considered a positive response, and these patients were then compared with patients who did not have a substantial change in the percentage of stenosis at the same time. Univariate analysis and then multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of response to intracoronary nitroglycerin.
RESULTS: Among 360 patients, 27 (7.5%) responded to nitroglycerine, and 333 (92.5%) were non-responsive. The mean age of patients was 60.2 ± 11.6 years, ranging from 23 to 93 years, and 265 (73.6%) were men. The study groups were not significantly different in the baseline demographic characteristics. The presence of multivessel disease (Odds ratio (OR) = 16.26, 95% confidence interval (CI):2.07-127.6; P = 0.008) and stenosis in the left circumflex artery (OR = 3.62, 95% CI: 1.03-12.70; P = 0.044) were the independent predictors for nonresponse to nitroglycerine, leading to PCI.
CONCLUSION: In some cases, especially those without multivessel diseases, intracoronary nitroglycerine administration can efficiently relieve coronary stenosis and prevent unnecessary PCI.
