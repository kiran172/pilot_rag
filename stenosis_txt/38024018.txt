Title: Femorotibial Bypass Sutured on Bovine Pericardium Patch of the Femoral Artery for Bypass Inflow: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 72-year-old man presented with intermittent claudication and a foot ulcer. Computed tomography revealed severe calcification and occlusion of the left femoral artery and calcification and stenosis from the superficial femoral artery to the popliteal artery. Thromboendarterectomy (TEA) and anterior reconstruction of the femoral artery with a bovine pericardium patch were performed. We sutured the great saphenous vein on the bovine pericardium patch for bypass inflow after creating an anastomosis hole with a puncher and performed an in situ femorotibial bypass. This technique helped us achieve a smooth and clean anastomosis. In situ vein graft anastomosis might be difficult on severely atherosclerotic femoral artery after TEAÂ and difficult anastomosis increases the risk of bypass occlusion. Anastomosis on the bovine pericardium patch for bypass inflow might ensure smooth and clean anastomosis in patients with severe atherosclerosis of the femoral artery.
