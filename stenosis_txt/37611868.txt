Title: Prognostic benefits of early vascular surgical intervention in patients with major peripheral vascular complications following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze the incidence, surgical management of major vascular complications, and outcomes in patients undergoing transfemoral (TF) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at our center after strict selection of the access route, carefully considering all known major predictors.
METHODS: Data of 494 consecutive patients with pre-interventional multi-slice computed tomography (CT) of the aorta who had undergone TF TAVR from 2009 to 2019 were analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 23/494 (4.7%) patients had major vascular and access-related complications of peripheral vessels and/or infrarenal aorta. These included hematomas that met the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3-criteria of major vascular complications (7/494, 1.4%), arterial dissections (3/494, 0.6%), pseudoaneurysm (6/494, 1.2%), thrombus of the external iliac artery leading to acute limb ischemia (1/494, 0.2%), fistula (1/494, 0.2%), and perforation (5/494, 1.0%). In total, 17/23 (73.9%) major vascular complications required immediate endovascular and/or open surgery. In 16/17 (94%) cases, only 1 surgical procedure was performed. The long-term survival of patients with and without major vascular complications of the peripheral vessels was determined after 2Â years.
CONCLUSIONS: Early vascular surgery intervention reversed the mortality disadvantage in patients with major complications of the peripheral vessels after TAVR. This underscores the importance of immediate vascular surgery stand-by as an indispensable requirement.
