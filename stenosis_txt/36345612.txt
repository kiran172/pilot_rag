Title: Novel stapler-assisted technique for closure of persistent tracheoesophageal puncture fistula.

Abstract: Tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) is a reliable method to restore voice and is an important part of voice rehabilitation following laryngectomy. However, complications following this procedure, including peri-prosthetic leakage and resulting aspiration pneumonia, may necessitate surgical closure. In this study, we present an effective and reliable method for TEP closure using a stapler-assisted technique. Case series study for patients who underwent stapler-assisted TEP closure reviewed from 2017 to 2021. All five patients had successful closure of their TEP tract without further leakage. No postoperative bleeding, wound infection, or esophageal stenosis occurred. One patient had postoperative stomal stenosis. The stapler-assisted technique for TEP closure is easy, quick, and effective. The reliability and quick return to oral intake post-operatively make it a preferable option over previous techniques.
