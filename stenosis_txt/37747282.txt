Title: Tracheal Agenesis: One Hospital's Nursing Experience With This Rare Airway Anomaly Case Report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheal agenesis is a rare and often fatal congenital anomaly that occurs early in fetal development. Tracheal agenesis occurs in one in 50,000 to 100,000 live births. This case study describes the nursing aspect of caring for this type of patient.
CLINICAL FINDINGS: Airway anomalies in neonates can be diagnosed immediately at birth or later when the infant develops respiratory distress or respiratory failure. Diagnosis and management of tracheal agenesis is difficult and a complex problem requiring a multidisciplinary medical team's expert approach for its treatment.
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory distress syndrome versus tracheoesophageal fistula was suspected.
INTERVENTIONS: The infant quickly decompensated, requiring intubation and eventual transfer to our tertiary care center for further evaluation of a possible airway anomaly. Because of deteriorating status, surgery was performed, and it was discovered the patient had tracheal agenesis, requiring the development of a 3-dimensional trachea specific for this patient.
OUTCOMES: This article describes the nursing aspect of caring for this type of patient.
PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: This article describes the success of nursing interventions and teamwork among nursing and the multidisciplinary team for the successful discharge of this patient home to her family.
