Title: Recurrent Stenoses in Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) for Dialysis Access: cuttIng ballooN angioplaSTy combined wITh paclitaxel drUg-coaTed balloon angioplasty, an observatIONal study (INSTITUTION Study).

Abstract: PURPOSE: To study the safety and efficacy of cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA) followed by paclitaxel drug-coated balloon (PCB) angioplasty for recurrent venous lesions in arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective single-arm cohort study of CBA followed by PCB angioplasty for recurrent AVF stenoses between September 2017 and April 2019. In total, 44 participants were recruited. Target lesions were included if they had recurred within 12 months post-angioplasty, were >  = 0.5 cm upstream from the arteriovenous anastomosis, and did not involve the central veins. Up to two non-target lesions per circuit/participant with the same definition were allowed. Lesions were considered separate when there was an intervening 2-cm segment of normal vessel. Technical success was defined as complete lesion effacement on angioplasty. End-points of target and circuit patency were evaluated clinically at 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure.
RESULT: Technical success was 96% (42/44): Two participants were excluded from analysis due to the need for high-pressure balloon angioplasty as the target lesions did not efface with CBA. The median follow-up duration was 337.5 days. Mean stenosis pre- and post-angioplasty was 69.0% (51.6-84.8) and 20.8% (0-44.8), respectively. The target lesion primary, primary assisted and circuit patency for the entire study population (n = 42) were 61.6 ± 7.8%, 92.7 ± 4.0%, and 54.7 ± 7.9%, respectively, at 12 months. For participants without non-target lesions (n = 22), the rates were 77.3 ± 8.9%, 90.9 ± 6.1%, and 60.7 ± 11.0%, respectively, at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: CBA followed by PCB angioplasty appears safe and feasible for treatment of recurrent venous lesions in dysfunctional AVFs.
