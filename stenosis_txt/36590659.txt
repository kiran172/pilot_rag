Title: Multiple tracheobronchial diverticula in a post-TB patient: A case report.

Abstract: The presence of multiple tracheal and bronchial diverticula is a rare condition. We present a case of a 22-years old non-smoker male with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, having multiple tracheal and bronchial diverticula along with other common sequelae such as stenosed and collapsed upper lobe bronchi.
