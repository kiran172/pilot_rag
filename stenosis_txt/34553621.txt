Title: Superficialization of dilated radial artery for vascular access: A case report.

Abstract: Successful hemodialysis treatment need a well functioning vascular access (VA) allowing two cannulation sites with enough blood flow have minimum adverse events. The expectations, age of the HD population are rising as well as the lack of conventional methods due to central venous exhaustion, we have to choose some complex access, including complex or tertiary vascular access mentioned in 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines of the European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) and the option to abandon the venous circuit in instead of arterial system, including arterial-arterial graft and arterial superficialization. This article report a complicated case of AVF dysfunction, central venous stenosis due to central venous catheter and aortic dissection stent as well as lower extremity arteriosclerosis occlusion, using the simple method of superficialization of enlarged radial artery to maintain hemodialysis.
