Title: Periadventitial biomaterials to improve arteriovenous fistula and graft outcomes.

Abstract: Periadventitial biomaterials have been employed for nearly three decades to promote adaptive venous remodeling following hemodialysis vascular access creation in preclinical models and clinical trials. These systems are predicated on the combination of scaffolds, hydrogels, and/or particles with therapeutics (small molecules, proteins, genes, and cells) to prevent venous stenosis and subsequent maturation failure. Periadventitial biomaterial therapies have evolved from simple drug delivery vehicles for traditional drugs to more thoughtful designs tailored to the pathophysiology of access failure. The emergence of tissue engineering strategies and gene therapies are another exciting new direction. Despite favorable results in experimental and preclinical studies, no periadventitial therapy has been clinically approved to improve vascular access outcomes. After conducting an exhaustive review of the literature, we identify the seminal studies and clinical trials that utilize periadventitial biomaterials and discuss the key features of each biomaterial format and their respective shortcomings as they pertain to access maturation. This review provides a foundation from which clinicians, surgeons, biologists, and engineers can refer to and will hopefully inspire thoughtful, translatable treatments to finally address access failure.
