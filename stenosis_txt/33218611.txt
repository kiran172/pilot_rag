Title: Anesthetic considerations in transcarotid artery revascularization.

Abstract: Transcarotid artery revascularization is a relatively new technology made available to vascular interventionalists within the last several years for patients with carotid artery stenosis. However, the intraoperative techniques and perioperative management of these patients continues to evolve as more experience is gained. Herein, we consider some important principles of anesthesia for patients undergoing this procedure.
