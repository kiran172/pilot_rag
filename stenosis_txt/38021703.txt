Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Migration During Vascular Access Closure.

Abstract: We present a novel complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) involving prosthetic migration due to entanglement by a standard guidewire during non-large bore vascular access closure, followed by successful bail-out using a second transcatheter prosthesis. To our knowledge, this mechanism of prosthesis migration has not been previously described.
