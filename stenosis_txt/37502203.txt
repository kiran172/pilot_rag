Title: Plaque Protrusion in a Patient with Left Common Carotid Artery Stenting after Radiation Therapy: A Case Report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We report a case of additional carotid artery stenting (CAS) for plaque protrusion occurring after initial CAS for radiation-induced common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man with a history of radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer presented to our hospital with sudden-onset right hemiparesis. Since vulnerable plaque of the left CCA was considered the embolic source for ischemic stroke, CAS was performed for left CCA stenosis. No perioperative complications were observed and the patient was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0. However, 1 month after CAS, cerebral embolism recurred. As protruding plaque was found on CTA, additional endovascular treatment was performed with intravascular ultrasonography. He was discharged without complications and showed a good outcome at 3 months.
CONCLUSION: In CCA stenosis after radiotherapy, accelerated arteriosclerosis may cause drug-resistant cerebral embolism and plaque protrusion after CAS, making determination of the treatment strategy difficult. Appropriate treatment options need to be based on individual underlying diseases and plaque instability.
