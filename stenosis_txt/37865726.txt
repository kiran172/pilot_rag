Title: Perfusion deficits in thrombolysis-treated acute ischemic stroke patients with negative or positive diffusion-weighted imaging.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT perfusion may provide diagnostic information for intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) administration in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. We aimed to compare the clinical features and perfusion deficits of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)-negative and DWI-positive AIS patients.
METHODS: This retrospective and observational study included thrombolysis-treated AIS patients undergoing multimodel CT imaging before treatment and DWI after treatment between 2021 and 2022. Two experienced neuroradiologists blindly and independently examined the images to identify perfusion deficits in AIS patients. The patients were divided into DWI-positive and DWI-negative groups based on visible hyperintense lesions on DWI. A modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of ≤ 2 indicated good functional outcomes at discharge. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether CT perfusion was an independent predictor of positive DWI imaging on follow-up.
RESULTS: This study included 151 patients, of whom 35 (23.2%) patients were DWI-negative on follow-up. These DWI-negative patients were less likely to have a medical history of atrial fibrillation; they had lower triglyceride levels, a shorter admission time, lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores after IV t-PA and lower mRS scores at discharge, and had better functional outcomes. A total of 37.1% of DWI-positive and 25.7% of DWI-negative patients had vascular stenosis (P = 0.215). A total of 47.4% of DWI-positive and 37.1% of DWI-negative patients had CT perfusion deficits (P = 0.284). A total of 73.5% of patients with normal CT perfusion had positive DWI, while 19.1% of patients with perfusion deficits had negative DWI. The sensitivity and specificity of NCCT were 14.8% and 97.1% (Kappa = 0.061, P = 0.074), CTP was 47.4% and 62.9% for predicting DWI lesion (Kappa = 0.069, P = 0.284).
CONCLUSIONS: About 23.2% of AIS patients who received intravenous thrombolysis treatment did not have a relevant DWI-MRI lesion on follow-up. Over one-third of patients in the DWI-MRI negative group showed CT perfusion deficits, with a sensitivity of 47.4% for predicting DWI lesions in non-mechanical thrombectomy patients.
