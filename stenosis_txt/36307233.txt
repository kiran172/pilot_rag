Title: Assessment of the degree of arterial stenosis in intracranial atherosclerosis using 3D high-resolution MRI: comparison with time-of-flight MRA, contrast-enhanced MRA, and DSA.

Abstract: AIM: To compare the accuracy of three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA), and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in measuring the degree of stenosis in intracranial atherosclerosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with intracranial artery ischaemic events underwent HR-MRI, TOF-MRA, and CE-MRA analysis, and some of these patients underwent DSA examination. The correlation between different methods for measuring the degree of lumen stenosis was analysed. The accuracy of HR-MRI, TOF-MRA, and CE-MRA was evaluated and compared with that of DSA.
RESULTS: A total of 189 arterial stenoses were identified in 93 patients. Of these, 72 patients with 142 arterial stenoses underwent DSA examination. A very strong correlation between HR-MRI and CE-MRA measurements was shown (r=0.839, p<0.0001). The correlation between HR-MRI and TOF-MRA measurements was strong (r=0.720, p<0.0001). A very strong correlation between HR-MRI and DSA measurements was found (r=0.864, p<0.0001), and a similar correlation was observed between CE-MRA, and DSA measurements (r=0.843, p<0.0001). The correlation between TOF-MRA and DSA measurements was strong (r=0.686, p<0.0001). There was substantial agreement between HR-MRI and DSA measurements (K = 0.772) and between CE-MRA, and DSA measurements (K = 0.734) that was slightly higher than the agreement between TOF-MRA and DSA measurements (K = 0.636).
CONCLUSION: HR-MRI can accurately measure stenosis (especially for moderate and severe stenosis) in intracranial atherosclerosis by direct visualisation of the vessel lumen and steno-occlusive plaque.
