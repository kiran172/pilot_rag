Title: Comparison of Minimally Invasive Surgery Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion and TLIF for Treatment of Lumbar Spine Stenosis.

Abstract: With the development of minimally invasive technology, minimally invasive surgery transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion has become an effective way to treat lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar spinal stenosis is one of the common diseases that cause backache or lumbago and sciatica. This article compares and analyzes the clinical efficacy of 60 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis surgery. It can be seen that the wound by MIS-TLIF is significantly less than that of traditional open surgery, and the postoperative recovery of MIS-TLIF is faster. So, MIS-TLIF is one of the concepts of minimally invasive surgery. The age distribution ranged from 56 to 78 years, with an average of 65.7 years. 31 cases were treated with MIS-TLIF (MIS-TLIF group), and 29 were treated with traditional posterior open surgery (TLIF group). The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative drainage of the operation area were recorded. After statistical testing, the intraoperative blood loss, incision size, and postoperative drainage volume of the wound in the MIS-TLIF group were significantly less than those in the TLIF group. The results of JOA score, ODI score, and VAS score during the postoperative follow-up period were comparable to those of open surgery. Therefore, minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion is effective in treating lumbar spinal stenosis.
