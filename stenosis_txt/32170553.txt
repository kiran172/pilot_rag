Title: Clinical outcome after surgical aortic valve replacement in low-risk Japanese patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Two randomized control trials demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve implantation was associated with 1-2 year clinical outcomes comparable or even superior to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in low surgical risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). However, no previous study has reported the clinical outcomes after SAVR in Japanese patients with low surgical risk. From 3815 consecutive patients enrolled in the CURRENT AS registry, we retrieved 220 patients who underwent SAVR in reference to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the PARTNER 3 trial. Age and surgical risk score in the current study population were comparable to those in the PARTNER 3 trial (Age: 75 years versus 74 years, and STS-PROM score: 2.3 versus 1.9). The cumulative incidence of a composite all-cause death or stroke was comparable between the current study population and the SAVR patients in the PARTNER 3 trial both at 30-day (2.3% versus 3.3%), and at 1-year (4.1% versus 4.9%). The clinical outcomes of SAVR in low surgical risk patients with severe AS selected from a real world Japanese registry according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the PARTNER 3 trial was favorable and numerically comparable to those of SAVR patients in the PARTNER 3 trial.
