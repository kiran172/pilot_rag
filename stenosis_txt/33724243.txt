Title: The Classification of Biliary Strictures in Patients With Right-Lobe Liver Transplant Recipients and Its Relation to Traversing the Stricture With a Guidewire.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Traversing the stricture with a guidewire is a prerequisite for the endoscopic treatment of biliary strictures after living donor liver transplantation. We aimed to evaluate the effect of variations in the biliary anastomosis and strictures on the success of endoscopic treatment and suggest a cholangiographic classification.
METHODS: The 125 strictures among the 104 patients with right-lobe living donor liver transplantation were reviewed. The strictures were classified by the anastomosis pattern according to the number (1, 2, or >2), location (common bile, hepatic, or cystic duct), the angle between the proximal and distal sites of the anastomosis, and the contrast enhancement pattern. The relationship between the success rate of traversing the anastomosis and the classification was evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 125 biliary strictures, 86 (68.8%) could be passed via endoscopically. Thirty-three strictures were managed either percutaneously (n = 13) or by magnetic compression anastomosis (n = 20). Compared with the round, the triangular (odds ratio [OR], 6.5), the intermediate form (OR, 17.7), and the end-to-side anastomosis (OR, 5.1) were associated with an increased chance of traversing. The contrast enhancement pattern of the strictures and the bile ducts was also related to the successful rate of the endoscopic treatment (P < 0.001). The success rate was higher in the patients with the angle between the proximal and distal sites of the anastomosis approximated was small (0°-30° = 74%, 30°-60° = 69%, 60°-90° = 63%, >90° = 41%).
CONCLUSIONS: The type of biliary anastomoses and stricture affect the success rate of endoscopic treatment. These data may play role in making decision about the type of anastomosis during the surgery.
