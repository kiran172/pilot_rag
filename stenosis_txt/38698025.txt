Title: Neurological affection and serum neurofilament light chain in wild type transthyretin amyloidosis.

Abstract: In contrast to inherited transthyretin amyloidosis (A-ATTRv), neuropathy is not a classic leading symptom of wild type transthyretin amyloidosis (A-ATTRwt). However, neurological symptoms are increasingly relevant in A-ATTRwt as well. To better understand the role of neurological symptoms in A-ATTRwt, A-ATTRwt patients were prospectively characterized at Amyloidosis Center Charité Berlin (ACCB) between 2018 and 2023 using detailed neurological examination, quality of life questionnaires, and analysis of age- and BMI-adapted serum neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels. 16 out of 73 (21.9%) patients presented with a severe neuropathy which we defined by a Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 20 or more. In this group, quality of life was reduced, peripheral neuropathy was more severe, and spinal stenosis and joint replacements were frequent. Age- and BMI matched serum NFL levels were markedly elevated in patients with a NIS ≥ 20. We therefore conclude that highly abnormal values in neuropathy scores such as the NIS occur in A-ATTRwt, and have an important impact on quality of life. Both peripheral neuropathy and spinal canal stenosis are likely contributors. Serum NFL may serve as a biomarker for neurological affection in patients with A-ATTRwt. It will be important to consider neurological aspects of A-ATTRwt for diagnosis, clinical follow-up, and future treatment development.
