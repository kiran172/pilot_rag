Title: Association of LDLc to HDLc ratio with carotid plaques in a community-based population with a high stroke risk: A cross-sectional study in China.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) ratio (LDLc/HDLc) and carotid plaques remains controversial. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate whether LDLc/HDLc is associated with carotid plaques in individuals with a high-stroke-risk.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study initially enrolled 5529 residents aged 40 years or older from Yangzhou, China in 2013-2014. All participants received a questionnaire interview, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Risk factors for stroke included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, smoking, less exercise, overweight/obesity, and family stroke history. Subjects with at least three of the risk factors or a history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) were defined as a high-stroke-risk population. Carotid ultrasonography was only conducted for this high-stroke-risk population. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of LDLc/HDLc with the presence of carotid plaques. Final analysis included 839 high-stroke-risk subjects and 40.6% were identified to have carotid plaques. Subjects with the highest tertiles group of LDLc/HDLc had a higher proportion of carotid plaques than the other two groups (47.1% vs. 34.6% and 40.4%, P < 0.001). With each unit increase of LDLc/HDLc, the chance of having carotid plaques increased by 65% (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.31-2.08) after adjusted for potential confounders. Among most subgroups, a higher LDLc/HDLc was significantly correlated with the presence of carotid plaques.
CONCLUSION: Higher LDLc/HDLc was significantly associated with the presence of carotid plaques in the Chinese population with a high risk of stroke.
