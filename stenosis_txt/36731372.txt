Title: Improving the diagnostic performance of computed tomography angiography for intracranial large arterial stenosis by a novel super-resolution algorithm based on multi-scale residual denoising generative adversarial network.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is very popular because it is characterized by rapidity and accessibility. However, CTA is inferior to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in the diagnosis of intracranial artery stenosis or occlusion. DSA is an invasive examination, so we optimized the quality of cephalic CTA images.
METHODS: We used 5000 CTA images to train multi-scale residual denoising generative adversarial network (MRDGAN). And then 71 CTA images with intracranial large arterial stenosis were treated by Super-Resolution based on Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN), Enhanced Super-Resolution based on Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) and post-trained MRDGAN, respectively. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) of the SRGAN, ESRGAN, MRDGAN and original CTA images were measured respectively. The qualities of MRDGAN and original images were visually assessed using a 4-point scale. The diagnostic coherence of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with MRDGAN and original images was analyzed.
RESULTS: The PSNR was significantly higher in the MRDGAN CTA images (35.96 ± 1.51) than in the original (31.51 ± 1.43), SRGAN (25.75 ± 1.18) and ESRGAN (30.36 ± 1.05) CTA images (all P < 0.001). The SSIM was significantly higher in the MRDGAN CTA images (0.95 ± 0.02) than in the SRGAN (0.88 ± 0.03) and ESRGAN (0.90 ± 0.02) CTA images (all P < 0.01). The visual assessment was significantly higher in the MRDGAN CTA images (3.52 ± 0.58) than in the original CTA images (2.39 ± 0.69) (P < 0.05). The diagnostic coherence between MRDGAN and DSA (κ = 0.89) was superior to that between original images and DSA (κ = 0.62).
CONCLUSION: Our MRDGAN can effectively optimize original CTA images and improve its clinical diagnostic value for intracranial large artery stenosis.
