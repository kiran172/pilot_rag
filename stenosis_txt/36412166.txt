Title: Suitability of the left internal jugular vein for CRT-D placement in the setting of extensive venous occlusion: Case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: Placement of coronary sinus (CS) leads is predominantly accomplished via the left cephalic-axillary-subclavian venous system. However, vein stenosis or occlusion from long-term chronic hemodialysis (HD) in patients with end-stage renal failure can pose a challenge. Cannulation of the CS via the left internal jugular vein (IJV) is technically difficult but often feasible. We report a case in which a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) had extensive left venous system occlusion from prior in dwelling HD catheters, and an AV fistula contralaterally, who underwent biventricular implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement with lead insertion through the left IJV.
