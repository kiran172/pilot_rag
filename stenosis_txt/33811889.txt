Title: Late Outcomes After Pulmonary Arterial Reconstruction in Patients With Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical pulmonary artery reconstruction in patients with arterial tortuosity syndrome has excellent outcomes. In this study, we report our late outcomes after more than a decade of experience with such complex interventions.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 33 arterial tortuosity syndrome patients who underwent pulmonary artery reconstruction. The mean preoperative right ventricular to left ventricular pressure ratio was 1.19 ± 0.2. Our surgical approach included either a single-stage complete repair through a median sternotomy (17 patients) or a two-stage repair through sternotomy/left thoracotomy (16 patients), depending on the degree of distal involvement in the left pulmonary artery.
RESULTS: Median age was 36 months. All patients had distal segmental peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Thirty patients (90.1%) were symptomatic before surgery. There was one hospital death due to viral pneumonia 78 days after the surgery (in-hospital mortality 3%). The mean right ventricular to left ventricular pressure ratio decreased to 0.31 ± 0.07 early postoperatively (P < 0.001), representing a 74% reduction compared with preoperative values. Follow-up was 100% complete for all hospital survivors (32 of 33) with a mean follow-up of 70.42 ± 43.32 months (range, 2 to 143). There was no late mortality or need for reintervention (surgical or catheter based) after hospital discharge. In late postoperative catheterization, the mean right ventricular to left ventricular pressure ratio was 0.27 ± 0.05 (P = .003 compared with early postoperative value). All patients were asymptomatic on their most recent follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of complete surgical reconstruction of all stenotic pulmonary artery segments in patients with arterial tortuosity syndrome is recommended for sustainable successful outcomes more than a decade later.
