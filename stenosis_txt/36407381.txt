Title: Ultrasonographically detected hepatosteatosis independently predicts the presence and severity of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has shown to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between the presence and severity of CAD and NAFLD.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 153 patients who underwent coronary angiographies. Patients were categorized into CAD and non-CAD groups. CAD severity was determined by the number of CAD-involved arteries and the vessel score multiplied by Gensini score, the latter judging CAD severity. Fatty liver was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography (USG), with the patients being categorized by the degree of hepatosteatosis, as Grade 0, Grade 1, and Grade 2-3.
RESULTS: Among the whole study population, 47.1% of patients (n=72) were female and 52.9% of patients (n=81) were male. Forty-three patients had normal coronary arteries; 27 patients had non-critical CAD and side branch disease; and 83 patients had clinically significant CAD (stenosis>50%). The rate of CAD and Gensini score were significantly different between Grade 0, 1 and 2-3 hepatosteatosis groups (p<0.05). Patients with CAD had a significantly higher AST level than those without (p< 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonographically detected hepatosteatosis independently predicts the presence and severity of CAD.
