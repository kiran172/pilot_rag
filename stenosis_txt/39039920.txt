Title: Scedosporium Infection After Intralesional Steroid Injections for Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: Intralesional steroid injections are commonly used to treat idiopathic subglottic stenosis and are believed to have minimal systemic effects. This case report presents an immunocompetent 67-year-old woman with idiopathic subglottic stenosis who developed Scedosporium apiospermum infection of the subglottis following in-office steroid injections, suggesting a potential risk for infection associated with this treatment. This highlights the need for further research to understand the impact of intralesional steroid injections on local and systemic immunocompetency to inform treatment protocols for idiopathic subglottic stenosis.
