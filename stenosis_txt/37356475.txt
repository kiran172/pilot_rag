Title: Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene conduits with curved and handsewn bileaflet designs for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study reviewed the application of curved and bileaflet designs to pulmonary expanded polytetrafluoroethylene conduits with diameters of 10 to 16 mm and characterized this conduit on in vitro experiment, including particle image velocimetry.
METHODS: All patients who received this conduit between 2010 and 2022 were evaluated. Three 16-mm conduits were tested in a circulatory simulator at different cardiac outputs (1.5-3.6 L/minute) and bending angles (130°-150°).
RESULTS: Fifty consecutive patients were included. The median operative body weight was 8.4 kg (range, 2.6-12 kg); 10-, 12-, 14-, and 16-mm conduits were used in 1, 4, 6, and 39 patients, respectively. In 34 patients, the conduit was implanted in a heterotopic position. The overall survival rate was 89% at 8 years with 3 nonvalve-related deaths. There were 10 conduit replacements; 5 16-mm conduits (after 8 years) and 1 12-mm conduit (after 6 years) due to conduit stenosis, and the remaining 4 for reasons other than conduit failure. Freedom from conduit replacement was 89% and 82% at 5 and 8 years, respectively. Linear mixed-effects models with echocardiographic data implied that 16-mm conduits were durable with a peak velocity <3.5 m/second and without moderate/severe regurgitation until the patient's weight reached 25 kg. In experiments, peak transvalvular pressure gradients were 11.5 to 25.5 mm Hg, regurgitant fractions were 8.0% to 14.4%, and peak Reynolds shear stress in midsystolic phase was 29 to 318 Pa.
CONCLUSIONS: Our conduits with curved and bileaflet designs have acceptable clinical durability and proven hydrodynamic profiles, which eliminate valve regurgitation and serve as a reliable bridge to subsequent conduit replacement.
