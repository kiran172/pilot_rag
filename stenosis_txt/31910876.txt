Title: Comparison of quality of life in patients who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement: star GK vs SJM.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We want to compare the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between the Star GK and the SJM valve in the Chinese population.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled a total of 172 patients who had undergone mechanical mitral valve replacement (MVR) (SJM valve in 87 patients and Star GK valve in 85 patients) at our institution from January 2013 to December 2015. We measured the sound pressure level, and used 2 self-administered questionnaires and the Chinese version of SF-36 to measure the HRQoL and valve-specific questions to evaluate patient anxiety.
RESULTS: The Star GK group and the SJM group were similar in age, gender, body surface area, diameter of the implanted valve, underlying disease and current median NYHA class. Regarding the valve sound pressure perceived 1â€‰year after operation, the SJM valve was slightly quieter than the Star GK valve, but the sound pressures of the two valves showed no significant differences. No significant differences in any of the eight subscales of the SF-36 were found between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the Star GK valve is similar to the SJM valve in its impact on HRQoL and audibility of mechanical sound in the Chinese population.
