Title: Temporal Trend in Revascularization for Patients With Ischemic Cardiomyopathy and Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). However, there is limited information about the trends and outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using New Jersey state mandatory registries, 8083 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with CABG or PCI revascularization for multivessel coronary artery disease from 2007 to 2018 were included in the analysis. Joinpoint regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the annual percentage change in trends and predictors of the 30-day mortality rate, respectively. A decline in CABG procedures was observed from 2007 to 2011 (annual percentage change, -11.5%; P=0.003), followed by stabilization. The PCI trend remained unchanged from 2007 to 2010 and then increased significantly (annual percentage change, 3.2%; P=0.02). In the subsample of patients with proximal left anterior descending artery plus circumflex and right coronary artery, CABG was a predominant procedure until 2011, and the proportion of both procedures did not differ thereafter. In the subsample of patients with left anterior descending artery and any other artery stenosis, PCI remained dominant from 2007 to 2018, while in patients with left main and any other artery stenosis, CABG remained dominant from 2007 to 2018 (P&lt;0.001). The 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rate was higher after PCI versus CABG for each year, but after adjustment for completeness of revascularization, there was no difference between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of revascularization procedures for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with multivessel coronary artery disease have changed over the years, as evidenced by the changes in CABG and PCI trends. CABG and PCI had comparable 30-day risk-adjusted mortality risks.
