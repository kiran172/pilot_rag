Title: [Early and long-term results after the Norwood procedure].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the early and long-term results after the Norwood procedure and to identify predictors of aortic recoarctation and arterial hypertension.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have operated on 2789 infants in the department of congenital heart diseases of the Meshalkin National Medical Research Center between January 2015 and December 2018. The current single-center prospective cohort study included 39 (1.4%) patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who underwent the Norwood procedure.
RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 15.3% (n=6). An inter-stage mortality was 10.2% (n=4). Recoarctation of the aorta and Sano shunt stenosis in inter-stage period occurred in 8 (24.2%) and 4 patients (12.1%), respectively. Body mass &lt;3 kg was the only risk factor of recoarctation (OR 7.08, 95% CI 1.17; 42.79, p=0.033). We found no risk factors of Sano shunt stenosis. There were no signs of recoarctation and Sano shunt dysfunction in the early postoperative period. Arterial hypertension developed in 14 (48.3%) patients. We found the correlation between systolic blood pressure and ventricular ejection fraction (Î² coefficient -0.88, 95% CI -1.33; -0.44, p=0.001). The only risk factor of arterial hypertension was increased stiffness of the aorta.
CONCLUSION: The early and inter-stage mortality are still the issues after the Norwood procedure. Postoperative reduced ejection fraction of single ventricle is one of the most common complications that could be related with residual arterial hypertension.
