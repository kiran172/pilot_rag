Title: Tandem Lesions of the Vertebrobasilar System Treated by Thrombectomy and Vertebral Artery Stenting: A Case Report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: There are few reports on endovascular treatment of tandem lesions in the posterior circulation and no consensus on treatment strategies has been reached. We report a case of tandem lesions of basilar artery occlusion and vertebral artery stenosis treated by thrombectomy and vertebral artery stenting.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 73-year-old man who developed consciousness disorder and tetraplegia. Head and neck CTA revealed tandem left vertebral artery stenosis and basilar artery occlusion. The patient was treated using a reverse technique, which involves performing thrombectomy first and then vertebral artery stenting, along with Carotid Guardwire PS. Postoperative impairment of consciousness and improvement of tetraplegia were achieved.
CONCLUSION: The reverse technique combined with Carotid Guardwire PS may be a useful treatment strategy for tandem lesions in the posterior circulation.
