Title: Clinical outcomes of postcarotid endarterectomy hypertension.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the clinical relevance of postcarotid endarterectomy hypertension (PEH) by investigating the effect of PEH on hospital length of stay (LOS) and by investigating short-term and long-term complications of PEH. In addition, risk factors for PEH were determined.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed. Demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative outcomes of 192 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were evaluated. Outcomes were compared between patients with PEH and patients without PEH. PEH was defined as an acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) rise >170 mm Hg or persistent SBP >150 mm Hg on the ward and leading to the consultation of an internist. The overall survival and event-free survival were compared using a Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox regression analysis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine risk factors for PEH.
RESULTS: PEH developed in 44 of 192 patients (25%). Preoperative hypertension (SBP >150 mm Hg) was determined to be a risk factor for PEH (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-6.9). Hospital LOS was prolonged in patients with PEH compared with patients without PEH (median LOS of 5 days vs 3 days, respectively; P < .001). No difference in the occurrence of ischemic neurologic events or rebleeding during hospitalization was observed (P = .58 and P = .72, respectively). Cardiovascular and ischemic neurologic events during follow-up did not occur more often in patients with PEH than in patients without PEH (P = .46). There was no difference in mortality between the PEH and non-PEH groups (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.6-4.3). The same applies to the event-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.4-1.7). Combined event-free survival for stroke and myocardial infarction was 92% (95% CI, 87%-97%) at 2 years for patients without PEH and 86% (95% CI, 74%-98%) at 2 years for patients with PEH (P = .25). Event-free survival for mortality was 90% (95% CI, 85%-96%) at 2 years for patients without PEH and 94% (95% CI, 86%-100%) at 2 years for patients with PEH (P = .36).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PEH had a significant increase in hospital LOS. However, adverse short-term and long-term events did not occur more often in patients with PEH. High preoperative SBP was identified as a risk factor for PEH; no other demographic and clinical variables were associated with PEH.
