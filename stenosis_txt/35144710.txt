Title: Can ectopic right coronary from the left sinus have a different course than intramural? A case of ectopic right with retroaortic course.

Abstract: Retrocardiac course of an ectopic right coronary artery is newly described. The alternative (usual) course of an anomalous right coronary from the left sinus of Valsalva is pre-aortic and intramural, with stenosis. In the present exceptional case, there was no stenosis.
