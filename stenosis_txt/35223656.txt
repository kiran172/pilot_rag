Title: Is There a Chance of Normal Life in Severe Laryngeal web.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Laryngeal web is a rare cause of pediatric stridor and respiratory distress. The clinical presentation is variable and symptoms usually correlate with the severity of the airway obstruction.
CASE REPORTS: We describe the cases of three children unexpectedly diagnosed with laryngeal web after a severe episode of bronchiolitis and after thirteen and eleven years, respectively, of persistent symptoms despite asthma medications.
CONCLUSION: Even if it is a rare cause of stridor and respiratory distress, congenital subglottic web could be a life threatening condition and clinicians should always consider it in the differential diagnosis of persistent noisy breathing, even in adolescents and young adults.
