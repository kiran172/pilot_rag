Title: Carotid Artery Stenting for a Nonagenarian Presenting as Stuttering Stroke.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is performed in patients with minor strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) to prevent further strokes. However, most operators do not intervene in older adults. We had a 92-year patient with recurrent minor strokes with two possible proximate causes - cardioembolism and significant symptomatic left carotid stenosis. This patient continued to have recurrent ischemic events in the left carotid territory despite optimum management of the cardioembolic source with dual antiplatelets and anticoagulation and was successfully treated with left CAS. The role of carotid revascularization in older patients with high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis and cardiac comorbidities is discussed.
