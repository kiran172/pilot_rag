Title: Impact of Preprocedural Aortic Valve Calcification on Conduction Disturbances after Transfemoral Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: AIM: The present study analyzes in depth the impact of different calcification patterns on disturbances of the conduction system in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 169 preprocedural TAVR multislice computed tomography scans from consecutive transfemoral (TF) TAVRs performed between 2014 and 2017 using either Edwards SAPIEN or Medtronic Evolut R valves were retrospectively evaluated. The volume, distribution, and orientation of annular and valvular aortic valve calcification were measured and their impact on postoperative conduction disturbances was determined using linear and logistic regression analyses. The total volume of calcification and distribution at the aortic annulus or valve did not influence the conduction system. Oval calcification of the left aortic cusp was independently associated with an elevated risk for an increase in atrioventricular block degree (+0.6, p = 0.03). Moreover, orthogonal calcifications at the level of the aortic annulus were associated with an increased risk for QRS prolongation (+26 ms, p = 0.004) and an increased risk for permanent pacemaker implantation (OR 4.3, p = 0.03) after TF TAVR. This was more pronounced in patients undergoing TF TAVR using a balloon-expandable Edwards SAPIEN 3 valve (QRS +38.195 ms, p < 0.001; OR permanent pacemaker 15.48, p = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: Orthogonal annular calcification confers an increased risk for conduction disturbances after TAVR. This is even more pronounced after implantation of balloon-expandable valves.
