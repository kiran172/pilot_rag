Title: Histologic Analysis of Urethral Stricture in 9 Patients Following Dorsal Vaginal Graft Urethroplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present the pathologic analysis of female urethral strictures obtained during reconstructive urethroplasty.
METHODS: Nine separate female urethral tissue specimens were obtained during dorsal vaginal graft urethroplasty by a single surgeon (S.P.P.). Samples were serially sectioned and fixed in 10% formalin 6 to 12 hours before routine processing in paraffin blocks. Serial 5-Âµm sections were subjected to H&E, Masson trichrome, and elastin staining. End point analysis included evaluation for epithelial hyperplasia and cell type, mucosal edema, degree of fibroblast/inflammatory cell infiltrate, and elastin fiber density and distribution.
RESULTS: Nine specimens were examined. Six specimens had epithelial linings of stratified squamous epithelium overlying fibrosis (67%), 1 had mixed squamous and urothelial epithelium, and 2 had only urothelial epithelium. Two specimens (29%) showed acute injury with prominent squamous papillary hyperplasia, focal erosion, and patchy mucosal hemorrhage. Areas of urethral stricture were variably thickened, with increased, densely packed collagen fibers and associated mucosal lymphocytic inflammation ranging from mild and patchy to focally dense with lymphoid aggregates. The highest elastin fiber density appeared to be associated with vessels and overlying muscle bundles in the submucosa.
CONCLUSIONS: Further elucidation of histopathologic characteristics may illuminate more appropriate therapeutic pathways for female urethral stricture disease management.
