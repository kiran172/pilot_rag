Title: Incidence and predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis following percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty: a study from a tertiary center in Thailand.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) remains a common and concerning health problem in Asia. Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is the standard treatment for patients with symptomatic severe MS and favorable valve morphology. However, studies on the incidence and predictors of adverse cardiac outcomes following PBMV in Asia have been limited. This study aims to evaluate the incidence and predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with rheumatic MS following PBMV.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with symptomatic severe MS who underwent successful PBMV between 2002 and 2020 at a tertiary academic institute in Thailand. Patients were followed up to assess adverse outcomes, defined as a composite of cardiac death, heart failure hospitalization, repeat PBMV, or mitral valve surgery. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors of adverse outcomes. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A total of 379 patients were included in the study (mean age 43 ± 11 years, 80% female). During a median follow-up of 5.9 years (IQR 1.7-11.7), 74 patients (19.5%) experienced adverse outcomes, with an annualized event rate of 2.7%. Multivariable analysis showed that age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.008-1.05, p = 0.006), significant tricuspid regurgitation (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.33-3.56, p = 0.002), immediate post-PBMV mitral valve area (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25-0.64, p = 0.01), and immediate post-PBMV mitral regurgitation (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.18-3.07, p = 0.008) were independent predictors of adverse outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic severe rheumatic MS, the incidence of adverse outcomes following PBMV was 2.7% per year. Age, significant tricuspid regurgitation, immediate post-PBMV mitral valve area, and immediate post-PBMV mitral regurgitation were identified as independent predictors of these adverse outcomes.
