Title: [Features of the upper gastrointestinal tract mucous membrane state in patients with atherosclerosis of the mesenteric arteries].

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the clinical and endoscopic features of diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in patients with atherosclerosis of the mesenteric arteries (MA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 48 patients with atherosclerosis of MA and 43 patients without atherosclerosis of MA, who were hospitalized in the department of vascular surgery of the Chelyabinsk Regional Clinical Hospital in the period from 2019 to 2021. All patients underwent multispiral computed tomoangiography of the visceral and lower limb arteries, esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
RESULTS: Assessment of lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed a higher incidence of erosive and ulcerative gastroduodenopathies among patients with atherosclerosis of MA (60.4%), compared with patients without atherosclerosis MA (39.5%); p=0.047. Signs of severe atrophy according to the data of histological examination were statistically significantly more frequent among patients with atherosclerosis of MA (29.2 and 11.6%; p=0.031). According to the results of logistic regression, the following predictors of erosions and ulcers of the upper gastrointestinal tract were revealed: the severity of stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is more than 35%, the body mass index (BMI) is less than 25.9 and the total score on the HADS scale is more than 6.5 points for depression (p=0.008).
CONCLUSION: Erosive-ulcerative gastroduodenopathies and atrophy of the gastric mucosa are significantly more common in the group of patients with MA atherosclerosis. The main risk factors for erosions and ulcers of the upper gastrointestinal tract in patients with MA atherosclerosis are: the severity of SMA stenosis is more than 35%, a decrease in BMI is less than 25.9 and an increase in the HADS score is more than 6.5 points.
