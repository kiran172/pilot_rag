Title: Prognostic Value of Coronary Angiography-Derived Fractional Flow Reserve Immediately After Stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential prognostic value of post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) and its gradient across the stent.
BACKGROUND: Post-PCI FFR and its gradient across the stent have been proved to be associated with clinical outcomes. However, little is known about the prognostic value of post-PCI coronary angiography-derived FFR and its gradient across the stent.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease and participated in drug-eluting stent (DES) clinical trials for stent implantation in a single center were included for this retrospective analysis. A novel coronary angiography-derived FFR (caFFR) and its gradient across the stent were calculated offline using two projections from coronary angiography performed after PCI. Clinical follow-up was completed at 9 months after the index procedure and the primary outcome was target vessel failure (TVF), defined as a composite of target vessel-related myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel-related revascularization (TVR), and cardiac death. Coronary angiography was also performed at the 9 months follow-up time to get data of late lumen loss (LLL) and percent diameter stenosis (%DS).
RESULTS: A total of 159 vessels in 136 patients were analyzed. The mean value of post-PCI caFFR was 0.90 ± 0.06. The median value of trans-stent caFFR gradient (ΔcaFFR<sub>stent</sub>) was 0.04 (interquartile range 0.02-0.08). ΔcaFFR<sub>stent</sub>&gt;0 was demonstrated in 147 vessels (92.45%). The TVF rate was significantly higher in patients with post-PCI caFFR &lt; 0.90 (4 [8.16%] vs. 1 [1.15%], P = 0.037), which was mainly achieved by the difference between the TVR rate. In the subgroup with lesions located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), post-PCI caFFR was an independent predictor of LLL (β = -1.07, 95% CI: -1.74 to -0.39, P = 0.002) and %DS at follow-up (β = -30.24, 95% CI: -56.44 to -4.04, P = 0.025), ΔcaFFR<sub>stent</sub> was an independent predictor of LLL (β=0.98, 95% CI:0.13-1.83, P = 0.026).
CONCLUSION: Suboptimal post-PCI caFFR and trans-stent caFFR gradient were common among vessels immediately after stenting. Lower post-PCI caFFR was associated with a higher rate of 9-month TVF. After LAD PCI, both post-PCI caFFR and its gradient across stent were independent predictors of the neointimal proliferation of the target vessel evaluated by LLL and %DS at follow-up.
