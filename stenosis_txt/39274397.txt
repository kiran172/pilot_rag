Title: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance for Structural Aortic Valve Stenosis Procedures.

Abstract: The number of structural aortic valve procedures has increased significantly in recent years. Pre-procedural planning and follow-up with noninvasive testing are essential. Although cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing left ventricular mass, volume, and function, it is not performed routinely in patients undergoing structural interventions. CMR can provide useful information for pre- and post-procedural assessment, including quantification of cardiac function, myocardial assessment, grading of the severity of valvular heart disease, and evaluation of extracardiac anatomy while avoiding the limitations of other non-invasive modalities. Here, we review the use cases, future perspectives, and limitations of CMR for patients undergoing structural aortic valve procedures.
