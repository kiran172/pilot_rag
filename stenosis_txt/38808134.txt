Title: Different profiles of acute graft pyelonephritis among kidney recipients from standard or elderly donors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute graft pyelonephritis (AGPN) is a relatively common complication in kidney transplants (KTs); however, the effects on allograft function, diagnostic criteria, and risk factors are not well established.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all consecutive adult KTs was performed between 01 January 2011 and 31 December 2018 (follow-up ended on 31 December 2019) to examine the association between the diagnosis of AGPN (confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) during the first post-transplantation year and graft outcomes.
RESULTS: Among the 939 consecutive KTs (≈50% with donors ≥60 years), we identified 130 MRI-confirmed AGPN episodes, with a documented association with recurrent and multidrug-resistant bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) (p &lt; 0.005). Ureteral stenosis was the only risk factor associated with AGPN (OR 2.9 [95% CI, 1.6 to 5.2]). KTs with AGPN had a decreased allograft function at the first year (ΔeGFR 6 mL/min/1.73 m2 [-2-15] in non-AGPN vs. -0.2 [-6.5-8.5] in AGPN, p &lt; 0.001), with similar and negative profiles in KTs from standard or elderly donors. However, only KTs with AGPN and a donor &lt;60 years showed reduced death-censored graft survival (p = 0.015); most of this subgroup received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction (40.4% vs. 17.7%), and their MRI presented either a multifocal AGPN pattern (73.9% vs. 56.7%) or abscedation (28.3% vs. 11.7%). No difference was noted in death-censored graft survival between early (&lt;3 months post-KT) or late (3-12 months) AGPN, solitary/recurrent forms, or types of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Linear regression confirmed the independent role of multifocal pattern, abscedation, ATG induction, and donor age on the eGFR at the first year.
CONCLUSION: AGPN, influenced by multifocal presentation, ATG induction, donor age, and abscedation, affects kidney function and significantly impacts allograft survival in KTs with donors <60 years.
