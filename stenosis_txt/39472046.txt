Title: Evolving use and clinical outcomes of coronary intravascular lithotripsy: insights from an international, multicentre registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is increasingly used for treatment of coronary artery calcification. This study aimed to evaluate contemporary utilisation patterns, safety and efficacy of IVL in an unselected real-world patient cohort.
METHODS: We included 454 patients undergoing IVL from May 2019 to February 2024 across seven centres in two European countries. Key endpoints included device success, technical success, procedural success, IVL-related complications and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The cohort (mean age 73±9 years, 75% male) had a mean SYNTAX Score of 22.0±13.6. Device, technical and procedural success were achieved in 98%, 91% and 89% of patients, respectively. IVL-related complications occurred in six patients (1%). At 1-year follow-up, MACE was observed in 37 patients (13%). Over time, IVL use increased in patients with acute coronary syndrome (p=0.004) and in combination with intracoronary imaging (p=0.002), while use of other calcium modification devices decreased (p=0.034).
CONCLUSION: In this real-world registry, IVL demonstrated efficacy across diverse clinical and anatomical settings. High success rates, low complication rates and MACE rates were observed acutely and at 1-year follow-up. Utilisation patterns evolved over time, with increased adoption in acute scenarios and alongside intracoronary imaging.
