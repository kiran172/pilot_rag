Title: Predicting and improving outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in older adults and the elderly.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are progressively extending to younger and lower risk patients. In this scenario, minimizing periprocedural complications and optimizing procedural result are both crucial to achieve an excellent long-term outcome.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we summarize the main strategies that can be adopted before, during, and after TAVR to predict and prevent complications, to optimize procedural results and ultimately improve outcomes, with an emphasis on more recent evidence, new devices, and new techniques.
EXPERT OPINION: In the next future TAVR will probably represent the first treatment option for patients affected by aortic valve stenosis who are candidates to receive a biological valve. Continuous refinement of TAVR devices has been key to allow safer and most effective procedures and further progress is expected. Development of new techniques and devices, such as ultrasound-guided puncture and intravascular lithotripsy, will expand safety and eligibility to transfemoral procedures. Effective preemptive measures for coronary occlusion have been developed. Open issues include cerebral protection, re-access to coronary arteries, post-procedural management, and therapy.
