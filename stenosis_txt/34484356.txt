Title: Clinical outcomes of distal vaginal and vulvar cancer treated with image-guided brachytherapy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate treatment outcomes with image-guided brachytherapy (IGBT) for distal vaginal and vulvar cancers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Women treated for distal vaginal or vulvar malignancies utilizing IGBT were retrospectively reviewed, and acute and late toxicities were retrospectively graded. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included, out of which, twelve patients (66.7%) were with primary disease of the distal vagina and vulva, most commonly squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (n = 8, 66.7%), and six with recurrent disease, most commonly recurrent endometrial carcinoma (n = 5, 83.3%). All patients received external beam radiation (EBRT) to a median dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions, followed by IGBT (range of 15 to 27.5 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions). Mean follow-up was 20.6 months. Mean dose to high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) D<sub>90</sub> was 72.4 Gy. Mean D<sub>2cc</sub> for the rectum, bladder, and urethra were 50 Gy, 50.6 Gy, and 62.9 Gy, respectively. Five patients (27.8%) recurred. Three patients (16.7%) had local recurrence, 1 patient (5.6%) had distant recurrence only, and 1 patient (5.6%) had simultaneous regional and distant recurrence. Grade 3 acute toxicities included 1 (5.6%) vaginal stenosis, 6 (33.3%) dermatitis/mucositis, 2 (11.1%) vaginal pain, and 1 (5.6%) vaginal/vulvar infection. Grade 3 late toxicities comprised 3 (17.7%) cases of vaginal pain and 1 (5.9%) skin/vaginal necrosis. There were no grade 4 or higher toxicities.
CONCLUSIONS: Definitive radiation therapy in the form of EBRT and IGBT provides meaningful loco-regional control in women with distal vaginal and vulvar cancers, with mainly skin and vaginal toxicity.
