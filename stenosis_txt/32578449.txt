Title: Composite Cartilage-osseous-mucosal Nasoseptal Flap for Reconstruction after Near Total Rhinectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of full thickness nasal defects usually requires different donor sites for the external skin envelope, structural elements, and internal nasal lining. In this paper we present a novel single site method for dual inner lining and skeleton repair for full thickness nasal defects with a composite nasoseptal flap and extended pedicle dissection.
METHODS: A 72-year-old male presented with a T4b melanoma involving the nasal dorsum and left upper lateral cartilage. Following full thickness resection, reconstruction was performed with a nasoseptal flap (NSF) with attached septal cartilage and vomer in conjunction with a paramedian forehead flap. Extended pedicle dissection into the pterygopalatine fossa allowed the NSF to fully cover the defect.
RESULTS: The nasal defect was fully corrected. There was no evidence of flap compromise or nasal valve stenosis at 1 month, 2 month, and 1 year follow-up visits.
CONCLUSIONS: We present here the first successful application of a composite cartilage-osseous-mucosal NSF for multilayered nasal reconstruction. In appropriate patients, this technique may obviate the need for flaps or grafts from extranasal sources, limiting donor site morbidity.
