Title: A Review of the Partner Trials.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) of moderate or greater severity has an estimated prevalence of 5% in people older than 65 years. Survival is poor after onset of symptoms, and surgical aortic valve replacement was the gold-standard treatment for decades. However, more than one-third of patients with symptomatic AS were untreated due to high surgical risk, exposing a clinical need for a less invasive therapy for aortic valve stenosis. The PARTNER trials were pivotal in presenting robust evidence for the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of AS and paved the way for clinical use worldwide.
