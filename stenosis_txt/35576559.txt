Title: Role of endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic resection in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal granular cell tumors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Diagnosis and complete resection of esophageal granular cell tumors (GCTs) is an area of concern. However, articles on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic resection of esophageal granular cell tumors are few. To evaluate the role of endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic resection in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal granular cell tumors.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 15 patients with esophageal granular cell tumors who underwent endoscopic ultrasound examination and endoscopic resection in our hospital was conducted. The clinical data, endoscopic ultrasound images, endoscopic treatment, pathological characteristics, postoperative complications and follow-up status of all patients were evaluated. Ten board-certified endoscopists independently evaluated the white light endoscopic images of the 15 patients (Test 1) and the endoscopic ultrasound images together with white light endoscopic images of the same patient set (Test 2).
RESULT: Female patients accounted for 53.4% of the participants. The average age at the time of diagnosis was 49.13 ± 9.31 years old. Ten lesions (66.67%) showed hypoechoic signal, four lesions (26.67%) showed hyperechoic signal and one lesion showed medium signal. The diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher with Test 2(65.3% vs. 92.0%, p &lt; .001). Complete endoscopic resection was performed in all the patients. No complications occurred in any of the patients. No esophageal stenosis, recurrence, or metastases was found in all patients during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: The endoscopic ultrasound images of esophageal granular cell tumors have certain characteristics that help diagnose esophageal granular cell tumors. Endoscopic resection of esophageal granular cell tumors is an effective, safe and feasible treatment method.
