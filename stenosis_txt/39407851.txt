Title: Optical Coherence Tomography in Myocardial Infarction Management: Enhancing Precision in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: In acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the urgency of coronary revascularization through percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is paramount, offering notable advantages over pharmacologic treatment. However, the persistent risk of adverse events, including recurrent AMI and heart failure post-revascularization, underscores the necessity for enhanced strategies in managing coronary artery disease. Traditional angiography, while widely employed, presents significant limitations by providing only two-dimensional representations of complex three-dimensional vascular structures, hampering the accurate assessment of plaque characteristics and stenosis severity. Intravascular imaging, specifically optical coherence tomography (OCT), significantly addresses these limitations with superior spatial resolution compared to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Within the context of AMI, OCT serves dual purposes: as a diagnostic tool to accurately identify culprit lesions in ambiguous cases and as a guide for optimizing PCI procedures. Its capacity to differentiate between various mechanisms of acute coronary syndrome, such as plaque rupture and spontaneous coronary dissection, enhances its diagnostic potential. Furthermore, OCT facilitates precise lesion preparation, optimal stent sizing, and confirms stent deployment efficacy. Recent meta-analyses indicate that OCT-guided PCI markedly improves safety and efficacy in revascularization, subsequently decreasing the risks of mortality and complications. This review emphasizes the critical role of OCT in refining patient-specific therapeutic approaches, aligning with the principles of precision medicine to enhance clinical outcomes for individuals experiencing AMI.
