Title: Prognostic value of echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac mechanics in patients with aortic stenosis and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection function (LVEF) is not reliable in identifying subtle systolic dysfunction. Speckle Tracking (ST) plays a promising role and hemodynamic forces (HDFs) are emerging as marker of LV function. The role of LV myocardial deformation and HDFs was investigated in a cohort of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and normal LVEF. Two hundred fifty three patients (median age 79 years, IQR 73 - 83 years) with mild (n = 87), moderate (n =77) and severe AS (n =89) were retrospectively enrolled. 2D echocardiographic global longitudinal strain (GLS), circumferential strain (GCS) and HDFs were determined. The worsening of AS was associated with raising inappropriate LV mass (p < 0.001) and declined LVEF, despite being in the normal range (p < 0.001). ST and HDFs parameters declined as the AS became severe (p<0.0001, for all). When patients were grouped based on the median of LV endocardial GLS value (> -19,9%) and LV systolic longitudinal force (LVsysLF) value (< 12,49), patients with impaired ST and lower HDFs components had increased incidence of aortic valve replacement (AVR) and worse survival (p <0.024 and p <0.037, respectively). Among ST and HDFs parameters, only LVsysLF was independently associated with AVR and all causes mortality on multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-0.99; p= 0.012). Reduced values of LVsysLF were associated with AVR and reduced survival in AS patients. LVsysLF could provide useful information in the stratification of patients with AS and possibly in the choice of timing for AVR.
