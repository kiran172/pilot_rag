Title: Exhaustion of coronary vasodilatory reserve in the resting state: Clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes after intervention.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: Resting coronary blood flow approximates flow with maximal vasodilation in very severe coronary stenosis. We studied the incidence of exhausted vasodilatory reserve by FFR, its clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis after FFR guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing FFR-guided PCI for coronary stenosis with reduced resting blood flow (baseline Pd/Pa < 0.8) were included. Basal maximal vasodilation (BMV) was defined as less than 5% difference between resting Pd/Pa and FFR, that is, FFR-baseline Pd/Pa < 0.05.
RESULTS: Of 658 vessels that underwent FFR-guided PCI in 602 patients, 151 vessels had resting blood flow in the ischemic range (baseline Pd/Pa ≤ 0.8) and were included in the analysis. Of these, 28 lesions in 28 patients met criteria for BMV (4.25% of the entire registry and 18.5% of those with the reduced basal coronary flow). Stenosis severity was a significant predictor of the presence of BMV. In long term follow-up (median 106 ± 3.6 months), BMV was not associated with increased target vessel revascularization (TVR) or major adverse cardiac event compared to non-BMV(OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.7-4.8, p-value 0.2 and OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.75-2.5, p = 0.3, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Low baseline Pd/Pa that approximates fractional flow reserve (exhausted vasodilatory reserve) defines a subgroup of patients with severe coronary artery stenosis. Prognosis, when treated with PCI along with medical therapy, appears similar to those with intact vasodilatory reserve.
