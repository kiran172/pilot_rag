Title: Delayed stenosis regression after drug-coated balloon angioplasty for femoropopliteal artery lesions.

Abstract: Paclitaxel has the potential for inducing lumen enlargement by vessel enlargement, healing of dissection, and plaque regression. This study was carried out to determine the possibility of and the relevant factors of delayed stenosis regression after drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for femoropopliteal (FP) artery lesions. A total 105 de novo FP lesions were finalized with DCB angioplasty in our institute between May 2018 and June 2020. Among them, cases in which residual stenosis was detected by duplex ultrasonography (DUS) after the procedure were included in this study. Significant stenosis was defined as peak systolic velocity ratio ≥ 2.4 by DUS. Follow-up DUS was routinely performed 6 months after the procedure, and we defined cases without stenosis as cases of delayed stenosis regression according to the follow-up DUS. DUS showed that 26 (25.5%) of 102 lesions had residual stenosis after DCB angioplasty, and delayed stenosis regression was observed in 12 (57.1%) of 21 lesions 6 months after the procedure. The percentage of lesions containing calcified plaque as detected by intravascular ultrasound analysis was significantly higher in the non-regression group than in the regression group (18.2% vs. 77.8%, p = 0.02). Vessel remodeling and dissection patterns were not associated with delayed stenosis regression. The results of our analyses indicate that delayed stenosis regression may occur after DCB angioplasty for FP lesions in more than half of cases with residual stenosis. Delayed stenosis regression may be difficult in cases of calcified lesions.
