Title: Complete resolution of acute pancreatitis-induced chylous ascites following transhepatic portal vein stenting.

Abstract: We introduce a case of a 73-year-old man who developed intractable chylous ascites due to portal vein compression as a result of peripancreatic inflammatory changes after acute biliary pancreatitis. After stenting the portal vein stenosis, the chylous ascites improved from requiring weekly paracentesis to requiring no drainage within 4â€‰months of the procedure and at the 15-month follow-up. To our knowledge, it is the first case reported in the literature where portal vein stenting has successfully been used to treat pancreatitis-induced chylous ascites.
