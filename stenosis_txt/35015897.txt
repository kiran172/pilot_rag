Title: Latest Advances in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (2022).

Abstract: Since the last decade, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the treatment of choice in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are ineligible or at higher risk for surgery. Due to the high safety profile of current device generation, TAVI has emerged as a qualified alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with classic aortic stenosis and intermediate surgical risk, severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, and isolated pure aortic regurgitation. Moderate aortic stenosis, with and without concomitant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, are under investigation in randomized controlled clinical trials from which we will gain exciting insights on the best timing of TAVI to protect the left ventricle from further functional deterioration due to increasing AS. In these cases, a meticulous diagnostic approach including advanced imaging is becoming more and more important. Current evidence on antithrombotic strategies after TAVI is weak, contributing to poor levels of standardization and high variability in daily clinical practice. This review will provide a short overview of recent clinical trials including best timing for TAVI with moderate AS and antithrombotic strategies after TAVI with current and future TAVI generations.
