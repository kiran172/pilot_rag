Title: Cardiocerebral Infarction Presenting in a Neurosurgical Emergency: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Cardiocerebral infarction (CCI), the simultaneous occurrence of acute ischemic stroke and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is a rare but critical condition. However, the optimal treatment strategy, particularly regarding the use of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), remains unclear. This case report describes a patient with CCI diagnosed during a neurosurgical emergency. A 67-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented with sudden right hemiparesis and sensory aphasia 30 minutes prior to hospital arrival. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute cerebral infarction in the left middle cerebral artery territoryÂ but without large-vessel occlusion. Routine electrocardiography (ECG) showed ST-T elevation in leads V1, V2, II, III, and aVF (augmented vector foot). Subsequent blood tests confirmed positive troponin T and elevated creatine kinase levels. Despite the absence of reported AMI symptoms, the patient received a diagnosis of CCI. Due to the uncertain time of AMI onset and to expedite transfer to the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) unit, t-PA administration was withheld. Upon transfer, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (200 mg) and clopidogrel (300 mg) was initiated. Emergency coronary angioplasty successfully treated a 99% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (#7). The patient's post-procedure course was uneventful. After 18 days, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital with a modified Rankin Scale score of 3. This case highlights the importance of routine 12-lead ECG in neurosurgical emergencies, regardless of presenting symptoms like chest pain. While guidelines support the use of t-PA in CCI, its administration requires careful consideration due to specific risks, including cardiac rupture and limitations on antithrombotic therapy within the first 24 hours.
