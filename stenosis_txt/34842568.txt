Title: Study on the Correlation Between Ischemic Leukoaraiosis and Cerebral Large Artery Stenosis Using the Stages of the Preinfarction Period Based on the Result of Computed Tomography Perfusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The influence of cerebral large artery stenosis (CLAS) on ischemic leukoaraiosis (LA) remains elusive. Based on the proposed stages of the preinfarction period, this study aimed to adopt the staging system to assess the correlation between ischemic LA and CLAS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with unilateral CLAS ≥50% and without cerebral stroke were screened. The severity and distribution of stenosis were evaluated on computed tomography angiography images. The degree of regional cerebral perfusion was rated according to the stages of preinfarction period: 0=normal, 1=stage Ia, 2=stage Ib, 3=stage IIa, 4=stage IIb. Stage I included stage Ia and stage Ib. Stage II included stage IIa and stage IIb. LA was scored with Fazakas scale on T2-weighted image and/or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 212 patients (mean age, 66.89±11.39 y), including 145 (68.40%) males. CLAS severity and distribution did not differ between patients with and without LA (P>0.05). Normal, stage I, and stage II had significantly different incidences of LA and hemispheric LA scores in the left and right hemispheres (P<0.05). The degree of regional cerebral perfusion was independently associated with LA in the left (P=0.0094) and right hemispheres (P=0.0091).
CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic LA is not directly related to CLAS but is independently associated with the degree of CLAS-induced cerebral hypoperfusion. The stages of the preinfarction period are helpful in identifying people at high risk of LA progression.
