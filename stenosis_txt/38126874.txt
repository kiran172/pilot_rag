Title: A Case Report of a Pericapsular Nerve Group Block for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: A pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block is an interfascial plane block that targets the articular branches of the femoral and obturator nerves. PENG blocks may be used for hip, vein, and groin surgeries. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a common treatment for aortic valve stenosis (AVS). Patients who undergo TAVI tend to be at high risk due to their older age and comorbidities. A PENG block using a high volume of local anesthetics may be as effective as a lumbar plexus block. In this case report, we describe successful anesthesia management using PENG blocks in 2 patients who underwent TAVI.
