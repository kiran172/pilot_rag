Title: [Pulmonary artery stenosis after single lung transplantation: a case report and literature review].

Abstract: Objective: To summarize and analyze the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of pulmonary artery stenosis post-lung transplantation. Methods: A 62-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with a cough and chest tightness of over a year's duration, which had worsened in the last two months, leading to the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The clinical data were observed and reviewed post-left allograft single lung transplantation. Literature searches were conducted using the keywords "lung transplantation" "stenosis, pulmonary artery" and "postoperative complications" in CNKI, Wanfang Medical Network, and PubMed databases up to December 2022. Results: On January 26, 2022, a left allograft single lung transplantation was performed under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation were successfully weaned off at 22 hours and 2 days, respectively, with transfer from the intensive care unit 12 days after surgery. PaO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> were 50 mmHg and 40 mmHg after deoxygenation. Both pulmonary CT angiography and ventilatory-perfusion imaging indicated stenosis of the left pulmonary anastomosis. Balloon dilation and pulmonary artery stenting were performed, with PaO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> improving to 87 mmHg and 42 mmHg, respectively. The patient was discharged 102 days post-surgery, and was followed up for 1 year, with a good prognosis. Additionally, 36 related articles were retrieved, encompassing 69 cases with a median age of 53 years (38.5-59.0 years). Of these, 27.54% (19/69) were diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 46.38% (32/69) underwent single lung transplantation, with the primary clinical symptom being hypoxemia in 71.01% (49/69) cases. Left pulmonary artery anastomotic stenosis was observed in 43.48% (30/69), with 65.22% (45/69) being diagnosed in the late postoperative period. Interventional therapy was performed to 44.93% (31/69), with a mortality rate of 21.74% (15/69). Conclusions: The primary clinical manifestation of post-lung transplantation pulmonary artery stenosis is hypoxemia and can be diagnosed by pulmonary artery CT angiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and pulmonary angiography. Early diagnosis can significantly reduce mortality, and interventional therapy is an effective treatment for severe pulmonary artery stenosis post-lung transplantation.
