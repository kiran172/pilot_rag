Title: Intussusception in the ascending colon caused by cecal chronic diverticulitis: a case report.

Abstract: Although intussusception in adults generally results from malignant tumors and polyps, intussusception caused by chronic diverticulitis is extremely rare. We present the case of a 59-year-old man treated with steroids and biopharmaceuticals at the Department of Dermatology for psoriasis vulgaris. Cecal diverticulitis frequently recurred, for which he was treated during follow-up. This time, endoscopy showed a circumferential stenosis in the ascending colon, and computed tomography showed the appearance of a target sign in the right colon. As a result, the patient was preoperatively diagnosed as having intussusception of the ascending colon triggered by diverticulitis of the cecum and underwent laparoscopic right colectomy. Pathological findings of the specimen revealed multiple diverticulitis of the cecum. Therefore, we thought that the intussusception was caused by chronic inflammation of the diverticula and surrounding fibrosis. Among intussusception in adults, chronic diverticulitis should be considered as a target of surgical treatment on rare occasions.
