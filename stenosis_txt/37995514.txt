Title: Imaging characteristics and prognostic factors of Behcet's disease with arterial involvement: A long-term follow-up study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the imaging characteristics and prognostic factors for the long-term survival of Behcet's disease (BD) with arterial involvement.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, BD patients with arterial involvement were identified from January 2003 to January 2020. Arterial lesions were detected by ultrasonography, traditional arteriography, and/or computed tomography angiography (CTA). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify the prognostic factors.
RESULTS: Totally, 84 BD patients with arterial involvement were identified (73.8 % males). The mean age at BD diagnosis was 39.1 ± 13.1 years. Arterial involvement was the initial manifestation in 33.3 % of the patients, and the median time from BD diagnosis to arterial involvement was 6 (IQR 1-15.5) years for the rest of patients. Systemic artery involvement and pulmonary artery involvement (PAI) were found in 64 and 27 patients, respectively. Approximately 94.0 % (79/84) of the patients had more than one artery involved concurrently or successively during the course of BD. Aneurysm/dilation was the most prevalent lesion in the aorta (76.0 %), while stenosis/occlusion was the main lesion of the coronary artery (90.9 %) and other aortic branches (74.5 %). Pulmonary hypertension was found in 70.4 % (19/27) of patients with PAI. The 5- and 10-year survival rates of BD patients with arterial involvement were 87.4 % and 84.1 %, respectively. Cardiac involvement (HR: 4.34) and pulmonary artery aneurysm/dilation (HR: 4.89) were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Arterial lesions associated with BD usually involve multiple arteries and manifest differently in different types of arteries. Cardiac involvement and pulmonary artery aneurysm/dilation are independent prognostic factors of BD patients with arterial involvement.
