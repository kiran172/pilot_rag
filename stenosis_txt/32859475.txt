Title: Combined Coronary CT Angiography and Evaluation of Access Vessels for TAVR Patients in Free-Breathing with Single Contrast Medium Injection Using a 16-cm-Wide Detector CT.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of combining coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography (CCTA) and CTA to evaluate access vessels for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients in free-breathing and with single contrast medium injection using a 16-cm-wide detector CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one consecutive patients (73.33 ± 6.43 years) referred for TAVR underwent a serious CT scans in free-breathing after one contrast injection: ECG-triggered one-heartbeat axial CCTA, followed by non-ECG-gated neck, thoracic, and abdominal CTA. Patient weight-dependent contrast dose volume at 1.0 mL/kg was used. CT attenuation values of the coronary, neck, aortic, iliac, and femoral arteries were measured and their image quality was evaluated with a 4-point score method. Stenosis (≥50%) in CCTA was evaluated using invasive coronary angiography result as a reference standard. Radiation and contrast doses were assessed.
RESULTS: The total dose-length-product for the entire examination was 411.4 ± 91.2 mGy.cm, and the total contrast dose was 57.3 ± 9.9 mL. There were adequate attenuations (>400 HU) in all arteries, and the peripheral access vessels and aortic annulus were evaluable in all patients. In neck CTA, 5 patients had vascular tortuosity, 6 patients had aberrant arteries and there were 212 plaques and 13 severe stenoses among the patients. In CCTA, on the per-segment, per-vessel, and per-patient analysis, CCTA showed a sensitivity and negative predictive value of (95% and 99%), (95% and 99%), and (96% and 98%), respectively, for the entire patient cohort, and (92% and 98%), (92% and 98%), and (88% and 93%), respectively, for patients with atrial fibrillation or heart rate higher than 75 beats.
CONCLUSION: It is feasible to perform a combined CCTA and CTA for evaluating access vessels for TAVR patients in free-breathing with single contrast injection. This approach generates acceptable image quality for all vessels and a high negative predictive value in excluding coronary artery disease with relatively low radiation and contrast doses.
