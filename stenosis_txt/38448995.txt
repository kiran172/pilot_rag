Title: Conjoined lumbosacral nerve root: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In patients with conjoined nerve roots, hemilaminectomy with sufficient exposure of the intervertebral foramen or lateral recess is required to prevent destabilization and ensure correct mobility of the lumbosacral spine. To the best of our knowledge, no case reports have detailed the long-term course of conjoined nerve roots after surgery.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 51-year-old Japanese man with a conjoined nerve root. The main symptoms were acute low back pain, radiating pain, and right leg muscle weakness. Partial laminectomy was performed with adequate exposure to the conjoined nerve root. The symptoms completely resolved immediately after surgery. However, the same symptoms recurred 7 years postoperatively. The nerve root was compressed because of foraminal stenosis resulting from L5-S disc degeneration. L5-S transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion was performed on the contralateral side because of an immobile conjoined nerve root. At 44 months after the second surgery, the patient had no low back pain or radiating pain, and the muscle weakness in the right leg had improved.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the long-term course of conjoined nerve root after partial laminectomy. When foraminal stenosis occurs after partial laminectomy, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion from the contralateral side may be required because of an immobile conjoined nerve root.
