Title: The effectiveness of vitamin D3 supplementation in improving functional outcome of non-surgically treated symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis: Randomized controlled clinical trial - Pilot study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although vitamin D is one of the essential nutrients associated with musculoskeletal system function, there is no standard treatment method for vitamin D deficiency. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the improvement in symptoms, functional recovery of the spine, and changes in the quality of life in patients with spinal stenosis.
METHODS: In this prospective study, patients with spinal stenosis and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels < 10 ng/mL were randomly assigned to a supplementation group (Group S) and a non-supplementation group (Group NS): 26 participants in Group S (16 females and 10 males) and 25 in Group NS (15 females and 10 males). The degree of lower back pain in both groups was assessed using the visual analog scale; spine function was assessed using the Oswestry disability index and Roland-Morris disability questionnaire; and patient quality of life was assessed using the 36-item short form health survey. We compared and analyzed the values that were measured at baseline, between 4 and 6 weeks (V1), 10 and 12 weeks (V2), and 22 and 26 weeks (V3).
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was observed in lower back pain, spine function, or quality of life between both groups at baseline. In terms of lower back pain in V1, Group S scored 4.15 ± 3.12, while Group NS scored 5.64 ± 1.85 (P = .045). In V2, Group S scored 3.15 ± 2.38, while Group NS scored 4.52 ± 1.87 (P = .027). Moreover, in V3, Group S scored 3.58 ± 1.65, while Group NS scored 4.60 ± 1.68 (P = .033), indicating a statistically significant improvement in each period.
CONCLUSION: If a vitamin D deficiency that does not require surgical treatment exists in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, high-dose vitamin D injections can improve lower back pain, which is the main symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis, as well as the functional outcomes of the spine and quality of life.
