Title: Small vessel disease burden and prognosis of recent subcortical ischaemic stroke differ by parent artery atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Parent artery atherosclerosis is an important aetiology of recent subcortical ischaemic stroke (RSIS). However, comparisons of RSIS with different degrees of parent artery atherosclerosis are lacking.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data from our multicentre cohort (all were tertiary centres) of the Stroke Imaging Package Study between 2015 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients with RSIS defined as a single clinically relevant diffusion-weighted imaging positive lesion in the territory of lenticulostriate arteries were categorized into three subgroups: (1) normal middle cerebral artery (MCA) on magnetic resonance angiography and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI); (2) low-grade MCA atherosclerosis (normal or <50% stenosis on magnetic resonance angiography and with MCA plaques on HR-MRI); (3) steno-occlusive MCA atherosclerosis (stenosis â‰¥50% or occlusion). The primary outcome was 90-day functional dependence (modified Rankin Scale score >2). The clinical and imaging findings were compared between subgroups.
RESULTS: A total of 239 patients (median age 60.0 [52.0-67.0] years, 72% male) were enrolled, including 140 with normal MCA, 64 with low-grade MCA atherosclerosis and 35 with steno-occlusive MCA atherosclerosis. Patients with steno-occlusive MCA atherosclerosis had the largest infarct volume. Low-grade MCA atherosclerosis was independently associated with cerebral microbleeding, more severe perivascular spaces in basal ganglia and higher total cerebral small vessel disease burden. Low-grade MCA atherosclerosis was an independent determinant of 90-day functional dependence (odds ratio 3.897; 95% confidence interval 1.309-11.604).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested RSIS with varying severity of parent artery atherosclerosis exhibits distinctive clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, with low-grade MCA atherosclerosis associating with higher cerebral small vessel disease burden and worse prognosis.
