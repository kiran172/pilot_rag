Title: Smith Magenis syndrome: First case of congenital heart defect in a patient with Rai1 mutation.

Abstract: Smith Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a rare neurobehavioral disorder caused by 17p11.2 microdeletion encompassing Retinoic Acid-Induced 1 (RAI1) gene (90% of cases) or by RAI1 point mutation (10% of cases). The neuropsychological phenotype of individuals with 17p11.2 deletion and in those with RAI1 variants mostly overlaps. However, cardiac defects have been described only in patients with a deletion so far. Here, we present the first case of a patient affected by SMS caused by RAI1 variant in whom a severe congenital pulmonary valve stenosis was diagnosed at birth, requiring trans catheter dilatation in the first month of life. This case expands the phenotypic spectrum associated with RAI1 variants in SMS, describing a previously unreported association with a congenital heart disease.
