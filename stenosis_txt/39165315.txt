Title: A rare case of intusscusception in a 6-month-old baby.

Abstract: This case report discusses the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and successful management of a rare case of intussusception in a 6-month-old female infant referred to a regional hospital in Ghana. The patient presented with vomiting, lethargy, fever, and currant jelly stool. Differential diagnoses considered included Merkel diverticulum, volvulus, lymphadenopathy, and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Ultrasound imaging revealed a concentric lesion with characteristic signs of intussusception. Ileo-caeco coli intussusception was confirmed as the diagnosis. Surgical management was used for this patient. The postsurgery phase was without any complications. The patient recovered well and was discharged with a switch to oral medications. Infant intussusception is still a disease with a low morbidity rate.
