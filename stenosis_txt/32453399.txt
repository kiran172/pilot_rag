Title: Association between serum phosphorus and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic Korean individuals without kidney dysfunction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding the relation between serum phosphorus concentration (SPC) and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in the asymptomatic healthy population without kidney dysfunction.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the relation between SPC and characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques and cardiac events according to SPCs using a large cohort of asymptomatic Korean individuals.
METHODS: We evaluated 6329 asymptomatic Korean individuals [mean age: 53.6 ± 7.6 y, 4611 men (72.9%)] without kidney dysfunction and coronary artery disease who voluntarily underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as part of a general health examination. Study participants were stratified into quartiles according to their SPCs (≤3.0, 3.1-3.3, 3.4-3.7, ≥3.8 mg/dL). The degree and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis were evaluated with CCTA. Stenosis of diameter ≥50% was defined as significant. A cardiac event was defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and coronary revascularization.
RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, the risk of any atherosclerotic plaque was significantly higher with increasing SPC quartiles (P = 0.001). In particular, the risk of calcified plaque increased in the second (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51; P = 0.006), third (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.64; P < 0.001), and fourth SPC quartiles (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.24, 1.82; P < 0.001) compared with that in the first quartile. However, there were no significant differences in the adjusted ORs for noncalcified plaque, mixed plaque, or significant stenosis. During a follow-up of median 5.4 y, there was no significant difference in cardiac events between the SPC quartiles.
CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic Korean individuals without kidney dysfunction, a high SPC was an independent predictor of calcified plaques without any difference in cardiac events. Further long-term prospective studies are required to validate these results.
