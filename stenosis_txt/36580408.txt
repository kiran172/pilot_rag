Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy in Peripheral Artery Disease.

Abstract: Peripheral artery disease affects millions of people worldwide, and it is associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality. In addition, it represents a significant challenge for the interventional operators to appropriately and successfully revascularize heavily calcified stenoses. There are several established atherectomy devices with the risk of procedural complications including dissection and perforation, among others. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel tool with relatively less procedural risk compared to the existing modalities. It is a device that emits high-energy ultrasound waves mounted on a balloon catheter that causes fractures on the calcium plaques allowing balloon expansion and luminal gain. Five trials have been published showing the safety and effectiveness of IVL, including one trial evaluating the device in common femoral artery and infrapopliteal arteries. The available data from the limited number of trials are very encouraging and demonstrates minimal risk. Additional studies on a larger scale are needed further to understand the its long-term effects and possible risks.
