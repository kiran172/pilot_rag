Title: A prospective study of radical external beam radiotherapy versus external beam radiotherapy combined with intraluminal brachytherapy for primary esophageal cancer.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study compared the efficacy and side effects of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) + intraluminal brachytherapy (IBT) with EBRT alone in patients with primary thoracic esophageal cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2013 and 2020, 64 patients with primary thoracic esophageal cancer without surgery received radiotherapy. Thirty-two patients received EBRT + IBT. EBRT dose was 50 Gy, 2 Gy/f, 5 times a week, and IBT dose was 10 Gy, 5 Gy/f, once a week. Thirty-two patients received EBRT alone, and the total dose was 60 Gy. The median followup was 19 months.
RESULTS: The local control rates (LCR) of EBRT + IBT and EBRT alone group at 1, 2, and 3 years after treatment were 88% and 72%, 53% and 22%, 25%, and 9%, respectively. The overall survival (OS) of the EBRT + IBT and EBRT alone group at 3 years after treatment were 38% and 9%. The 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) rates of EBRT + IBT and EBRT alone group were 25% and 9%. Univariate analysis showed that EBRT + IBT could be the prognostic factor improving OS (p = 0.04), and tumor located in the mid-thoracic region exhibited a poorer prognosis on LRFS (p = 0.03). Grade 3 or higher acute side effects included two cases of dysphagia and three cases of bone marrow suppression. Severe late side effects included three cases of fistula, three cases of radiation pneumonia, and five cases of stenosis requiring treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with EBRT alone, EBRT + IBT is an effective treatment modality for T1∼3NanyM0 primary thoracic esophageal cancer with good local control. It can prolong the survival time of patients and has acceptable toxicity.
