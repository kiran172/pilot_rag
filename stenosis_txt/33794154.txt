Title: Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in the Setting of Anomalous Circumflex Coronary Artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The anomalous circumflex coronary artery (ACCA) from the right coronary artery or sinus of Valsalva lies in proximity to the aortic valve annulus. This study sought to determine the prevalence of injury to the ACCA during surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).
METHODS: We queried the databases of the Departments of Cardiovascular Surgery and Cardiovascular Diseases of Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota for all patients who underwent SAVR in the setting of an ACCA. The study investigators identified 31 patients operated on from September 2002 through December 2018. The end point was myocardial ischemia in the distribution of the ACCA.
RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 69 ± 11 years, sex was female in 8 patients (26%), and ejection fraction was 62% (interquartile range, 59% to 68%). No patient underwent exploration of the ACCA, but 5 (16%) had a coronary artery bypass graft to the ACCA. No patient demonstrated myocardial infarction or underwent perioperative intervention on the ACCA; however, discharge echocardiography showed new lateral wall motion abnormality in 5 (16%) patients that was associated with a reduction in ejection fraction of -11% from baseline (P = .007). Coronary artery bypass graft to the ACCA was not protective of new lateral wall motion abnormality (P = .968). Mortality was 34% ± 10% at 10 years and was not associated with new lateral wall motion abnormality (log-rank test P = .183).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically apparent myocardial infarction was not identified after SAVR, but echocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia in the distribution of the ACCA was identified in 16% of patients. Protective adjuvant intervention on the ACCA may be indicated. Further study is warranted.
