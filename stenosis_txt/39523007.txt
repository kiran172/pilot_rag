Title: Perioperative Management of Takayasu Arteritis for Cardiac Surgery　- Review and Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is classified as a large vessel vasculitis and often causes vascular stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysm formation. Although the principal treatment for TAK involves suppressing inflammation with glucocorticoids, the emergence of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs has considerably changed the treatment landscape of TAK in recent years. Several biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as tocilizumab (TCZ), have shown promising effects on TAK in clinical studies. Cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons encounter patients receiving these drugs who require catheterization, endovascular treatment, or cardiovascular surgery. However, in patients treated with glucocorticoids and TCZ, there needs to be greater awareness of more complications than usual after surgery, such as delayed wound healing, systemic infection, and surgical site infection. In addition, in patients receiving TCZ, inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, may not increase when complications arise from infection. Unfortunately, there are no guidelines or solid evidence that have clearly defined the optimal perioperative treatment strategy for patients with TAK who require cardiovascular surgery. This article reviews the evidence and our recent experience supporting the perioperative use of TCZ, and proposes a protocol that can reduce complications in patients with TAK undergoing invasive cardiovascular treatment.
