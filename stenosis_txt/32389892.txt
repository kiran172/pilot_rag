Title: Predicting conservative treatment failure in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Single center, case-control study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of conservative treatment failure in patients presenting due to lumbar disc herniation-associated low back pain and sciatica.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single institution, case-control study including 240 patients that were selected for microsurgical or conservative treatment due to lumbar disc herniation in a 2,5-year period. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed in order to identify independent predictors among demographic, clinical and radiographic factors.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between conservatively and surgically managed groups in bivariate analysis. Logistic regression models further revealed that leg paresthesia (p =  0,003; OR = 5,136) and percentage of spinal canal stenosis ratio (p < 0,001; OR = 1,055) had the strongest, independent correlation with conservative treatment failure in our cohort. Back-to-leg ratio did not reach statistical significance although it proved a strong correlation in bivariate analysis (p < 0,001, Cramér's V = 0,53).
CONCLUSION: Increasing % canal compromise ratio (cut-off value 23%) and co-occurrence of leg paresthesia were the most important risk factors for surgery in our series of patients.
