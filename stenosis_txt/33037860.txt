Title: Associations Between Carotid Plaque Characteristics and Improvement of Cerebral Blood Perfusion in Patients With Moderate to Severe Carotid Stenosis Undergoing Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The relationship between plaque characteristics and their predictive value for perioperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) are unknown.
PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between carotid plaque characteristics and perioperative CBF utilizing MRI.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
POPULATION: In all, 131 patients with carotid moderate-to-severe stenosis referred for carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T, black-blood T<sub>1</sub> - and T<sub>2</sub> -weighted, 3D time-of-flight, and simultaneous noncontrast angiography intraplaque hemorrhage.
ASSESSMENT: The relative CBF (rCBF = CBF<sub>index-hemisphere</sub> /CBF<sub>contralateral-hemisphere</sub> ) and the CBF difference ratio (DR<sub>CBF</sub> = [CBF<sub>post-CEA</sub> - CBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> ]/CBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> ) in the middle cerebral artery territory were measured. The pre- and post-CEA CTP data were used as the assessment standard for CBF change. Carotid lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), intraplaque hemorrhage, calcification, fibrous cap rupture, maximum wall thickness, normalized wall index (NWI), and stenosis were determined.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Pearson or Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney U-test, and linear regression.
RESULTS: Patients with LRNC had higher rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> than those without (1.0 ± 0.1 vs. 0.9 ± 0.1, P &lt; 0.05). NWI was weakly correlated with rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> (r = -0.213, P &lt; 0.05) and DR<sub>CBF</sub> (r = 0.185, P &lt; 0.05) and marginally correlated with rCBF<sub>post-CEA</sub> (r = 0.166, P = 0.057). LRNC was weakly correlated with rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> (r = 0.179, P &lt; 0.05). NWI was associated with rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> (β = -0.035; 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.064, -0.006]; P &lt; 0.05), rCBF<sub>post-CEA</sub> (β = 0.042; 95% CI [0.002, 0.081]; P &lt; 0.05) and DR<sub>CBF</sub> (β = 0.105; 95% CI [0.026, 0.185]; P &lt; 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, associations of NWI with rCBF<sub>post-CEA</sub> (β = 0.059; 95% CI [0.016, 0.103]; P &lt; 0.05) and DR<sub>CBF</sub> (β = 0.110; 95% CI [0.021, 0.199]; P &lt; 0.05) remained statistically significant, while the association between NWI and rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> was no longer significant (β = -0.026; 95% CI [-0.058, 0.006]; P = 0.112).The associations of LRNC with rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> (β = 0.057; 95% CI [-0.0006, 0.114]; P = 0.052) and DR<sub>CBF</sub> (β = -0.157; 95% CI [-0.314, 0.001]; P = 0.051) were close to statistical significance. After adjusting for confounding factors, these associations were statistically significant (of LRNC vs. rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> : β = 0.060; 95% CI [0.003, 0.118]; P &lt; 0.05; LRNC vs. DR<sub>CBF</sub> : β = -0.205; 95% CI [-0.375, -0.036]; P &lt; 0.05).
DATA CONCLUSION: Carotid plaque burden and components, particularly LRNC, might be effective indicators for CBF change following CEA. Level of Evidence 1 Technical Efficacy Stage 5.
