Title: Initial Application of a Bicuspid Aortic Annuloplasty Ring in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency (AI) are common valvular conditions that may necessitate repair or replacement of the aortic valve. Aortic valve replacement is associated with higher long-term complications and thus, a consistent, reliable method of repair is needed. This is especially true in the pediatric population where lifelong anticoagulation and development of recurrent aortic stenosisor aortic insufficiency are especially problematic. The Hemispherical Aortic Annuloplasty Reconstruction Technology ring has been developed and used for annular stabilization in adults with success, though its efficacy in the pediatric population has yet to be demonstrated. Herein, we discuss the use of a geometric ring in aortic valve repair for the pediatric patient.
