Title: Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery repair outcomes: Preoperative mitral regurgitation persists in the follow-up.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present the midterm outcomes of surgical correction of the anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) with a focus on mitral regurgitation (MR).
METHODS: Medical records of 36 ALCAPA patients who underwent surgery in a single center were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: There were one (2.7%) neonate, 19 (52.7%) infants, 15 (41.6%) children, and 1 (2.7%) adult patient operated. Coronary reimplantation, tube reconstruction, and coronary artery bypass surgery techniques were performed in 29 (80.5%), 6 (16.6%), and 1 (2.7%) patient, respectively. Sixteen (44.4%) patients had a low ejection fraction and 13 (36.1%) patients had at least moderate MR preoperatively. None of our patients underwent a concomitant mitral surgery during the initial repair. Three and two patients died in the early and late postoperative period, respectively. Two patients underwent reoperation due to MR and pulmonary stenosis, separately. Preoperative MR was the only factor associated with at least moderate MR at the final follow-up (p < .01) and the presence of preoperative moderate or over-moderate MR estimated at least moderate MR at the final follow-up with 100% sensitivity and 80% specificity.
CONCLUSION: Although the mitral valve was not repaired in the first operation, the reoperation rate is low. However, a moderate or higher preoperative MR predicted MR at the last follow-up. Performing annuloplasty in such patients can be a strategy to be researched.
