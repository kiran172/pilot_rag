Title: Pulmonary vein occlusion: A delayed complication following radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: This case reports demonstrates the rare but potentially serious complication of pulmonary vein stenosis and subsequent thrombosis diagnosed two years after radiofrequency ablation of the pulmonary veins for atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary vein stenosis can remain asymptomatic until significant occlusion occurs, after which it can present with a variety of symptoms, mimicking a myriad of cardiovascular and pulmonic pathologies. Early diagnosis and treatment rely on consistent follow up using appropriate diagnostic imaging modalities and is paramount in preventing severe complications.
