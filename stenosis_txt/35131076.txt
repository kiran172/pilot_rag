Title: Two Siblings With Peripheral Pulmonary Arterial Stenosis: Pulmonary Angiography of Advanced and Early Stages.

Abstract: Peripheral pulmonary arterial stenosis (PPAS) is known to cause pulmonary hypertension (PH). Although adult patients at advanced stage have been increasingly reported, there are few reports on clinical characteristics and pulmonary angiography (PAG) findings of early stage PPAS. We present two Japanese siblings with PPAS with homozygosity of RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys-one with advanced stage and the other with early stage. The latter case was an asymptomatic 37-year-old woman with mild PH. Notably, her PAG demonstrated nonthrombotic stenosis in the subsegmental branches of the pulmonary arteries with varying degrees of stenosis among lung segments. Taken together with a family history, genetic analysis, and cerebral angiography, the obtained images were considered as showing PPAS with early stage. This result is clinically informative to diagnose PPAS at an early stage and is also important to understand the pathogenesis of PPAS.
