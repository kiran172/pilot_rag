Title: [Application of mechanical debulking in arteriosclerosis occlusive disease of lower extremity].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the effect of mechanical debulking in treating arteriosclerosis occlusive disease of lower extremity. Methods: The clinical data of 52 arteriosclerosis occlusive disease of lower extremity cases treated with Rotarex mechanical debulking system from June 2017 to June 2020 at Department of Intervention Vascular Surgery,Peking University Third Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. There were 37 males and 15 females,aged(69.4±10.1)years(range:47 to 89 years).Lesion length was (21.6±12.9)cm(range:4 to 45 cm),occlusion length was (18.5±11.8)cm(range:4 to 45 cm).The lesion was located in iliac artery(IA) in 6 cases,femoral-popliteal artery(FPA) in 42 cases,and both IA and FPA in 4 cases. All the cases were treated with Rotarex mechanical debulking system. Residual stenosis more than 50% were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty(PTA).Drug coated balloon was used in part of them,and stent was used only when it was necessary. The patient's operation, complications, postoperative target vessel restenosis and reoperation were collected. The paired sample t test and rank sum test was used for data comparison and the postoperative target vessel patency rate was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Results: All the 52 cases obtained technical success. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was used in all cases,and drug coated balloon were used in 11 cases. Twenty-six stents were implanted in 24 cases (2 cases implanted 2 stents).Nine stents were implanted in IA and 15 in FPA. The length of stents was (11.3±3.3)cm(range:6 to 23 cm).There were 3 procedure related complications: one of them was acute occlusion in an iliac lesion,and thrombectomy was applied urgently,and the result was good. And the other two were distal embolism. The thrombus were took out with guiding catheter. The hospital stay was (4.8±1.9)days. The ankle brachial index increased from 0.34±0.16 to 0.81±0.16 after treatment(t=-25.160,P&lt;0.01).The Rutherford stages decreased from (M(IQR)) 3(1) to 1(1(Z=-6.825,P&lt;0.01).The median followed up time was 19 months(range:6 to 42 months).Two cases stopped antiplatelet agents during follow-up and which result in acute thrombosis 2 weeks and 2 months later respectively. One of them was treated with percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and the other one was not for gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Four cases died during follow-up,one case died of lung cancer,one died of abdominal infection,and the other 2 cases died of cardiovascular disease,and no amputation was observed. Target lesion restenosis(TLR) more than 50% occurred in 13 cases during the follow-up. All TLR were observed in FPA,and target lesion revascularization was taken in 3 of them. According to Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis,half-year,1-year and 2-year cumulative patency rates of target vessels in this group was 94.2%,87.4% and 51.4%, respectively. And half-year and 1-year cumulative patency rates just in FPA cases was 92.9% and 84.3%, respectively. Conclusions: Percutaneous mechanical debulking using Rotarex catheter combining PTA can reduce the use of stents in femoral-popliteal artery. It is safe and effective in treating with arteriosclerosis obliterans of lower extremity.
