Title: Experience of Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty for Severe Aortic Stenosis in Patients Scheduled for Open Surgery for Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia.

Abstract: Objectives: To estimate the effectiveness of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) for severe aortic stenosis (SAS) in patients scheduled for open surgery for chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Materials and Methods: Clinical data of patients from 2012 to 2018 were retrieved and summarized. The early outcomes and survival after BAV and open bypass were retrospectively investigated. Results: BAV was performed on seven dialysis patients. One patient died of mesenteric infarction 3 days after BAV; however, six patients were able to undergo open bypass at an average of 10 days (7-19 days) after BAV. One patient died of hemorrhagic shock before the wound healed; five patients underwent limb salvage. Four of these five patients could not undergo surgical aortic open valve replacement owing to advanced age or poor cardiac function and died within 2 years. Only one patient who underwent radical surgery after a bypass survived more than 4 years. Conclusion: BAV enabled open surgery and limb salvage in patients with SAS. Although BAV alone cannot ensure long-term survival, the procedure will continue to be important as a bridge technique to radical surgery, such as transcatheter aortic valve implantation and aortic valve repair, which are often avoided owing to infection.
