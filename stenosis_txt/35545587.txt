Title: [Effect and prognosis of new type of re-dilated stent in the treatment of pulmonary artery bifurcation stenosis].

Abstract: the early and med-term follow-up results and technical points of new re-dilated stent in the treatment of pulmonary artery bifurcation opening stenosis, and explore its feasibility and advantages. From March 2019 to October 2020, 10 children [5 males, mean age (7Â±3) years], mean weight 18.75(13.35,23.05) kg with pulmonary artery bifurcation opening stenosis were treated with new re-dilated stents in the Central China Fuwai Hospital. Including 5 cases of tetralogy of Fallot, 4 cases of pulmonary atresia, 1 case of anomalous origin of coronary artery, all children were given new re-dilated stent implantation. Echocardiography, chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were performed 1 day, 3, 6, 12 months after intervention. Pulmonary artery CTA was performed after 6 or 12 months to evaluate the results, including restenosis, malposition and rupture. A total of 16 stents were implanted in 10 children, 5 cases had simultaneous stenosis of bifurcation openings of pulmonary arteries, and 1 stent was implanted in each of the left and right pulmonary artery openings. The pressure of right ventricular and gradient was significantly decreased immediately after intervention, from preoperative (38-80) mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) to postoperative (0-22) mmHg, only one patient's pressure gradient is over 20 mmHg (22 mmHg), and all cases discharged successfully. Stent restenosis, malposition, fracture and other abnormalities were not observed in follow-up. Stents implantation for patients with pulmonary artery bifurcation opening stenosis is very more difficult. A good strategy can ensure that the intervention is safe and effective. It not only avoids the risk of repeated surgery, but also achieves good med-term follow-up results.
