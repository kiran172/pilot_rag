Title: Triple endoscopy and recurrent croup in children: A single aerodigestive center experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of triple endoscopy (combined direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy (DLB), flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (FB + BAL), and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)) in the diagnosis and management of patients with recurrent croup (RC), and to identify predictors of endoscopic findings METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of pediatric patients (age <18 years) with RC evaluated by triple endoscopy at a tertiary care pediatric hospital from 2010 to 2021. Data including presenting symptoms, airway findings, BAL and EGD with biopsy findings were collected.
RESULTS: 42 patients with RC underwent triple endoscopy were included. The mean age was 4.55Â±2.84 years old. The most common symptom was chronic cough among 19 (45%) patients, while 23 (55%) patients had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Airway findings included tracheomalacia in 19, laryngeal cleft in 17, and subglottic stenosis in 11 patients. On EGD with biopsy, abnormal gross findings were present in 6 and abnormal microscopic findings in 18 patients, including 6 with histologic findings suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux and 5 with eosinophilic esophagitis. Seventeen (40%) patients had positive culture on BAL. No findings in patient histories significantly predicted presence of lower airway malacia, subglottic stenosis, or abnormal EGD findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with recurrent croup presenting to aerodigestive centers may not have any pertinent presenting symptoms that correlate with significant findings on triple endoscopy. Further work is needed to determine which children with recurrent croup may benefit from aerodigestive evaluation.
