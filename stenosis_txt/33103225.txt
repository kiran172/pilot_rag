Title: Usefulness of CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc Score to predict clinical outcomes of patients undergoing carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: The CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score predicts stroke and mortality risk in several cardiovascular diseases regardless of atrial fibrillation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the ability of CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score to predict in-hospital and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS). The study population included 558 patients undergoing CAS. The patients were stratified into three groups based on their CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores [low (≤ 2, n = 123), moderate (3-5, n = 355) and high (6-8, n = 80)]. In-hospital and 3-year outcomes were compared between the groups. In-hospital rates of ipsilateral and major strokes and death were significantly different between the groups (1.6% vs. 3.9% vs. 16.2%; 1.6% vs. 4.5% vs. 16.2%; 0.8% vs. 3.1% vs. 13.8%, p &lt; 0.001 for all, respectively). At 3 years of follow-up, rates of ipsilateral and major strokes and death were significantly increased in patients with highscore compared to those with moderate and low scores (1.6% vs. 5.8% vs. 13%, p = 0.005; 0.8% vs. 5.2% vs. 13%, p = 0.001; 1.6% vs. 8.4% vs. 15.9%; p = 0.002, respectively). After adjusting for multi-model Cox regression analysis, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score persisted as an independent prognostic factor for mortality and major stroke in patients undergoing CAS. Higher CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score predicted increased risk of in-hospital and 3- year stroke and mortality in patients undergoing CAS.
