Title: Mesenteric Ischemia After Cardiac Surgery in Dialysis Patients: An Overlooked Risk Factor.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: No study has examined the association of the calcification of abdominal artery orifices with nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) in dialysis patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Thus, this study aimed to determine whether calcification of abdominal blood vessel orifices in hemodialysis patients may be a risk factor for NOMI and examine the long-term survival of dialysis patients after undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS: From April 2014 to September 2020, 100 dialysis patients underwent cardiac surgery at our hospital. The calcification of the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was evaluated by computed tomography, and the degree of orifice stenosis was graded as follows: patent, 0; partial occlusion, 1; and complete occlusion, 2.
RESULTS: Eight patients experienced NOMI, and all of them died. SMA calcification scores were not significantly different between the NOMI and non-NOMI groups (1.38±0.52 vs. 1.13±0.69; P = 0.247). However, the average CA orifice calcification score was significantly greater in the NOMI group than in the non-NOMI group (1.63±0.52 vs. 1.15±0.65; P = 0.039), and the SMA+CA orifice calcification scores were significantly different between the groups (3.00±0.76 vs. [non-NOMI] 2.25±1.18; P = 0.028). In all patients, the 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates were 13% and 18%, respectively. All patients were completely followed up with a mean follow-up period of 604±585 days. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with SMA and CA calcification tended to have a shorter overall survival than patients without calcification; however, no significant difference was noted.
CONCLUSIONS: The calcification of CA and/or SMA orifices was associated with postoperative NOMI and poor long-term survival among dialysis patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
