Title: Five-year outcomes after surgery for class 1 obesity: a retrospective analysis of a Canadian bariatric centre's experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of literature exploring the role of bariatric surgery in class 1 obesity. We evaluated the 5-year outcomes after bariatric surgery in patients with class 1 obesity, assessing weight loss, resolution/reduction of obesity-related comorbidities, morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of patients who underwent bariatric surgery (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [LSG] or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass [LRYGB)]) for class 1 obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30.0-34.9) between January 2012 and February 2019.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (35 [95%] female, mean age 44.5 yr [standard error (SE) 11.3 yr], mean preoperative BMI 33.1) were included, of whom 32 underwent LSG and 5 underwent LRYGB. Thirty-five patients were followed for 5 years post-operatively, achieving a mean BMI of 25.6 (SE 1.2) and excess weight loss of 89.4% (SE 15.1%). Remission of hypertension was achieved in 5 of 12 patients (42%), and remission of dyslipidemia was achieved in 7 of 11 patients (64%). Of the 11 patients with diabetes, 7 underwent LSG and 4, LRYGB. At 5 years postoperatively, the mean glycosylated hemoglobin concentration was 6.3%. Four patients in the LSG group developed de novo reflux, 1 patient required conversion to LRYGB, and 1 patient with sleeve stenosis required endoscopic dilatation. There were no deaths in either patient group.
CONCLUSION: At our centre, bariatric surgery for class 1 obesity was safe and had long-term efficacy, with remission or reduction of related comorbidities. Prospective controlled trials are required to confirm these results.
