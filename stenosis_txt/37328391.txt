Title: Conductive disturbances in the transcatheter aortic valve implantation setting: An appraisal of current knowledge and unmet needs.

Abstract: New-onset conduction disturbances, including left bundle branch block and permanent pacemaker implantation, remain a major issue after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Preprocedural risk assessment in current practice is most often limited to evaluation of the baseline electrocardiogram, whereas it may benefit from a multimodal approach, including ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring and multidetector computed tomography. Physicians may encounter equivocal situations during the hospital phase, and the management of follow-up is not fully defined, despite the publication of several expert consensuses and the inclusion of recommendations regarding the role of electrophysiology studies and postprocedural monitoring in recent guidelines. This review provides an overview of current knowledge and future perspectives regarding the management of new-onset conduction disturbances in the setting of transcatheter aortic valve implantation, from the preprocedural phase to long-term follow-up.
