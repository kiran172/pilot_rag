Title: Bronchial Fibroepithelial Polyp With Severe Hemoptysis as First Manifestation: A Case Report.

Abstract: Fibroepithelial polyps are uncommon benign tumors that mostly occur in skin, oral cavity and genitourinary tract. These lesions have common morphological features with other mesenchymal tumors such as angiomyofibroblastoma, aggressive angiomyxoma, and cellular angiofibroma and present with numerous histological appearances. Benign endobronchial tumors are rare. These neoplasms have a slow growth and usually are related to bronchial obstruction. Only a few cases of bronchial fibroepithelial polyps have been reported. Bronchial fibroepithelial polyps might present with airway stenosis resulting in atelectasis and bronchiectasis and the most frequent manifestations are recurrent infection, refractory asthma, dyspnea and hemoptysis. Chronic inflammation is associated with the pathogenesis of fibroepithelial polyps. Treatment varies according to mainly to the size and symptoms. Small lesions presenting with few symptoms can be treated with corticosteroids and antibiotics while invasive techniques including bronchoscopic resection of the polyp or lobectomy are used for larger lesions. We report a case of a bronchial fibroepithelial polyp with severe hemoptysis as the first manifestation. Physicians should always suspect these lesions in the differential diagnosis of hemoptysis and with initial right diagnosis surgical procedures can be avoided.
