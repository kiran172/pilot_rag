Title: Conservative Management of Necrotizing Enterocolitis in Newborns: Incidence and Management of Intestinal Strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND:  Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the main causes of acute abdomen in neonates. Surgical treatment entails important morbidity and mortality and conservative management, when possible, offers better outcomes. Post-NEC intestinal strictures are one of the main complications.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis from June 2011 to November 2022 of post-NEC strictures (PNS) after conservative management of neonates diagnosed with NEC (modified Bell stage IIA or higher) at a tertiary neonatal surgery center.
RESULTS:  Out of 219 NEC, 126 received initial conservative management (57.5%), 24 (19%) of which eventually underwent surgery for PNS. Average gestational age and weight at birth of our cohort were 31.3 ± 4.9 weeks and 1,694 ± 1,009 g.PNS diagnosis was made 38.4 ± 16.5 days after the NEC episode. 6/24 (25%) were asymptomatic and diagnosed by screening enema, 11 (46%) presented signs of intestinal obstruction before the enema could be performed and 7 (29%) after a normal previous protocol study.Median age at PNS surgery was 56 ± 17.9 days. A total of 2/3 strictures were found in cecum, ascendent, and transverse colon. Primary resection and anastomosis were performed in all cases. Feeds were restarted on postoperative day 4.3 ± 2.9. Two cases presented anastomotic complications (1 dehiscence and 1 stenosis), and no deaths were recorded.
CONCLUSIONS:  PNS is a frequent complication after conservative management. Deffered surgical treatment after the acute NEC episode is resolved allows for safer surgeries (since patients have reached hemodynamical stability and overcome septic shock), shorter resections, and favorable postoperative outcomes.
