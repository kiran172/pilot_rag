Title: Sutureless Repair With Extended Atriotomy for Post-Repair Pulmonary Venous Obstruction.

Abstract: Post-repair pulmonary venous obstruction is a common cause of reoperation after total anomalous pulmonary venous return repair. Herein, we report 3 cases of specific type of post-repair pulmonary venous obstruction with eccentric stenosis of pulmonary vein ostium due to retained composite neoseptum and the technique used for subsequent repair.
