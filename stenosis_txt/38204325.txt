Title: Survival of P. falciparum infected red blood cell aggregates in elongational shear flow.

Abstract: Rosetting, the formation of red blood cell aggregates, is a life-threatening condition in malaria tropica and not yet fully understood. We study rosette stability using a set of microfluidic stenotic channels, with varied narrowing angle and erythrocytes of blood groups O and A. We find reduced ability of a rosette to pass a stenosis without disruption, the longer the tapered part of the constriction and the narrower the stenosis is. In general, this ability increases with rosette size and is 5-15% higher in blood group A. The experimental results are substantiated by equivalent experiments using lectin-induced red blood cell aggregates and a simulation of the underlying protein binding kinetics.
