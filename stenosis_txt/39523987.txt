Title: Variation in the management and treatment of children with giant coronary artery aneurysm following Kawasaki disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Giant coronary artery aneurysms are rare but potentially fatal complications of Kawasaki disease. The lack of evidence-based recommendations on their management and treatment cause guidelines and practices to differ. We aimed to assess these variations.
METHODS: An anonymous online survey regarding surveillance, imaging, pharmacological management, and interventional practices was distributed among 134 physicians attending to Kawasaki disease patients worldwide. A p-value of <0.05 was deemed significant.
RESULTS: The majority (60%) of respondents were general paediatric cardiologists, and 29% interventional specialists. The average years in practice was 15 Â± 9.6. Physicians from Asia had the most experience with giant coronary artery aneurysms. American practitioners preferred combining anticoagulants with aspirin. Beta-blockers and statins were more likely used in teenagers versus younger children. Cardiac catheterisation was most (52%) chosen for coronary surveillance in patients with echocardiogram anomalies, followed by Coronary CT-angiography. The indications for coronary intervention were split among respondents, regardless of geographic region or experience. The preferred treatment of coronary stenosis was percutaneous intervention (69%) versus bypass surgery. For thrombosis, thrombolytics (50%) were preferred over percutaneous (39%) and surgical (11%) interventions. Most (92%) preferred intervening in young children in a paediatric facility but were split between a paediatric and adult facility for older children. Most chose combined management by adult and paediatric specialists for either age-scenarios (70, 82%).
CONCLUSION: As identified by our study, the lack of large studies and evidence-based recommendations cause uncertainty and ambivalence towards certain treatments. International collaborative efforts are needed to provide more robust evidence in the management of these patients.
