Title: Acute Vision Impairment Caused by Internal Carotid Artery Plaque Hemorrhage Combined With Thrombosis.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis (As) is an important pathologic basis for ischemic cerebrovascular disease and easily causes stenosis of the origin of the internal carotid artery (ICA). As the main source of intracranial blood supply, the ICA accounts for 70% to 80% of blood flow. This stenosis can cause various ocular symptoms in patients. In the existing literature, it is rare to report cases with only acute vision loss caused by ICA plaque hemorrhage combined with thrombosis. The authors report a case of acute vision impairment caused by ICA plaque hemorrhage. The clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, differential diagnosis, and treatment methods were discussed based on relevant literature, and the diagnosis and differentiation of the disease were considered to deepen the understanding of the disease.
