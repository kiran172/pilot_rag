Title: Clinical and Angioarchitectural Features of Ruptured Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is a feared complication of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs). Traditional grading systems including the Cognard and Borden classifications assess for this risk. We sought to define the specific angioarchitecture of ruptured lesions.
METHODS: A total of 41 cases between 2004 and 2019 with ruptured cranial DAVFs were retrospectively analyzed. Information reviewed from records and imaging included hematoma location, fistula anatomy and architecture, classification, venous pouches, common collecting veins, downstream stenosis, treatment, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Mean age at presentation was 60 years, and 61% of patients were male. Hemorrhage was most commonly intraparenchymal, and the majority of fistulae were transverse-sigmoid, tentorial, or convexity. We noted that 71% of lesions had a multi-feeder-common-hole configuration. Venous aneurysms (present in 64% of patients) were in direct communication with the hematoma in 88%; 72% of cases were treated by endovascular means; 64% of patients were treated within 7 days. Five patients re-bled between diagnosis and treatment. A total of 83% of patients were functionally independent at last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhage from cranial DAVFs is mostly intraparenchymal. Venous aneurysms are common and very often responsible for the bleed. Embolization yields high cure rates and should be performed early because of risk of re-hemorrhage. However, in spite of hemorrhage, DAVFs have a relatively favorable clinical outcome.
