Title: Celiac artery occlusion from median arcuate ligament compression complicating a hemorrhagic duodenal ulcer repair.

Abstract: We present a case of a hemorrhagic duodenal ulcer complicated by occlusion of the celiac artery (CA) by acute median arcuate ligament (MAL) compression. Angiography revealed retrograde flow through the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) to the hepatic artery, with occlusion at the CA origin. This unique presentation required coordinated release of the MAL to reestablish antegrade CA flow before pyloroplasty and GDA ligation. The presence of preexisting MAL compression of the CA should be considered during the repair of bleeding duodenal ulcers through embolization or ligation of the GDA, because impaired CA perfusion could result in foregut ischemia.
