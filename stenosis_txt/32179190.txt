Title: Oxygen Embolism and Pneumocephalus After Hydrogen Peroxide Application During Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion Surgery: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) solution is commonly used to irrigate wounds because of its hemostatic and antiseptic properties. Previous studies suggest that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can result in toxicity to keratinocytes and fibroblasts, but complications after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> application, including oxygen embolism, which is one of the most severe, have rarely been reported.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 40-year-old woman was diagnosed with L4-5 lumbar spinal stenosis and subsequently underwent minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion treatment at another hospital. Hypotension, hypoxia, and a decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure occurred immediately after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> irrigation. After the operation, she was able to be extubated but remained comatose. Postoperative computed tomography scan revealed intracranial air trapping in the right frontal lobe and multiple cerebral infarction foci.
CONCLUSIONS: When using a knee-prone surgical position or in cases of dural laceration, the application of undiluted H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution should be avoided, especially in a surgical wound within a closed cavity. When hypotension, hypoxia, and a decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure occur immediately after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> irrigation, oxygen embolism should be strongly suspected.
