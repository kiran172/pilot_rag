Title: A successful surgical repair for supravalvular aortic stenosis with a bicuspid valve and malpositioned coronary orifices by partial Brom's technique: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a relatively rare form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, often accompanied by other cardiac conditions. However, a standard surgical reparative technique has not been established and repairing SVAS remains challenging.
CASE PRESENTATION: We repaired SVAS of a 3-year-old boy accompanied by a bicuspid aortic valve and malpositioned coronary orifices by partial Brom's technique with two glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patches, using recent advanced preoperative information, including geometric and effective heights. Echocardiography after the surgery revealed release of SVAS without aortic regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS: In repair for SVAS, it is important not only to release stenosis but also to make a functional aortic valve, using recent advanced preoperative information. In the case of children, repairing the aortic valve by only using autologous tissue having growth potential, is also important.
