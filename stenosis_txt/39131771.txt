Title: An interesting case series of ticagrelor induced long QTc.

Abstract: This case series explores three patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and experienced prolonged QT intervals under treatment with Ticagrelor. The first case was a female who presented with chest pain and received a Xience stent. The second case involved a male patient who received two Xience stents. The third case was that of a male patient with LAD stenosis. All three patients received Ticagrelor and exhibited prolonged QTc intervals on their electrocardiograms (ECGs), which was resolved after switching to Clopidogrel. Thus far, the potential impact of Ticagrelor on QT prolongation has not been adequately addressed in the literature. It is hypothesized that Ticagrelor can block adenosine uptake by red blood cells, which may explain QTc prolongation. The results of this case series indicate that Ticagrelor may prolong QTc intervals. Consequently, it is imperative that clinicians are aware of this previously unlisted side effect and that patients are closely monitored while seeking alternative medications to manage the condition.
