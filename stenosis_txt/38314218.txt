Title: Hydrocephalus Resolution with Third Ventriculostomy with Floor Stenting: Technical Note and Literature Review.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The management of refractory obstructive hydrocephalus is a paramount neurosurgical challenge. The endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has been accepted as the procedure of choice for obstructive hydrocephalus, depending on the presence of certain risk factors, such as intracranial infections, young age, previous shunt failure and distorted anatomy of the ventricular floor, that predispose occlusion or obstruction of the CSF outflow through the stoma.
CASE REPORT: A 20-year-old man with obstructive hydrocephalus due to primary aqueductal stenosis performed several neurosurgical procedures, including two previous ETV, without long term resolution. We performed another ETV, with stent placement at the stoma to prevent occlusion. After 25 months of asymptomatic follow-up, the patient presented with an enlarged fourth ventricle, and a new neuroendoscopic procedure showed a patent stoma and a well-placed stent.
DISCUSSION: Stent placement on the third ventricular floor was already reported 19 times in the literature. Its success rate is about 94,7%, and complications happened in 2 cases, with functional impaired in only one of them.
CONCLUSION: Third ventriculostomy with floor stenting proved to be an effective procedure in our case of complex hydrocephalus. It is a viable option in cases where there is a greater chance of stoma occlusion.
