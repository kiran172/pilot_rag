Title: Forearm brachial artery to brachial vein looped arteriovenous grafts: A single center, single surgeon observational study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term hemodialysis (HD) treatment requires the establishment of a cannulatable vascular access (VA) point. While the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is considered the gold standard, the arteriovenous graft (AVG) is a viable alternative especially in patients with poor superficial venous anatomy. Few studies have assessed the efficacy of the brachial-brachial arteriovenous graft (BB-AVG) for long-term HD access. By analyzing one surgeon's experience in creating, surveilling and maintaining BB-AVGs, this retrospective study aims to add to the body of literature in assessing patency outcomes of BB-AVGs.
METHODS: We identified 57 BB-AVGs that met inclusion criteria and were created between October 6, 2005 and May 1, 2019 by a single surgeon in 54 patients. We analyzed primary failures, patency, complications and interventions. Patency rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The incidence of complications and interventions were expressed as number of events per person-year.
RESULTS: A total of 54 patients (median age of 65 years) were analyzed. Primary patency rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 20.4% 7.4%, and 5.0%. Primary assisted patency rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 46.7%, 33.5%, and 15.1%. The secondary patency rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 81.8%, 63.8%, and 60.1%, respectively. The incidence of complications and interventions was 2.164 per person-year. Most complications and interventions were due to stenosis (1.202 per person-year) or thrombosis (0.802 per person-year).
CONCLUSION: In patients with poor superficial veins, the brachial vein is a reasonable alternative to use as the venous outflow. However, in order to achieve acceptable patency rates, close monitoring of the VA, as well as aggressive treatment of complications within the brachial vein is necessary. Overall, the BB-AVG should be considered in patients who lack adequate superficial veins and require preservation of the more proximal veins.
