Title: Splice implantation of multiple drug-eluting stents for tandem severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery: A case report.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery tandem affects the blood supply to the brain and threatens human life, which can be solved by interventional procedures.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old male patient presented with a sudden onset of dizziness, palpitation, numbness, and weakness of the limbs. Imaging studies suggested multiple tandem severe stenoses from the left internal carotid artery contrast C2 to C4.
DIAGNOSIS: Severe stenosis of the left internal carotid tandem.
INTERVENTIONS: Multiple drug-eluting stent splicing and implantation were performed.
OUTCOMES: The left internal carotid artery stenosis was released, intracranial vascular filling was significantly improved, and the patient recovered well.
LESSONS: Interventional implantation of multiple drug-eluting stents relieves tandem severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery, with a wide range of applicability, high safety profile, and rapid postoperative recovery compared with endothelial debridement procedures.
