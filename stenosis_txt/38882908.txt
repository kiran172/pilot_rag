Title: Intracerebral Hemorrhage in a Child with Renal Artery Stenosis and COVID-19.

Abstract: Pediatric intracerebral hemorrhage is a rare condition among children. We discuss the case of a 7-year-old Filipino male with generalized tonic seizures and diagnosed to have both SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypertension secondary to renal arterial stenosis. The occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage in children, though commonly caused by arteriovenous malformations, may be secondary to an acute hypertensive episode. In this case, the presence of COVID-19 in the patient may have been contributory to the development of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage due to its direct endothelial effects, as well as its dysregulatory action on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
