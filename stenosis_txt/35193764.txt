Title: Outcomes, Trends, and Predictors of Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from the National Inpatient Sample).

Abstract: Major bleeding has been identified as one of the most common complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with some suffering gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). This study aimed at assessing the incidence and predictors of GIB after TAVI in the United States. We performed a retrospective analysis of data from the National Inpatient Sample database from 2011 to 2018. A total of 216,023 hospitalizations for TAVI were included. Of the included patients, 2,188 (1%) patients had GIB, whereas 213,835 (99%) patients did not have GIB. The presence of arteriovenous malformation was associated with the highest odds of having a gastrointestinal bleed (odds ratio (OR) 24.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.13 to 35.92). Peptic ulcer disease was associated with an eightfold increased risk of bleeding (OR 8.74, 95% CI, 6.69 to 11.43) followed closely by colorectal cancer (OR 7.89, 95% CI, 5.33 to 11.70). Other comorbidities that were associated with higher propensity-matched rates of GIB were chronic kidney disease (OR 1.27,95% CI, 1.14 to 1.41), congestive heart failure (OR 1.18, 95% CI,1.06 to 1.32), liver disease (OR1.83, 95% CI,1.53 to 2.19), end-stage renal disease (OR 2.08,95% CI, 1.75 to 2.47), atrial fibrillation (OR1.63,95% CI,Â  1.49 to 1.78), and lung cancer (OR 2.80, 95% CI,1.77 to 4.41). Patients with GIB had higher propensity-matched rates of mortality than those without GIB, (12.1% vs 3.2%, p <0.01). Patients with GIB had a higher median cost of stay ($68,779 vs $46,995, p <0.01) and a longer length of hospital stay (11 vs 3 days, p <0.01). In conclusion, health care use and mortality are higher in hospitalizations of TAVI with a GIB. Baseline comorbidities like peptic ulcer disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, atrial fibrillation and, colorectal cancer are significant predictors of this adverse event.
