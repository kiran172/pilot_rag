Title: Endovascular stent implantation as a primary method of treatment for blocked modified Blalock‒Taussig shunt.

Abstract: Modified Blalock‒Taussig shunt is a commonly performed palliative cardiac surgery. Complications like early or late occlusion have been reported in approximately 10% of patients. Thrombosis, stenosis, or kinking are possible mechanisms that lead to shunt obstruction which may be life-threatening and need urgent intervention in form of medical, surgical, or interventional catheterization. Traditionally, these patients are managed in the operating room with shunt revision but with advancing techniques, percutaneous interventions are being increasingly deployed to salvage these patients effectively. We describe our experience of two cases of blocked modified Blalock‒Taussig shunt, which was successfully managed by stenting the shunt.
