Title: Vascular Complications in TAVI Procedures: Assessment, Management, and Outcomes-a Retrospective Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic modality for aortic stenosis, predominantly in the elderly population. Despite its clinical success, the incidence and implications of vascular complications during TAVI remain a subject of critical concern.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 140 patients who experienced vascular complications during TAVI procedures from a total cohort of 1,343 cases. Patient demographics, clinical profiles, and procedural characteristics were scrupulously examined. Vascular complications, both intraoperative and postoperative, were identified through various diagnostic modalities. Statistical analyses were employed to discern associations and significance levels. Comparative assessments with international literature were performed to gain broader insights.
RESULTS: The study unveiled an overall incidence of vascular complications at approximately 10.44%. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)-p-value (0.013), choice of valve type-p-value (0.016), and access point-p-value (0.027) demonstrated significant correlations with these complications. Complication incidences in TAVI procedures included pseudoaneurysms (4.76%), arteriovenous fistulas (1.49%), hematomas (0.37%), dissections (2.24%), arterial perforations (0.15%), stenosis/occlusion (0.37%), and closure device failures (1.94%). Over 70% of complications at the valve entry point result from dissections and closure device failures, while the pigtail entry point is predominantly linked to over 70% of pseudoaneurysms. Extended hospitalization (7.84 Â±SD 3.14) was observed for patients experiencing vascular complications, underlining the importance of vigilant postprocedural care.
CONCLUSION: This study provides comprehensive insights into vascular complications during TAVI procedures, shedding light on their incidence, risk factors, clinical presentations, diagnostic methodologies, and management strategies.
