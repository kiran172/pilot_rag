Title: Surgically induced aortic coarctation in a neonatal porcine model allows for longitudinal assessment of cardiovascular changes.

Abstract: Noncritical aortic coarctation (COA) typically presents beyond early childhood with hypertension. Correction of COA does not ensure a return to normal cardiovascular health, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, we developed a porcine COA model to study the secondary cardiovascular changes. Eight male neonatal piglets (4 sham, 4 COA) underwent left posterolateral thoracotomy with descending aorta (DAO) mobilization. COA was created via a 1-cm longitudinal DAO incision with suture closure, plication, and placement and an 8-mm external band. All animals had cardiac catheterization at 6 (11-13 kg), 12 (26-31 kg), and 20 (67-70 kg) wk of age. Aortic luminal diameters were similar along the thoracic aorta, except for the COA region [6.4 mm COA vs. 17.3 mm sham at 20 wk (P &lt; 0.001)]. Collateral flow could be seen as early as 6 wk. COA peak systolic pressure gradient was 20 mmHg at 6 wk and persisted through 20 wk increasing to 40 mmHg with dobutamine. Pulse pressures distal to the COA were diminished at 12 and 20 wk. This model addresses many limitations of prior COA models including neonatal creation at an expected anatomic position with intimal injury and vessel sizes similar to humans.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY A neonatal model of aortic coarctation was developed in a porcine model using a readily reproducible method of aortic plication and external wrap placement. This model addresses the limitations of existing models including neonatal stenosis creation, appropriate anatomic location of the stenosis, and intimal injury creation and mimics human somatic growth. Pigs met American Heart Association (AHA) criteria for consideration of intervention, and the stenoses were graded as moderate to severe.
