Title: Point-of-care ultrasound in the head and neck region.

Abstract: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in the head and neck region plays a particularly significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of upper airway stenosis, swelling, and painful diseases in the neck, and in the evaluation of swallowing function. Therefore, it should be performed in various medical settings beyond the boundaries of the clinical department such as general medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesiology, orthopedics, and pediatrics. The target diseases are salivary gland disease, lymph node disease, pharyngeal disease, laryngeal disease, esophageal disease, thyroid disease, and dysphagia and dyspnea due to various causes. Head and neck POCUS is an extremely useful diagnostic method for both patients and doctors, and its use is expected to become more widespread in the future.
