Title: Endoscopic Treatment for Nonhypertrophic Idiopathic Pyloric Stenosis in an Adolescent Patient.

Abstract: Nonhypertrophic idiopathic pyloric stenosis (NHIPS) is a rare occurrence in children. It could be related to peptic ulcers, but a definitive cause is yet to be found. Treatment is a matter of debate, ranging from medical to surgical. We report the case of a 15-year-old boy suffering postprandial vomiting and weight loss in the previous 3 months. NHIPS was diagnosed and successfully treated with several sessions of endoscopic pyloric dilation and jejunal feeding. In association with a multidisciplinary approach, endoscopic dilation should be considered as a first-line treatment to avoid surgery.
