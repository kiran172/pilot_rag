Title: Search for Reliable Circulating Biomarkers to Predict Carotid Plaque Vulnerability.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is responsible for 20% of ischemic strokes, and the plaques from the internal carotid artery the most frequently involved. Lipoproteins play a key role in carotid atherosclerosis since lipid accumulation contributes to plaque progression and chronic inflammation, both factors leading to plaque vulnerability. Carotid revascularization to prevent future vascular events is reasonable in some patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. However, the degree of stenosis alone is not sufficient to decide upon the best clinical management in some situations. In this context, it is essential to further characterize plaque vulnerability, according to specific characteristics (lipid-rich core, fibrous cap thinning, intraplaque hemorrhage). Although these features can be partly detected by imaging techniques, identifying carotid plaque vulnerability is still challenging. Therefore, the study of circulating biomarkers could provide adjunctive criteria to predict the risk of atherothrombotic stroke. In this regard, several molecules have been found altered, but reliable biomarkers have not been clearly established yet. The current review discusses the concept of vulnerable carotid plaque, and collects existing information about putative circulating biomarkers, being particularly focused on lipid-related and inflammatory molecules.
