Title: Re-do hypospadias surgery following failed previous repair: lessons learned over two decades of experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate our experience with different surgical techniques and to find clinical factors that affect the outcome of treatment in cases of redo-hypospadias.
METHODS: We have retrospectively evaluated demographic and clinical data of children who underwent redo or cripple-hypospadias repair.
RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2021, 76 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The median age of the first cripple-hypospadias surgery was 64.8 ± 62.9 months. Upon primary surgery 5(6.6%) patients presented with distal-hypospadias, 13(17.1%) midshaft-hypospadias, 37(48.7%) proximal-hypospadias and 21(27.6%)with an unknown initial meatal status. To correct cripple-hypospadias 3(3.9%) patients underwent meatal-advancement and meatoplasty 32(42.1%) different tubularization techniques, 25(32.9%) required flap/graft, 13(17.1%) staged procedure and in 3(3.9%) surgical technique was undefined. Fifty-four (71%) children presented with post-surgery complications: 25(32.9%) meatal retraction, 19(25.3%) meatal stenosis and 17(22.3%) developed urethro-cutaneous fistula. Thirty-six (47.4%) patients underwent additional surgeries. There was no association between surgical technique or age and the need for additional surgeries (P = 0.831, P = 0.425 respectively). There was no association between surgical technique or age and surgical complications (P = 0.514, P = 0.425 respectively). All surgical techniques except meatal-advancement might lead to urethral stricture on long term follow-up (P = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that treatment of cripple-hypospadias is challenging for both surgeon and patients alike. There is a need to tailor a surgical technique to each patient and there is no one technique which is appropriate for all patients.
