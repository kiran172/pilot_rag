Title: Gastrogastric herniation: An unusual complication following greater curve plication for the treatment of morbid obesity: Case report.

Abstract: Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for obese patients. Laparoscopic greater curvature plication (LGCP) is a good, effective and feasible surgical option for the treatment of obese patients. But it has some complications that should be considered such as gastric remnant distention, stomal stenosis and marginal ulcers. Here, we reported an extremely rare complication "gastro-gastric herniation". This condition was diagnosed through upper gastrointestinal contrast imaging and treated through laparoscopy. The hernia was invaginated and firm continuous sutures were placed. We followed the patient for one year and the results were great. Thus, we can add gastro-gastric hernia to the medical literature as a rare complication of laparoscopic greater curvature gastric plication, and It is considered a serious condition that requires immediate treatment and follow-up.
