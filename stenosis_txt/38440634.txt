Title: Role of Loupes Magnification in Tracheal Resection and Anastomosis.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Tracheal resection and anastomosis is characterized in the last years by significant innovations which are well codified and standardized. Although the mortality rate is markedly reduced, the operation is still not free from risk of complications such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, anastomosis dehiscence, granulation tissue formation and restenosis.
