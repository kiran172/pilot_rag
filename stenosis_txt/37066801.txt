Title: Clinical significance of MRA, TCD and electroencephalogram in the diagnosis of intracranial artery stenosis in ischemic cerebrovascular disease.

Abstract: The clinical value of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) and electroencephalogram (EEG) in the diagnosis of intracranial artery stenosis in ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD) was explored. The clinical data of TCD, MRA and EEG in 98 patients with ICVD were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical value of TCD, MRA combined with EEG in the diagnosis of intracranial artery stenosis in ICVD was analyzed based on the results of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard. A total of 98 patients were diagnosed with 27 cases of normal intracranial artery, 32 cases of mild stenosis, 25 cases of moderate stenosis, and 14 cases of severe stenosis DSA examination. TCD was detected in 23 cases of normal, 25 cases of mild stenosis, 23 cases of moderate stenosis and 13 cases of severe stenosis. MRA showed 24 cases of normal, 28 cases of mild stenosis, 21 cases of moderate stenosis and 12 cases of severe stenosis. EEG examination detected that there were 25 cases of normal, 24 cases of mild stenosis, 22 cases of moderate stenosis, and 14 cases of severe stenosis. Sensitivity, accuracy and negative predictive value had significant differences between combined diagnosis and single diagnosis. The combined detection of TCD, MRA and EEG is consistent with DSA detection in the diagnosis of ICVD intracranial artery stenosis.
