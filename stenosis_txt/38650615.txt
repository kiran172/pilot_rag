Title: Impact of cancer in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Owing to the minimally invasive nature of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), TAVR seems to be preferred in patients with cancer; however, related research on the clinical efficacy and safety of TAVR in patients with cancer and severe aortic stenosis is limited, and conclusions are controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer who underwent TAVR.
METHOD AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the clinical outcomes in patients with and without cancer who underwent TAVR. We systematically reviewed and analyzed 15 studies (195,658 patients) published in PubMed and Cochrane Library databases between January 2022 and January 2023. The primary outcomes were short-term (in-hospital or 30-day) and long-term (≥12 months) mortality. The prevalence of current or previous cancer in the patients undergoing TAVR was 19.8 % (38,695 patients). Patients with cancer had a lower risk of short-term mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.77, P < 0.001) but a higher risk of long-term mortality (OR 1.54, 95 % CI 1.35-1.76, P < 0.001) than those without cancer. Patients with cancer had a lower incidence of postprocedural stroke and acute kidney injury but a higher incidence of pacemaker implantation than patients without cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer undergoing TAVR have a good short-term prognosis and acceptable perioperative complications compared with patients without cancer. However, the long-term outcomes are contingent on cancer survival.
