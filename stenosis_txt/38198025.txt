Title: Shunt dysfunction patterns after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation using a combination of a generic stent-graft and bare-stents.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Even though transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) using Fluency Stent-grafts provides good shunt patency rates, shunt dysfunction is a great concern after TIPS creation, occurring in up to 20% of cases within one year. The objective of this study was to describe shunt dysfunction patterns after TIPS creation using a combination of generic stent-grafts/bare-stents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-center retrospective study of all TIPS revisions between January 2005 and December 2020. TIPS revision angiograms were analyzed for stents' positions, stenoses' diameters, and stenoses' locations.
RESULTS: Out of 99 TIPS, a total of 33 TIPS revisions were included. The median time to TIPS revision was 10.4 months. Angiograms showed four patterns of TIPS dysfunction-associated features (DAF), defined as follows: Type 1 was defined as stenosis located after the stent end in the hepatic vein (HV), type 2 as intra-stent stenosis located in the hepatic vein, type 3 as intra-stent stenosis or a kink in the parenchymal tract or the portal vein end of the TIPS, and type 4 as a complete TIPS occlusion. Types 1, 2, 3, and 4 were seen in 23 (69.7%), 5 (15.2%), 2 (6.1%), and 3 (9.1%) TIPS respectively. TIPS revision was successful in 30 (90.1%) patients with median pre- and post-TIPS revision PSG of 18.5 mmHg and 8 mmHg respectively (p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Our results illustrate the four angiographic patterns of TIPS DAF after TIPS creation using a combination of generic stent-grafts/bare-stents and emphasize the need for appropriate stent length extending to the HV/inferior vena cava junction.
