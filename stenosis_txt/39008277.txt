Title: Directional atherectomy with anti-restenotic therapy versus open repair in patients with restenotic disease after surgical revascularization of the common femoral artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the performance of directional atherectomy with anti-restenotic therapy (DAART) compared to surgery in patients with restenosis of the groin arteries after endarterectomy or femoral bypass anastomosis.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with restenotic lesions from two vascular surgery units were retrospectively evaluated. Detailed medical history, type of previous reconstruction, anatomical and perioperative data, 30-day mortality and morbidity as well as data during follow-up were documented. The primary outcome measure was primary patency, whereas technical success, secondary patency, target lesion revascularization (TLR), freedom from major amputation, overall morbidity and mortality were additionally evaluated.
RESULTS: The endovascular (25 patients) and surgical (17 patients) groups were comparable regarding the initial surgical reconstruction, demographics, comorbidities and medication. In the DAART group technical success was 100% without any residual stenosis >30%, distal embolization, perforation or bailout stenting. Hospital stay was shorter after DAART (medial 2 vs. 7 days, P<0.001), while more wound complications were documented in the surgical group within the first 30-days (29.4% vs. 0%, P=0.004). Primary patency, secondary patency and TLR were comparable between the groups (66.7% vs. 64.7%, HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.3-2.9, P=0.93, 86.4% vs. 93.8%, HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.65-6.6, P=0.71, 68% vs. 70.6%, HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.3-2.9, P=0.93, respectively). During follow-up no major amputation was observed, the improvement of the Rutherford class was comparable between the two groups and there were two deaths in the surgical group.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, DAART for restenotic atherosclerotic disease of the common femoral artery and its branches is a safe alternative to redo surgery and is associated with shorter hospital stay, fewer wound complications, comparable patency and freedom from TLR rates.
