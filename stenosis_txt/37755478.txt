Title: Celiac trunk thrombosis in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome induced by median arcuate ligament compression: a case presentation and literature review.

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare disorder caused by the compression of the celiac axis by the fibrous structure of the diaphragm called the median arcuate ligament. Patients with MALS are usually undiagnosed unless characteristic symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, postprandial pain, and weight loss are presented. We report a case of a 29-year-old patient diagnosed with MALS and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) that developed celiac trunk, common hepatic artery and splenic artery thrombosis. There is not enough information on MALS as a trigger of thrombosis in predisposed patients such as those with APS. However, the case gives rise to suspicion and highlights the diagnostic processes, especially for patients with APS presenting postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. This review likewise aims at the importance of Doppler ultrasonography as a screening tool and computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) both in the angiography variant, especially to diagnose confirmation and underlying treatment options.
