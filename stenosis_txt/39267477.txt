Title: A rare esophageal metastatic adenocarcinoma misdiagnosed as esophageal leiomyoma.

Abstract: Here we report for the first time an extremely rare case of esophageal metastatic adenocarcinoma resembling esophageal leiomyoma leading to misdiagnosis. The case gives us great insights that in any esophageal stenosis with normal mucosa, metastasis must be contemplated as a differential diagnosis, especially in patients with a history of cancer.
