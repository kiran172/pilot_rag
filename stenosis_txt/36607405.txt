Title: Selection of operative approach in children with Currarino syndrome.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To summarize the experience of surgical treatment of children diagnosed with Currarino syndrome, with an emphasis on the selection of an optimal operative approach.
METHODS: The clinical materials of patients diagnosed with Currarino syndrome were recorded. Special attention was given to the operative management, particularly the different routes for operation. The type of ARM was the critical point. The Rintala score was used for the evaluation of bowel function.
RESULTS: The medical records of 26 patients were reviewed. Seven were male, and 19 were female, with a mean age of 19.38 ± 13.80 months. The standard posterior sagittal approach (SPS) group included three perineal fistulae, one anal stenosis, one retraction of the rectum after anoplasty for vestibular fistula, one ARM with no fistula, one rectourethral fistula, and one cloaca. In the limited posterior sagittal approach (LPS) group, there were 13 perineal fistulae, one displacement of the rectum, and one retraction of the rectum after anoplasty for the vestibular fistula. In addition, the transanal approach (TA) and anterior sagittal approach (AS) were also used. The mean follow-up time was 39.48 ± 26.84 m. The Rintala score was 16.74 ± 2.93.
CONCLUSION: For a perineal fistula, SPS or LPS should be used to reach anoplasty and remove the presacral mass. For a vestibular fistula, the AS or LPS should be chosen. For anal stenosis, SPS or LPS should be used.
