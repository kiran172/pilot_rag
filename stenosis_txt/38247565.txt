Title: Antiphospholipid Antibodies Associated with Native Arteriovenous Fistula Complications in Hemodialysis Patients: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-persistent positivity is frequent in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) complications such as stenosis and thrombosis are among the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. The association between aPL positivity and AVF thrombosis seems to now be well established. However, whether aPL positivity is associated with other AVF complications, such as maturation failure or stenosis, is not well known. Given the significant impact of AVF failure on patient's prognosis, it is of interest to further investigate this particular point in order to improve prevention, surveillance and treatment, and, ultimately, the patient's outcome. This literature review aims to report the recent literature on aPL-associated native AVF complications.
