Title: Long-Term Echocardiographic Follow-Up After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation to Assess Structural Valve Deterioration and Bioprosthetic Valve Failure.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in aortic stenosis are expanding and the life expectancy of patients following TAVI is increasing. Determining the long-term durability of TAVI valves is therefore important. Rates of long-term (≥5 years) structural valve deterioration (SVD) vary widely and there are currently no comparable data from Australia. The aim herein was to determine the incidence of haemodynamic SVD and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) using recently standardised definitions in a Western Australian cohort after at least 5 years.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at Royal Perth Hospital between January 2009 and January 2015. Of 211 patients, 55 survived ≥5 years and had echocardiographic data available for review. Median time to the echocardiogram was 5.9 years (max 7.8 years); 49% male, mean age 83 years.
RESULTS: Of the 55 survivors who had echocardiograms available ≥5 years after TAVI, four (9%) had moderate haemodynamic SVD and one (2%) had severe SVD and BVF.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest excellent long-term durability of contemporary TAVI valves in an Australian cohort with very low incidence of SVD and BVF. These findings add confidence to the expanding applications of TAVI valves.
