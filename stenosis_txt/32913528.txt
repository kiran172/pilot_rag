Title: The effect of traditional Tibetan guozhuang dance on vascular health in elderly individuals living at high altitudes.

Abstract: To evaluate the effect of dance on vascular-related factors and cerebral hemodynamics in elderly individuals in Qinghai-Tibetan plateau regions (mean altitude ≥2,300 m). Thirty elderly individuals, who practiced traditional Tibetan Guozhuang dance or did not, were enrolled, respectively. Serum PGC-1α, HCY, FSTL-1, VEGF and HIF-1α were measured by ELISA assays. Carotid artery stenosis and plaque, IMT, extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis and cerebral arteriosclerosis were evaluated using CUS and TCD. Body weight, BMI, heart rate, systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure, serum BGS, TC, LDL, HIF-1α, VEGF, and HCY in the dance group were significantly lower than the no-dance group. FSTL-1 levels, SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>/heart rate ratio in the dance group were significantly higher than the no-dance group. Incidence of extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis, carotid stenosis and plaque in the dance group was significantly lower than the no-dance group. IMT was a significant positive correlation between PGC-1α and HCY in the no-dance group. Elderly individuals who regularly practiced Tibetan dance had improved blood vessel functionality and cerebral hemodynamic at high altitudes.
