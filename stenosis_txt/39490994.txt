Title: A proposal of a simplified grading and echo-based staging of aortic valve stenosis to streamline management.

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the relevance of continuity equation based aortic valve area (AVA) calculation as a robust parameter suitable for accurate grading of aortic stenosis (AS) irrespective of flow conditions. Combining the AVA-based grading and echocardiography-based staging, can provide with the most comprehensive clinical assessment of patients with AS and preserved left ventricular systolic function to streamline management decisions.
