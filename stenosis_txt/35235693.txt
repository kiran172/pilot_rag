Title: Characteristics and outcomes of elderly patients undergoing carotid stenting: Experience of a high-volume interventional cardiology center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an attractive option in order to treat carotid artery stenosis. However, its safety in elderly patients is questioned. Aim of this single-center retrospective study was to assess data of elderly patients undergoing CAS, and to compare them with those of the younger (< 75 years).
METHODS: We collected data of 580 consecutive patients undergoing CAS between December 2007 and June 2020 and compared clinical and procedural characteristics as well as in-hospital major adverse events (MACCE) and long-term mortality between patients < 75 years and patients ≥ 75 years old.
RESULTS: There were 272 patients (46.9%) with age ≥ 75 years and 308 patients (53.1%) with age < 75 years. The median follow-up was 48 months (range 2-144). There was no significant difference about in-hospital MACCE between the two groups (4.7% in the older vs. 3.5% in the younger group, p = 0.9), but a higher rate of cerebral hemorrhage occurred in the older group (1.8% vs. = 0.3%, p = 0.07), even if not significant. Long-term mortality was significantly higher in the older group (27.9 vs. 20.1%, p = 0.027). Multivariate predictors of 12-months mortality were neurologic symptoms within 6 months (OR: 4.83; 95% CI: 2.04-11.42; p ≤ 0.001), smoking status (OR: 2.84; 95% CI: 1.17-6.86; p = 0.02) and age ≥ 75 years (OR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.14-6.76; p = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients, CAS can be carried out efficaciously with acceptable procedural risks, if performed by expert operators and after a correct selection by a multidisciplinary team.
