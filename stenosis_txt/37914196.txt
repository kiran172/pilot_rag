Title: Long-Term Evaluation of Revascularization Strategies for Medina 0.1.0 Left Main Bifurcation Lesions: The LM-CROSSOVER Registry.

Abstract: The present study aimed to compare long-term outcomes of patients with Medina 0.1.0 left main (LM) bifurcation lesions treated by crossover stenting (COS) versus accurate ostial stenting (AOS). A total of 229 consecutive eligible patients with Medina 0.1.0 LM bifurcation lesions were enrolled and were stratified according to the stenting techniques. The primary end-point was major cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCE), defined as the combination of all-cause death, target vessel related-myocardial infarction (MI), clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), stroke, or stent thrombosis. COS and AOS were applied to 78 (34%) and 151 (66%) patients, respectively. During a mean of 40.6 ± 21.1 months of follow-up, the rate of MACCE (27.8 vs 12.8%; P=.007) was higher in patients treated with AOS than those treated with the COS technique, mainly driven by more frequent all-cause death (13.9 vs 3.8%, P = .013) and TLR (6.4 vs 15.9%; P = .029). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, AOS strategy was one of the independent predictors of MACCE (odds ratio: 2.166; 95% confidence interval, 1.080-4.340; P = .029). The current study suggests that COS was associated with a better long-term MACCE rate and lower all-cause mortality rate than AOS in patients with Medina 0.1.0 LM bifurcation disease.
