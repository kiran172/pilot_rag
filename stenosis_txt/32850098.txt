Title: Coronary artery occlusion following low-power catheter ablation.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is an unusual but potentially serious complication of catheter ablation procedures. This case describes the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction following low-power ablation in a young patient and highlights the importance of maintaining high index of suspicion following catheter ablation irrespective of the ablation power used. A 22-year-old patient had low-power ablation of the right posteroseptal accessory pathway in the ostium of the coronary sinus on account of persistently symptomatic WPW syndrome with orthodromic re-entrant tachycardia. Two hours after the procedure, she developed moderately severe chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in the inferior leads. Coronary angiography showed 100% stenosis of the right coronary artery just beyond the posterior descending artery. She failed balloon angioplasty and a drug eluting stent was placed in the posterolateral branch of the right coronary artery. The symptoms resolved and follow up echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions with no regional wall motion abnormality. This case demonstrates the occurrence of MI following low-power catheter ablation. Patients should be monitored for this complication irrespective of the ablation power used.
