Title: Vasospastic Angina With ST-Segment Elevation Seen During Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT) Monitoring.

Abstract: A 54-year-old man presented with significant ST-segment elevations noted on both channels displayed on the mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry (MCOT). Pertinent cardiac history was remarkable for syncope and episodes of atypical chest pain. The latter were described as infrequent and not associated with exercise intolerance. His syncopal episodes were described as occurring mostly in the mornings after the use of the restroom. Episodes happen 1 or 2 times a year since 2015. Patient had undergone thorough investigation with no significant findings. An MCOT was prescribed since frequency of symptoms has recently increased. Significant ST-segment elevations were noted. The patient described atypical chest pain and a sensation of presyncope during these recordings. He was urgently admitted, and a coronary angiogram revealed no epicardial luminal stenosis. However, the presence of sluggish coronary flow was suggestive of possible vasospastic angina. No ST-segment changes were noted during his coronary angiogram. The remarkable element portrayed by this case hinges in showing the unique utility of MCOT, as the most uncharacteristic diagnostic tool, in identifying transient ST-segment elevations that finally led to the diagnosis.
