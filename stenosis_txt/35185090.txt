Title: A Propensity Score-Matched Comparison of Midterm Outcomes Between Drug-Coated Balloons and Drug-Eluting Stents for Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome.

Abstract: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, lesion-based study to examine the safety and efficacy of drug-coated balloons (DCBs) for de novo coronary stenosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) by comparing them with those of drug-eluting stents (DESs).A total of 309 consecutive lesions in patients with ACS who were successfully treated by emergent procedures using either a DCB (n = 107) or a DES between January 2016 and December 2019 were included in the study. The primary endpoint was the incidence of target lesion failure (TLF), defined as cardiac death without mortality due to ACS, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and any target lesion revascularization, including acute occlusion, after DCB use and definite stent thrombosis after DES placement. A propensity score-matched analysis was used to adjust the 36 baseline variables. Retrospective investigations were conducted in January 2021.Baseline adjustment yielded 91 lesions in each group, with a mean balloon size of 3.02 ± 0.22 mm and a mean length of 20.9 ± 6.2 mm in the DCB group. The frequency of TLF in the DCB group (9.9% during the mean observational interval of 671 ± 508 days) was not significantly different from that in the DES group (13.2% during a period of 626 ± 543 days, P = 0.467). The cumulative TLF-free ratio in the DCB group was not significantly different from that in the DES group (P = 0.475, log-rank test).The present propensity score-matched comparison showed statistically equivalent midterm clinical outcomes after DCB use to those of DES placement for de novo lesions in patients with ACS treated by emergent procedures.
