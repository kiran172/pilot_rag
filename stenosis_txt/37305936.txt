Title: [The efficacy and safety analysis of cervical and abdominal double single-port minimally invasive esophagectomy].

Abstract: Objective: To summarize the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive esophagectomy through cervical and abdominal double single-port. Methods: A total of 28 patients who underwent cervical and abdominal double single-port minimally invasive radical resection of esophageal cancer from January 2021 to October 2022 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University were retrospectively collected, including 18 males and 10 females, aged 58-80 (72±4) years. All patients were placed in the supine position, the single port was operated through the cervical mediastinum first, then the single port was operated through the abdominal cavity, and finally the neck was anastomosed. The operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative ambulation time, postoperative drainage tube removal time, postoperative complications, postoperative pathological examination results, postoperative discharge time of patients were recorded and followed. Results: In the included 28 patients, there were twenty-six patients successfully completed the cervical and abdominal double single-port minimally invasive radical resection of esophageal cancer, and two patients were transferred to the right thoracoscopic surgery due to oozing of blood and unclear visual field, without conversion to laparotomy or enlargement of the incision occurred. The operation time was 125 to 215 (152±32) minutes, including 43 to 100 (56±15) minutes in the mediastinum and 35 to 63 (40±5) minutes in the abdominal cavity. Intra-operative blood loss was 55-100 (45±20) ml. There were 8 to 14 (11±3) lymph nodes dissected in the mediastinum and 7 to 15 (9±3) lymph nodes dissected in the abdominal cavity. Twenty-eight patients were active in bed 1 to 2 days after surgery. The left cervical drainage tube was removed 2 days after surgery. There was no anastomotic fistula, anastomotic stenosis, pulmonary infection, chylothorax and stomach emptying disorder in the whole group. Pleural effusion occurred in 4 cases, all of them had pleural damage during the operation, and were cured after postoperative puncture and drainage; two cases had hoarseness and one case had cough after eating, all patients were discharged from hospital after eating liquid. Postoperative hospital median stay was [ M(Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>)] 7(6, 9) d. The postoperative pathological examination results of all patients were squamous cell carcinoma, and the postoperative pathological stage was pT1-3N0-1M0. The median postoperative follow-up was 25 (5, 35) months, and no patients had complications, recurrence, metastasis or death during the follow-up period. Conclusion: The cervical and abdominal double single-hole minimally invasive radical resection of esophageal cancer is safe and feasible, with good short-term efficacy, which provide an opportunity for radical surgery for patients with advanced age, poor cardiopulmonary function or insufficient thoracic conditions.
