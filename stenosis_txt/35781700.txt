Title: Preliminary study of carotid variables under ultrasound analysis as predictors for the risk of coronary arterial atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid atherosclerosis by ultrasound scanning can be considered as an ideal window to reflect systemic artery atherosclerosis, which has aroused wide concern for predicting the severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis clinically. Ultrasound radio frequency (RF) data technology has enabled us to evaluate the carotid structure and elastic function precisely, for predicting the severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent coronary angiography and were assigned to four groups according to whether atherosclerotic plaque was found or not and it caused stenosis. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) and arterial stiffness were investigated by quality intima-media thickness (QIMT) and quality arterial stiffness (QAS) techniques during ultrasound scanning. Univariable and multivariable modeling were used to investigate correlations of carotid parameters to coronary artery atherosclerosis. Receive operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate diagnostic performance of these ultrasound variables.
RESULTS: Carotid IMT and stiffness variables pulse wave velocity (PWV), α, β and compliance coefficient (CC) were statistically different between every two-group's comparisons. IMT correlated with stiffness variables significantly with r = 0.70, 0.77, 0.63, and -0.39, respectively. All variables correlated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis with the odd ratio (OR) of 1.73, 1.67, 1.19, 1.23, and 0.56 accordingly as IMT, PWV, α, β and CC were concerned. The AUC of IMT, PWV, α, β and CC were 0.9257, 0.8910, 0.8016, 0.9383, 0.8581 with correctly classified rate of 88.16%, 83.77%, 78.07%, 86.84%, and 81.58%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery IMT and stiffness variable PWV, α, β and CC presented favorable predicting and differentiating values for patients with coronary atherosclerosis of different severity.
