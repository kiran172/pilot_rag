Title: Outcomes of Gastric Conduit in Corrosive Esophageal Stricture: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gastric conduit has emerged as the preferred treatment option for both esophageal bypass and replacement for corrosive stricture of the esophagus. There is a lack of consensus and a dearth of published literature regarding the short- and long-term complications of using a gastric conduit. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the outcomes, morbidity, and complications associated with it.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar (January 1960 to May 2020) were systematically searched for all studies reporting short- and/or long-term outcomes and complications following the use of a gastric conduit for corrosive esophageal stricture.
RESULTS: Seven observational studies involving 489 patients (53.2% males, mean age ranging from 22.1 to 41 years) who had ingested a corrosive substance (acid in 74.8%, alkali in 20.7%, and unknown in the rest) were analyzed. Gastric pull-up was performed in 56.03% (274/489) of patients. Median blood loss in the procedure was 187.5 ml with a mean operative duration of 298.75 ± 55.73 min. The overall pooled prevalence rate of anastomotic leak was 14.4% [95% CI (6.2-24.0); p &lt; 0.05, I2 = 67.38], and anastomotic stricture was 27.2% [95% CI (13-42.8); p &lt; 0.001, I2 = 80.11]. Recurrent dysphagia according to pooled prevalence estimates occurred in 14.4% patients [95% CI (5.4-25.1); p &lt; 0.05, I2 = 69.1] and 90-day mortality in 4.8% patients [95% CI (1.5-9.1%); I2 = 31.1, p = 0.202]. The dreaded complication of conduit necrosis had a pooled prevalence of 1.3% [95% CI (0.1-3.4%); I2 = 0, p = 0.734].
CONCLUSION: The stomach can be safely used as the conduit of choice in corrosive strictures with an acceptable rate of complications, postoperative morbidity, and mortality.
