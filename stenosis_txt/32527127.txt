Title: Prolonged endotracheal intubation: a feasible option for tracheomalacia after retrosternal goitre surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheomalacia may be caused by long-standing compression of retrosternal goitre because of destruction of support of tracheal cartilages. Life-threatening airway collapses may occur after surgical removal of goitre. However, available literature on management methods of tracheomalacia is sparse. Our study highlights prolonged endotracheal intubation as a feasible treatment method.
METHODS: This retrospective study analysed 106 thyroidectomies for retrosternal goitre performed between 1994 and 2019. We recorded each patient's clinical profile. Severe tracheomalacia was confirmed through the following: soft and floppy trachea on intra-operative palpation and the collapse of cross-sectional tracheal area measured in computed tomography (CT) images by >80%. We assessed the extent of airway stenosis of these cases. All severe cases were treated by prolonged endotracheal intubation.
RESULTS: Surgical treatment was successfully performed in all 106 retrosternal goitre patients with no mortality. Seventeen severe tracheomalacia cases were confirmed. The extent of airway stenosis was assessed: the minimal tracheal diameter of compressed trachea was 0.2-0.4 [mean 0.31, standard deviation (SD) 0.06] cm, and the narrow tracheal length was 4-6.7 (mean 5.1, SD 0.6) cm. These patients underwent endotracheal intubation for 17-47 h after surgery. All patients were transferred to the general ward after extubation and successfully discharged. There were no cases of tracheal stenosis on follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Tracheomalacia is a rare but serious complication of retrosternal goitre surgery. Based on our experience, prolonged endotracheal intubation is a feasible treatment for tracheomalacia after retrosternal goitre surgery.
