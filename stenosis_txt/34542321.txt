Title: Short Communication: Plasma Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 and Subclinical Coronary Artery Disease in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study.

Abstract: Chronic inflammation, including among people with HIV (PWH), elevates immune cell expression of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3); however, low plasma LAG3 predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in the general population. The associations among LAG3 plasma levels, subclinical atherosclerosis, inflammation, and HIV infection have not been well described. We measured plasma LAG3 in 704 men with and without HIV from the multicenter AIDS cohort study, who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography. HIV serostatus was not independently associated with LAG3 after adjustment for sociodemographic and CVD risk factors. Current smoking status and African American race were associated with lower LAG3, and age and sTNFÎ±RI concentration were associated with greater LAG3. LAG3 was not associated with coronary artery stenosis. Thus, no difference was found in plasma LAG3 concentration by HIV serostatus, and no association between LAG3 and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in men with and without HIV was observed.
