Title: Point-of-care Ultrasound in the Evaluation of Mitral Valve Regurgitation and Mitral Annular Calcification.

Abstract: CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was performed and demonstrated a hyperechoic structure on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Admission to cardiology and echocardiogram revealed moderately decreased mobility of the posterior leaflet, mitral annular calcification, and severe mitral regurgitation.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight the role of POCUS in identifying mitral valve pathology in the ED, ultimately leading to appropriate disposition and management. Mitral annular calcification can lead to significant manifestations including mitral stenosis or regurgitation, and advanced cases have been associated with an increased risk of infective endocarditis, thrombosis, and arrhythmia.
