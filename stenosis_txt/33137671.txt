Title: Congenital urethrocele in children. A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Congenital urethrocele is a rare disease in children. The diagnosis is often easy but the management remain difficult due to the risk of urethral stenosis form.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 19-month-old child presenting with a penoscrotal mass. Cystourethroscopy confirmed the diagnosis of an urethrocele of the anterior urethra. Urethrocele repair was performed with good results. We propose to discuss clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic characteristics of congenital urethrocele in children.
CONCLUSION: An early, precise diagnosis and awareness of the anterior urethral diverticulum in boys with obstructive symptoms can reduce incidence of advanced uropathies.
