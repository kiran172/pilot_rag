Title: Left Main Coronary Artery Ostial Stenosis in a Pediatric Patient With Sudden Cardiac Arrest.

Abstract: Pediatric resuscitated sudden cardiac arrest may result from diverse conditions and, therefore, warrants a comprehensive work-up. Although rare, coronary artery abnormalities must be ruled out in these patients. We describe a case with congenital left main coronary artery ostial stenosis diagnosed using advanced imaging techniques. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
