Title: Open paediatric laryngotracheal reconstruction: a five-year experience at a tertiary referral centre.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Laryngotracheal reconstruction with costal cartilage graft is a cornerstone procedure in treatment of multiple paediatric airway pathologies. The current study aimed to report on the experience of laryngotracheal reconstruction and document post-operative outcomes and complications.
METHOD: Records of laryngotracheal reconstruction procedures performed between 2016 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Primary indication, clinical data, decannulation rate, voice assessment, need for revision surgery and possible complications were analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were treated with laryngotracheal reconstruction. Subglottic stenosis formed the largest percentage of cases followed by congenital glottic web (20 and 14 patients, respectively). Three patients (7.3 per cent) underwent single stage surgery, and the remaining cases had a double stage procedure. Revision laryngotracheal reconstruction was needed in a single case, and 38 out of 39 tracheostomised patients were successfully decannulated.
CONCLUSION: Favourable outcomes were reported with costal cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction as a definitive treatment for a large range of paediatric airway problems.
