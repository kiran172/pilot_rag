Title: Rapid Carotid Screening by Duplex: A Prospective Single Centre Assessment.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: A novel carotid quick scan (CQS) protocol was developed to rapidly screen for carotid atherosclerosis greater than 50% stenosis in a vascular outpatient setting. This study assessed accuracy and time saved.
MATERIAL & METHODS: The CQS was developed by consensus agreement between vascular surgeons and accredited clinical vascular scientists through a modified Delphi technique. The protocol comprised a rapid B-mode then colour flow transverse sweep of the common and internal carotid arteries, with internal carotid artery velocity assessment. One hundred outpatients attending with peripheral artery disease or abdominal aortic aneurysm were recruited. CQS sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was assessed against a conventional full carotid duplex study, performed to UK and ESVS guidelines.
RESULTS: Twenty four percent of patients (n = 100) had &gt;50% carotid NASCET stenosis. CQS achieved an excellent accuracy of 96.5% in detecting &gt;50% stenosis when compared to full duplex; Cohen's ƙ = .88, (95%CI .79-.97; P &lt; .001), sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 97.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) 88.9% and negative predictive value (NPV) 98.2%. Median (IQR) time to complete the CQS was 13 sec (±12) per side, compared to 151 sec (±78) per side for the full carotid duplex. In the presence of &gt;50% carotid disease, median CQS time was 25 sec (±31) per side compared to 214 (±104) by full scan.
CONCLUSION: CQS as a carotid screening tool is rapid, accurate and acceptable to the population and workforce. It would be simple to roll out in all vascular laboratories to reduce the time and cost burden of excluding significant carotid disease in any group.
