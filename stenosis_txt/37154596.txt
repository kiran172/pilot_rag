Title: Ureterocalicostomy Using Native Ureter in an Allograft Kidney: A Case Report.

Abstract: Ureteral obstruction is the most common complication of renal transplant. It is managed through minimal invasive procedures or open surgeries. Herein, we report the procedure and clinical outcomes of a case of ureterocalicostomy with lower pole nephrectomy in a patient with extensive ureteral stricture after renal transplant. Based on our search, there are 4 cases of ureterocalicostomy in allograft kidney in the literature, and only 1 of these included the application of partial nephrectomy. We offer this rarely applied option for those cases with extensive allograft ureteral stricture and very small, contracted, and intrarenal pelvis.
