Title: Predictors of coronary tortuosity in patients with chronic coronary syndrome.

Abstract: Aim    Coronary artery tortuosity is a common coronary angiographic finding. This tortuosity can cause myocardial ischemia even in the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis. Our aim was to compare the demographic, clinical and echocardiographic features of patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) and with and without coronary artery tortuosity.Material and methods    361 patients who underwent elective coronary angiography (CAG) due to CCS were included in the study. These patients divided into two groups, those with coronary tortuosity (Group 1) and those without (Group 2). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors associated with coronary artery tortuosity.Results    The mean age of the 361 CCS patients (44 % female; 56 % male) was 56.7±11.5 years. In the univariable regression analysis, age, female sex, hypertension (HT), PR interval, QTc interval, ST / T segment changes, left ventricle diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), left ventricle hypertrophia (LVH) were identified as predictors of coronary tortuosity. In the multivariable regression analysis, age (OR: 1.059; 95 %CI: 1.032-1.087, p&lt;0.001) and hypertension (OR: 0.484; 95 %CI: 0.278-0.843, p=0.01) were identified as independent predictors of coronary tortuosity.Conclusion    Coronary artery tortuosity is an angiographic finding that develops as a result of adaptive mechanisms in the heart and can cause myocardial ischemia. Predictors of coronary artery tortuosity in patients with CCS were long PR and QTc intervals, ST / T segment changes, LVH, LVDD, advanced age, and female gender. Evaluation of these demographic, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data may help clinicans to anticipate coronary artery tortuosity in patients with CCS and to be precautious for PCI.
