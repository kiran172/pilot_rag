Title: Managing Myocardial Bridge and Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction in an Adolescent With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: We report a case of symptomatic myocardial bridge in an adolescent with dynamic right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and history of congenital pulmonary valve stenosis as well as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Definitive treatment was surgical infundibular myectomy and coronary unroofing, resulting in improvement in right ventricular outflow tract gradient and ischemic symptoms.
