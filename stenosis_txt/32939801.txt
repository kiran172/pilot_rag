Title: Occlusion following the deployment of MANTA VCD after TAVR.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We present a complication following the deployment of the MANTA vascular closure device (VCD) following a transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure which resulted in occlusion of the common femoral artery.
AIMS: To address possible complications associated with MANTA VCD.
RESULTS: This was addressed by ballooning the site from the contralateral side which re-established flow.
CONCLUSION: We believe this is the first report to address this kind of complication and may prove useful as more of the MANTA devices are being used in multiple procedures.
