Title: In Vitro Model for the Evaluation of Innovative Transcatheter Debridement Device (TDD): Pericardium-Based Scaffold and Stem Cells to Reproduce Calcificated Valves.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis has become the most common valvular disease in elderly patients. Several treatments are available such as surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve implantation. To date, however, there is a need to discover alternative treatments that can delay the disease progression and, therefore, the implant of a prosthetic valve. In this regard, a decalcification procedure based on the use of ultrasonic waves could represent an innovative solution in transcatheter cardiovascular therapies. In this article, we describe an innovative transcatheter debridement device (TDD) that uses low-intensity ultrasound shock waves for calcium ablation from the native aortic valve and bioprosthetic valve. Mesenchymal stem cells were seeded onto pericardium-based scaffolds and committed into an osteogenic phenotype. After treatment with TDD, cell proliferation was analyzed, as well as lactate dehydrogenase release and cell morphology. The release of calcium and inflammation events were detected. The results confirmed that the TDD was able to induce a safe decalcification without any adverse inflammatory events.
