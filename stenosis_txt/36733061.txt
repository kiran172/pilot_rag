Title: [A Case of Rapidly Progressing Colon NEC Treated with Laparoscopic Colectomy and Completely Cured].

Abstract: We experienced a case of rapidly progressing transverse colon NEC that was treated with laparoscopic right hemispherectomy. A 72-year-old man underwent a follow-up lower gastrointestinal endoscopy at another hospital after a polyp resection. The examination showed a surrounding mass with stenosis of the intestinal tract of the transverse colon. A biopsy led to a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed of the transverse colon tumor. He was discharged on postoperative day 13 without complications, and NEC was diagnosed. We decided to administer postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, starting with cisplatin plus etoposide. Four courses of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were completed. Approximately 1 year has passed since the operation, and progress has been observed in the outpatient department without recurrence.
