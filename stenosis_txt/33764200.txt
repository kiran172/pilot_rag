Title: Montgomery T-Tube Insertion Under ECMO in a Patient With Complete Subglottic Stenosis and Severe Lower Tracheal Collapse.

Abstract: The treatment of complete subglottic stenosis (SGS) remains a challenge due to anatomic and technological limitations. Placement of the Montgomery T-tube is an effective treatment option. For complete SGS patient combined with lower trachea collapse, the ventilation management during the T-tube insertion process is more complicated. Here, we report a case with complete SGS combined with severe lower trachea collapse, which was successfully managed with T-tube insertion under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
