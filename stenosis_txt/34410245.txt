Title: Experience of transcatheter device closure of atrial septal defect in a tertiary care institute.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To share institutional experience of transcatheter device closure of secundum atrial septal defect in children and adults.
METHODS: The descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Institute of Cardiology, Multan, Pakistan, from February 2011 to September 2019, and comprised patients with moderate to large secundum atrial septal defect without severe pulmonary hypertension. All procedures were performed under general anaesthesia and trans-oesophageal echo guidance. Success and safety of procedure were evaluated. Data was analysed using SPSS 16.
RESULTS: Of the 75 patients, 26(34.6%) were males and 49(65.3%) were females. The overall mean age was 25±1.53 years (range: 4 -54 years). Mean defect was 20.38±0.58mm (range: 9-32mm). Large defects >25mm were 17(22.7%). Significant pulmonary stenosis was observed in 3(4%) patients and valvuloplasty was performed. Device size was selected on the basis of trans-oesophageal echo measurement +4-5mm. Balloon sizing was performed in only 3(4%) patients. Amplatzer septal occluder was used in 60(80%) patients. Balloon-assisted technique was used in 9(12%) patients. All the procedures were successful except 2(2.7%) where device was embolised and retrieved by surgery. Transient arrhythmias were observed in 6(8%) patients and small pericardial effusion in 1(1.3%) patient who was managed conservatively. There was no procedure-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: Transcatheter closure of moderate to large secundum atrial septal defect in children and adults was found to be a safe procedure.
