Title: Association Between Pulmonary Hypertension and Its Effect on 30-Day Mortality, Readmission, and Cost After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Multicenter Study.

Abstract: Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is commonly seen in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to improve PH, however, its impact on clinical outcomes and cost remains unclear. Methods We did a multicenter, retrospective analysis of patients undergoing TAVR in our system between December 2012 to November 2020. The initial sample size was 1356. We excluded patients with prior history of heart failure, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less, and patients who had active symptoms of heart failure within two weeks of the procedure. Patients were divided into four groups based on their pulmonary pressures, using right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) as a surrogate for PH. Groups included patients with normal pulmonary pressures (<35mmHg), mild (35-45mmHg) moderate (46-60mmHg), and severe PH (>60mmHg). Primary outcomes included 30-day mortality and readmission. Secondary outcomes included length of ICU stay and cost of admission. We used Chi-square and T-tests for demographic analysis of categorical continuous variables respectively. Adjusted regression was used for the reliability of correlation between variables. Multivariate analysis was used for final outcomes. Results Final sample size was 474. Average age was 78.9 years (SD: 8.2, 53% Male). Thirty-one percent (n=150) had normal pulmonary pressures, 33% (n=156) had mild PH, 25% (n=122) had moderate and 10% (n=46) had severe PH. Patients with history of hypertension (p-value<0.001), diabetes (p-value<0.001), chronic lung disease (p-value=0.006) and those on supplemental oxygen (p-value=0.046), had significantly higher proportion of patients with moderate and severe PH. We found significantly higher odds of 30-day mortality in patients with severe PH (OR: 6.77, CI: 1.09-41.98: p-value 0.04) compared with normal or mild PH. There was no significant difference in 30-day readmission (p-value=0.859) between the four groups. Cost did not change with severity of PH (Avg: $261,075: p-value=0.810). Patients with severe PH spent a significantly higher number of hours in ICU, compared with the other three groups (Mean: 18.2, p=value <0.001). Conclusions Severe pulmonary hypertension significantly increased the odds of 30-day mortality and ICU stay in TAVR patients. We did not see any significant difference in 30-day readmission and cost of admission, based on PH severity.
