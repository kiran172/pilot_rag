Title: Left ventricular hypertrophy as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIMS: This study aimed to clarify the relationship between cardiovascular prognosis and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and to investigate the relationship between cardiac sympathetic nerve (CSN) function and these factors using 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this single-centre, retrospective observational study, 349 patients who underwent TAVR at our institution between July 2017 and May 2020 were divided into two groups: those with severe LVH pre-operatively [severe LVH (+) group] and those without LVH pre-operatively [severe LVH (-) group]. The rates of freedom from cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization) were compared. The relationship between changes in left ventricular mass index (LVMi) and changes in delay heart-mediastinum ratio (H/M) from before TAVR to 6 months after TAVR was also investigated. The event-free rate was significantly lower in the severe LVH (+) group (87.1% vs. 96.0%, log-rank P = 0.021). The severe LVH (+) group exhibited a significantly lower delay H/M value, scored by 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy, than the severe LVH (-) group (2.33 [1.92-2.67] vs. 2.67 [2.17-3.68], respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the event-free rate of post-operative cardiovascular events was lower among patients with a delay H/M value &lt; 2.50 than that among other patients (87.7% vs. 97.2%, log-rank P = 0.012). LVMi was significantly higher (115 [99-130] vs. 90 [78-111] g/m2 , P &lt; 0.001) and delay H/M value was significantly lower (2.53 [1.98-2.83] vs. 2.71 [2.25-3.19], P = 0.025) in the severe LVH (+) group than in the severe LVH (-) group at 6 months after TAVR. Patients with improved LVH at 6 months after TAVR also had increased delay H/M (from 2.51 [2.01-2.81] to 2.67 [2.26-3.02], P &lt; 0.001), whereas those without improved LVH had no significant change in delay H/M (from 2.64 [2.23-3.06] to 2.53 [1.97-3.00], P = 0.829).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe LVH before TAVR is a prognostic factor for poor post-operative cardiovascular outcomes. LVH associated with aortic stenosis and CSN function are correlated, suggesting their involvement in LVH prognosis.
