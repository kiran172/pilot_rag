Title: PCSK9 and HS-CRP Predict Progression of Aortic Stenosis in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: It is essential to study the factors associated with the evolution of aortic stenosis progression (ASP) to develop therapies that could reduce it. We studied 283 patients 6 months after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ASP was defined as an increase in the maximum aortic velocity of at least 0.5 m/s between the echocardiogram performed during ACS hospitalization and the last one recorded in the electronic medical registry. The median follow-up was 72.4 months. Twenty patients (7%) had ASP. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed showing that PCSK9 plasma levels (OR, 0.668 CI (0.457-0.977); p = 0.038), HS-CRP (OR, 1.034 CI (1.005-1.063); p = 0.022), the presence of dyslipidemia (OR, 4.622 CI (1.285-16.618); p = 0.019), the history of PAD (OR, 9.453 CI (1.703-52.452); p = 0.010), and GFR (OR, 0.962 CI (0.939-0.986); p = 0.002) were independent predicting factors of ASP. In patients with ischemic heart disease, low plasma levels of PCSK9 and elevated levels of HS-CRP are independent predictors of ASP.
