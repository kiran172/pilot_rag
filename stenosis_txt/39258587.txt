Title: Multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of PASSEO-LUX DCB® drug coated balloon compared to plain balloon angioplasty of arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis: Two-years results.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare primary patency after angioplasty with drug-coated balloon (DCB)-Passeo-18Lux, BIOTRONIK versus uncoated balloon in dysfunctional peripheral vascular access (PVA) for hemodialysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 133 patients from four hospitals were randomized to receive DCB or plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) after satisfactory treatment (residual stenosis <30%) with high pressure balloon (HPB). The primary endpoint was clinical patency of PVA 2 years after angioplasty. Secondary endpoints included the relationship between the location of stenosis and patency and also, other covariates. Mortality at 2 years was compared between both groups.
RESULTS: Patency measured in days after angioplasty was higher in fistulae dilated with DCB than HPB. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed the next percent of success (free time restenosis) after DCB versus POBA at 6 months-77.1% versus 58.2% (160.41-143.72 days until restenosis), 12 months-51.4% versus 44.3% (274.1-237.23), 18 months-38.6% versus 38% (350.74-305.18), and 24 months-37.1% versus 30.4% (419.04-369.1). At 6 months, this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.018), but not at 12 (p = 0.225), 18 (p = 0.471), or 24 months (p = 0.236). Mortality was similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: DCB angioplasty resulted in superior target lesion primary patency (TLPP)-free survival at 6 months of follow-up. No significant improvements in TLPP-free survival long term were observed. Mortality observed at 1 and 2 years was similar in DCB and POBA: there was no significant difference, and a safety study demonstrated no difference between the two groups (complications and mortality): DCB is safe to use in stenosis treatment in patients who are PVA carriers.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level Ia, therapeutic study, RCT. EBM ratings will be based on a scale of 1-5.
