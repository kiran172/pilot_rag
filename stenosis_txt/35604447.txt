Title: Infective Endocarditis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: Infective endocarditis (IE) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a rare but potentially fatal event. In this systematic review, we searched PubMed and Embase for large TAVI studies and registries to identify the incidence, presentation, microbiology, risk factors, and outcomes of IE in this population. After application of the selection criteria and quality assessment, 8 studies representing 255,310 TAVR cases and 4218 cases of IE qualified for this review. IE following TAVI is uncommon with an incidence of 0.87 to 1.7 events per 100 person-years. Most events occur in the first year following valve implantation. Staphylococcus , Enterococcus , and Streptococcus species are the most common pathogens. Risk factors include age, sex, concomitant comorbidities, and procedural factors. Outcomes are dismal, and surgical intervention is rare in this population.
