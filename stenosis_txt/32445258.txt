Title: Pulmonary valve replacement after tetralogy of Fallot repair in a patient with immune thrombocytopenia.

Abstract: Marked thrombocytopenia causes significant bleeding in cardiovascular surgery. Herein, we describe the case of a 47-year-old woman with immune thrombocytopenia who underwent successful pulmonary valve replacement for pulmonary valve regurgitation and stenosis after complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Her platelet count decreased significantly to less than 5 × 109 /L on postoperative day 3, thus multiple platelet transfusions were given. Pulse steroid therapy with dexamethasone was subsequently administered systemically for 4 days. After the treatment, her platelet count started to recover. There were no significant postoperative bleeding events, and red blood cell transfusion was not required. Other than the platelet event, the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 15.
