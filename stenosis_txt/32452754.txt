Title: Agreement between three-dimensional planimetry and mitral navigation method in the assessment of mitral valve area in rheumatic severe mitral stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Rheumatic heart disease predisposes to structural changes in the mitral valve including commissural fusion and calcification with subsequent narrowing of the mitral valve orifice resulting in rheumatic mitral stenosis (RMS). To define the best therapeutic strategy, an accurate measurement of mitral valve area (MVA) for RMS is of paramount importance. The propose of the present study was to assess the agreement between the mitral navigation method (MVN) and three-dimensional (3D) planimetry in the assessment of MVA in patients with RMS.
METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with a different degree of mitral stenosis with the standard transthoracic echocardiography methods such as the pressure half time and planimetry underwent 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) examination. 3D TEE zoom mitral valve planimetry was measured in the diastolic frame during the mitral valve's largest opening. By using MVN software of the Philips Q-Lab, MVA was measured at its maximum diastolic opening. Both 3D planimetry (3DPL) and MVN were measured at the mid diastole during the mitral valve's largest opening.
RESULTS: In this retrospective analysis, we examined consecutive 37 RMS patients (mean age 51.1 ± 11.6 years, 31 patients were female). MVA measured by the MVN method was found to be highly correlated with the 3D MVA measured by 3DPL (r = 0.937, p&lt;.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, we showed that the MVN method may be additionally used in detecting the severity of RMS.
