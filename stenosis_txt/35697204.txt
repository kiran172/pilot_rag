Title: A finger in every pie - The versatility of chemokines.

Abstract: In this issue of Biomedical Journal we encounter the chemokine superfamily and its clinical potential. The time course from 56 days zero COVID-19 to a resurgence in cases is presented, as well as a possible solution to overcome rejection in vascularized composite allotransplantation. We are shown the opportunity deep learning (DL) offers in the case of tracking single cells and particles, and also use of DL to bring all hands on deck to counter the current challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. This issue contains articles about the effect of low energy shock waves in cystitis; the negative effect of high fructose on aortic valve stenosis; a study about the outcome of fecal microbiota transplantation in case of refractory Clostridioides difficile infection; a novel long non-coding RNA that could serve in treating triple-negative breast cancer; the benefits of acupressure in patients with restless leg syndrome; and Filamin A mutations in abnormal neuronal migration development. Finally, a link between jaw surgery and the psychological impact on the patient is explored; a method presented that allows identification of cervical characteristics associated with difficult embryo transfer; and a letter suggesting new parameters to evaluate the use of bone-substitute augmentation in the treatment of osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures.
