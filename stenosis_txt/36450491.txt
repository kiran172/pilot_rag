Title: [A case of recurrent cerebral infarction in an adult patient with false Taussig-Bing anomaly].

Abstract: The case was a 53-year-old woman. At birth, she was diagnosed with a false Taussig-Bing anomaly with pulmonary artery stenosis and a single ventricle. However, no cardiac surgery was performed, and conservative treatment was continued by a cardiovascular surgeon even after adulthood. Because of secondary polycythemia and a history of multiple cerebral infarctions, she took anti-platelet drugs and anti-coagulants. However, she was admitted with the diagnosis of cerebral infarction for the fourth time. It was considered that the patient was at high risk of paradoxical cerebral embolism due to cardiac malformation with cyanotic congenital heart disease accompanied by coagulation abnormalities. Considering the pathophysiology, we decided to use aspirin in combination with warfarin.
