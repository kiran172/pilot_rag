Title: Non-traditional lipid parameters as potential predictors of carotid plaque vulnerability and stenosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Lipid abnormalities are important risk factors in patients with large atherosclerotic strokes. Recent studies have shown that non-traditional lipid parameters are crucial to the development of atherosclerosis and are closely related to the clinical outcome of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between non-traditional lipid parameters and carotid plaque stability and stenosis degree in patients with large atherosclerotic stroke.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 336 patients with AIS. All patients were divided into the non-plaque group, stable plaque group, and vulnerable plaque group according to ultrasound examination. At the same time, the patients were divided into non-stenosis, mild stenosis, moderate stenosis, and severe stenosis groups according to the degree of stenosis. Non-traditional lipid parameters, including residual lipoprotein cholesterol (RLP-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), non-HDL-C to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (non-HDL-C/HDL-C), triglyceride to HDL-C ratio (TG/HDL-C), Castelli's risk index (CRI), and the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between the non-traditional lipid parameters and carotid plaque vulnerability. Spearman linear correlation analysis was used to test the correlation between variables and the degree of carotid plaque stenosis.
RESULTS: This study population included 336 patients with AIS, of whom 294 had a carotid plaque. Multivariate logistic regression model showed that RLP-C (OR, 3.361; 95%CI, 1.311-8.617), non-HDL-C/HDL-C (OR, 1.699; 95%CI, 1.279-2.258), non-HDL-C (OR, 1.704; 95%CI, 1.143-2.540), CRI-I (OR, 1.573; 95%CI, 1.196-2.068), and CRI-II (OR, 2.022; 95%CI, 1.369-2.985) were independent risk factors for carotid plaque vulnerability. In addition, Spearman correlation analysis showed that the values of RLP-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, CRI-I, CRI-II, and AIP on admission were positively correlated with the degree of carotid plaque stenosis (all P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that non-traditional lipid parameters (LP-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, CRI-I, and CRI-II) were potential predictors of carotid plaque vulnerability in patients with AIS. However, no significant correlation was observed between TG/HDL-C and AIP. RLP-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, CRI-I, CRI-II, and AIP were closely related to the degree of carotid plaque stenosis. Non-traditional lipid parameters can be used as novel biomarkers of carotid plaque vulnerability and stenosis.
