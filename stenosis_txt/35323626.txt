Title: Idiopathic Ventricular Arrhythmias Originating from Different Portions of the Coronary Venous System: Prevalence, Electrocardiographic Characteristics, Catheter Ablation, and Complications.

Abstract: (1) Background: To determine the prevalence, electrocardiographic characteristics, mapping, and ablation of IVAs arising from the CVS. (2) Methods: Detailed activation and pace mapping of the CVS IVAs was performed before attempted radiofrequency ablation (RFCA). (3) Results: The IVAs originating from the vicinity of the CVS represented approximately 5.27% (164/3113) of all IVAs; 94.51% (155/164) cases were accessed at the earliest identified site and 83.54% (137/164) IVAs were successfully ablated. The main coronary vein group had a relatively short procedure time, short fluoroscopy time, fewer radiofrequency lesions prior to success, and less Swartz sheath support. IVAs originating from the CVS had distinct ECG characteristics: Rs, RS or rS (with s or S) wave in lead V1 indicate the Vas arising from the proximal portion of the anterior interventricular vein (AIV) and summit-CV; Rs (with s or S) wave in leads V5−V6 indicate the Vas arising from the adjacent regions of the distal great cardiac vein 1 (DGCV1); positive wave (R, Rs or r) In lead I indicate the VAs ori”inat’ng from Summit-CV and posterior wall subgroup (including middle cardiac vein [MCV], posterior lateral vein [PLV], coronary sinus [CS]). Compared with the IVAs originating from the endocardial mitral annulus, a PdW > 45 ms, an IDT > 74 ms, and an MDI > 0.50 indicate a CVS origin of the IVAs. The common peri-procedure complications were CV dissection (6.45%, 10/155), CV rupture (1.29%, 2/155), coronary artery spasm (1.29%, 2/155), coronary artery stenosis (0.65%, 1/155), pericardial effusion (0.65%, 1/155) and tamponade (1.29%, 2/155). Stenosis of coronary arteries was not observed at the adjacent ablation site in the CVS during follow-up. (4) Conclusions: vAs arising from the CVS are not a rare phenomenon. Several ECG and procedure characteristics could help regionalize, map, and ablate the origin of IVAs from different portions of the CVS. RFCA within the CVS was relatively effective and safe.
