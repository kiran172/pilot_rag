Title: Long- term outcomes of congenital tracheal stenosis after slide tracheoplasty.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Long-term outcomes of slide tracheoplasty in patients with congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) have rarely been reported. This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of CTS after slide tracheoplasty.
METHODS: The medical records of 33 patients who underwent slide tracheoplasty for CTS at our institution between January 2005 and July 2018, with a follow-up duration > 5 years, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' characteristics, perioperative condition, operative management, postoperative course, tracheal stenosis rates and growth data, were collected from medical records.
RESULTS: The median operative age, minimum tracheal diameter, length of stenosis, duration of hospital stays, and follow-up duration were 8 months, 2.4 mm, 35 mm, 39 days, and 90 months, respectively. One patient died of bleeding in the right lung at 126 months postoperatively. Among the 10 patients requiring postoperative tracheostomy, seven were successfully decannulated at a median of 65 months postoperatively. Tracheal stenosis rates improved postoperatively and were subsequently maintained. Growth impairment and psychomotor delay were observed in 9 and 16 patients, respectively with significant differences found only in cases with genetic abnormalities and not in tracheal stenosis severity.
CONCLUSION: Slide tracheoplasty for CTS leads to favorable long-term outcomes. However, various associated anomalies may influence growth and psychomotor development, emphasizing the importance of adequate support.
