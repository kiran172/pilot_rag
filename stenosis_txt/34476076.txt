Title: A case of carotid endarterectomy assisted with a three-way junction shunting tube for the internal carotid artery stenosis involving a persistent primitive hypoglossal artery.

Abstract: Only several cases of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis involving the persistent primitive hypoglossal artery (PPHA) have been treated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) because of its extreme rarity. CEA was performed for an 87-year-old female with severe stenosis of the right ICA-PPHA bifurcation requiring shunting from CCA to both PPHA and ICA. We initially attempted to insert two intraluminal balloon shunts into the CCA, as previously reported. However, we found this procedure technically impossible to achieve. An improvised three-way junction tube was inserted distally into PPHA and ICA and proximally into CCA, securing blood flow during CEA. Unfortunately, the patient suffered post-operative ischemic brain lesions due to the prolonged ischemic time during our initial unsuccessful shunt attempt. A three-way junction shunting tube could be an effective shunt technique during an anatomically complicated CEA.
