Title: Management of balloon dilatation in cases of subglottic stenosis in children: success and failure.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess efficacy and prognostic factors of endoscopic balloon dilatation for the treatment of subglottic stenosis in children.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 49 pediatric patients with subglottic stenosis treated at the Shanghai Children's Hospital between December 2017 and December 2021. Specific demographic data, type and severity of the stenosis, number of balloon dilatations and outcomes were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: Forty-nine children (30 male, 19 female) were included in the study with a median age at diagnosis of 24 (13-36.5) months, of which 7 (14.3%) had received open laryngotracheal reconstruction previously. The degree of subglottic stenosis was grade I in six patients, grade II in 16 patients, grade III in 20 patients and grade IV in seven patients. After various numbers of balloon dilatations (1-7 times), 29 patients showed a good outcome (decannulation or prevention of tracheostomy) and the success rate in that series was 59.2%. Overall, prognosis of balloon dilatation was not dependent on pathogeny (congenital or acquired) or open surgical history(P > 0.05), but rather on the severity grade of stenosis and the number of dilatations (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic balloon dilatation can be safe and effective in the treatment of subglottic stenosis in children, except for more serious cases (grade IV). Open surgery should be considered if no significant improvement is observed after dilatation, especially after three or more dilatations.
