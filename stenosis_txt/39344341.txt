Title: Off versus on pump myocardial revascularization in patients with severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is a global cause of morbidity and mortality, often managed by coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This study addresses a critical decision-making dilemma in CABG procedures for patients with severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis, comparing off-pump and on-pump techniques.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-center analysis, employing propensity scored matched-pair methodology to compare perioperative outcomes in patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis undergoing off-pump or on-pump CABG. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of perioperative stroke. Secondary endpoints included postoperative delirium, intrahospital mortality, intensive care unit stay, length of hospitalization and long-term survival.
RESULTS: The study involved 243 patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis operated between July 2009 and October 2018, subsequently propensity score matched into two groups of 78 patients each (off-pump and on-pump). The incidence of perioperative stroke was significantly higher in the On-Pump group compared to the off-pump group (10.3% vs. 1.3%, P=0.03). However, secondary endpoints, such as intrahospital mortality and length of hospitalization, showed no significant differences between the two groups. Long-term survival rates were also comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that off-pump CABG significantly reduces the risk of perioperative stroke in patients with severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis compared to on-pump CABG, without compromising long-term outcomes. These results support the preference for off-pump CABG in this high-risk patient population, highlighting the need for tailored surgical approaches based on individual patient risk profiles.
