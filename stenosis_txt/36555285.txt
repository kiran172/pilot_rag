Title: microRNAs Associated with Carotid Plaque Development and Vulnerability: The Clinician's Perspective.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke (IS) related to atherosclerosis of large arteries is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability in developed countries. Atherosclerotic internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) contributes to 20% of all cerebral ischemia cases. Nowadays, atherosclerosis prevention and treatment measures aim at controlling the atherosclerosis risk factors, or at the interventional (surgical or endovascular) management of mature occlusive lesions. There is a definite lack of the established circulating biomarkers which, once modulated, could prevent development of atherosclerosis, and consequently prevent the carotid-artery-related IS. Recent studies emphasize that microRNA (miRNA) are the emerging particles that could potentially play a pivotal role in this approach. There are some research studies on the association between the expression of small non-coding microRNAs with a carotid plaque development and vulnerability. However, the data remain inconsistent. In addition, all major studies on carotid atherosclerotic plaque were conducted on cell culture or animal models; very few were conducted on humans, whereas the accumulating evidence demonstrates that it cannot be automatically extrapolated to processes in humans. Therefore, this paper aims to review the current knowledge on how miRNA participate in the process of carotid plaque formation and rupture, as well as stroke occurrence. We discuss potential target miRNA that could be used as a prognostic or therapeutic tool.
