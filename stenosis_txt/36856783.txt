Title: Perioperative renal function change after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A single-center retrospective study in China.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In recent years, the kidney function after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has gradually become a hot spot that arouse extensive attention.Our study is aimed to evaluate the incidence and predictors of acute kidney recovery (AKR) after TAVR.
METHODS: A total of 102 patients undergoing TAVR in Beijing Anzhen Hospital from June 2021 to March 2022 were enrolled in our study. Patients were divided into AKR group (n = 54), unchanged group (n = 40) and acute kidney injury (AKI) group (n = 8) based on the percent change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Univariate analysis was used to compare the differences in general clinical characteristics and other related indicators between the three groups to analyze the risk factors of AKR.
RESULTS: The incidence of AKR was 53% (54/102) after TAVR. Multivariate analysis showed that the incidence of age and proportion of severe NYHA class (III or IV) was significantly higher in the AKR group while renal dysfunction (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was lower. Besides, fluid management/volume therapy was significantly different among the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: AKR is a generalizable phenomenon occurring frequently after TAVR. The age, proportion of severe NYHA class and the baseline renal function are independent predictors of AKR events in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR.
