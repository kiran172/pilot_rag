Title: Bicuspidization reconstruction for regurgitant quadricuspid pulmonary valve concomitant pulmonary artery aneurysm graft replacement.

Abstract: Large pulmonary artery aneurysm with severe pulmonary valve regurgitation due to the quadricuspid pulmonary valve (Type F) was found in a 54-year-old woman with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, and in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III. The annulus plication and bicuspidization technique were successfully used for the pulmonary valvular reconstruction. Then, the main pulmonary artery was replaced with Dacron graft and the left pulmonary arterioplasty was performed. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed a satisfactory motion of the reconstructed pulmonary valve with trivial regurgitation and no stenosis.
