Title: Mechanism of effect of stenting on hemodynamics at iliac vein bifurcation.

Abstract: When performing stent intervention for iliac vein compression syndrome, the operator selects the appropriate stent and determines its implantation depth according to the type and severity of iliac vein stenosis in the patient. However, there is still uncertainty regarding how the structure of the stent and its implantation depth affect hemodynamics at the site of lesion. In this paper, we analyzed three commonly used stents (Vena stent from Venmedtch, Venovo from Bard, and Smart stent from Cordis) with different implantation depths (0, 10, 20Â mm) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We focused on evaluating hemorheological parameters such as time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), etc., within one pulsatile cycle after stent implantation. The correlation between geometric parameters of the stents and hemodynamic indicators was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient (r), which was further validated through PIV velocity measurement experiment. The results revealed that an increase in implantation depth led to a more pronounced disturbance effect on blood flow at bifurcation for densely arranged support body-type stents. This effect was particularly significant during periods of smooth blood flow. On the other hand, crown-shaped Vena stents exhibited relatively less disruption to blood flow post-implantation. Implantation depth showed a strong negative correlation with TAWSS but a strong positive correlation with OSI and RRT. These findings suggest an increased risk of thrombosis at iliac vein bifurcation following stent placement. Amongst all three tested stents, Vena Stent demonstrated more favorable periodic parameters after implantation compared to others. These results provide valuable theoretical insights into understanding contralateral circulation thrombosis associated with iliac vein stenting.
