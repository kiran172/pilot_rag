Title: Vessel wall enhancement as a predictor of arterial stenosis progression and poor outcomes in moyamoya disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the association between vessel wall enhancement and progression of arterial stenosis and clinical outcomes in patients with moyamoya (MMD) using high-resolution magnetic resonance (HRMR) vessel wall imaging.
METHODS: Consecutive participants diagnosed with MMD were prospectively recruited and underwent HRMR at baseline and during follow-up, which had an interval period of ≥ 6 months and were clinically followed up for ≤ 24 months to record the occurrence of ischemic stroke. The relationship between vessel wall enhancement and arterial stenosis progression and stroke occurrence was evaluated.
RESULTS: HRMR vessel wall imaging was used to identify 309 stenotic lesions at the internal carotid artery (ICA) in 170 participants (mean age: 37.7 ± 11.3 years old, male: 44.1%). The baseline presence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.97-6.44, p < 0.001) and progression (aOR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.29-6.80, p = 0.010) of vessel wall enhancement and middle cerebral artery (MCA) involvement (aOR = 4.98, 95% CI = 1.50-16.52, p = 0.009) were significantly associated with rapid progression of arterial stenosis. Furthermore, vessel wall enhancement (adjusted HR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.33-9.70, p = 0.011) and rapid progression of arterial stenosis (adjusted HR = 4.52, 95% CI = 1.48-13.81, p = 0.008) were correlated with future stroke occurrence.
CONCLUSION: The baseline presence of vessel wall enhancement was associated with rapid progression of arterial stenosis and increased risk for stroke in MMD patients. Our findings suggest that vessel wall enhancement may serve as a predictor of disease progression and poor outcomes in MMD.
KEY POINTS: • The baseline presence of vessel wall enhancement was significantly associated with the rapid progression of arterial stenosis. • The baseline presence of vessel wall enhancement and rapid progression of arterial stenosis were both correlated with increased risk for future occurrence of stroke. • Our findings suggest that vessel wall enhancement may serve as a predictor of rapid progression of arterial stenosis and poor outcomes in MMD patients.
