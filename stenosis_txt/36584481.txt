Title: Stabilizing cardiac ryanodine receptor with dantrolene treatment prevents left ventricular remodeling in pressure-overloaded heart failure mice.

Abstract: Dantrolene (DAN) directly binds to cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) through Leu601-Cys620 in the N-terminal domain and subsequently inhibits diastolic Ca2+ leakage through RyR2. We previously reported that therapy using RyR2 V3599K mutation, which inhibits diastolic Ca2+ leakage by enhancing calmodulin (CaM) binding ability to RyR2, prevents left ventricular (LV) remodeling in transverse aortic constriction (TAC) heart failure. Here, we examined whether chronic administration of DAN prevents LV remodeling in TAC heart failure via the same mechanism as genetic therapy. A pressure-overloaded hypertrophy mouse model was developed using TAC. Wild-type (WT) mice were divided into three groups: sham-operated mice (Sham group), TAC mice (TAC group), and TAC mice treated with DAN (TAC-DAN group, 20Â mg/kg/day, i.p.). They were then followed up for 8 weeks. The survival rate was higher in the TAC-DAN group (83%) than in the TAC group (49%), and serial echocardiography studies and pathological tissue analysis showed that LV remodeling was significantly prevented in the TAC-DAN group compared to the TAC group. An increase in the diastolic Ca2+ spark frequency and a decrease in the binding affinity of CaM to RyR2 were observed at 8 weeks in the TAC group but not in the TAC-DAN group. Stabilization of RyR2 with DAN prevented LV remodeling and improved survival after TAC by enhancing CaM binding to RyR2 and inhibiting RyR2-mediated diastolic Ca2+ leakage.
