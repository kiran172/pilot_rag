Title: Sliding tracheoplasty of complete tracheal cartilage rings in children.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Complete tracheal rings are a rare malformation that occurs in 1 out of 100,000 live births. It is rare, isolated tracheal or tracheobronchial anomaly developed due to abnormal cartilage growth with formation of complete ring and often resulting in airway stenosis. Slide tracheoplasty, as it was originally described by Tsang et al. and popularized by Grillo et al., overlaps stenotic segments of trachea, shortening trachea itself, thus, doubling the circumference and diameter of the stenotic area.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have performed slide tracheoplasty in 12 children during the period of 2019-2021 in thoracic surgery department of our center. Median age was 15 ± 21,1 months (2 months-6 years),median weight - 8,04 ± 4,75 kg (3-20,7 kg),tracheal lumen varied from 2.5 to 3.0 mm, stenosis length - from 40 to 70% of the trachea length.
RESULTS: Slide tracheoplasty was performed using central veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 7 cases and using cardiopulmonary bypass in 5 cases. Concomitant heart disease was revealed in 5 children (pulmonary artery sling in 3 cases, ventricular septal defects - 1, aberrant subclavian artery -1). 5 children underwent one-stage correction of VSD: plastic VSD -1; left pulmonary artery reimplantation - 3; subclavian artery reimplantation - 1. All patients were on mechanical ventilation for 4,3 ± 2,78 days at postoperative period. Patients were discharged 16,3 ± 5,14 days after surgery. Satisfactory result of treatment in the form of respiratory failure relief was achieved in 10 patients. It was possible to increase the trachea lumen from 1.5 to 2 times in all cases. There were 2 (16,6%) fatal cases due to sepsis and multi-organ failure development.
CONCLUSIONS: Children with complete tracheal rings are very complicated patients with various comorbidities. Despite the advances in medicine, sometimes it is impossible to save lives of these children. The use of extracorporeal circulation (ECMO and bypass) allows us to safely perform reconstructive surgery on the trachea and save the child from respiratory failure manifestations. If needed, simultaneous correction of heart and tracheal defects is possible. Slide tracheoplasty allows to increase trachea lumen at least in 1.5-2 times. Mechanical ventilation is an unfavorable predictive factor for the outcomes of congenital tracheal stenosis management.
