Title: Comparison of surgical outcomes and urinary functioning after phalloplasty with versus without urethral lengthening in transgender men.

Abstract: Background: Phalloplasty in transgender men is performed with or without Urethral Lengthening (UL). To create clear expectations in the choice of UL, an overview and comparison of outcomes is useful. Aims: To provide and compare surgical outcomes and urinary functioning after phalloplasty with versus without UL in transgender men. Methods: A single-center, retrospective chart review was conducted among transgender men who underwent phalloplasty with or without UL between 01-2013 and 10-2020. Primary outcomes were differences in complication and reoperation rates. Secondary outcomes were end-stages of voiding at last follow-up and differences in voiding analyses pre- and postoperatively. Results: Of 136 men, 91 (67%) underwent phalloplasty with, and 45 (33%) without UL. Wound infection (31 vs. 16%, p = 0.06) and partial flap loss (35 vs. 13%, p = 0.008) were predominately seen after UL. In the UL group, 43% urethral fistulas and 60% urethral strictures were observed, relative to one man without UL who had a urethral fistula (both p &lt; 0.001). Meatal or perineal orifice stenosis was seen in 29% with versus 11% without UL (p = 0.02). Reoperation was needed in 81% with versus 27% without UL (p &lt; 0.001). At follow-up, 80/91 (88%) after UL reached end-stage of voiding, with 60/80 (75%) able to void while standing and 20/80 (25%) having a definitive urethrostomy. The remaining 11/91 (12%) men were awaiting further treatment for urological complications. The men able to void while standing had a median of one reoperation (range 0-6), and a significant decrease in maximum flow rate on postoperative uroflowmetry (21.4 vs. 29.8 mL/s, p &lt; 0.001). After phalloplasty without UL, all men had a definitive perineostomy without changes in voiding analyses. Discussion: The choice for or against UL during phalloplasty has become more relevant over the years. This comparison of surgical outcomes and urinary functioning can be useful in the shared decision-making process to come to the most suitable choice of phalloplasty.
