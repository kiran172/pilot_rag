Title: A Widow-Maker and a Doppelganger: An Anomalous Case of the Coronaries.

Abstract: The anomalous origin of the left circumflex (LCX) artery from the right coronary sinus is a relatively rare condition. A 'double' left anterior descending (LAD) artery is probably the rarest of coronary artery anomalies. We present a case of acute myocardial infarction with a clot and a critical distal stenosis in the left main stem (LMS) supplying a dual LAD and an aberrant origin of the LCX.
