Title: Setting a Benchmark for Quality of Care: Update on Best Practices in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Programs.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established therapy for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. The evolution of technology and procedural approaches has facilitated the development of streamlined clinical pathways to optimize patient care and improve outcomes. The revision of historical practices and the adoption of contemporary best practices throughout patients' journey from referral to discharge create opportunities to drive quality improvement. Nursing expertise and leadership are essential to recalibrate preprocedure, periprocedure, and postprocedure practice to transform the way we care for TAVR, achieve excellent outcomes, and promote high-performing health services for the treatment of valvular heart disease.
