Title: Impact of periprocedural bleeding on mid-term outcome in nonagenarians who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation: insights from LAPLACE registry.

Abstract: Data from several recent studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) even in nonagenarians. However, the impact of periprocedural bleeding following TAVI on their outcome remains unclear. In the aLliAnce for exPloring cLinical prospects of AortiC valvE disease (LAPLACE) registry, we compared outcomes between the bleeding and no-bleeding groups among 1953 patients < 90 years old (mean age, 83.0 ± 4.6 years old) and 316 nonagenarians (mean age, 91.7 ± 1.9 years old) who underwent TAVI with a median follow-up period of 628 days. The group with any periprocedural bleeding showed a higher 30-day mortality than the no-bleeding group in patients < 90 years old (3.3% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.001) and nonagenarians (7.9% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.001). In patients < 90 years old, severe periprocedural bleeding (n = 85) was associated with a higher mid-term all-cause mortality rate than no severe bleeding (n = 1,868), even after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio [HR], 1.994; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.287-2.937; p = 0.002). On the other hand, in nonagenarians, any periprocedural bleeding (n = 38) was associated with a higher mid-term cardiovascular (CV) mortality rate (21.1% vs. 4.3%, log-rank p = 0.014) than no bleeding (n = 278), even after adjusting for covariates (HR, 3.104; 95% CI 1.140-8.449; p = 0.027). In conclusion, any periprocedural bleeding after TAVI was associated with mid-term CV mortality in nonagenarians, whereas severe bleeding was associated with mid-term all-cause mortality in patients < 90 years old.
