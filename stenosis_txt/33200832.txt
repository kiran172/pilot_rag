Title: Sialographic Analysis of Radioiodine-Associated Chronic Sialadenitis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To apply a novel sialography classification system to identify parotid and submandibular ductal findings following I-131 therapy and to assess correlates to dose and duration of symptoms.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective single-center case series.
METHODS: Patients who underwent sialography between February 2008 and February 2019 after previously receiving I-131 treatment were identified via a retrospective chart review. Their sialograms were systematically evaluated and scored by applying the Iowa parotid sialogram scale to also include submandibular gland analysis.
RESULTS: From 337 sialograms, 30 (five submandibular, 25 parotid) underwent analysis. Ductal stenosis was identified in all sialograms and was graded as moderate (>50%-75%) in 7/30 cases and severe (>75%) in 15/30 cases. The distal (main) duct was narrowed in 23/30 cases. No association was identified between degree of ductal stenosis and I-131 dose (P = .39), age (P = .81), or time from I-131 therapy to sialogram (P = .97).
CONCLUSIONS: The Iowa parotid sialogram scale was successfully applied to report abnormalities of the parotid and submandibular ductal system. The most common manifestation of I-131-associated sialadenitis was a severe stenosis within the distal salivary duct. No statistically significant association was found between degree of ductal stenosis and dose of I-131, age, or duration of symptoms.
