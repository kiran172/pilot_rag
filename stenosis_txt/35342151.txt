Title: Temporary Stenting for Anastomotic Stenosis after Tracheal Resection of Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 51-year-old man who noticed discomfort in the pharynx was found to have a tracheal tumor on physical examination. He was diagnosed as having adenoid cystic carcinoma by a transbronchial biopsy and underwent tracheal segmental resection via a collar incision. He was additionally treated with radiation therapy owing to a positive surgical margin, and he subsequently developed anastomotic tracheal stenosis. Silicon stent placement to open the airway was performed for the tracheal stenosis. One year after stent placement, the trachea was dilated, so the stent was removed, and he is still under follow-up without recurrence free 1.5 years after stent replacement.
