Title: Risks and benefits of renal artery stenting in fibromuscular dysplasia: Lessons from the ARCADIA-POL study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Although renal stenting is the standard revascularization method for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) (FMD-RAS), stenting in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) RAS is usually limited to periprocedural complications of angioplasty and primary arterial dissection. The main aim of the study was to retrospectively analyze the immediate and long-term results of renal stenting versus angioplasty in patients with FMD.
METHODS: Of 343 patients in the ARCADIA-POL registry, 58 patients underwent percutaneous treatment due to FMD-RAS (in 70 arteries). Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) was performed as an initial treatment in 61 arteries (PTRA-group), whereas primary stenting was undertaken in nine arteries (stent-group). Stent-related complications were defined as: in-stent restenosis > 50% (ISR); stent fracture; under-expansion; or migration.
RESULTS: In the PTRA-group, the initial restenosis rate was 50.8%. A second procedure was then performed in 22 arteries: re-PTRA (12 arteries) or stenting (10 arteries). The incidence of recurrent restenosis after re-PTRA was 41.7%. Complications occurred in seven of 10 (70%) arteries secondarily treated by stenting: two with under-expansion and five with ISR. In the stent-group, stent under-expansion occurred in one case (11.1%) and ISR in three of nine stents (33.3%). In combined analysis of stented arteries, either primarily or secondarily, stent-related complications occurred in 11/19 stenting procedures (57.9%): three due to under-expansion and eight due to ISRs. Finally, despite several revascularization attempts, four of 19 (21%) stented arteries were totally occluded and one was significantly stenosed at follow-up imaging.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that renal stenting in FMD-RAS may carry a high risk of late complications, including stent occlusion. Further observational data from large-scale registries are required.
