Title: Clinical Significance of Optical Coherence Tomography-Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for In-Stent Restenosis Within Drug-Eluting Stents: Impact on Patient Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The evidence for optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in improving the prognosis of individuals with in-stent restenosis (ISR) is lacking.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study enrolled 588 consecutive individuals with drug-eluting stent ISR undergoing PCI from March 2010 to March 2022. Two hundred seven (35.2%) underwent OCT guidance, and 381 (64.8%) underwent angiography guidance. Clinical outcomes were analyzed using survival curves. The primary clinical endpoint was 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization. Compared with angiography guidance, OCT guidance demonstrated a higher frequency of drug-coated balloon use and adjunctive therapeutic modalities, including predilation, postdilation, nonslip element balloons, and noncompliant balloons (P&lt;0.05). Following PCI, the OCT-guided group achieved a significantly larger minimum lumen diameter (2.36 versus 2.15â€‰mm, P&lt;0.001) and a lower percentage diameter stenosis (17% versus 20%, P&lt;0.001) than the angiography-guided group. Survival analysis revealed significantly lower 2-year MACEs in the OCT-guided group compared with the angiography-guided group (7% versus 15%, P=0.007), validated in the propensity matching analysis (7% versus 15%, P=0.001). Multiple sensitivity analyses showed that OCT-guided PCI treatment was an independent protective factor for 2-year MACEs in individuals with drug-eluting stent ISR.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with angiography guidance, OCT guidance is associated with a lower 2-year MACE risk among individuals with drug-eluting stent ISR. Therefore, OCT should be actively considered for guiding PCI treatment in individuals with drug-eluting stent ISR.
