Title: [Novel study and applications of CT angiography derived fractional flow reserve in China].

Abstract: CT angiography derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) has been an important tool for evaluating functional significance of coronary stenosis since 2011, promoting coronary CT angiography (CCTA) from the era of traditional anatomical evaluation to a new era of functional evaluation,playing a key role in guiding clinical decisions and prognostic evaluation of coronary artery disease. This review focuses on the innovative research and contributions of Chinese scholars' in CT-FFR filed, including homemade techniques, extending clinical applications and generalization of CT-FFR.
