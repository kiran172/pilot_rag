Title: First Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Gadobutrol in a Patient With Severe Contrast Allergy.

Abstract: Iodinated contrast media (ICM) is an integral part of interventional cardiology procedures however, a proportion of patients have contrast allergy. We report the first TAVR performed with a gadolinium-based contrast agent, gadobutrol (GBCA) in a patient with severe recurrent ICM allergic reactions despite prophylactic treatment.
