Title: Changes in polysomnographic findings following transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a patient with aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Patients with aortic stenosis (AS) are likely to have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and improvements in AS by transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement alter the type and severity of SDB. However, limited data are available whether polysomnographic findings changed following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In this report, we describe the case of a patient with severe AS and SDB whose polysomnographic findings showed that after TAVI, sleep disturbances occurred in association with worsened periodic leg movements despite improvement in the SDB. &lt;Learning objectives: Patients with aortic stenosis often have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) which can be improved following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, no studies assessed SDB by polysomnography before and after TAVI. Following TAVI, our case revealed sleep disturbances associated with worsened periodic leg movements (PLM) despite improvement of SDB. Therefore, polysomnography may be considered following TAVI to detect residual SDB and sleep disturbance in association with PLM.&gt;.
