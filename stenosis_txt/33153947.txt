Title: Watchful waiting care or early intervention in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: Where we are.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis, the most common valvular heart disease in Western countries, affects predominantly older people. Prompt aortic valve replacement is undoubtedly indicated in symptomatic patients. Management of asymptomatic patients is nowadays shifting from a conservative approach to early aortic valve replacement, as multimodality imaging is increasingly available. However, multimodality imaging has led to multiple prognostic parameters and complex algorithms, as well as a new staging classification that has left patients and physicians somewhat puzzled. We highlight the value of thorough serial clinical examinations, Doppler echocardiography and exercise testing when caring for a growing aortic stenosis population, including that has no or limited access to multimodality imaging. Evidence for early aortic valve replacement versus conservative management in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis is biased by the lack of serial stress testing evaluation; 30% of so-called asymptomatic patients were in fact symptomatic, and thus were clear candidates for aortic valve replacement in the above-mentioned studies. Randomized trials of aortic valve replacement versus conservative management that include serial stress testing evaluation are needed to ascertain whether early aortic valve replacement actually improves clinical outcome in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. Less interventional medicine and healthcare resource utilization can result in better health.
