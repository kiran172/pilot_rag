Title: A Case of Bilateral Papilledema With Improved Clinical Symptoms by Venous Stenting for Superior Sagittal Sinus Stenosis.

Abstract: Superior sagittal sinus (SSS) obstruction causes intracranial hypertension, often requiring surgical stenting. Consensus on treating brain venous sinus stenosis, another cause, is lacking. This study reports a case of SSS stenosis and intracranial hypertension treated with venous stenting, improving bilateral papilledema. A 51-year-old with a headache and visual disturbance had papilledema and visual field loss. MR venography showed SSS stenosis, leading to a neurosurgery referral. Lumbar puncture confirmed intracranial hypertension (>35 cmH2O), prompting venous stenting. Post-procedure, papilledema, headache, and visual field loss improved. Venous stenting could be effective for SSS stenosis with clinically proven or recurrent pressure differences. Further cases are needed for standardization.
