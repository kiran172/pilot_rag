Title: MicroRNA-134-5p and the Extent of Arterial Occlusive Disease Are Associated with Risk of Future Adverse Cardiac and Cerebral Events in Diabetic Patients Undergoing Carotid Artery Stenting for Symptomatic Carotid Artery Disease.

Abstract: There is little known about the prognostic value of serum microRNAs (miRs) in diabetic patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery disease (ICAS) who underwent stent supported angioplasty (PTA) for ICAS. The present study aimed to investigate expression levels of selected miRs for future major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE) as a marker in diabetic patients following ICAS-PTA. The expression levels of 11 chosen circulating serum miRs were compared in 37 diabetic patients with symptomatic ICAS and 64 control group patients with symptomatic ICAS, but free of diabetes. The prospective median follow-up of 84 months was performed for cardiovascular outcomes. Diabetic patients, as compared to control subjects, did not differ with respect to age (p = 0.159), distribution of gender (p = 0.375), hypertension (p = 0.872), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.203), smoking (p = 0.115), coronary heart disease (p = 0.182), lower extremities arterial disease (LEAD, p = 0.731), and miRs expressions except from lower miR-16-5p (p < 0.001). During the follow-up period, MACCE occurred in 16 (43.2%) diabetic and 26 (40.6%) non-diabetic patients (p = 0.624). On multivariate Cox analysis, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) for diabetic patients associated with MACCE were miR-134-5p (1.12; 1.05−1.21, p < 0.001), miR-499-5p (0.16; 0.02−1.32, p = 0.089), hs-CRP (1.14; 1.02−1.28; p = 0.022), prior myocardial infarction (8.56, 1.91−38.3, p = 0.004), LEAD (11.9; 2.99−47.9, p = 0.005), and RAS (20.2; 2.4−167.5, p = 0.005), while in non-diabetic subjects, only miR-16-5p (1.0006; 1.0001−1.0012, p = 0.016), miR-208b-3p (2.82; 0.91−8.71, p = 0.071), and hypertension (0.27, 0.08−0.95, p = 0.042) were associated with MACCE. Our study demonstrated that different circulating miRs may be prognostic for MACCE in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients with symptomatic ICAS. Higher expression levels of miR-134 were prognostic for MACCE in diabetic patients, while higher expression levels of miR-16 were prognostic in non-diabetic patients.
