Title: Auritidibacter ignavus, an Emerging Pathogen Associated with Chronic Ear Infections.

Abstract: We describe detection of the previously rarely reported gram-positive bacterium Auritidibacter ignavus in 3 cases of chronic ear infections in Germany. In all 3 cases, the patients had refractory otorrhea. Although their additional symptoms varied, all patients had an ear canal stenosis and A. ignavus detected in microbiologic swab specimens. A correct identification of A. ignavus in the clinical microbiology laboratory is hampered by the inability to identify it by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Also, the bacterium might easily be overlooked because of its morphologic similarity to bacterial species of the resident skin flora. We conclude that a high index of suspicion is warranted to identify A. ignavus and that it should be particularly considered in patients with chronic external otitis who do not respond clinically to quinolone ear drop therapy.
