Title: Evaluation of length of stay after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation with SAPIEN 3 prosthesis: A French multicentre prospective observational trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complications decrease after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and early discharge is feasible and safe in selected populations.
AIMS: To evaluate length of stay (LOS) and reasons for prolonged hospitalisation after transfemoral TAVI in unselected patients.
METHODS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis, who had transfemoral TAVI with the SAPIEN 3 prosthesis using exclusively local anaesthesia, were prospectively and consecutively included at five French high-volume centres. LOS was calculated from TAVI procedure to discharge. Reasons for prolonged hospitalisation (i.e.>3 days) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2018, 293 patients were included, with a mean age of 82.4±6.5 years and a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 13.7±9.0%. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.4%. The median LOS was 5 (3-7) days, and varied considerably between centres (from 2 to 7 days). Sixty-four (21.8%) patients were discharged within 3 days after transfemoral TAVI. Reported reasons for prolonged hospitalisation were complications in 62.2%, loss of autonomy in 3.1%, discharge refusal in 2.2% and logistical reasons in 0.9%. In 31.6% of cases, the investigators reported no apparent reasons.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that LOS after transfemoral TAVI, using the SAPIEN 3 prosthesis and a minimalist approach, varies considerably between centres. In almost a third of cases, hospitalisation was prolonged without any apparent reason. Efforts should be made to educate centres to reduce LOS.
