Title: The role of endosonography in cardiology: case series and literature review.

Abstract: AIMS: Endosonography (EUS) is the diagnostic tool with the highest resolution for the local staging of gastrointestinal tumours and, due to the detailed visualization of the wall layers, is recommended in current guidelines for cancer management. In addition, an endoscope has an ultrasound tip design and balloon insufflation control design, and a 120Â° bending mechanism to deflect the endoscope tip. These advantages could be beneficial and valuable while investigating the cardiovascular structures during routine gastrointestinal procedures using this diagnostic tool.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We present six cases of incidentally diagnosed cardiac pathologies (pulmonary thromboembolism of the main pulmonary artery, patent foramen oval with right to left shunt under Valsalva, left atrial appendage thrombus, aortic dissection, moderate aortic valve stenosis, mitral and aortic valve endocarditis) during routine gastrointestinal endosonographic procedures. These diagnoses influenced changes in management strategies in four cases.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of EUS in cardiovascular medicine allows for a real-time high-resolution assessment of cardiovascular structures and allows early detection of silent cardiac pathologies during routine gastrointestinal procedures. It is the diagnostic tool with the highest resolution for accurate definition of variable gastrointestinal anatomy. Thus, help for accurate definitions of cardiovascular anatomy and pathology, which could influence optimal management strategies with improved safety, efficacy, and economic outcomes.
