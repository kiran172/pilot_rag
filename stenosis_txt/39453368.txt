Title: Incidence, Predictors, and Outcomes of Unplanned Coronary Angiography After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical in managing severe aortic stenosis. Unplanned coronary angiography after TAVR, with or without percutaneous coronary intervention, may present significant challenges.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of unplanned coronary angiography after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: All TAVR procedures between July 2015 and December 2021 were examined for the occurrence of unplanned angiography and for procedural success with percutaneous coronary intervention if attempted, and a machine learning prediction model was created.
RESULTS: Among 1,444 patients (median age 81 years, 59% men), 6.7% had unplanned post-TAVR angiography, 45% within the first year. The most common indication was acute coronary syndrome, which occurred in 3.3% overall. Patients with preprocedural CAD (50.1%) had a significantly higher incidence of unplanned angiography (10.5% vs 2.9%; P < 0.001) in comparison with others. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with unplanned angiography were age (>75 years; HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.30-0.71; P < 0.001), mean aortic valve gradient (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.68-0.98; P = 0.031), dialysis (HR: 2.68; 95% CI: 1.07-6.74; P = 0.036), and CAD (HR: 2.96; 95% CI: 1.76-4.98; P < 0.001). In multivariate models, these same variables had areas under the curve of 0.71 to 0.77 for 5-year prediction of unplanned angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: Unplanned angiography post-TAVR occurs in about 1 in 15 patients, with about one-half occurring within the first year, about one-half due to acute coronary syndrome, and pre-existing CAD being the strongest predictor. For those considering TAVR and who have or are at risk for CAD, a comprehensive strategy to facilitate lifetime management is needed.
