Title: Mechanical thrombectomy of right internal carotid artery terminus occlusion using the ADAPT technique: impact of aspiration on parent vessel.

Abstract: The impact of ADAPT-"a direct aspiration first pass technique"-on intracranial vasculature is not well understood, since the change of arterial diameter is often not visible during aspiration. We present a unique case in which the impact of aspiration on the parent vessel was visualized due to a previously deployed Neuroform Atlas stent and a Pipeline embolization device. The patient presented with right internal carotid artery occlusion. An aspiration catheter was advanced over the microcatheter system and corked into the clot, located within the stents in proximal M1. The stents were seen to collapse both during electronic pump and hand aspiration with no evidence of stent migration. This demonstrates that it is crucial to engage the clot interface with the tip of the aspiration catheter while performing ADAPT. Placing the aspiration catheter remote from the clot may result in collapse of the artery proximal to the clot with subsequent ADAPT failure.(video 1) neurintsurg;12/11/1148/V1F1V1video 1.
