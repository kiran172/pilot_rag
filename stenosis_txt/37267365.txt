Title: Activation of Piezo1 promotes osteogenic differentiation of aortic valve interstitial cell through YAP-dependent glutaminolysis.

Abstract: Hemodynamic overload and dysregulation of cellular metabolism are involved in development of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). However, how mechanical stress relates to metabolic changes in CAVD remains unclear. Here, we show that Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, regulated glutaminase 1 (GLS1)-mediated glutaminolysis to promote osteogenic differentiation of valve interstitial cells (VICs). In vivo, two models of aortic valve stenosis were constructed by ascending aortic constriction (AAC) and direct wire injury (DWI). Inhibition of Piezo1 and GLS1 in these models respectively mitigated aortic valve lesion. In vitro, Piezo1 activation induced by Yoda1 and oscillatory stress triggered osteogenic responses in VICs, which were prevented by Piezo1 inhibition or knockdown. Mechanistically, Piezo1 activation promoted calcium-dependent Yes-associated protein (YAP) activation. YAP modulated GLS1-mediated glutaminolysis, which enhanced osteogenic differentiation through histone acetylation of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) promoters. Together, our work provided a cross-talk between mechanotransduction and metabolism in the context of CAVD.
