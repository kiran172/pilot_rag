Title: [Genetic analysis of a child with atypical Williams-Beuren syndrome presenting as supravalvular aortic stenosis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a child with supravalvular aortic stenosis.
METHODS: The child and his parents were subjected to conventional G-banding karyotyping, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis.
RESULTS: No karyotypic abnormality was detected in the child and his parents. aCGH has identified a de novo 278 kb deletion encompassing the ELN gene in 7q11.23, which overlapped with the critical region of Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS). MLPA has confirmed above findings.
CONCLUSION: The proband was diagnosed with atypical WBS. Deletion of the ELN gene may predispose to supravalvular aortic stenosis in the proband.
