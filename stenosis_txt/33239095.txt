Title: Relationship between the severity of endometriosis symptoms (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain) and the spread of the disease on ultrasound.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: About 10-15% of women of childbearing age have endometriosis. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between the severity of symptoms of endometriosis and the spread as well as the stage of the disease on ultrasonography. The present cross-sectional study evaluates the relationship between the severity of endometriosis symptoms and the spread of disease on ultrasonography in patients with endometriosis.
RESULTS: Considering different analyses, the cumulative size of posterior deep infiltrative endometriosis (DIE) (less than 1Â cm) is significantly correlated with minimal severity of dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain. The incidence of dyspareunia was more prevalent in patients with complete stenosis of Douglas pouch than those with incomplete stenosis. Furthermore, the incidence of severe and very severe pain in patients with Douglas pouch stenosis is relatively higher than that in patients without stenosis. Only dyspareunia is related to the stage of endometriosis, and patients with dyspareunia are five times more at risk of a higher stage of the disease. The severity of dyspareunia is related to the stage of endometriosis and the severity of Douglas pouch stenosis. The results showed a correlation between chronic pelvic pain and r-ASRM score (revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine score).
