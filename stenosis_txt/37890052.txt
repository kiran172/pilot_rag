Title: Pediatric Airway Balloon Dilation: Urge for Safety Redesign.

Abstract: Airway balloons are widely used by otolaryngologists to treat laryngotracheal stenosis. We review an adverse event and interventions that may prevent similar occurrences. There are no other reports of similar incidents in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience. We implore Acclarent to redesign their airway balloon device to prevent accidental airway irrigation.
