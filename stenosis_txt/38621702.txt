Title: Vessel wall imaging in the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome presenting as Moyamoya syndrome-A case report.

Abstract: Objectives: We describe a case of anti-phospholipid syndrome (APLS) vasculopathy presenting with Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) and show the associated intracranial vessel wall MRI (VWI) findings. Methods: A 37-year-old-woman presented with acute onset dizziness and left-sided weakness. Neurologic exam revealed a left facial droop and left hemiparesis. She underwent a comprehensive laboratory work-up for stroke. Neuroimaging included a CT head, CT angiogram, VWI, and digital subtraction angiography. Results: Work-up revealed a triple-positive APLS antibody profile. CT of the head showed an acute right basal ganglia infarction and right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT angiogram revealed severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery terminus in a Moyamoya pattern. Intracranial VWI showed long-segment concentric vessel wall thickening and homogeneous vessel wall enhancement and T2-hyperintense wall edema of the stenotic right ICA terminus, M1 middle cerebral artery, and A1 anterior cerebral artery. She was treated with long-term anticoagulation with warfarin and a right superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass. Discussion: We present intracranial VWI features of vessel wall pathology in a patient with primary APLS presenting with MMS.
