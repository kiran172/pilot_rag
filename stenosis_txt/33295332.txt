Title: [Prosthesis-patient mismatch after transcatheter aortic valve implantation].

Abstract: Prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) is present when the actual area of an implanted prosthetic valve is too small compared to the size of the patient's body. Its main hemodynamic consequence is that of generating higher than expected gradients through prosthetic valves which are normally functioning. This review aims to update on the incidence of PPM after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and its long-term clinical impact through a review of the clinical studies available to date. Furthermore, this review will focus on some particular settings, such as TAVI procedures in small annuli or valve-in-valve, which have a higher risk of encountering this complication. Finally, we will focus on the strategies available to reduce the risk of PPM when planning a TAVI procedure.
