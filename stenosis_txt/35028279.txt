Title: Kidney autotransplantation as a treatment for resistant hypertension due to renal artery stenosis: A case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: Resistant hypertension is a common presentation of renal artery stenosis. Hypertension secondary to renal artery stenosis is typically managed with lifestyle and pharmacological interventions and less commonly with angioplasty or stenting, although exact treatment varies depending on the cause. In select cases refractory to these measures, kidney autotransplantation may be a valuable last-line approach. This case report demonstrates the successful use of kidney autotransplant for managing resistant hypertension in a young male with Takayasu's arteritis and renal artery stenosis of a solitary kidney. We review the literature on the indications for kidney autotransplantation in renal artery stenosis, including the outcomes on blood pressure control and renal function and also the potential complications.
