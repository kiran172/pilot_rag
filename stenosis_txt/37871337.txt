Title: Asymptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage following carotid endarterectomy: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting are common surgical interventions for internal carotid artery stenosis. Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is a well-known complication of both procedures that can lead to intracranial hemorrhage and worsen clinical outcomes. Here, the authors report a rare case of non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) following CEA and review the relevant literature.
OBSERVATIONS: A 70-year-old woman with hypertension and diabetes presented with progressive visual loss in the right eye and was diagnosed with ocular ischemic syndrome. Imaging revealed severe right cervical carotid artery stenosis. CEA was performed with no complications. Postoperatively, the patient's blood pressure was tightly controlled, with no evidence of CHS. However, an asymptomatic SAH was detected on postoperative day 7. Careful observation and blood pressure control were maintained. Since follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no enlarging of the SAH and the patient was asymptomatic, she was discharged on postoperative day 15 with a modified Rankin scale score of 0.
LESSONS: This case highlights the potential occurrence of non-aneurysmal SAH as a rare complication of CEA, even in asymptomatic patients. Repeated postoperative MRI is necessary to detect such complications. It is crucial to carefully control blood pressure after CEA regardless of symptoms.
