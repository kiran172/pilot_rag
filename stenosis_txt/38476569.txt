Title: Severe pulmonary hypertension associated with hypothyroidism and mixed aortic valve disease: A case report.

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension is a condition characterised by elevated pulmonary arterial pressures secondary to various aetiologies; the most common ones are left heart diseases. Similarly, an association between thyroid diseases and pulmonary hypertension has been reported in some cases, but the pathophysiological relationship has not been fully elucidated. Etiological investigation is an important step in the management of pulmonary hypertension and determines the appropriate treatment. In this report, we present a case of severe pulmonary hypertension in a 57-year-old woman, in which mixed aortic valve disease and hypothyroidism were involved.
