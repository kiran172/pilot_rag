Title: Management of spondylolisthesis using MIS techniques: Recent advances.

Abstract: The authors discuss the recent advances in the understanding and management of spondylolisthesis. The two most common kinds of spondylolisthesis - Degenerative and Spondylolytic types have been elaborated in this paper, with the understanding that similar management principles can be applied to the other lesser common varieties. The impetus has been on application of minimally invasive techniques in the treatment as well as renewed interest in stand-alone decompression in degenerative spondylolisthesis.
