Title: Pacing Over the Guidewire in Cardiac Structural Intervention: A Practical Guide.

Abstract: Left ventricular access for aortic valve intervention provides the opportunity to deliver rapid pacing over the guidewire for device positioning and deployment. Temporary pacing delivered via the left ventricle can obviate the need for venous access and has been shown to be a safe alternative to temporary right ventricular pacing. The technique requires some basic knowledge and experience in temporary cardiac pacing. We outline safe practical steps and common pitfalls in using this technique.
