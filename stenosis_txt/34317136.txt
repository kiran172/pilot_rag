Title: A 27-Year-Old Woman With Postpartum Papillary Muscle Rupture.

Abstract: Postpartum papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is extremely uncommon and tolerated poorly with limited management options other than emergency surgical intervention. This case demonstrates the challenges of postpartum PMR in a young woman with unrecognized vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and highlights the importance of preconception screening of cardiovascular disease. (Level of Difficulty: Beginner.).
