Title: Transverse aortic constriction-induced heart failure leads to increased levels of circulating microparticles.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Circulating microparticles represent one type of signal transmission between cells. Previous studies revealed increased levels of circulating microparticles in patients with heart failure, while composition, temporal occurrence and biological effects are largely unknown.
METHODS: Circulating microparticles were quantified by flow cytometry in mice following TAC. Microparticles were characterized by NTA and immunoblotting for Flotillin-1. Microparticle content was investigated by microRNA analyses.
RESULTS: After TAC induction of heart failure could be demonstrated. Simultaneously we observed increased numbers of circulating microparticles in the first week after TAC with a rapid decline thereafter. The most relevant fraction of circulating EVs after TAC derived from lymphocytes containing has-miR-26a-5p and / -146b-5p known to be involved in inflammatory processes.
CONCLUSION: This work provides a previously unknown timely limited occurrence of circulating microparticles after new onset of heart failure which might have important influence on disease development and progression and thereby are of probable therapeutic relevance.
