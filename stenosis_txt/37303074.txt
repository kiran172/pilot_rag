Title: Investigation of Combined Carotid Endarterectomy and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Outcomes and Adverse Event Risk Factors in the Vascular Quality Initiative.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate outcomes of simultaneous CEA and CABG utilizing the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI). Additionally, we seek to investigate risks for both perioperative and long-term mortality and adverse neurological outcomes.
METHODS: All carotid endarterectomies in the VQI between January 2003 and May 2022 were queried. We identified 171,816 CEA in the database. We extracted 2 cohorts from these CEA. The first group was patients who underwent simultaneous carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and coronary artery bypass (CABG) (N = 3137). The second group encompassed patients who underwent CABG or percutaneous coronary artery angioplasty/stent within 5 years of ultimately undergoing CEA (N = 27,387). We investigated the following outcomes in a multivariable fashion: 1. Risks for mortality in long term follow-up for both cohorts combined; 2. Risks for ischemic event in the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the CEA site after index hospital admission in follow up for both cohorts combined. Tertiary outcomes are also investigated in the manuscript.
RESULTS: On multivariable analysis, patients undergoing simultaneous combined CEA and CABG had equivalent long-term survival to patients who underwent coronary revascularization within 5 years of ultimately undergoing CEA. Five-year survival is noted to be 84.5% vs 86% with a Cox regression non-significant P-value (.203). Significant multivariable risks for reduced long term survival (P < .03 for all) included: advancing age (HR 2.48/year); smoking history (HR 1.26); Diabetes (HR 1.33); history of CHF (HR 1.66); history of COPD (HR 1.54); baseline renal insufficiency at the time of surgery (HR 1.30); anemia (HR1.64); lack of preoperative aspirin (HR 1.12); and lack of preoperative statin (HR 1.32); lack of patch placement at CEA site (HR 1.16); perioperative MI (HR 2.04); perioperative CHF (1.66); perioperative dysrhythmia (HR 1.36); cerebral reperfusion injury (HR 2.23); perioperative ischemic neurological event (HR 2.48); and lack of statin at discharge (HR 2.04). Amongst patients with documented neurological status in follow up, combined CEA and CABG had over 99% freedom from ischemic cerebral event ipsilateral to the CEA site after discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined CEA and CABG provides excellent long-term mortality prevention in patients with co-existing severe coronary and carotid atherosclerosis. Simultaneous CEA and CABG provides equivalent stroke prevention and long-term survival to both a cohort of patients undergoing coronary revascularization within 5 years of CEA and patients undergoing isolated CEA or CABG in the literature. The two most impactful modifiable risk factors towards long-term stroke and mortality prevention for patients undergoing simultaneous CEA-CABG are patch placement at CEA site and adherence to statin medication therapy.
