Title: [Duodenal Stent Placement against Anastomotic Stenosis after Esophageal Cancer Resection-A Case Report].

Abstract: A 53-year-old man was diagnosed as esophageal cancer, and esophagectomy was performed. Anastomotic stenosis was caused due to lymphorrhea and anastomotic leakage after surgery. Dilation was performed, though stenosis did not improved, we placed esophageal stent across the stenotic lesion. Pharyngitis occurred after indwelling esophageal stent, we hence removed the stent. Passage disorder was developed, we placed duodeneal stent which is more flexible. Stenosis is now palliated after placing duodeneal stent. Duodeneal stent could be an option for the tratment of anastomotic stenosis after esophageal surgery.
