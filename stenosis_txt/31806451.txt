Title: Troponin T Predicts Cardioembolic Aetiology and Clinical Outcome in Undetermined Ischaemic Stroke in Hyperacute Phase.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels have been related to clinical outcome in stroke patients. However, the role of hs-cTnT and its potential as a biomarker in ischaemic stroke (IS) has not been well established. This study aims to determine whether basal hs-cTnT determination in the hyperacute phase of undetermined IS and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can predict the cardioembolic aetiology and clinical outcome.
METHODS: We prospectively studied 110 consecutive patients with undetermined acute IS and TIA. hs-cTnT levels were determined at hospital arrival. Large vessel stenosis/occlusion and previously known aetiologies at admission were exclusion criteria for this study. All patients were subjected to a complete aetiological evaluation. A 12-month follow-up was performed in all patients. The subtype of IS was evaluated following the SSS-TOAST criteria. We established two groups at admission: cardioembolic aetiology (group A) and noncardioembolic aetiologies (group B).
RESULTS: The number of patients in each group was similar (group A: 52, 47.27%; group B, 58, 52.73%). Patients in group A had elevated hs-cTnT more frequently (61.54% versus 17.24%; P < .001). Group A patients had significantly higher mortality at 3 months (14.29% versus 1.82%, P = .025). In the multivariate analysis, elevated hs-cTnT was the only independent predictor of cardioembolic aetiology (odds ratio: 14.821; 95% confidence interval: 3.717-59.102, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Baseline hs-cTnT assessment in undetermined strokes and TIA during the hyperacute phase is independently associated with cardioembolic aetiology.
