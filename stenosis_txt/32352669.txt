Title: [Etiology, diagnosis and treatment of cicatricial tracheal stenosis].

Abstract: Development of tracheal surgery was associated with introduction of fundamentally new procedures: two-level reconstruction, redo tracheal resection, tracheal resection with simultaneous dissection of tracheoesophageal fistula. There are combined and staged techniques when tracheal repair or endoscopic interventions are performed as a stage before circular resection of trachea. However, a single algorithm for prevention and correction of postoperative complications is still absent in tracheal surgery. Further development of tracheal surgery directly depends on introduction of preventive measures and analysis of adverse factors associated with increased risk of complications. In this regard, ongoing researches in this area are very perspective.
