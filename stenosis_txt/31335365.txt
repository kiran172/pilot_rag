Title: Hemodynamic Performance and Outcomes of Mosaic Valve for Aortic Stenosis with Decreased Left Ventricular Function: Results from J-MOVE Study.

Abstract: We evaluated impact of a small-sized Mosaic porcine bioprosthesis on hemodynamic performance and outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in a Japan multicenter cohort. Of 1,202 patients enrolled, 105 (8.7%) who had LVEF < 50% and AS underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR). Fifty-two patients received Mosaic porcine bioprosthesis ≤ 21 mm (S-AVR), and 53 received a bioprosthesis ≥ 23 mm (L-AVR). The median follow-up period was 3.1 [1.2, 5.1] years. At 5 years, LVEF significantly improved from median 41.2 [33.8, 45.9]% to 64.2 [49.8, 72.5]% in S-AVR (p < 0.001) and from median 43.2 [37.3, 46.8]% to 61.2 [47.2, 68.0]% in L-AVR (p < 0.001). The left ventricular mass index significantly decreased from median 158.4 [122.2, 194.9] to 110.0 [83.6, 129.4] gm/m in S-AVR (p < 0.001) and from median 169.8 [132.2, 203.6] to 109.6 [101.8, 132.4] gm/m in L-AVR (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between S-AVR and L-AVR groups regarding freedom from cardiac death (93.1 ± 3.9% vs. 96.2 ± 3.8%; p = 0.119) and valve-related death (97.6 ± 2.4% vs. 100.0 ± 0.0%; p = 0.953). Clinical outcomes and improved hemodynamic performance were similar in both groups.
