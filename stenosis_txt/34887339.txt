Title: Latest Advances in Multimodality Imaging of Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is a common condition associated with major morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Nevertheless, we currently lack any effective medical therapies that can treat or prevent disease development or progression. Modern advances in echocardiography and CT have helped improve the assessment of aortic stenosis severity and monitoring of disease progression, whereas cardiac MRI informs on myocardial health and the development of fibrosis. In a series of recent studies, 18F-NaF PET/CT has been shown to assess valvular disease activity and progression, providing mechanistic insights that can inform potential novel therapeutic approaches. This review will examine the latest advances in the imaging of aortic stenosis and bioprosthetic valve degeneration and explore how these techniques can assist patient management and potentially accelerate novel therapeutic developments.
