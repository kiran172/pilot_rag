Title: Bilateral peritonsillar abscess. A case report and review of controversies surrounding diagnosis and management.

Abstract: The bilateral presentation of peritonsillar abscess is uncommon. Its management is controversial and it has been argued whether a quinsy tonsillectomy or an interval tonsillectomy should be performed. Here we describe the case of a 14-year-old boy with sore throat, trismus, and fever. He had bilateral tonsillar hypertrophy, convex arches, and soft palate edema. Computed tomography: bilateral tonsillar hypertrophy, with post-contrast enhancement, both with collection, edema with moderate pharyngeal stenosis. The patient was hospitalized for intravenous therapy and tonsillectomy with bilateral drainage resulting in a complete resolution of his condition and discharge at 48 hours. In the presence of a peritonsillar abscess, an unsuspected contralateral abscess should be considered. It should be diagnosed and managed adequately to prevent complications. Quinsy tonsillectomy could be safe and should be considered in patients who will undergo anesthesia for abscess drainage. The final decision should be made for each patient on an individual basis.
