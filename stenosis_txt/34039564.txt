Title: Risk factors for ophthalmic artery stenosis and occlusion in patients with retinoblastoma treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the risk factors for ophthalmic artery (OA) stenosis and occlusion after intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with selective ophthalmic artery catheterisation (OAC) in the treatment of retinoblastoma.
DESIGN: Retrospective, single centre case-control study.
METHODS: The study was conducted including consecutive patients with unilateral or bilateral intraocular retinoblastoma undergoing IAC between June 2016 and June 2019 with a follow-up time of 4 years. Main outcomes are rate of IAC-induced OA occlusion and OA diameter.
RESULTS: 346 attempted OAC infusions were successful. The total incidence of OA occlusion was 15.89%. The occlusion and control groups were similar in patients' age, sex and disease stage. Median OA diameter was 0.49 mm in those with OA occlusion, and 0.66 mm in those without occlusion. In the occlusion group, the OA diameter difference was significantly larger between the first IAC and the final IAC (0.22mm vs 0.12mm, p=0.001). In both groups, the median number of IAC treatments was 3. Multivariate Cox regression models included initial OA diameter (OR: 0.005, p=0.001), ratio of OA orifice diameter differences between first and last IAC to the initial OA orifice diameter (OR: 4.661, p=0.003), and number of IAC (OR: 1.538, p=0.042) as clinical features significantly associated with OA occlusion.
CONCLUSIONS: The OA diameter at first IAC treatment, the ratio of OA orifice diameter differences between first and last IAC to the initial OA orifice diameter and total number of IAC treatments may be three main clinical predictors for OA occlusion after IAC for retinoblastoma.
