Title: Efficacy and safety of endoscopic balloon dilation in inflammatory bowel disease: results of the large multicenter study of the ENEIDA registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is no information regarding the outcome of Crohn's disease (CD) patients treated with endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) in non-referral hospitals, nor on the efficacy of EBD in ulcerative colitis (UC). We report herein the results of the largest series published to date.
AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of EBD for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) stenosis performed in 19 hospitals with different levels of complexity and to determine factors related to therapeutic success.
METHODS: We identified IBD patients undergoing EBD in the ENEIDA database. Efficacy of EBD was compared between CD and UC and between secondary and tertiary hospitals. Predictive factors of therapeutic success were assessed with multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Four-hundred dilations (41.2% anastomotic) were performed in 187 IBD patients (13 UC/Indeterminate colitis). Technical and therapeutic success per dilation was achieved in 79.5% and 55.3%, respectively. Therapeutic success per patient was achieved in 78.1% of cases (median follow-up: 40 months) with 49.7% requiring more than one dilation. No differences related to either diagnosis or hospital complexity was found. Technical success [OR 4.12 (95%CI 2.4-7.1)] and not receiving anti-TNF at the time of dilation [OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.6)] were independently related to therapeutic success per dilation. A stricture length ≤ 2 cm [HR 2.43 (95% CI 1.11-5.31)] was a predictive factor of long-term success per patient. The rate of major complications was 1.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: EBD can be performed with similar efficacy and safety in hospitals with differing levels of complexity and it might be a suitable treatment for UC with short stenosis. To achieve a technical success and the short length of the stenosis seem to be critical for long-term therapeutic success.
