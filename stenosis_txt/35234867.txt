Title: Long-term results of tricuspid valve repair using three-dimensional versus flexible rings in patients with functional tricuspid regurgitation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Significant functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) should be corrected in patients undergoing surgery for left-sided valvular diseases. We hypothesized that ring type may affect outcomes in tricuspid annuloplasty. Herein, we report our experience with three-dimensional semi-rigid rings compared to open simple-band annuloplasty.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study that included all patients who underwent tricuspid annuloplasty concomitant to left-sided valvular surgery. The study's main outcome measure was long-term recurrent TR probability.
RESULTS: Of the 781 study patients, 611 (78%) underwent annuloplasty using flexible band and 170 (22%) underwent rigid ring implantation. Early mortality did not differ significantly between the rigid and flexible groups (4.4% vs 4.1%, P = 1.000). Long-term mortality was similar between the groups [hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-1.36, P = 0.847]. At a mean follow-up of 62 (50) months, freedom from TR grade 3+/4+ was 96.4% and 96.7% in the rigid and flexible groups, respectively (HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.55-3.61, P = 0.476). Furthermore, 2.4% of the rigid and 1.3% of the flexible groups required reoperation (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.21-4.82, P = 0.988). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that rheumatic valve aetiology (HR 1.92, CI 1.04-2.98, P = 0.042) and mitral stenosis (HR 1.44, CI 1.01-2.2, P = 0.044) were predictors for recurrent TR (3+/4+). Ring type was not associated with recurrence (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.3-2.47, P = 0.787).
CONCLUSIONS: Open bands performed at least as well as three-dimensional rings. Our results suggest that late clinical results of tricuspid annuloplasty depend on left-sided pathology and patient factors and less on the type of ring used.
