Title: Outcomes and Predictors for Re-stenosis of Esophageal Stricture in Epidermolysis Bullosa: A Multicenter Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Esophageal strictures are the common gastrointestinal complications in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) requiring dilation. There is limited information on the best type of intervention, outcomes, and predictors for re-stenosis.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the frequency, clinical presentation of esophageal strictures in EB patients, and to ascertain the predictors of re-stenosis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study involving 7 specialized, international EB centers on patients who were 0 to 50 years of age. Descriptive statistics and hazard risks for re-stenosis were calculated.
RESULTS: We identified 125 patients with 497 esophageal stricture episodes over a mean period of observation of 17 (standard deviation [SD] = 11.91) years. Dilations were attempted in 90.74% of episodes, using guided fluoroscopy 45.23%, retrograde endoscopy 33.04%, and antegrade endoscopy 19.07%. Successful dilation was accomplished in 99.33% of attempts. Patients experienced a median of 2 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1-7) stricture episodes with a median interval between dilations of 7 (IQR: 4-12) months. Predictors for re-stenosis included: number of strictures (2 vs 1 stricture: χ = 4.293, P = 0.038, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.294 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.014--1.652 and 3 vs 1 stricture:χ = 7.986, P = 0.005, HR = 1.785 [95% CI: 1.194, 2.667]) and a long (≥1 cm) segment stricture (χ = 4.599, P = 0.032, HR = 1.347 (95% CI: 1.026--1.769). Complications were more common with the endoscopic approach (8/86, antegrade endoscopy; 2 /149, retrograde endoscopy vs 2/204, fluoroscopy; χ = 17.39, P-value <0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: We found excellent dilation outcomes irrespective of the dilation procedure; however, with higher complications in the endoscopic approach. Long (>1 cm) segment involvement and multiple locations were predictive of stricture reoccurrence.
