Title: Safety evaluation of sinus patency after stereotactic radiosurgery for transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas: implications of treatment options for patients with Borden type I fistulas.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in treating transverse-sigmoid sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas (TSS DAVFs), and to investigate post-SRS sinus patency, focusing on the risk factors associated with treated sinus occlusion.
METHODS: Data from 34 patients treated with SRS between January 2006 and April 2023 were analyzed. Detailed angioarchitecture was confirmed using digital subtraction angiography before SRS. Angiography of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery and vertebral artery was performed to evaluate whether the involved side of the TSS was used for normal venous drainage. TSS stenosis was defined as sinus diameter < 50% of the normal proximal diameter. DAVF shunt obliteration, TSS occlusion, neurological status, and adverse events were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 34 patients, 21 had Borden type I and 14 had Borden type II DAVFs. The median age at SRS was 64 years (interquartile range 54-71 years), and the follow-up period was 31 months (interquartile range 15-94 months). Complete shunt obliteration was achieved in 24 (70.6%) patients. The cumulative 2-, 3-, and 5-year shunt obliteration rates were 49.6%, 71.2%, and 86.0%, respectively. Borden type I had higher obliteration rates (60.5%, 83.1%, and 94.4%, respectively) than Borden type II (41.7%, 51.4%, and 75.7%, respectively; p = 0.034). TSS occlusion occurred in 5 patients (14.7%). The cumulative 1-, 5-, and 10-year TSS occlusion rates were 2.9%, 8.3%, and 23.6%, respectively, across the entire cohort. All occlusions occurred exclusively in the sinuses that were not used for normal venous drainage. Cox proportional analyses revealed that TSS stenosis and the sinus not being used for normal venous drainage were significantly associated with a greater risk of TSS occlusion after SRS (HR 9.44, 95% CI 1.01-77.13; p = 0.049).
CONCLUSIONS: SRS is effective and safe for TSS DAVF and results in favorable shunt obliteration, symptom improvement, and low complication rates. TSS occlusion after SRS is asymptomatic and is limited to sinuses that are not used for normal venous drainage.
