Title: Incidence of Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients After Neck Dissection.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of progressive internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) by head and neck contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in 45 patients who underwent neck dissection for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 45 patients who underwent head and neck contrast-enhanced CT before and after surgery for OSCC by the Hu Yongjie team at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial-Head & Neck Oncology of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital in 2016 and were followed up for 5 years.
RESULTS: Comparison of the current CT with previously obtained head and neck contrast-enhanced CT images revealed progressive ICAS in 3 patients with a mean age of 50.0 years. All 3 patients were male, and their OSCC sites were the tongue in 2 patients and the buccal in 1 patient. Tumor resection and neck dissection were performed for all 3 patients. Two patients underwent radiotherapy. In all 3 patients, the ICAS had occurred on the same side as the tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that neck dissection with cervical sheath removal might increase the incidence of ICAS, but this result may need the support of a larger sample size study.
