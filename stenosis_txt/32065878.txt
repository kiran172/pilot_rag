Title: Congenital midnasal stenosis: Conservative management.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Congenital midnasal stenosis (MNS) is an extremely rare disease which may be life threatening, and shows difficulty in diagnosis and management. This case series summarizes superiority of using intranasal mometasone furoate spray (IMS) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat nasal obstruction in neonates with MNS.
METHODS: This study reviewed six consecutive cases of MNS.
RESULTS: Three patients were treated with IMS and CPAP. Two patients were treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation without stenting, followed by IMS and CPAP due to persisting nasal obstruction after the operation. One patient was treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation without stenting alone.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to review the use of CPAP and IMS as an effective therapy for some patients with MNS. It suggests that conservative management with CPAP and IMS may be an alternative therapeutic option to surgery.
