Title: Mitral annular calcification and valvular dysfunction: multimodality imaging evaluation, grading, and management.

Abstract: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) refers to calcium deposition in the fibrous skeleton of the mitral valve. It has many cardiovascular associations, including mitral valve dysfunction, elevated cardiovascular risk, arrhythmias, and endocarditis. Echocardiography conventionally is the first-line imaging modality for anatomic assessment, and evaluation of mitral valve function. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) has demonstrated importance as an imaging modality for the evaluation and planning of related procedures. It also holds promise in quantitative grading of MAC. Currently, there is no universally accepted definition or classification system of MAC severity. We review the multimodality imaging evaluation of MAC and associated valvular dysfunction and propose a novel classification system based on qualitative and quantitative measurements derived from echocardiography and cardiac CT.
