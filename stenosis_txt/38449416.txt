Title: [Two Cases of Portal Vein Stent Placement for Portal Vein Stenosis Due to Recurrence of Pancreatic Cancer].

Abstract: We report 2 cases of portal vein stent placement for malignant portal stenosis due to recurrence of pancreatic cancer with symptoms of portal hypertension. Case 1: The patient was a 68-year-old female. Five years ago, a mass was found around the aorta on a computerized tomography(CT)scan taken after a residual pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. It was diagnosed as lymph node recurrence and S-1 therapy was started. As further tumor enlargement led to portal vein compression, venostasis around the ascending jejunum, anemia, and black stools, a portal vein stent was placed. The portal vein blood flow was improved, the collateral vessels disappeared, and the patient no longer experienced anemia or black stool. Case 2: A 75-year-old female patient underwent a subtotal gastric-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy and combined resection of the portal vein for pancreas head cancer. On a postoperative CT scan taken 6 months later, a mass compressing the portal vein appeared, which was diagnosed as a local recurrence. As thrombocytopenia was observed, a portal vein stent was placed before starting chemotherapy. The portal vein blood flow and the platelet count improved. Portal vein stenting is an effective procedure for malignant portal stenosis, improving portal blood flow and clinical symptoms.
