Title: Long-term prosthetic-associated subclinical thrombotic events evaluation by cardiac CTA after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: incidence and outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To observe prosthetic-associated subclinical thrombotic events (PASTE) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) by cardiac CTA, and assess their impact on long-term patient outcomes.
MATERIALS: We prospectively and consecutively enrolled 188 patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with TAVI from February 2014 to April 2017. At 5 years, 61 of 141 survived patients who had completed annual follow-up CTA (≥ 5 years) were included. We analyzed PASTE by CTA, including hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT), sinus filling defect (SFD), and prosthesis filling defect (PFD). The primary outcome was a major adverse cardiovascular composite outcome (MACCO) of stroke, cardiac re-hospitalization, and bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD); the secondary outcomes were bioprosthetic hemodynamics deterioration (PGmean) and cardiac dysfunction (LVEF).
RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 5.25 years, long-term incidence of HALT, SFD, and PFD were 54.1%, 37.7%, and 73.8%, respectively. In the primary outcome, SFD and early SFD were associated with the MACCO (SFD: p = 0.005; early SFD: p = 0.018), and SFD was a predictor of MACCO (HR: 2.870; 95% CI: 1.010 to 8.154, p = 0.048). In the secondary outcomes, HALT was associated with increased PGmean (p = 0.031), while persistent HALT was correlated with ΔPGmean (β = 0.38, p = 0.035). SFD was negatively correlated with ΔLVEF (β = -0.39, p = 0.041), and early SFD was negatively correlated with LVEF and ΔLVEF (LVEF: r = -0.50, p = 0.041; ΔLVEF: r = -0.53, p = 0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: PASTE were associated with adverse long-term outcomes, bioprosthetic hemodynamics deterioration, and cardiac dysfunction. In particular, SFD was a predictor of MACCO and may be a potential target for anticoagulation after TAVI (NCT02803294).

CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: PASTE, especially SFD, after TAVI based on cardiac CTA findings impacts the long-term outcomes of patients which is a predictor of long-term major adverse outcomes in patients and may be a potential target for anticoagulation after TAVI.
KEY POINTS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is being used more often; associated subclinical thromboses have not been thoroughly evaluated. Prosthetic-associated subclinical thrombotic events were associated with adverse outcomes, bioprosthetic hemodynamics deterioration, and cardiac dysfunction. Studies should be directed at these topics to determine if they should be intervened upon.
