Title: In lupus cystitis, is the urinary tract dilated or obstructed?

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Lupus cystitis is a rare but serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that can cause permanent bladder dysfunction, leading to irreversible deterioration of kidney function. We report two cases of SLE with lupus cystitis who showed different images from the same cause of disease.
METHODS: Patient 1, a 67-year-old woman diagnosed with SLE presented with persistent dysuria for 3 weeks with sudden headache and vomiting. She was hospitalized because of acute kidney injury; the serum creatinine level was 10.68 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) showed significant bilateral ureteral stenosis and bilateral hydronephrosis. Patient 2, a 45-year-old woman diagnosed with SLE presented with dysuria requiring self-catheterization. CT showed significant bilateral ureteral dilatation and bilateral hydronephrosis.
RESULTS: In patient 1, the right kidney was afunctional. Left nephrostomy was performed on Day 2. Her serum creatinine returned to the normal range. In patient 2, After admission, she changed to an indwelling bladder catheter. Her serum creatinine level improved from 2.04 to 1.31 mg/dL.
CONCLUSION: In patients with lupus cystitis, the urinary tract is commonly dilated, but stenosis has been seen in rare case. Physicians should be careful in diagnosing it.
