Title: Low-profile LEO baby stents using dual stenting technique in treating complex intracranial aneurysms located in small artery: Initial and mid-term outcome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms (IAs) was challenging. Our retrospective study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LEO Baby stents using the dual stenting technique for complex IAs.
METHODS: Clinical and angiographic data of 15 IAs located in small arteries treated by LEO Baby stents in our neurosurgical center were retrospectively collected and analyzed between April 2019 to January 2021.
RESULTS: 15 patients received dual stent-assisted coiling procedures and the stent configurations include 7 cases of T- configuration, 5 cases of parallel- configuration, 2 cases of Y- configuration, and 1case of X- configuration. 11 patients received dual stents deployment with only LEO Baby stents and 4 patients received LEO Baby stent combined with LVIS stent. Immediate postprocedural results showed Raymond I in 4 patients (26.7%), Raymond II in 5 patients (33.3%), and Raymond III in 6 patients (40.0%). One patient (6.7%) was confirmed with an ischemic complication during the procedure. All 15 patients (100%) received clinical follow-up ranging between 6 and 28 months. An mRS score of 0-2 was reached in all patients. 13 patients (86.7%) received angiographic clinical follow-up ranging between 6 and 20 months. The results revealed that Raymond I was achieved in 10 patients (76.9%) and Raymond II was achieved in 3 patients (23.1%). One patient (7.7%) in 6 months after the procedure was confirmed with asymptomatic in-stent stenosis.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that dual stents deployment of LEO Baby stents was a feasible strategy for the treatment of complex IAs located in the small arteries.
