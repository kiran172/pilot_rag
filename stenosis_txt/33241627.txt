Title: Impact of early hospital discharge on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: AIMS: Early discharge after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may potentially impact post-procedural safety of the patient. The study aim was to compare safety of TAVI in patients planned for fast track hospital stay with patients planned for standard hospital stay.
METHODS AND RESULTS: All-comers patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI between 2011 and 2017 were allocated to two matched groups depending whether the procedure was performed before or after transition from standard to fast track course. Data on vital status and hospitalizations were obtained through national registries. Three hundred and nineteen matched pairs were eligible for analysis. The median length of post-procedural stay was 3 days (IQR: 2-4) for patients in the fast track group compared to 6 days (IQR: 4-8) in the standard approach group (p < .0001). There was no difference in all-cause mortality between groups at 30-day (1.3% vs. 1.9%, p = .52) or 90-day follow-up (2.9% vs. 4.1%, p = .42). There was no difference in the risk of new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) in pacemaker naïve patients between groups at 30-day (15.8% vs. 21.2%, p = .16) or 90-day follow-up (15.8% vs. 21.9%, p = .12). There was no difference in the rate of rehospitalization between groups between discharge and 90-day follow-up (2.09 per patient-year vs. 2.09 per patient-year, p = .99).
CONCLUSIONS: Early discharge in an all-comers population undergoing transfemoral TAVI is safe with regards to all-cause mortality, need for PPI, and rehospitalization.
