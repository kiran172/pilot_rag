Title: Petrous internal carotid artery aneurysm rupture induced by Eustachian tube catheterisation: case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Petrous internal carotid artery aneurysms are very rare vascular lesions, which may present with otalgia and life-threatening massive otorrhoea.
CASE REPORT: An 84-year-old woman presented at a local otolaryngology clinic with progressive otalgia due to an acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media. She was referred with left-sided massive otorrhoea following Eustachian tube catheterisation. She suffered another massive otorrhoea with epistaxis during left-sided ear cleaning at a clinic visit. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and computed tomography angiography revealed a left-sided aneurysm and adjacent stenosis at the left internal carotid artery. Coil embolisation of the petrous internal carotid artery aneurysm was performed with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty followed by dilatation of the stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Computed tomography angiography should be performed immediately when a patient reports massive otorrhoea. Endovascular occlusion is a treatment option as it avoids complications of open surgical ligation procedures.
