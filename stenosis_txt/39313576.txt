Title: The introduction of a mid-urethral stent for hypospadias surgery in toilet-trained children.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To address the unique challenges presented by hypospadias repair in toilet-trained boys, we propose a modification to the standard stenting technique: implementation of a mid-urethral stent (MUS) extending beyond the urethroplasty, terminating distally to the sphincter mechanism. This modification upholds continence while facilitating normal voiding.
METHODS: Toilet-trained boys undergoing hypospadias repair from 2009 to 2020 were retrospectively assessed. Patients were allocated into one of two groups: "Continent" drainage (a short stent was placed across the urethroplasty) or "incontinent" drainage (a standard stent or a Foley catheter was placed). Stent- related complications (dislodgement and obstruction) and surgical outcomes were compared.
RESULTS: 545 children underwent hypospadias repair with 96 (17.6%) of them toilet-trained. The "continent" and "incontinent" groups consisted of 44 and 52 patients. No differences were found regarding age, severity of hypospadias, number of corrective procedures, operative time or surgical technique. Rates of stent-related complications did not differ. No significant difference was found regarding complications requiring additional surgery, including meatal stenosis and dehiscence. Post-operative fistula occurred in one patient in the continent group and in seven patients in the incontinent group.
CONCLUSION: Use of a continence-preserving MUS is a safe alternative in toilet-trained patients undergoing hypospadias repair without increasing risk of complications.
