Title: The management and outcomes of ABO-incompatible pediatric liver transplantation: Experience of a single Chinese center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the safety of using ABO incompatible (ABO-i) liver grafts in pediatric patients under our prophylactic strategies.
METHODS: A total number of 544 pediatric liver transplantations between January 2013 and December 2017 performed in Organ Transplant Center, Tianjin First Central Hospital were included in this study. The recipients were divided into 3 groups based on the compatibility of donor-recipient blood type matching (ABO-identical group, n = 352, ABO-compatible group, n = 121 and ABO-incompatible group, n = 71). Recipient characteristics, perioperative data, postoperative complications and recipient survival rate were compared. The recipient outcomes between living-related and non-living-related ABO-incompatible liver graft recipients were also compared.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time in three groups were 3.4 (1.8, 6.4) years, 3.2 (1.8, 6.1) years and 2.8 (1.8, 6.2) years, without statistical difference. The cumulative 1-year and 3-year graft survival rate were 94.3% and 94.0% in ABO-id group, 93.1% and 93.1% in ABO-c group and 97.1% and 97.1% in ABO-i group. The cumulative 1-year and 3-year recipient survival rate were 96.1% and 95.5% in ABO-id group, 94.8% and 94.8% in ABO-c group and 97.1% and 97.1% in ABO-i group, respectively. No significant difference was seen among three groups. The recipient characteristics and perioperative data were similar among three groups. The recipients in ABO-i group showed significantly lower incidence of portal vein stenosis. Apart from that, three groups shared equal incidence of other surgical complications and acute rejection. Among ABO-i liver graft recipients, the cumulative 1-year and 3-year recipient survival rate were 98.2% and 98.2% in living donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients and 92.9% and 92.9% in deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) recipients, without significant difference. The incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis was significantly higher in DDLT group compared with LDLT group, while the other complications were similar between two groups.
CONCLUSION: Our data revealed that the application of ABO-i liver grafts in pediatric liver transplantation under rational peri-operative management strategy is a safe measure to increase donor availability for pediatric patients in Chinese population.
