Title: [Calcification distributional density of the aortic-valvular complex is an independent risk factor for conduction block following self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve replacement].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of calcification distributional density in different regions of aortic-valvular complex (AVC) on postoperative new-onset conduction block (CB) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using self-expandable valves (SEV) made in China.
METHODS: From January, 2016 to December, 2022, 73 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis received Venus-A prosthetic valve replacement using SEV made in China, and postoperative new-onset CB occurred in 18 (24.7%) of the patients. The baseline data, imaging and intervention- related data were compared were between the patients with CB and those without CB. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for investigating the independent risk factors for new- onset CB after TAVR, and the predictive performance of these risk factors was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and DeLong test.
RESULTS: Compared with those with CB, the patients experiencing postoperative new-onset CB had a greater implantation depth (6.77±2.45 mm vs 5.11±3.28 mm, P=0.027), a smaller difference between the membranous septum length and the implantation depth (MSID) (0.68±3.49 mm vs 2.82±3.88 mm, P= 0.036), and a higher calcification distributional density of the left coronary sinus (LCS) in the device landing zone (DLZ) (P= 0.026). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that DLZ-LCS calcification distributional density and MSID were independent risk (protective) factors for new-onset CB following TAVR. ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC of MSID and DLZ-LCS calcification distributional density was 0.775 and 0.716, respectively, and their combination had had a significantly higher AUC of 0.890 (P=0.041 and 0.027, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The DLZ-LCS calcification distributional density is an independent risk factor for new-onset CB following TAVR using SEV. The conduction complications following TAVR can be effectively predicted using this calcification indicator combined with MSID.
