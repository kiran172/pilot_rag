Title: [Proximal incisal edge length and recent clinical observation of Siewert type Ⅱ advanced esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the clinical effect of the radical resection with a proximal incisal edge length of 20-25 mm and 30-35 mm in Siewert type Ⅱ advanced esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma, to shorten the minimum safe distance of the proximal incisal edge to 20-25 mm. Methods: A retrospective cohort study method was used. The clinical data of 166 patients with Siewert type Ⅱ advanced esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma who underwent total gastrectomy from January 2017 to August 2020 in the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Heji Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College were retrospectively collected. According to the proximal incisal edge length, the patients were divided into two groups: the proximal incisal edge length of 20-25 mm group (69 cases) and 30-35 mm group (97 cases). The perioperative conditions and the 6-month follow-up after the operation were compared between the two groups. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in baseline information between the patients in the two groups (P&gt;0.05). The operations of both groups were completed. The intraoperative operation time of the proximal incisal edge length of 20-25 mm group was shorter than that in the proximal incisal edge length of 30-35 mm group ((172±24)and(206±27)min, P&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in the amount of intraoperative blood loss, the treatment of the diaphragm during the operation and the positive rate of intraoperative freezing of the upper incisal edge between the patients in the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). And there was no significant differences in the first exhaust time, gastric tube removal time, first feeding time and hospital stay after the operation of the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). There was no significant differences in the incidence of anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stenosis, reflux esophagitis and intestinal obstruction after the operation between the patients in the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). And there was no anastomotic leakage case among the 69 cases in the proximal incisal edge length of 20-25 mm group. Postoperative pathological treatment showed no significant differences in the vascular tumor thrombus and nerve infiltration between the two groups (both P&gt;0.05). During the 6-month follow-up, there was no death or tumor recurrence in the two groups, and there was no significant difference in body weight loss at 6 months after the operation between the two groups (P=0.178). Conclusion: When radical resection of Siewert type Ⅱ advanced esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma is performed, it is feasible to shorten the minimum safe distance of the proximal incisal edge to 20-25 mm under the premise of ensuring R0 resection. The operation time is shortened. Due to the shortening the incisal edge distance, the anastomotic tension is decreased, and the incidence of postoperative anastomotic leakage is also reduced.
