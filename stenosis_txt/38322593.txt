Title: Predictive Value of CFIm25 Expression in Peripheral Blood Monocytes for Coronary Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Background: Cleavage factor Im25 (CFIm25) regulates cell function by affecting mRNA editing processes and plays diverse roles in various diseases. Studies have found that peripheral blood monocytes are valuable in diagnosing and prognosing coronary atherosclerosis. However, no studies have examined the predictive value of CFIm25 expression in peripheral blood monocytes for coronary atherosclerosis. Methods and Results: We collected the coronary angiography results of 267 patients and calculated the Gensini score to evaluate their degree of coronary atherosclerosis. We isolated peripheral blood monocytes and detected CFIm25 RNA expression. Based on their Gensini score, we divided the patients into negative (0, n = 46), mild lesion (≤ 8, n = 71), moderate lesion (8-23, n = 76), and severe lesion (≥ 23, n = 74) groups. Results showed that CFIm25 expression correlated negatively with the Gensini score and the number of involved coronary vessels. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses showed that CFIm25 expression in peripheral blood monocytes was a protective factor for severe lesions, ≥ 50% stenosis, and three-vessel lesions. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CFIm25 expression for predicting lesions, severe lesions, ≥50% stenosis, and three-vessel lesions were 0.743, 0.735, 0.791, and 0.736, respectively. Conclusions: CFIm25 expression in peripheral blood monocytes correlates negatively with the degree of coronary atherosclerosis and helps predict the severity and number of coronary artery lesions.
