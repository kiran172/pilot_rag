Title: Circumferential Decompression Technique of Posterior Endoscopic Cervical Foraminotomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Cervical osseous foraminal stenosis (COFS) results from the uncinate process and facet hyperostosis. Currently, the optimal surgical technique for the treatment of COFS remains controversial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with COFS presenting radiculopathy underwent posterior endoscopic cervical foraminotomy by the circumferential decompression technique. The neck disability index (NDI), the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the modified MacNab criteria were used to evaluate the outcomes. In addition, the range of motion (ROM) and the slippage distance between the operated vertebrae in flexion-extension position were measured to evaluate the stability of the cervical spine.
RESULTS: There were 24 consecutive patients in the study. The mean follow-up period was 16.2 months (range: 12-26 months). The NDI and VAS scores for arm/neck pain improved significantly from preoperatively to the last follow-up. The satisfaction rate by modified MacNab criteria was 91.7% on the third postoperative day and 100% on the day of final follow-up. There were no significant differences in intervertebral ROM or slippage distance between the last follow-up and preoperatively (P = 0.968, P = 0.394). Arm pain occurred in one patient, and sustained fingers numbness in two patients, but these symptoms resolved at the last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Posterior endoscopic cervical foraminotomy by the circumferential decompression technique is a safe and effective treatment for COFS. Moreover, it preserves the stability and physiological mobility of the cervical spine.
