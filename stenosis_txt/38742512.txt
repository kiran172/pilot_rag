Title: Stress Echocardiography by the ABCDE Protocol ln the Assessment of Prognosis of Stable Coronary Heart Disease.

Abstract: AIM: To assess the role of clinical indicators and parameters of stress echocardiography performed according to an extended protocol as predictors for the occurrence of a composite cardiovascular endpoint (CCVEP) in IHD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 186 patients (60.2% men, mean age 60.6±9.9 years) with an established (n=73; 39.2%) and suspected (60.8%) diagnosis of IHD. Stress EchoCG with adenosine triphosphate (38.2%), transesophageal pacing (15.1%), dobutamine (2.6%), and bicycle ergometry on a recumbent ergometer (44.1%) was performed. The stress EchoCG protocol included assessment of regional wall motion abnormalities (WMA), B-lines, LV contractile reserve (CTR), coronary reserve (CR), and heart rate reserve. The median follow-up period was 13 [9; 20] months. The composite CCVEP included death from cardiovascular diseases and their complications, acute coronary syndrome, and revascularization and was defined at the first of these events. Statistical analysis was performed with the Statistica 16.0 and SPSS Statistics 23.0 software packages. Differences were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05.
RESULTS: Invasive or noninvasive coronary angiography was performed in 90.3% of patients; obstructive coronary disease (stenosis ≥50%) was detected in 67.9% of cases. During the follow-up period, 58 (31.2%) patients had cardiovascular complications. The risk of developing CCVEP was associated with the pretest probability (PTP) of ischemic heart disease (odds ratio, OR, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.02-1.08), dyslipidemia (DLP) (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.20-0.82), carotid atherosclerosis (OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.18-0.86), LV ejection fraction (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99), appearance at peak stress of new significant (2 LV segments or more) regional WMAs (OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.18-6.55), decreased LV CTR (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.27-0.79) and CR (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.61); p&lt;0.05 for all. In a multivariate analysis with Cox regression, the model with clinical indicators included PTP of IHD (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07; p=0.01) and DLP (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.02-1.01; p=0.05) as predictors. The model with stress EchoCG parameters included the appearance of new significant WMAs (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16-0.65; p=0.001) and reduced &lt;2.0 CR (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.24-0.82; p=0.01). A comparative analysis of Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed statistically significant differences in the dynamics of the CCVEP occurrence depending on the absence or presence of hemodynamically significant WMAs and/or reduced CR during stress EchoCG (p&lt;0.01).
CONCLUSION: Reduced LV CR and WMA during stress EchoCG in patients with suspected or confirmed IHD are significant independent predictors for the CCVEP occurrence. Among clinical indicators, PTP of IHD and DLP are of the greatest importance for prognosis.
