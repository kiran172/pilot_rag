Title: Systolic High-Pitch Coronary CT Angiography for Evaluation of the Coronary Arteries in Heart Transplant Recipients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, image quality, and radiation dose of high-pitch coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) recipients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twenty-two consecutive OHT recipients (16 men, six women; median age, 66.5 years [interquartile range, 51.3-70.3 years]; median heart rate, 91 beats/min [interquartile range, 79.3-97.3 beats/min]) underwent CCTA with a third-generation dual-source CT scanner in high-pitch mode to rule out coronary allograft vasculopathy. Data acquisition was triggered at 30% of the R-R interval. Two independent observers blindly assessed image quality on a per-segment, per-vessel, and per-patient basis using a 4-point scale (4, excellent; 1, not evaluative). Scores 2-4 indicated diagnostic quality. Studies were compared with previously performed retrospective ECG-gated examinations, when available. Interobserver agreement on the image quality was assessed with kappa statistics. Radiation dose was recorded. RESULTS. A total of 322 coronary segments were evaluated. Diagnostic image quality was observed in 97.5% of the segments. Interobserver agreement for image quality assessment was very good on a per-patient (κ = 0.82), per-vessel (κ = 0.83), and per-segment basis (κ = 0.89). The median per-patient image quality score was 4.0 (3.0-4.0) for the entire coronary tree. A comparison of image quality scores between high-pitch and retrospective ECG-gated CCTA examinations showed no significant differences, but the estimated mean radiation dose was significantly lower for the high-pitch mode (median dose-length product, 31.6 mGy × cm [interquartile range, 23.1-38.8 mGy × cm] vs 736.5 mGy × cm [interquartile range, 655.5-845.7 mGy × cm], p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION. Performing single-heartbeat high-pitch CCTA during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle in OHT recipients results in diagnostic image quality in coronary angiograms at very low radiation dose.
