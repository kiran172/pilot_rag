Title: Risk and Timing of Noncardiac Surgery After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Noncardiac surgery after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a clinical challenge with concerns about safety and optimal management.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate perioperative risk of adverse events associated with noncardiac surgery after TAVI by timing of surgery, type of surgery, and TAVI valve performance.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted using data from a prospective TAVI registry of patients at the tertiary care University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. All patients undergoing noncardiac surgery after TAVI were identified. Data were analyzed from November through December 2021.
EXPOSURES: Timing, clinical urgency, and risk category of noncardiac surgery were assessed among patients who had undergone TAVI and subsequent noncardiac surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A composite of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major or life-threatening bleeding within 30 days after noncardiac surgery.
RESULTS: Among 2238 patients undergoing TAVI between 2013 and 2020, 300 patients (mean [SD] age, 81.8 [6.6] years; 144 [48.0%] women) underwent elective (160 patients) or urgent (140 patients) noncardiac surgery after TAVI and were included in the analysis. Of these individuals, 63 patients (21.0%) had noncardiac surgery within 30 days of TAVI. Procedures were categorized into low-risk (21 patients), intermediate-risk (190 patients), and high-risk (89 patients) surgery. Composite end points occurred within 30 days of surgery among 58 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 19.7%; 95% CI, 15.6%-24.7%). There were no significant differences in baseline demographics between patients with the 30-day composite end point and 242 patients without this end point, including mean (SD) age (81.3 [7.1] years vs 81.9 [6.5] years; P = .28) and sex (25 [43.1%] women vs 119 [49.2%] women; P = .37). Timing (ie, ≤30 days from TAVI to noncardiac surgery), urgency, and risk category of surgery were not associated with increased risk of the end point. Moderate or severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.33; 95% CI, 1.37-3.95; P = .002) and moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation (aHR, 3.61; 95% CI 1.25-10.41; P = .02) were independently associated with increased risk of the end point.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that noncardiac surgery may be performed early after successful TAVI. Suboptimal device performance, such as prosthesis-patient mismatch and paravalvular regurgitation, was associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes after noncardiac surgery.
