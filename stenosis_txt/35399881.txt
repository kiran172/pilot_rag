Title: Review/Perspective: Operations for Cauda Equina Syndromes - "The Sooner the Better".

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although most studies recommended that early surgery for cauda equina syndromes (CES) be performed within <48 h., the largest and most comprehensive Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database (NISC) series, involving over 25,000 CES patients recommended that time be shortened to 0-<24 h. In short, CES surgery performed "the sooner the better," was best.
METHODS: The 2 major variants of CES include; incomplete/partial ICES, and those with urinary retention/bowel incontinence (RCES). Those with ICES often exhibit varying combinations of motor weakness, sensory loss (i.e. including perineal numbness), and urinary dysfunction, while RCES patients typically exhibit more severe paraparesis, sensory loss including saddle anesthesia, and urinary/bowel incontinence. The pathology responsible for ICES/RCES syndromes may include; acute disc herniations/stenosis, trauma (i.e. including iatrogenic/ surgical hematomas etc.), infections, abscesses, and other pathology. Surgery for either ICES/RCES may include decompressions to multilevel laminectomies/fusions.
RESULTS: Following early surgery, most studies showed that ICES and RCES patients exhibited improvement in motor weakness and sensory loss. However, recovery of sphincter function was more variable, being poorer for RCES patients with preoperative urinary retention/bowel incontinence.
CONCLUSIONS: Although early CES surgery was defined in most studies as <48 h., two large NISC series involving over 25, 000 CES patients showed that CES surgery performed within 0 -< 24 h resulted in the best outcomes.
