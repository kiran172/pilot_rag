Title: Utility of Minimally Invasive Cardiovascular Monitoring in the High-Risk Patient Undergoing Radical Cystoprostatectomy: A Case Report.

Abstract: Non-cardiac surgery in a high-risk patient with severe mitral stenosis (MS) and severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents a significant anesthetic challenge. Guidelines recommend using advanced hemodynamic monitors for specific cardiovascular goals. The gold standard for intraoperative monitoring in these cases is the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). This case discusses the successful management of a severe MS patient undergoing cystoprostatectomy using a minimally invasive cardiovascular monitor (MICM) incorporating several hemodynamic parameters.
