Title: Analysis of Genetic Variants in the Glucocorticoid Receptor Gene NR3C1 and Stenosis of the Carotid Artery in a Polish Population with Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Early diagnosis and elimination of risk factors are crucial for better managing CVDs. Atherosclerosis, whose development might be associated with glucocorticoids (GCs), is a critical factor in the development of carotid artery (CA) stenosis and most other CVDs. Aim: To investigate the association of Tth111I, N363S, and ER22/23EK-NR3C1 polymorphisms and the incidence of CA stenosis. Methods: The study group consisted of 117 patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and CA stenosis and 88 patients with CAD and ruled out CA stenosis. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood, and genotyping was carried out using Tth111I, N363S, and ER22/23EK-NR3C1 polymorphism sequencing. Results: No significant association between studied polymorphisms and the incidence or the severity of CA stenosis in the Polish population with CAD was found. Conclusion: This is the first study that proves that common NR3C1 gene variants do not influence CA stenosis and probably are not associated with atherosclerosis. The search for genes that can act as prognostic markers in predicting CA stenosis is still ongoing.
