Title: Proteomic Analysis in Valvular Cardiomyopathy: Aortic Regurgitation vs. Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling after aortic valve (AV) surgery is less predictable in chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) than in aortic stenosis (AS). We aimed to disclose specific LV myocardial protein signatures possibly contributing to differential disease progression. Global protein profiling of LV myocardial samples excised from the subaortic interventricular septum in patients with isolated AR or AS undergoing AV surgery was performed using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Based on label-free quantitation protein intensities, a logistic regression model was calculated and adjusted for age, sex and protein concentration. Web-based functional enrichment analyses of phenotype-associated proteins were performed utilizing g:Profiler and STRING. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD039662. Lysates from 38 patients, including 25 AR and 13 AS samples, were analyzed. AR patients presented with significantly larger LV diameters and volumes (end-diastolic diameter: 61 (12) vs. 48 (13) mm, p &lt; 0.001; end-diastolic volume: 180.0 (74.6) vs. 92.3 (78.4), p = 0.001). A total of 171 proteins were associated with patient phenotype: 117 were positively associated with AR and the enrichment of intracellular compartment proteins (i.e., assigned to carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism, protein biosynthesis and the proteasome) was detected. Additionally, 54 were positively associated with AS and the enrichment of extracellular compartment proteins (i.e., assigned to the immune and hematopoietic system) was observed. In summary, functional enrichment analysis revealed specific AR- and AS-associated signatures of LV myocardial proteins.
