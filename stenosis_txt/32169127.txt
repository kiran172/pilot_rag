Title: Correlation Between the Severity of Coronary Artery Ectasia and Monocyte/Lymphocyte, Platelet/Lymphocyte, and HDL/LDL Ratios.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the monocyte/lymphocyte, platelet/lymphocyte, and HDL/LDL ratios as markers of the severity of coronary artery ectasia(CE).
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Cardiology, Izmir Katip Celebi University and Balikesir University, Turkey, from January 2017 to October 2018.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 7,923 coronary angiographs were retrospectively scanned. Inclusion criteria was >1.5 times dilatated of native coronary artery segment. Exclusion criteria was <1.5 times or no dilatation of native coronary segment compared with normal coronary segment. Demographic features, CE type, clinic status, monocyte/lymphocyte, platelet/ lymphocyte and HDL/LDL ratios are collected.
RESULTS: Two hundred and six (2.6%) cases were identified, which had a mean age of 61.4 Â±11.4 years. The male to female ratio was 3:1; and 46% of the patients presented with unstable angina. The prevalence of CE was 2.6%; and 118 (57.2%) patients had non-obstructive coronary artery disease. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking were the most commonly seen disorders. Markis Type 4 was the most common type of CE determined. A statistically significant correlation was determined among the monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, and the increased diameter of ectasia of the vessel.
CONCLUSION: Although there should be awareness of CE, many clinicians do not pay as much attention to CE as to coronary stenosis. The results of this study showed that the monocyte/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio are consistent with the ectasia severity. This correlation will be useful for the evaluation of follow-up and treatment success in patients with CE.
