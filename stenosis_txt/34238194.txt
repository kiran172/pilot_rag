Title: Contrast-induced Nephropathy in Non-cardiac Vascular Procedures, A Narrative Review: Part 1.

Abstract: Contrast-induced Nephropathy (CIN) is animportant complication of iodinated Contrast Medium (CM) administration, being associated with both short- and long-term adverse outcomes (e.g., cardiorenal events, longer hospital stay and mortality). CIN has been mainly studied in relation to cardiac procedures but it can also occur following non-cardiac vascular interventions. This is Part 1 of a narrative review summarizing the available literature on CIN after non-cardiac vascular diagnostic or therapeutic procedures for aortic aneurysm and carotid stenosis. We discuss the definition, pathophysiology, incidence, risk factors, biomarkers and consequences of CIN in these settings, as well as preventive strategies and alternatives to limit iodinated CM use. Physicians and vascular surgeons should be aware of CM-related adverse events and the potential strategies to avoid it. Clearly, more research in this important field is required.
