Title: Clinical Outcomes of Proximal Gastrectomy versus Total Gastrectomy for Proximal Gastric Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The extent of optimal gastric resection for proximal gastric cancer (PGC) continues to remain controversial, and a final consensus is yet to be met. The current study aimed to compare the perioperative outcomes, postoperative complications, and overall survival (OS) of proximal gastrectomy (PG) versus total gastrectomy (TG) in the treatment of PGC through a meta-analysis.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for articles published in English since database establishment to October 2019. Evaluated endpoints were perioperative outcomes, postoperative complications, and long-term survival outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 2,896 patients in 25 full-text articles were included, of which one was a prospective randomized study, one was a clinical phase III trial, and the rest were retrospective comparative studies. The PG group showed a higher incidence of anastomotic stenosis (OR = 2.21 [95% CI: 1.08-4.50]; p = 0.03) and reflux symptoms (OR = 3.33 [95% CI: 1.85-5.99]; p < 0.001) when compared with the TG group, while no difference was found in PG patients with double-tract reconstruction (DTR). The retrieved lymph nodes were clearly more in the TG group (WMD = -10.46 [95% CI: -12.76 to -8.17]; p < 0.001). The PG group was associated with a better 5-year OS relative to TG with 11 included studies (OR = 1.35 [95% CI: 1.03-1.77]; p = 0.03). After stratification for early gastric cancer and PG with DTR groups, however, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (OR = 1.35 [95% CI: 0.59-2.45]; p = 0.62).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, PG was associated with a visible improved long-term survival outcome for all irrespective of tumor stage, while a similar 5-year OS for only early gastric cancer patients between the 2 groups. Future randomized clinical trials of esophagojejunostomy techniques, such as DTR following PG, are expected to prevent postoperative complications and assist surgeons in the choice of surgical approach for PGC patients.
