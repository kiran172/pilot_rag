Title: Pituitary apoplexy causing acute ischemic stroke: Which treatment should be given priority.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy is syndrome of sudden onset of headache, visual loss, pituitary dysfunction, and altered consciousness. Pituitary apoplexy followed by acute cerebral ischemia is extremely rare. Here, we introduced the case of successful surgical resection of pituitary adenoma which induced acute cerebral ischemia.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 78-year-old man with a known pituitary macroadenoma presented with decreased consciousness and left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) showed large pituitary macroadenoma with hemorrhage and diffusion-perfusion mismatch of right internal carotid artery (ICA) territory. Conventional angiography was done and severe stenosis of bilateral ICA and prominent flow delay of left ICA were noted at paraclinoid segment. Microscopic tumor mass removal with transsphenoidal approach was performed. Final pathological diagnosis was pituitary adenoma with apoplexy. Immediately after surgery, his symptoms were disappeared. Follow-up image studies revealed much improved perfusion in right ICA territory and patency of bilateral ICAs.
CONCLUSION: Direct compression of ICA is rare complication of pituitary apoplexy, which caused cerebral ischemia. Conventional angiography should be necessary for accurate diagnosis and prompt surgical decompression should be the treatment of choice.
