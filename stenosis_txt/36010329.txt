Title: Arteriovenous Hemodialysis Access Stenosis Diagnosed by Duplex Doppler Ultrasonography: A Review.

Abstract: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is currently the hemodialysis access with the longest life expectations for the patients. However, even the AVF is at risk for many complications, especially the development of stenosis. The latter can not only lead to inadequate hemodialysis but also lead to AVF thrombosis. Duplex Doppler ultrasonography is a very precise method, in the hands of experienced professionals, for the diagnosis of AVF complications. In this review, we summarize the ultrasound diagnostic criteria of significant stenoses and their indication for procedural therapy.
