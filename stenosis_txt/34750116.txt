Title: Development and clinical translation of tubular constructs for tracheal tissue engineering: a review.

Abstract: Effective restoration of extensive tracheal damage arising from cancer, stenosis, infection or congenital abnormalities remains an unmet clinical need in respiratory medicine. The trachea is a 10-11â€…cm long fibrocartilaginous tube of the lower respiratory tract, with 16-20 tracheal cartilages anterolaterally and a dynamic trachealis muscle posteriorly. Tracheal resection is commonly offered to patients suffering from short-length tracheal defects, but replacement is required when the trauma exceeds 50% of total length of the trachea in adults and 30% in children. Recently, tissue engineering (TE) has shown promise to fabricate biocompatible tissue-engineered tracheal implants for tracheal replacement and regeneration. However, its widespread use is hampered by inadequate re-epithelialisation, poor mechanical properties, insufficient revascularisation and unsatisfactory durability, leading to little success in the clinical use of tissue-engineered tracheal implants to date. Here, we describe in detail the historical attempts and the lessons learned for tracheal TE approaches by contextualising the clinical needs and essential requirements for a functional tracheal graft. TE manufacturing approaches explored to date and the clinical translation of both TE and non-TE strategies for tracheal regeneration are summarised to fully understand the big picture of tracheal TE and its impact on clinical treatment of extensive tracheal defects.
