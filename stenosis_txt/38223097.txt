Title: Noninvasive transthoracic doppler flow velocity and invasive thermodilution to assess coronary flow reserve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary flow reserve (CFR) provides prognostication and coronary physiological information, including epicardial coronary stenosis and microvascular function. The relationship between stress transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TDE)-derived coronary flow velocity reserve (CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub>) and thermodilution-derived coronary flow reserve (CFR<sub>thermo</sub>) before and after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unclear.
METHODS: This single-center prospective registry study evaluated patients who underwent fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided elective PCI for left anterior descending artery (LAD) lesions with wire-based invasive physiological measurements and pre- and post-PCI stress TDE examinations.
RESULTS: A total of 174 LAD lesions from 174 patients were included in the final analysis. A modest correlation was detected between the pre-PCI CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> and the pre-PCI CFR<sub>thermo</sub> (r=0.383, P&lt;0.001). The frequently used CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> threshold of 2.0 corresponded to a pre-PCI CFR<sub>thermo</sub> of 2.18. Pre-PCI CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> underestimated pre-PCI CFR<sub>thermo</sub> [1.89 (1.44-2.31) vs. 2.05 (1.38-2.93), P&lt;0.001]. Both CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> and CFR<sub>thermo</sub> increased significantly post-PCI [pre-PCI CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> 1.89 vs. post-PCI CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> 2.33, P&lt;0.001; pre-PCI CFR<sub>thermo</sub> 2.05 (1.38-2.93) vs. post-PCI CFR<sub>thermo</sub> 2.59 (1.63-3.55), P&lt;0.001]. In contrast, there was no significant relationship between changes in CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> and changes in CFR<sub>thermo</sub> after PCI (r=0.008, P=0.915) or between post-PCI CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> and post-PCI CFR<sub>thermo</sub> (r=0.054, P=0.482).
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-PCI CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> and CFR<sub>thermo</sub> are modestly correlated, but post-PCI CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> and CFR<sub>thermo</sub> have no correlation. CFR<sub>S-TDE</sub> and CFR<sub>thermo</sub> are not interchangeable, particularly post-PCI, suggesting that the two metrics represent different coronary physiologies after PCI.
