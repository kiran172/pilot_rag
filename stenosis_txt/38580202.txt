Title: Cardiac Surgery After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Trends and Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Reports of cardiac operations after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and early TAVR explantation are increasing. The purpose of this report is to document trends and outcomes of cardiac surgery after initial TAVR.
METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database was queried for all adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery after a previously placed TAVR between January 2012 and March 2023. This identified an overall cohort and 2 subcohorts: nonaortic valve operations and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) after previous TAVR. Cohorts were examined with descriptive statistics, trend analyses, and 30-day outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 5457 patients who were identified, 2485 (45.5%) underwent non-SAVR cardiac surgery, and 2972 (54.5%) underwent SAVR. The frequency of cardiac surgery after TAVR increased 4235.3% overall and 144.6% per year throughout the study period. The incidence of operative mortality and stroke were 15.5% and 4.5%, respectively. Existing The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk models performed poorly, because observed-to-expected mortality ratios were significantly >1.0. Among those undergoing SAVR after TAVR, increasing preoperative surgical urgency, age, dialysis, need for SAVR, and concomitant procedures were associated with increased mortality, whereas type of TAVR explant was not.
CONCLUSIONS: The need for cardiac surgery, including redo SAVR after TAVR, is increasing rapidly. Risks are higher, and outcomes are worse than predicted. These data should closely inform heart team decisions if TAVR is considered at lowering age and risk profiles in the absence of longitudinal evidence.
