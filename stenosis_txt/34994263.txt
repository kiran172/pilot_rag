Title: High flow arteriovenous malformation with transverse-sigmoid sinus stenosis and congestive venopathy mimicking DAVF.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations commonly present with hemorrhage, seizures, headache and other symptomatology. However, AVMs presenting as venous hypertension, owing to downstream stenosis/occlusion of venous sinuses, are very rare. This presentation is much more common in patients with dural AVFs.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a young lady with left frontal arteriovenous malformation with bilateral transverse-sigmoid sinus stenosis, presenting with features of venous hypertension, which was treated with surgical excision of AVM. This case demonstrates a rare example of AVM with co-existing venous sinus stenosis distal to the nidus.
CONCLUSIONS: High flow AVMs may co-exist with venous sinus stenosis or occlusion and lead to congestive venopathy. Treatment of AVM with surgical resection can be performed safely to relieve the hyper-dynamic venous congestion.
