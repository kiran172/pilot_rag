Title: Assessment of Intracoronary Adenosine-Induced Hyperemia in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in Comparison with Patients in Sinus Rhythm.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is routinely used to evaluate coronary stenosis in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), although no studies currently address its reliability in this particular population. The clinical impact of correct assessment of coronary stenosis in AF is particularly high in light of the antithrombotic therapy imposed by both AF and coronary stenting.
OBJECTIVES: Given the hemodynamic variability and microvascular dysfunction described in AF, the aim of this study was to evaluate the hyperemic response to intracoronary adenosine in AF in comparison with sinus rhythm (SR).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study included 36 patients in AF and 36 patients in SR. The hyperemic curves were derived in a subset of patients where the required information was available (n = 16 AF, n = 10 SR). AF patients presented a hyperemic response after intracoronary administration of adenosine, which was equivalent to SR in terms of magnitude and time to maximal hyperemia.
CONCLUSION: There is equivalent hyperemic response in FFR-guided revascularization in AF versus SR population. Our findings support the use of FFR in evaluating intermediate coronary stenosis in AF.
