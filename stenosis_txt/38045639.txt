Title: Successful Treatment of Recurrent Pyloric Stenosis Using Balloon Dilation.

Abstract: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a common surgical disease in infants, with an incidence of 2 to 5 cases per 1000 live births. It often presents with nonbilious projectile vomiting after feeding and a mid-epigastric mass in infants between the third and eighth weeks of life. Ramstedt pyloromyotomy remains the gold standard of treatment. Postoperative emesis is common; however, further evaluation for incomplete pyloromyotomy and recurrent pyloric stenosis should be conducted with prolonged, or new-onset postoperative emesis. While repeat pyloromyotomy is the standard of care for infants presenting with incomplete pyloric stenosis, treatment for the rare development of recurrent pyloric stenosis is not clearly outlined. Here, we report a successful balloon dilation procedure in an 8-week-old female with recurrent pyloric stenosis three and a half weeks after the initial laparoscopic pyloromyotomy.
