Title: Outcomes and Quality of Life After Ross Reintervention: Would You Make the Same Choice Again?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Ross procedure was introduced as a long-term if not definitive solution for aortic pathology. However, the rate of reoperation is not negligible.
METHODS: This single-center prospective study assessed the general outcome of Ross reoperation and patients' perceived quality of life compared with 2 control groups (Ross non-reoperation and mechanical aortic valve replacement). Patient's preference regarding the choice between mechanical aortic valve and Ross procedure was investigated in a subgroup that could theoretically have been directed to either of the 2 procedures.
RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2017, 64 consecutive patients underwent reoperation after Ross. Median age was 31 years. Median freedom from reoperation after the Ross procedure was 136 months. An autograft reoperation was required in 49, and 25 had homograft failure. No in-hospital death was recorded. Mean follow-up was 77 months (range, 6-164 months). Quality of life was assessed with the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire. The Ross reoperation group showed a lower score involving psychological concerns compared with the other groups. In the reoperated-on patients group, 52 had adequate aortic annulus dimensions to receive a prosthetic valve instead of a Ross procedure. When asked whether they would make the same choice, only 31% confirmed the preference.
CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations after Ross procedure have low mortality and morbidity. Long-term follow-up showed a high quality of life, even after reoperations. However, owing to psychological concerns after the redo operation, when choosing a Ross procedure, it is our duty to thoroughly explain to patients that a high level of disillusion is predictable in case of reoperations.
