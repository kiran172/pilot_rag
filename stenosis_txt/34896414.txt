Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Regurgitation Caused by Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Aortic regurgitation (AR) in patients with Takayasu arteritis is considered a relatively common clinical condition. Aortic valve replacement as a surgical treatment, however, is known to have a high risk of postoperative prosthetic valve detachment or anastomotic pseudoaneurysm. This pilot study reports on an initial experience with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for AR caused by Takayasu arteritis. The outcome suggests that TAVR may be a potentially feasible alternative treatment option for AR in Takayasu arteritis, especially in relatively older and vulnerable patients.
