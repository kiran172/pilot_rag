Title: Reduced histologic neo in-stent restenosis after use of a paclitaxel-coated cutting balloon in porcine coronary arteries.

Abstract: The incidence of in-stent restenosis (ISR) has declined dramatically, but once it develops, no current treatment option, such as drug-eluting stents, drug-coated balloons, or cutting balloons (CBs), prevents re-narrowing of the stented atherosclerotic artery. In this preclinical study, we aimed to improve the efficacy of ISR treatment by coating CBs with paclitaxel (paclitaxel-eluting cutting balloon; PECB) and to characterize the histological features of neo-ISRs that arise after ISR treatment. ISR was induced by bare metal stent (BMS) implantation in coronary arteries in pigs. After one month of follow-up, the BMS-induced ISR was treated with either CB or PECB. After another month, we performed quantitative coronary angiography, explanted the treated arteries and assessed histopathological and histomorphometric parameters. In addition, we compared the histological features of neo-ISRs with pre-treatment ISRs. Injury, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and endothelialization scores were similar between the CB and PECB groups at one month after ISR treatment. Neointimal area (0.87±0.61 vs. 1.95±1.14 mm², p=0.02), mean neointimal thickness (0.40±0.39 vs. 0.99±0.56 mm, p=0.01), and percent area stenosis (27.3±20.4 vs. 48.3±22.9%, p=0.04) were decreased in PECB-treated coronary arteries compared to CB-treated arteries, respectively. Density of cells (predominantly smooth muscle cells; SMCs) was increased in neo-ISRs (3.51±3.05×10³ vs. 6.35±2.57×10³ cells/mm², p<0.01), but significantly more CD68⁺ and CD20⁺ cells were found in the pre-treatment ISRs. In conclusion, PECB treatment of ISRs led to better results in terms of smaller neointimal area and %area stenosis of the neo-ISR. SMC density was increased in neo-ISRs in contrast with higher percentage of CD68⁺ and CD20⁺ cells in pre-treatment ISRs.
