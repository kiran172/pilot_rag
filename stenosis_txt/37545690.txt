Title: Now You See Me Now You Don't: Subaortic Membrane Causing a Diagnostic Dilemma.

Abstract: Subaortic stenosis secondary to subaortic membrane is the second most common form of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. We present the case of a 70-year-old male patient who presented with a 6-week history of progressive signsÂ of heart failure. Multimodality imaging was required to confirm the presence of a subaortic membrane. (Level of Difficulty: Beginner.).
