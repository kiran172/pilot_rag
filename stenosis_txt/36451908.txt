Title: The Chronically Blocked Ear - A dive into external auditory exostosis.

Abstract: Numerous papers have reported the presence of reactive but benign bony exostosis in the external auditory canal of swimmers; of both cold and warm water. This outgrowth may lead to stenosis of the canal with associated complications such as repeated cerumen impaction, infections and also hearing loss. In this case report, we will present the case of a 62-year-old gentleman who was referred for imaging by an ENT specialist following difficulty with visualisation of the tympanic membrane during otoscopy.
