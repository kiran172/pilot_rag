Title: Predictive Utility of Left Heart Catheterization Indices for Left Ventricular Thrombus Formation After Anterior ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Left ventricular thrombus (LVT) has a 5% incidence after anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Multiple risk factors predispose to LVT formation, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction and infarct size, however measurable predictors during index left heart catheterization (LHC) have not been determined.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients presenting between January 2010 and September 2017 with anterior STEMI who had in-hospital transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). LHC variables that were assessed included coronary anatomy, location of culprit stenosis, presence of diffuse stenosis, number of severely diseased vessels, apical akinesis on left ventriculogram (LVG), left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and success of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
RESULTS: Of 598 consecutive anterior STEMI patients, records and inpatient TTE results were available in 425 patients. The incidence of LVT was 6.8% (n = 29). After multivariate adjustment, severe triple vessel coronary disease (OR = 8.27, CI = 2.97-23.00, p ≤0.001), apical akinesis on LVG (OR = 6.74, CI = 1.48-30.73, p = 0.014), wrap-around left anterior descending (LAD) anatomy (OR = 5.10, CI = 1.97-13.23, p = 0.001), and failure of recanalization after PCI (OR = 3.94, CI = 1.06-14.66, p = 0.04) were predictors for LVT formation. The combined negative predictive value (NPV) for the absence of these four indices was 99.2%.
CONCLUSION: Severe triple vessel disease, apical akinesis on LVG during index admission, wrap-around LAD, and failure of recanalization after PCI are associated with increased risk of LVT formation after anterior STEMI. The high NPV for the absence of these indices could serve as a risk stratification tool for LVT risk to guide early TTE utilization.
