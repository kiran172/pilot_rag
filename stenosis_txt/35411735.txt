Title: [Biomechanical Study of New Biodegradable Esophageal Stent].

Abstract: The radial force of the degradable esophageal stent before and after degradation is one of the important indicators for effective treatment of esophageal stricture. Based on a combination of in vitro experiments and finite element analysis, this paper studies and verifies the biomechanical properties of a new type of degradable esophageal stent under different esophageal stricture conditions. Under radial extrusion conditions, the maximum stress at the port of the stent is 65.25 MPa, and the maximum strain is 1.98%; The peak values of stress and strain under local extrusion and plane extrusion conditions both appear in the extrusion area and the compression expansion area at both ends, which are respectively 48.68 MPa, 46.40 MPa, 0.49%, 1.13%. The maximum radial force of the undegraded stent was 11.22 N, and 97% and 51% of the maximum radial force were maintained after 3 months and 6 months of degradation, respectively. The research results verify the safety and effectiveness of the radial force of the new degradable esophageal stent, and provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of esophageal stricture.
