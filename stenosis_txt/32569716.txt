Title: Outcomes of transcarotid artery revascularization with dynamic flow reversal in patients with contralateral carotid artery occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The outcomes of carotid revascularization in patients with contralateral carotid artery occlusion (CCO) are controversial. CCO has been defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a high-risk criterion and is used as an indication for transfemoral carotid artery stenting. With the promising outcomes associated with transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), we aimed to study the perioperative outcomes of TCAR in patients with CCO and to assess the feasibility of TCAR in these high-risk patients.
METHODS: All patients in the Vascular Quality Initiative database who underwent TCAR with flow reversal between September 2016 and May 2019 were included. Patients with trauma, dissection, or more than two treated lesions were excluded. Univariable and multivariable logistic analyses were used to compare the primary outcome of in-hospital stroke or death after TCAR in patients with CCO and those without CCO (patent and <99% stenosis). Secondary outcomes included intraoperative neurologic changes and the individual outcomes of in-hospital stroke, death, and myocardial infarction as well as 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 5485 TCAR cases were included, of which 593 (10.8%) had CCO. In patients with CCO, mean flow reversal time was shorter (10.1 ± 6.7 minutes vs 11.1 ± 7.8 minutes; P < .01); intraoperative neurologic changes occurred in 1% of these patients compared with 0.7% of those with patent contralateral carotid arteries (P = .43). On univariable analysis, no significant difference in in-hospital stroke or death was shown between patients with and patients without CCO (1.7% vs 1.5%; P = .65). Similarly, no significant differences were noted between the groups in terms of in-hospital death (0.7% vs 0.4%; P = .27), stroke (1.7% vs 1.2%; P = .32), and stroke/death/myocardial infarction (2.2% vs 1.8%; P = .53) as well as 30-day mortality (0.8% vs 0.6%; P = .55). The results remained statistically nonsignificant after adjustment for baseline differences between the groups; the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of in-hospital stroke/death in patients with CCO compared with those with patent contralateral carotid arteries was not significant (OR, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-3.0; P = .40). In symptomatic patients presenting with prior stroke, CCO was associated with significantly higher odds of stroke or death (OR, 4.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-15.4; P = .01) compared with no CCO. On the other hand, in asymptomatic patients, no significant difference in outcomes was observed between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, TCAR seems to be safe in patients with CCO. Caution should be taken in symptomatic patients with CCO and a history of prior stroke as they might have worse outcomes compared with patients with patent contralateral carotid arteries. Studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up are needed to assess the perioperative and long-term outcomes of TCAR in patients with CCO in comparison to other procedures.
