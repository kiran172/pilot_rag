Title: Percutaneous tracheostomy: Comparison of three different methods with respect to tracheal cartilage injury in cadavers-Randomized controlled study.

Abstract: Background: Performing tracheostomy improves patient comfort and success rate of weaning from prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation. Data suggest that patients have more benefit of percutaneous technique than the surgical procedure, however, there is no consensus on the percutaneous method of choice regarding severe complications such as late tracheal stenosis. Aim of this study was comparing incidences of cartilage injury caused by different percutaneous dilatation techniques (PDT), including Single Dilator, Griggs' and modified (bidirectional) Griggs' method. Materials and methods: Randomized observational study was conducted on 150 cadavers underwent post-mortem percutaneous tracheostomy. Data of cadavers including age, gender and time elapsed from death until the intervention (more or less than 72 h) were collected and recorded. Primary and secondary outcomes were: rate of cartilage injury and cannula malposition respectively. Results: Statistical analysis revealed that method of intervention was significantly associated with occurrence of cartilage injury, as comparing either standard Griggs' with Single Dilator (p = 0.002; OR: 4.903; 95% CI: 1.834-13.105) or modified Griggs' with Single Dilator (p &lt; 0.001; OR: 6.559; 95% CI: 2.472-17.404), however, no statistical difference was observed between standard and modified Griggs' techniques (p = 0.583; OR: 0.748; 95% CI: 0.347-1.610). We found no statistical difference in the occurrence of cartilage injury between the early- and late post-mortem group (p = 0.630). Neither gender (p = 0.913), nor age (p = 0.529) influenced the rate of cartilage fracture. There was no statistical difference between the applied PDT techniques regarding the cannula misplacement/malposition. Conclusion: In this cadaver study both standard and modified Griggs' forceps dilatational methods were safer than Single dilator in respect of cartilage injury.
