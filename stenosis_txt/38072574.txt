Title: Case study scrub nurse role in aorto-bifemoral reconstruction with transbrachial balloon endoclamping technique.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aortoiliac arterial disease is a chronic progressive disease which is characterized by steno-occlusive changes in the aorta and iliac arteries. The gold standard for the treatment of patients with the advanced stage of the disease is aorto-bifemoral reconstruction. Patients with circumferential juxtarenal calcifications of the aorta bear a high risk of intraoperative complications, due to difficult cross-clamping in such zones.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 73-year-old patient who has been admitted due to left leg rest pain and second toe ulceration. Multislice computed tomography showed significant stenosis of the aortoiliac segment with a circumferentially calcified abdominal aorta. Aortobifemoral reconstruction was performed featuring endoluminal occlusion of the aorta using a balloon catheter which was placed through the left brachial artery. The procedure and the postoperative course were uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day.
CONCLUSION: The hybrid endovascular and open surgery technique presented emerged as a valid alternative for selected high-risk patients. Scrub nurses should be familiarized with endovascular techniques and tools and be aware of the measures to be protected from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.
