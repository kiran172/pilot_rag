Title: Management of Biliary Complications in Liver Transplant Recipients.

Abstract: Biliary complications are often referred to as the Achilles' heel of liver transplantation (LT). The most common of these complications include strictures, and leaks. Prompt diagnosis and management is key for preservation of the transplanted organ. Unfortunately, a number of factors can lead to delays in diagnosis and make adequate treatment a challenge. Innovations in advanced endoscopic techniques have increased non-surgical options for these complications and in many cases is the preferred approach.
