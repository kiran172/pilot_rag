Title: Anaesthetic management using remimazolam in a patient with severe aortic stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The administration of general anaesthesia in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) requires careful attention to haemodynamics. We used remimazolam for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in a woman with severe AS undergoing a total mastectomy.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old woman with severe AS was scheduled to undergo a total mastectomy. We decided to administer total intravenous anaesthesia with remimazolam to minimize haemodynamic changes. Although the patient showed transient hypotension after anaesthesia induction, the cardiac index was preserved with a low dose of continuous noradrenaline. The anaesthesia was then safely maintained without a decrease in the patient's cardiac index.
CONCLUSIONS: General anaesthesia using remimazolam preserved cardiac output in this patient; therefore, remimazolam can be safely used to avoid the risk of cardiac suppression in patients with severe AS.
