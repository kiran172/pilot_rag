Title: Use a biodegradable stent in ERCP and it will never be forgotten.

Abstract: The easiest way to drain the bile duct or the main pancreatic duct by means of ERCP is the insertion of a plastic stent. Once cannulation has been achieved, which is generally the most complex and limiting step in ERCP, stent insertion is straightforward and rewarding. The main problem in benign pancreato-biliary conditions comes in the follow-up. Indications for biliary stent insertion in non-neoplastic diseases are common bile duct (CBD) stones that could not be completely extracted, benign strictures and leaks. In the pancreas stents are frequently inserted to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis and for benign strictures and other less frequent conditions such as main pancreatic duct disruption. Currently in all centers more and more ERCPs are performed in patients without naive Papilla of Vater, generally for stent extraction or exchange. For example, in the recent study by Barakat and Banerjee, carried out in a tertiary care academic medical center, only 25% were index or initial ERCP, without previous sphincterotomy or stent, and subsequent procedures comprised the remaining 75 %.
