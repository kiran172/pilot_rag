Title: A case of pregnant patient with stenotic bicuspid aortic valve.

Abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) during pregnancy remains challenging; however, the postponement of surgery with the possibility of valvuloplasty as a bridge therapy seems reasonable. Our case showed that despite physiological changes during pregnancy, the aortic valve defect did not worsen, which allowed us to avoid dilemmas related to anticoagulation on artificial valve.
ABSTRACT: A 31-year-old woman, with a bicuspid aortic aorta, post-aortic valvulotomy, was listed for cardiac surgery because of severe aortic stenosis. However, the operation was postponed due to procreation plans. During the pregnancy and delivery, we did not observe neither deterioration of symptoms nor changes of echocardiographic parameters. Subsequent monthly echocardiographic studies did not reveal a significant increase of peak and mean aortic gradient.Presented case reports showed that despite physiological changes associated with pregnancy, the aortic valve defect did not worsen, which allowed to avoid dilemmas related to anticoagulation on artificial valves.
