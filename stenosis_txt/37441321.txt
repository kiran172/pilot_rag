Title: Redo pull-through for postoperative complications following pull-through in Hirschsprung disease: a single center experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Although surgical management of Hirschsprung disease (HD) is effective in most patients, some patients experience long-term postoperative complications, and require redo pull-through (PT). The present study evaluated clinical outcomes of redo PT in HD patients at a single center.
METHODS: Patients with HD who underwent redo PT procedures between 2003 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Five (38.5%) had undergone initial PT surgery at our center and 8 (61.5%) at other centers. Redo PT procedures were transanal endorectal PT in 12 patients (92.3%) and the posterior sagittal approach in 1 patient (7.7%). Indications for redo PT included pathologic misdiagnosis in 8 patients (61.5%); stricture in 2 (15.4%); and rectal stenosis, obstructing Duhamel pouch and remnant septum in 1 each (7.7%). At a median follow-up of 68 months (range, 3-227 months) after redo PT, 8 patients (61.5%) had normal bowel function, 2 (15.4%) had incontinence, and 1 (7.7%) had constipation.
CONCLUSION: Redo PT procedures could be an effective approach for improving obstructive symptoms in HD patients with anatomic or pathologic reasons following primary PT. Careful selection of patients and discreet indications for redo PT are crucial.
