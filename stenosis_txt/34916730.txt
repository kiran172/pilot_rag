Title: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mimicking radiculopathy: a case series.

Abstract: The clinical findings of early stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are similar to those of cervical or lumbar radiculopathy. In the current study, we describe 3 cases of ALS that were misdiagnosed as cervical or lumbar radiculopathy. Three patients (a 48-, a 52-, and an 80-year-old) visited our clinic due to motor weakness on either the upper or lower extremities. At other clinics or hospitals, they were diagnosed with radiculopathy due to herniated lumbar disc or cervical foraminal stenosis. The motor weakness in these patients was ipsilateral or bilateral but dominant on one side. Sensory deficits or bulbar symptoms were not observed. Of the 3 patients, 2 had neuropathic pain, but it was not dermatome related. We conducted an electrodiagnostic test and observed a low amplitude of compound motor action potential on the affected nerve and positive sharp waves on muscles of involved segments, including thoracic paraspinalis. All the patients were diagnosed with probable laboratory-supported ALS or possible ALS based on the established diagnostic criteria (El Escorial Criteria). In the present study, we showed three cases of ALS that were misdiagnosed as radiculopathy. Our study would be helpful for early and accurate diagnosis of patients with ALS.
