Title: Low-dose dynamic myocardial perfusion imaging by CZT-SPECT in the identification of obstructive coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We measured myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) by a dynamic low-dose CZT-SPECT protocol in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD) and investigated the capability of dynamic data in predicting obstructive CAD. A total of 173 patients with suspected or known CAD underwent dynamic CZT-SPECT after the injection of 155 MBq and 370 MBq of 99mTc-sestamibi for rest and stress imaging, respectively. Standard rest and stress imaging were performed at the end of each dynamic scan. A total perfusion defect (TPD) &lt; 5% were considered normal. Obstructive CAD was defined as ≥ 70% stenosis at coronary angiography.
RESULTS: Global MPR was lower (p < 0.05) in patients with abnormal compared with those with normal MPI (2.40 ± 0.7 vs. 2.70 ± 0.8). A weak, albeit significant correlation between TPD and MPR (r = - 0.179, p < 0.05) was found. In 91 patients with available angiographic data, hyperemic MBF (2.59 ± 1.2 vs. 3.24 ± 1.1 ml/min/g) and MPR (1.96 ± 0.7 vs. 2.74 ± 0.9) were lower (both p < 0.05) in patients with obstructive CAD (n = 21) compared with those without (n = 70). At univariable analysis, TPD, hyperemic MBF, and MPR were significant predictors of obstructive CAD, whereas only MPR was independent predictor at multivariable analysis (p < 0.05). At per vessels analysis, regional hyperemic MBF (2.59 ± 1.2 vs. 3.24 ± 1.1 ml/min/g) and regional MPR (1.96 ± 0.7 vs. 2.74 ± 0.9) were lower in the 31 vessels with obstructive CAD compared with 242 vessels without (both p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected or known CAD, MPR assessed by low-dose dynamic CZT-SPECT showed a good correlation with myocardial perfusion imaging findings and it could be useful to predict obstructive CAD.
