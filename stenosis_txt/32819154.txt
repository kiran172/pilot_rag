Title: Myocardial ischemia from previously placed autologous pericardial roll conduits.

Abstract: We report two cases of symptomatic cardiac ischemia caused by left coronary artery compression. One was a 16-year-old boy with history of the Ross procedure, aortic root aneurysm, and right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit stenosis. The other was a 32-year-old woman with history of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect repair and a giant right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit aneurysm. In both cases, the left coronary artery was compressed by the previously placed valved autologous pericardial roll right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit. Conduit replacement without direct coronary intervention relieved the coronary ischemia. Early diagnosis and relief of external compression avoided potentially fatal outcomes.
