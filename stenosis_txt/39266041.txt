Title: Alveolar capillary dysplasia complicated by subglottic stenosis.

Abstract: Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is an interstitial lung disease. In ACDMPV, respiratory impairment with severe pulmonary hypertension occurs from the early hours of life. Anomalies in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems have been reported. However, little is known about upper airway abnormalities. We encountered a genetically diagnosed ACDMPV infant who presented with subglottic and bronchial stenosis. The prenatal diagnosis was hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Her respiratory condition worsened at 16 hours of life. We found subglottic stenosis when intubating. She died on day 7. Autopsy imaging with CT scan showed bilateral main bronchial stenosis. Chromosomal microarray revealed a 531â€‰kb deletion in chromosome 16q24.1, including FOXF1.
