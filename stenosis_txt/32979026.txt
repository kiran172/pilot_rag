Title: Hybrid treatment of aortic aneurism, type-A dissection, and aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: Hybrid multidisciplinary interventions are attractive care options for heart valve and vascular diseases in high-risk patients. We describe the feasibility of staged hybrid aortic arch repair to treat a type Ia endoleak and transcatheter aortic valve replacement to treat an aortic valve stenosis, achieving an escape strategy to treat an unexpected type-A aortic dissection.
