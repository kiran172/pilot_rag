Title: Managing complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Although transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a streamlined and standardized procedure, different complications still remain and need the operators to be properly trained about their management.
AREAS COVERED: This review article aims at offering a practical overview of the most impactful TAVI complications, analyzing, and discussing the potential risk factors, and focusing on the available strategies for their management.
EXPERT OPINION: Complications following TAVI have been decreasing thanks to technical advancements and operators experience. The thorough knowledge of potential complications and their prevention played a key role in the decreasing of complications rates. Pre-procedural, computed tomography angiography assessment of patient's anatomical characteristics allows to properly choose and tailor the best strategy for managing complications in most cases. Nevertheless, further research is required to shed light on the optimal strategies to adopt for managing TAVI complications.
