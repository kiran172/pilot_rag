Title: A Rare Case of Female Bladder Outlet Obstruction: Severe Introital Stenosis.

Abstract: Herein, we report a rare case of severe introital stenosis in a 22-year female who presented with obstructive voiding symptoms and inability to have sexual intercourse. Introital stenosis had been caused by the emergency primary closure after major vulvoperineal trauma 15 years ago. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in the literature that describes a very long time from primary closure to dilation and reconstruction. A detailed systematic evaluation and pelvic examination were performed. The dilation procedure was performed and the patient was closely followed up. Reconstructive surgery, which involved the removal of the granulation tissue and approximation of healthy vaginal mucosal edges in several sessions, was performed after the initial dilation procedure. Follow-up was performed with the clinical assessment of the symptoms, physical examination, and uroflowmetry. Our technique was effective and did not lead to any complications. The sexual dysfunction and voiding complaints of the patient completely resolved within a post-operative period of 11 months. Key Words: Introital stenosis, Bladder outlet obstruction, Dilation, Female, Reconstruction.
