Title: Fenestration: Integrating Wings Into the Atrial Septal Occluder for Navigating a Challenging Terrain.

Abstract: Background Atrial septal defect (ASD) closure with significant left-to-right shunt and concurrent comorbidities poses challenges for intervention. A fenestrated atrial septal defect (FASD) device is a viable option for patients who cannot undergo complete occlusion due to hemodynamic and medical reasons. This study explores the use of FASD occluders in patients with secundum ASD and associated comorbidities where complete occlusion is difficult. Methodology This retrospective study collected the details of patients recommended for FASD closure diagnosed with significant secundum ASD and who had additional comorbidities between July 2015 and July 2023 in a tertiary cardiac center in eastern India. Among this cohort, patients who underwent FASD device placement were subjected to a comprehensive analysis. Results In total, 16 patients diagnosed with secundum ASD, characterized by significant left-to-right shunt and concurrent comorbidities, were considered for FASD closure during the study period. Ultimately, 13 patients (first group) underwent fenestrated atrial septal occluder implantation. The average age was 45.07 years, with the majority being females (n = 9). Comorbidities among this cohort included substantial left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (n = 7), left ventricular diastolic dysfunction coupled with moderate pulmonary hypertension (n = 1), severe pulmonary hypertension (n = 1), severe pulmonary valvular stenosis with right ventricular diastolic dysfunction (n = 2), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n = 2). From this cohort, three patients did not undergo the intervention. The second group consisted of an elderly patient with severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, a young adult with a history of left atrial arrhythmia, and a child with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The average ASD size among patients who underwent the intervention was 26.38 mm, with a thick-to-thick dimension measuring 31.15 mm. The procedure was successful in all 13 patients, with the most frequently used device being a 34 mm occluder (range = 28-40 mm). All devices, excluding the initial one, were custom-made atrial septal occluders (Lifetech Scientific). Among the patients, 12 exhibited left-to-right fenestration flow, while one patient experienced fenestration constriction, likely due to occluder overcrowding. The first patient had a handmade 5 mm fenestration in a 40 mm Amplatzer septal occluder, which got closed off at the one-year follow-up. The procedure was well-tolerated hemodynamically in all patients, with no major complications during the peri-procedural period. Short-term follow-up indicated favorable patient progress. Conclusions FASD closure emerges as a pivotal alternative for intricate scenarios involving secundum ASD coupled with concurrent comorbidities, offering individualized tailored solutions. Alongside the conventional associated comorbidities, such as left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, FASD devices hold the potential to extend their benefits to patients grappling with other complexities, including severe pulmonary valvular stenosis, SLE, predisposition to left atrial arrhythmia, and conditions like DMD. Ensuring meticulous evaluation of patient suitability and providing ongoing vigilant care becomes paramount for achieving optimal outcomes. The validation of these findings and the broadening of the comprehension of this approach necessitate further comprehensive investigations.
