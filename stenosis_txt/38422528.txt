Title: Impact of mitral stenosis on early and late outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis: a single-center analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of concomitant mitral stenosis (MS) on early and late outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis.
METHODS: This study involved 952 patients undergoing TAVR for severe tricuspid aortic stenosis. The patients were classified into 3 groups: without MS, with progressive MS, and severe MS (mitral valve area â‰¤ 1.5 cm2). Clinical outcomes between these groups were compared.
RESULTS: The median age of the overall cohort was 82 years, and patients in the progressive (n = 49) and severe (n = 24) MS groups were more likely to be female than those in the no-MS group (n = 879). Periprocedural mortality rate was lowest in the no-MS group (1.8%) compared with the progressive (4.1%) and severe (4.2%) MS groups, which were not significantly different (P = .20). During 5 years of follow-up (median: 27, range: 0-72 months), there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (log-rank P = .99), a composite of all-cause mortality or rehospitalization for heart failure (log-rank P = .84), or cardiovascular death (log-rank P = .57) between groups. Although crude analysis showed a significant difference in rehospitalization for heart failure in the severe MS group compared with the no-MS group (P = .049), the difference was not significant in the multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.36 [95% CI, 0.66-2.80], P = .41).
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR can be safely performed in patients with severe tricuspid aortic stenosis and concomitant MS, with early and mid-term outcomes comparable to those in patients without MS.
