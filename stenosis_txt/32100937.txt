Title: Prognostic influence of acute decompensated heart failure in patients planned for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with severe aortic stenosis presenting with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and planned for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and to study the variables influencing their prognosis.
METHODS: Our retrospective study included 801 patients planned for TAVI in our center. Seven hundred and fifty-six underwent TAVI and were categorized according to ADHF as the initial clinical presentation into two groups: ADHF group (n = 261) and no-ADHF group (n = 495). Pre as well as periprocedural outcomes and 1 year mortality were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the patients planned for the TAVI procedure, 45 patients remained untreated: 35 patients died while waiting to undergo TAVI which represented 20% of all deaths in our study, ADHF was observed in 23 of 45 (51%) these untreated patients. The 1-year all-cause mortality rate was significantly higher in the ADHF group versus the no-ADHF group (27% vs. 15%, p &lt; .0001). In multivariate analysis, male gender (odds ratio [OR] =2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-4.57, p = .03), body mass index &lt;25 kg/m2 (OR = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.51-5.04, p = .0009), and logistic EuroSCORE II ≥20% (OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.56-5.94, p = .001) were associated with a higher 1-year mortality in the ADHF group.
CONCLUSION: The patients eligible for TAVI presenting with ADHF were associated with a higher mortality for both: while on the waiting list for TAVI as well as at 1-year follow-up and thus asking for clearer criteria to prioritize action in this high-risk TAVI patients.
