Title: Racial and ethnic influences on carotid atherosclerosis: Epidemiology and risk factors.

Abstract: Carotid atherosclerosis-related stenosis, marked by atherosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid artery, significantly increases ischemic stroke risk. Its prevalence varies across ethnic groups, reflecting racial disparities. Epidemiological studies have highlighted different susceptibilities to carotid stenosis among racial groups. Native Americans and Whites show greater vulnerability, indicating genetic and environmental influences. The impact of carotid stenosis is more severe in Hispanic and Black populations, with a higher incidence of related brain injuries, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. Comparative imaging studies between Chinese and White individuals reveal unique patterns of carotid stenosis, enhancing understanding of its pathophysiology and management across ethnicities. This review also categorizes risk factors, distinguishing those with racial disparity (such as genetic loci, sleep apnea, and emotional factors, socioeconomic status) from those without. In summary, racial disparities affect carotid stenosis, leading to varying susceptibilities and outcomes among ethnic groups. Recognizing these differences is essential for developing effective prevention, diagnosis, and management strategies. Addressing these disparities is critical to reducing ischemic stroke's burden across populations. Continued research and targeted interventions are crucial to improve outcomes for individuals at risk of carotid stenosis and its complications.
