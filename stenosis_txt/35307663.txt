Title: RESULTS OF PREVENTIVE METHODS OF OCCURRENCE CERVICAL ANASTOMOTIC COMPLICATIONS IN ESOPHAGOPLASTY.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim: The aim of the study was to improve the results of surgical treatment in patients with corrosive esophageal strictures using the designed comprehensive surgical management program in esophagoplasty to decrease cervical anastomotic complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The results of surgical treatment of 116 patients with esophageal strictures were studied. 45 patients had post-burn corrosive strictures, 17 - postoperative corrosive strictures, 10 - peptic strictures due to reflux esophagitis and 44 patients - esophageal cancer. All patients were divided into two groups: the control group, consisting of 55 patients who underwent conventional surgical treatment of corrosive esophageal strictures during 2005-2011, and experimental group involving 61 patients operated on during 2012- 2020, in whom an individual approach to the choice of surgical method was applied using diagnostic and treatment algorithm as well as the designed surgical management program.
RESULTS: Results: In early postoperative period the proportion of specific and non-specific complications was significantly lower in experimental group as compared to the control group: cervical anastomotic leak - 16.36 % versus 4.392 %; strictures of cervical anastomosis - 20.0% versus 6.56 % (p<0.05). There were six postoperative deaths - four in the control group and two in experimental group.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: To prevent the development of cervical anastomotic complications and mortality in esophagoplasty proper therapeutic approach with consideration of all prognostic criteria and risk factors should be chosen and designed surgical management program should be applied.
