Title: Beneficial Effect of Carotid Artery Stenting on Cerebral Hemodynamic Impairment and Cognitive Function.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedure on cerebral hemodynamics and cognitive performance in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. In this prospective observational study, 16 consecutive patients in a single institute were treated with CAS from 2010 to 2011 (71.7 Â± 7.3 years old, 12 males, and six left-sided procedures). Before and after the CAS procedure, all patients were evaluated with single photon emission computed tomography using 123I-iodoamphetamine and acetazolamide as well as the Weschler Adult Intelligent Scale (WAIS) to assess three intelligent quotients and four indexes. Patients with decreased preprocedural cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) experienced significant increases in CBF and CVR (P = 0.01 and 0.03). Twelve (75%) patients experienced a significant increase in one or more WAIS scores, while two (13%) showed a significant decrease. The most frequently improved scores were the Working Memory Index and Processing Speed Index (seven patients/44%). Preprocedural CBF was significantly correlated with the Full-scale and Performance Intelligent Quotients (r = 0.51-0.56, P = 0.02-0.04), and patients who experienced a significant increase in these scores had larger increases in CVR than patients with unchanged scores (P = 0.0097-0.019). These results indicate that the CAS procedure improved impaired cerebral hemodynamics and might benefit the cognitive function of patients with internal carotid artery stenosis related to impaired cerebral hemodynamics.
