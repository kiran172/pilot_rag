Title: Long-term surgical outcomes of congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis: a systematic review, meta-analysis and microsimulation study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a rare form of congenital outflow tract obstruction and long-term outcomes are scarcely reported. This study aims to provide an overview of outcomes after surgical repair for congenital SVAS.
METHODS: A systematic review of published literature was conducted, including observational studies reporting long-term clinical outcome (>2 years) after SVAS repair in children or adults considering >20 patients. Early risks, late event rates and time-to-event data were pooled and entered into a microsimulation model to estimate 30-year outcomes. Life expectancy was compared to the age-, sex- and origin-matched general population.
RESULTS: Twenty-three publications were included, encompassing a total of 1472 patients (13 125 patient-years; pooled mean follow-up: 9.0 (6.2) years; median follow-up: 6.3 years). Pooled mean age at surgical repair was 4.7 (5.8) years and the most commonly used surgical technique was the single-patch repair (43.6%). Pooled early mortality was 4.2% (95% confidence interval: 3.2-5.5%) and late mortality was 0.61% (95% CI: 0.45-0.83) per patient-year. Based on microsimulation, over a 30-year time horizon, it was estimated that an average patient with SVAS repair (mean age: 4.7 years) had an observed life expectancy that was 90.7% (95% credible interval: 90.0-91.6%) of expected life expectancy in the matched general population. The microsimulation-based 30-year risk of myocardial infarction was 8.1% (95% credible interval: 7.3-9.9%) and reintervention 31.3% (95% credible interval: 29.6-33.4%), of which 27.2% (95% credible interval: 25.8-29.1) due to repair dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: After surgical repair for SVAS, 30-year survival is lower than the matched-general-population survival and the lifetime risk of reintervention is considerable. Therefore, lifelong monitoring of the cardiovascular system and in particular residual stenosis and coronary obstruction is recommended.
