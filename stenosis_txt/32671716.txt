Title: Predictors of conduction recovery after permanent pacemaker implantation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Conduction disturbances after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) requiring pacemaker (PPM) implantation are a known complication and may be reversible. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the incidence and predictors for atrioventricular (AV) conduction recovery after TAVR.
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study of patients undergoing PPM implantation for conduction disorders after TAVR between June 2011 and March 2019. Conduction recovery was defined as ≤ 1% ventricular pacing (VP) on follow-up PPM interrogation.
RESULTS: A total of 110 patients (mean age 83.6 ± 6.6 years, 46.8% female) were included. At a median follow-up of 438 days (interquartile range [IQR] 111-760 days), 35 patients (32%) had conduction recovery, with 50% of these occurring within the first 6 months. On multivariate analysis, predictors of conduction recovery include female sex (hazard ratio [HR] 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-6.4, p = 0.048), non-VP/non-complete heart block rhythm immediately post-TAVR (HR 5.2, 95% CI 1.5-18.1, p = 0.011), normal sinus rhythm 7 days post-TAVR (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7-9.2, p = 0.002), and smaller valve size (mm) (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.7-0.996, p = 0.045). Significant narrowing of the QRS and resolution of new-onset left bundle branch block within 1 month post-TAVR occurred in those with conduction recovery on PPM interrogation.
CONCLUSIONS: One-third of patients receiving new PPM implantation have conduction recovery after TAVR, with 50% occurring within the first 6 months. Patient gender, valve size, and rhythm on serial ECGs after TAVR can help identify patients that may recover AV conduction. A conservative approach rather than immediate PPM implantation may be considered in these patients.
