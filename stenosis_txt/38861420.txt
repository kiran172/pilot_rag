Title: Post-RFA Pulmonary Vein Stenosis Mimicking Lymphangitic Carcinomatosis in a Patient With History of Liposarcoma.

Abstract: A 58-year-old man with resected liposarcoma exhibited persistent irregular interlobular septal thickening of lung on CT concerning lymphangitic metastasis. FDG PET/CT was positive in these foci. There was a narrowing of the pulmonary veins, which had not been seen on the imaging conducted prior to radiofrequency ablation therapy for atrial fibrillation. Lung perfusion scanning demonstrated more extensive hypoperfusion. This case highlights the diagnostic pitfalls of interstitial thickening of the lung in cancer patients. Meticulous history review and nuclear imaging helped distinguish the postablation pulmonary venous stenosis from metastatic spread to the lung interstitium.
