Title: The Effect of Endovascular Treatment of Renal Artery Stenoses on Coexistent Aneurysms Associated with Fibromuscular Dysplasia.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Endovascular data on patients with coexistent renal artery stenosis (RAS) and renal artery aneurysm (RAA) caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are scarce, and the outcomes from RAS-specific treatment on RAA remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of RAS-specific endovascular management in patients with coexisting RAA caused by FMD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and endovascular data on 19 patients with coexistent RAS and RAA caused by FMD who underwent RAS-specific endovascular therapy were analyzed prospectively. An RAA located within 10 mm of the RAS was defined as a stenosis-related RAA (SRAA), and long-term outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients (24 RASs and 30 RAAs) underwent endovascular therapy. Twenty-one RASs were treated with balloon angioplasty alone, whereas 3 RASs were treated with stent implantation. None of the RAAs were treated directly. During an average of 4.2 years ± 3.2 of follow-up, systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased from 183.0 mm Hg ± 19.5 and 120.2 mm Hg ± 19.0 to 127.9 mm Hg ± 10.3 and 80.9 mm Hg ± 6.9, respectively; the number of antihypertensive medications reduced from 1.7 ± 1.0 to 0.8 ± 0.3 (for all, P < .001). The serum creatinine level remained stable. The maximum diameter of all RAAs decreased from 14.6 mm ± 9.7 to 11.3 mm ± 8.4 (P < .001). There was a significant difference in the improvement rate of the maximum diameter between SRAAs (65.0%, 13 of 20) and non-SRAAs (20.0%, 2 of 10) (P = .019).
CONCLUSIONS: RAS-specific endovascular therapy is safe and effective and possibly aids in preventing RAA progression in patients with FMD with coexistent RAS and RAA.
