Title: Circumferential Pannus at C1-C2 Causing Spinal Cord Compression.

Abstract: Periodontoid pannus formation is a pathologic condition caused by a multitude of different etiologies, however, it is most commonly due to rheumatoid arthritis. In these cases, the pannus is typically located in the retro-odontoid space ventral to the spinal cord, leading to progressive neural compression. We describe in this report, a patient who presented with progressive high cervical myelopathy, who on imaging revealed both a retro-odontoid pannus and a posterior C1-C2 mass causing severe circumferential compression of the spinal cord. The patient was successfully treated with a C1-C2 laminectomy and occipitocervical fusion. Periodontoid pannus is a common entity; however, the presence of a C1-C2 posterior pannus is a unique finding. To our knowledge, circumferential pannus at C1-C2 causing neural compression is a clinical entity that has not been previously reported.
