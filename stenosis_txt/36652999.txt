Title: [Treatment of degenerative lumbar lateral recess stenosis with full endoscopic lamina fenestration discectomy].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of full endoscopic lamina fenestration discectomy (Endo-LOVE) with full endoscopic transforaminal approach discectomy in the treatment of degenerative lumbar lateral recess stenosis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 48 patients with degenerative lumbar lateral recess stenosis between March 2018 and March 2019 was performed. There were 32 males and 16 females, aged from 60 to 83 years old with an average of (72.9±6.5) years, course of disease ranged from 5 to 16 years with an average of (8.0±2.8) years. The patients were divided into observation group and control group according to surgical approaches. There were 28 cases in observation group, underwent Endo-LOVE surgery;and 20 cases in control group, underwent full endoscopic foraminal approach discectomy. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, hospitalization day and complications were observed between two groups. Visual analgue scale (VAS), Japanese Orthopaedic Association(JOA), Oswestry Disability Index(ODI), lateral crypt angle were compared between two groups. And clinical effects were evaluated by modified Macnab standard.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in follow-up and operation time between two groups (P&gt;0.05). Intraoperative blood loss was from 5 to 15 ml with an average of (8.4±3.6) ml in observation group and 5 to 25 ml with an average of (11.5±5.4) ml in control group. The hospitalization day was from 5 to 8 days with an average of (6.0±1.0) days in observation group and 6 to 9 days with an average (7.2±1.1) days in control group. Intraoperative blood loss and hospitalization day were significantly lower in observation group(P&lt;0.05). There were no serious complications in both groups. The VAS, JOA scores, and ODI at 3-month and final follow-up were significantly improved in both groups (P&lt;0.05), and observation group was significantly better than control group (P&lt;0.05). The skeletal lateral crypt angle and soft lateral crypt angle were significantly greater than the preoperative angle at 3 days postoperatively(P&lt;0.05), and observation group was significantly better than control group(P&lt;0.05). At the final follow-up, the modified Macnab criteria was used to assess clinical efficacy, in observation group, 22 patients obtained excellent results, 5 good and 1 fair;while 11 excellent, 4 good and 5 fair in control group;the clinical efficacy of observation group was significantly better than that of control group(P&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Both surgical methods are performed under direct vision, with high safety and good clinical efficacy. However, Endo-LOVE enlarged the lateral crypt more fully.
