Title: Computed tomography-assessed variations of the carotid sinus.

Abstract: PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified variations regarding the morphology and location of the carotid sinus, a phenomenon still not commonly approached or studied on computed tomography angiography (CTA). Detailed characterization of the carotid sinus was performed on CTAs, determining its position, diameter and length.
METHODS: The study group included 43 patients with disease-free carotid trunks subjected to cervical CTA. We measured the terminal caliber of the common carotid artery (CCA), as well as the calibers of the internal (ICA) and external carotid arteries (ECA) at their origin. The diameters were correlated with the location and the shape of the carotid sinus. We also measured the length of the sinus dilatation (carotid bulb), in regard to its location on the terminal branches of the common carotid artery.
RESULTS: Mean diameters of the studied arteries were 7.39 ± 1.04 mm for the CCA, 6.71 ± 1.49 mm for the ICA and, respectively, 4.27 ± 0.75 mm for the ECA. The classical position of the carotid sinus was seen in 80% of cases, the rest being considered anatomical variants. The length of the carotid bulb on the ICA was 9.99 ± 2.22 mm, showing variability between genders.
CONCLUSIONS: The carotid sinus does not always extend to the ICA, presenting different distribution patterns that might be relevant in sinus pathology from a clinical point of view, respectively from a surgical point of view during invasive or minimally invasive interventions on the carotid axis.
