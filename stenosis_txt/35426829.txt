Title: Radiological and clinical features of twig-like middle cerebral artery in comparison with moyamoya angiopathy: a multicenter retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Twig-like middle cerebral artery (T-MCA) is a rare congenital anomaly that is difficult to distinguish from moyamoya angiopathy (MMA), given the similarity of the angioarchitectures. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the radiological and clinical features of T-MCA and to distinguish this condition from MMA.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted in 29 patients with T-MCA and 57 patients with MMA. Demographic, radiological, and clinical data were compared between the patients with T-MCA and those with MMA.
RESULTS: The T-MCA group tended to be older than the MMA group (mean age 47 ± 18 vs 39 ± 22 years). Twenty patients with T-MCA (69%) were initially diagnosed with MMA. All T-MCA cases had twig-like networks and steno-occlusive changes involving the MCA. The T-MCA group had a higher incidence of intracranial aneurysms (35% vs 11%) and coexisting arterial anomalies (48% vs 12%). T-MCA and MMA cases had significant differences in involvement of the internal carotid artery terminus (0% vs 100%) and posterior cerebral artery (0% vs 23%), and in transdural anastomosis (0% vs 51%). T-MCA cases were less likely to present with stroke (59% vs 86%) and more likely to be asymptomatic (28% vs 12%). Of the patients with stroke, those with T-MCA had more hemorrhagic strokes (41% vs 29%) and fewer ischemic strokes (59% vs 71%) compared to those with MMA.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that T-MCA is a different disease entity from MMA based on significant differences in the radiological and clinical features. Neurosurgeons should recognize this anomaly and understand the key features that differentiate T-MCA from MMA.
