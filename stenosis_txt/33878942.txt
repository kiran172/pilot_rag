Title: Clinical Validity of 3 Different Grading Systems for Facet Joint Violation: A Retrospective Study and In-Depth Review.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective.
OBJECTIVES: To study the violation rate of 3 different types of facet joint violation (FJV) grading systems (Babu, Shah, and Park), and to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and association with clinical outcomes of the above 3 grading systems.
METHODS: 152 patients of lumbar spinal stenosis treated with percutaneous pedicle screw placement were enrolled in our study. FJV was evaluated on 3-dimensional lumbar CT reconstruction. Three types of grading systems were used to evaluate FJV: Babu's system (grading by the severity of violation), Shah's system (grading by side of violation), and modified Park's system (grading by different components to cause violation). The violation rate and observer consistency of the 3 grading systems were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by visual analog score (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) score.
RESULTS: Kappa coefficients of interobserver consistency on Babu, Shah, and Park grading systems were 0.726,0.849,0.692, respectively. The violation rate of Babu, Shah, and Park grading systems were comparable, which were 34.54%, 32.57%, 33.55%, respectively. In all 3 grading systems, the postoperative VAS low-back pain and ODI scores in non-FJV groups were lower than those in FJV groups (P &lt; .05), and there were no significant differences between 2 groups in VAS leg pain(P &gt;.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Babu, Shah and modified Park grading system are reliable grading systems, and it reported comparable violation rate. The self-reported clinical outcomes of patients with FJV were worse at 2-year follow-up. For clinical application, it is recommended to use 2 or even 3 different grading systems together to evaluate the FJV.
