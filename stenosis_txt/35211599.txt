Title: Treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissecting aneurysm with SUPERA stent implantation: Two case reports.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is no standard endovascular treatment for extracranial internal carotid artery dissecting aneurysms. In the past, stent-graft isolation and stent-assisted coil embolization were commonly used for wide-necked and fusiform aneurysms. Here, we present two cases of extracranial internal carotid artery dissecting aneurysms treated successfully using the SUPERA stent.
CASE SUMMARY: Case 1 was a 57-year-old male patient with sudden right limb weakness and vague speech and diagnosed with cerebral infarction in February 2019. Cervical computed tomographic angiography (CTA) revealed left internal carotid artery dissection with stenosis. CTA at 2 mo showed an eccentric wide-necked dissecting aneurysm (5 mm × 5 mm × 12 mm, 10-mm neck) that was enlarged at 4 mo (7 mm × 6 mm × 12 mm, 11-mm neck). The patient underwent SUPERA stent implantation. His condition was stable in July 2020. Case 2 was a 57-year-old man who suddenly felt dizzy and developed unsteady walking in November 2019. Cervical CTA suggested right internal carotid artery dissecting aneurysm (11 mm × 9 mm × 31 mm) complicated with severe lumen stenosis (95%). The patient underwent SUPERA stent implantation. The patient had no residual symptoms and was stable in December 2020.
CONCLUSION: SUPERA stent implantation might achieve good results in treating wide-necked or long fusiform internal carotid artery dissecting aneurysms.
