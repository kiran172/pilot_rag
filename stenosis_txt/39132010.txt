Title: The Hemodynamic Effects of Interatrial Septostomy in Iatrogenic Mitral Stenosis Following MitraClip.

Abstract: Iatrogenic mitral stenosis is a rare complication of the MitraClip procedure for which limited therapeutic options exist. We present a unique case using real-time echocardiographic and hemodynamic data demonstrating a potential role for interatrial septostomy creation as a percutaneous management option in this challenging population.
