Title: Revolutionizing spinal interventions: a systematic review of artificial intelligence technology applications in contemporary surgery.

Abstract: Leveraging its ability to handle large and complex datasets, artificial intelligence can uncover subtle patterns and correlations that human observation may overlook. This is particularly valuable for understanding the intricate dynamics of spinal surgery and its multifaceted impacts on patient prognosis. This review aims to delineate the role of artificial intelligence in spinal surgery. A search of the PubMed database from 1992 to 2023 was conducted using relevant English publications related to the application of artificial intelligence in spinal surgery. The search strategy involved a combination of the following keywords: "Artificial neural network," "deep learning," "artificial intelligence," "spinal," "musculoskeletal," "lumbar," "vertebra," "disc," "cervical," "cord," "stenosis," "procedure," "operation," "surgery," "preoperative," "postoperative," and "operative." A total of 1,182 articles were retrieved. After a careful evaluation of abstracts, 90 articles were found to meet the inclusion criteria for this review. Our review highlights various applications of artificial neural networks in spinal disease management, including (1) assessing surgical indications, (2) assisting in surgical procedures, (3) preoperatively predicting surgical outcomes, and (4) estimating the occurrence of various surgical complications and adverse events. By utilizing these technologies, surgical outcomes can be improved, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for patients.
