Title: Spectral segmentation and radiomic features predict carotid stenosis and ipsilateral ischemic burden from DECT angiography.

Abstract: PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to compare spectral segmentation, spectral radiomic, and single- energy radiomic features in the assessment of internal and common carotid artery (ICA/CCA) stenosis and prediction of surgical outcome. METHODS Our ethical committee-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)- compliant study included 85 patients (mean age, 73 Â± 10 years; male : female, 56 : 29) who under- went contrast-enhanced, dual-source dual-energy CT angiography (DECTA) (Siemens Definition Flash) of the neck for assessing ICA/CCA stenosis. Patients with a prior surgical or interventional treatment of carotid stenosis were excluded. Two radiologists graded the severity of carotid ste- nosis on DECTA images as mild (<50% luminal narrowing), moderate (50%-69%), and severe (>70%) stenosis. Thin-section, low- and high-kV DICOM images from the arterial phase acquisi- tion were processed with a dual-energy CT prototype (DTA, eXamine, Siemens Healthineers) to generate spectral segmentation and radiomic features over regions of interest along the entire length (volume) and separately at a single-section with maximum stenosis. Multiple logistic regressions and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used for data analysis. RESULTS Among 85 patients, 22 ICA/CCAs had normal luminal dimensions and 148 ICA/CCAs had luminal stenosis (mild stenosis: 51, moderate: 38, severe: 59). For differentiating non-severe and severe ICA/CCA stenosis, radiomic features (volume: AUC=0.94, 95% CI 0.88-0.96; section: AUC=0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.93) were significantly better than spectral segmentation features (volume: AUC = 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-0.87; section: AUC = 0.68, 95% CI 0.66-0.78) (P < .001). Spectral radiomic features predicted revascularization procedure (AUC = 0.77) and the presence of ipsilateral intra- cranial ischemic changes (AUC = 0.76). CONCLUSION Spectral segmentation and radiomic features from DECTA can differentiate patients with differ- ent luminal ICA/CCA stenosis grades.
