Title: Acquired cyanosis secondary to RVOT obstruction due to pacemaker lead prolapse and vegetation in a child with ASD.

Abstract: Pacemaker implantation in the paediatric population is associated with significant perioperative complications. We report a child with atrial septal defect who developed cyanosis following pacemaker implantation. An 8-year-old male child presented to us with fever of 2 months, along with cyanosis and clubbing. He underwent endocardial transvenous pacemaker implantation for congenital complete heart block. His echocardiography revealed right atrial vegetation (1 × 1 cm), moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and a prolapsed lead loop extending into the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary valve causing severe obstruction of pulmonary valve. He was started on empirical treatment followed by sensitive antibiotics based on culture report; however due to recurrent ventricular tachycardia he was taken for emergency surgery. He underwent closure of atrial septal defect, removal of pulse generator, removal of endocardial leads/vegetation, and pulmonary valve repair. Postoperative echocardiography revealed mild tricuspid regurgitation and resolution of pulmonic stenosis. This case presents a rare complication of severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction following pacemaker implantation. &lt;Learning objective: Lead displacement into pulmonary artery is a rare complication most often seen with abandoned pacemaker lead. Infective endocarditis involving pacemaker lead should be treated by prompt removal of lead and antibiotics.&gt;.
