Title: Percutaneous mitral commissurotomy in women with asymptomatic severe mitral stenosis before pregnancy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Performing percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) in the women with asymptomatic severe mitral stenosis (MS) who plan a pregnancy is recommended. However the data regarding this recommendation is limited in the literature. We aimed to investigate maternal and fetal outcomes of women with asymptomatic severe MS who underwent PMC before a planned pregnancy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the procedural, pregnancy related, and fetal outcomes of 33 consecutive women with severe asymptomatic MS, age 27.97 ± 2.86 years, who underwent PMC before a planned pregnancy between 2014 and 2019. The control group comprised of 66 pregnant women, age 29.09 ± 3.00 years, without a cardiac disease.
RESULTS: The PMC procedure was successful in all patients and no major complication occurred. There were no deaths, pulmonary oedema, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and thromboembolism during pregnancy. Maternal arrhythmia (p &lt; .001), deterioration in NYHA class (p = .08), and use of cardiovascular medication (p &lt; .001) was significantly higher in the study group. Maternal hospitalisation (p = .435), preeclampsia (p = 1), abortus (p = 1), fetal death (p = 1), and preterm delivery (p = .746) was similar between groups. Birth weight was significantly lower in the PMC group 2890 g (229) vs 3120 g (255) &lt;0.001, however small for gestational age newborns were similar between groups (p = .12).
CONCLUSIONS: PMC is safe in asymptomatic women with severe MS planning a future pregnancy. In selected patients with favourable valve anatomy PMC may improve maternal and fetal outcomes.
