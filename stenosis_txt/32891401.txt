Title: Comparison of the Usefulness of Strain Imaging by Echocardiography Versus Computed Tomography to Detect Right Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction in Patients With Significant Secondary Tricuspid Regurgitation.

Abstract: Assessment of right ventricular (RV) systolic function in patients with significant secondary tricuspid regurgitation (STR) remains challenging. In patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), STR and RV enlargement have been associated with poor outcomes. In these patients, speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) may detect RV systolic dysfunction better than 3-dimensional (3D) RV ejection fraction (EF). The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of RV dysfunction when assessed with STE in patients with significant STR (≥3+) compared with patients without significant STR (<3+) matched for 3D RV dimensions and RVEF on dynamic computed tomography (CT). Patients with dynamic CT data before TAVI were evaluated retrospectively. To assess the performance of RV-free wall strain (RVFWS) for identifying patients with impaired RV systolic function, patients were subsequently matched 1:1 based on age, gender, indexed RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDVi), indexed RV end-systolic volume (RVESVi), RVEF, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In a total 267 patients (80 ± 8 years, 48% male), significant STR (≥3+) was observed in 67 patients. Patients with STR≥3+ had larger RVEDVi, larger RVESVi, lower LVEF, and more impaired RVFWS compared with patients with STR<3+ (n = 200). After propensity score matching, patients with STR≥3+ (n = 53) had significantly more impaired RVFWS compared with patients with STR<3+ (n = 53): -18.2 ± 5.0% versus -21.1 ± 3.7%, p = 0.001. In conclusion, patients with significant STR have more pronounced RV systolic dysfunction as assessed with STE than the patients without significant STR despite having similar 3D RV dimensions and RVEF on dynamic CT.
