Title: [Redo Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction].

Abstract: As more patients with congenital heart disease survive the definitive surgical repair, more attention has paid to their residual defects or late sequela which required surgical re-intervention. Redo-right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction is the most frequent reoperation, mostly indicated for pulmonary regurgitation after tetralogy of Fallot repair, or conduit stenosis in post-Rastelli patients. For patients with significant chronic pulmonary regurgitation, reoperation should be considered before right ventricular geometry and function becomes irreversible. In Japan, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) valved conduit with bulging sinus has been widely used and has showed excellent long-term results. However, careful monitoring must be continued for right ventricular outflow tract function in order to maintain good quality of life of these patients.
