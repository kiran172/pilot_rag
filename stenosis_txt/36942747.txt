Title: Cerebral and Retinal Infarction in Bicuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: Background Description of cerebral and retinal infarction in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is limited to case reports. We aimed to characterize cerebral and retinal infarction and examine outcomes in patients with BAV. Methods and Results Consecutive patients from 1975 to 2015 with BAV (n=5401) were retrospectively identified from the institutional database; those with confirmed cerebral or retinal infarction were analyzed. Infarction occurring after aortic valve replacement was not included. Patients were grouped according to infarction pathogenesis: embolism from a degenerative calcific BAV (BAVi); non-BAV, large artery atherosclerotic or lacunar infarction (LAi); and non-BAV, non-large artery embolic infarction (nLAi). There were 83/5401 (1.5%) patients, mean age 54±12 years and 28% female, with confirmed cerebral or retinal infarction (LAi 23/83 [28%]; nLAi 30/83 [36%]; BAVi 26/83 [31%]; other 4/83 [5%]). Infarction was embolic in 72/83 (87%), and 35/72 (49%) were cardioembolic. CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score was 1.4±1.2 in BAVi (P=0.188 versus nLAi) and 2.3±1.2 in LAi (P=0.005). Recurrent infarction occurred in 41% overall (50% BAVi, P=0.164 and 0.803 versus LAi and nLAi). BAVi was more commonly retinal (39% BAVi versus 13% LAi, P=0.044 versus 0% nLAi, P=0.002). Patients with BAVi and LAi were more likely to have moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis and undergo aortic valve replacement compared with patients with nLAi. Conclusions Cardioembolism, often from degenerative calcification of the aortic valve, is a predominant cause of cerebral and retinal infarction in patients with BAV and is frequently recurrent. Cerebral and retinal infarction should be regarded as a complication of BAV.
