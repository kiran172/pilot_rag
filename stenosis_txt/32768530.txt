Title: Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty for Carotid Artery Occlusion Caused by Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: A 27-year-old male patient suffering from dizziness and right amaurosis was diagnosed with Takayasu arteritis (TA). Computed tomography angiography showed that all the supra-aortic arteries were occluded except an aberrant right subclavian artery. The patient underwent drug-coated balloon dilatation at the lesion of the right common carotid artery and performed well after the procedure. Six months later, the patient's symptoms have not recurred and computed tomography angiography showed the right carotid artery remains patency. The supra-aortic artery lesions in TA may be a potential novel indication for a drug-coated balloon.
