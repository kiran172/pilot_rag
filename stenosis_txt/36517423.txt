Title: [Diagnostic value of different serological markers and correlation analysis with disease phenotype in inflammatory bowel disease].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the diagnostic value of different serological markers and the correlation with disease phenotype in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: The clinical data of 445 IBD patients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from June 2010 to December 2020 were retrospectively collected, including 223 cases of ulcerative colitis (UC) [111 males, 112 females, with a median age of 46(20,79) years] and 222 cases of Crohn's disease (CD) [147 males, 75 females, with a median age of 39 (19, 72) years]. The positive rates of serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), goblet cell autoantibodies (GAB) and pancreatic autoantibodies (PAB) in the two groups were analyzed. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of UC and CD were calculated. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the relationship between different combinations of antibodies and disease phenotype. Results: The positive rates of ASCA and PAB in CD patients were 34.7% (77/222) and 38.3% (85/222), respectively, which were higher than those in UC patients [10.3% (23/223) and 4.5% (10/223), P&lt;0.001]. The positive rate of ANCA in UC patients was 50.2% (112/223), which was higher than that in CD patients [5.4% (12/222), P&lt;0.001]. The positive rates of serum GAB in CD and UC patients were 21.6% (48/222) and 28.3% (63/223), respectively, with no significant difference (P=0.760). In patients with CD, the sensitivity of mono-marker ASCA (+), dual-marker ASCA (+) ANCA (-), quadruple-marker ASCA (+) ANCA (-) PAB (+) GAB (-) in diagnosing CD was 34.7%, 32.9%, 20.7%, the specificity was 89.7%, 95.5%, 100.0%, the positive predictive value was 77.0%, 90.1%, 100.0%, and the negative predictive value was 58.0%, 58.7%, 55.9%, respectively. In patients with UC, the sensitivity of mono-marker ANCA (+), dual-marker ANCA (+) ASCA (-), quadruple-marker ANCA (+) ASCA (-) PAB (-) GAB (+) in diagnosing UC was 50.2%, 40.4%, 24.2%, the specificity was 94.6%, 95.5%, 100.0%, the positive predictive value was 90.3%, 90.0%, 100.0%, and the negative predictive value was 65.4%, 61.4%, 56.8%, respectively. Mono-marker ASCA (+) (OR=3.39, 95%CI: 1.59-7.21), dual-marker ASCA (+) ANCA (-) (OR=2.87, 95%CI: 1.34-6.14), triple-marker ASCA (+) ANCA (-) GAB (-) (OR=3.09, 95%CI: 1.31-7.31) and quadruple-marker ASCA (+) ANCA (-) PAB (+) GAB (-) (OR=3.15, 95%CI: 1.56-8.03) were associated with stenosis and/or penetrating type CD. The mono-marker ANCA (+) (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.42-5.12) and dual-marker ANCA (+) ASCA (-) (OR=2.11, 95%CI: 1.03-4.16) were associated with extensive colonic lesions in UC. Conclusion: Based on ASCA or ANCA, the combination with PAB or GAB, is conducive to IBD diagnosis, and is associated with stenosis and/or penetrating type of CD and extensive type of UC.
