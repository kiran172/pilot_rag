Title: An Adolescent With Progressive Shortness of Breath.

Abstract: Shortness of breath and wheezing are common presenting signs for children in the emergency department. In adolescence, it is often due to asthma or lower respiratory tract infections. We present a rare pediatric case of an adolescent with biphasic stridor and progressive exercise-induced shortness of breath who was found to have severe idiopathic subglottic stenosis.
