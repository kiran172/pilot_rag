Title: The importance of compression time in stapled hemorrhoidopexy: is patience a virtue?

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether longer compression time before firing the stapler reduced the postoperative complications related to staple line formation in stapled hemorrhoidopexy.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control study was conducted at a colorectal-anal specialty hospital. Consecutive patients with grades III and IV hemorrhoids who underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy between January 2016 and November 2019 were included. According to the compression time, patients were assigned to the long compression time group (2 minutes) or the typical compression time group (30 seconds). The primary outcome measure was incidence of staple line complications such as dehiscence, bleeding, and stenosis.
RESULTS: A total of 348 patients treated with stapled hemorrhoidopexy were evaluated. Seventy-three and 275 patients were included in the long compression time group and the typical compression time group, respectively. No significant differences were observed in patient characteristics between the groups. However, additional procedures were performed more frequently in the typical compression time group (78.1% vs. 92.0%, P=0.001). Bleeding occurred more frequently in the typical compression time group (1.4% vs. 8.4%, P=0.030). The rates of dehiscence and stenosis were not significantly different between the groups. Fecal urgency developed more frequently in the typical compression time group (0% vs. 5.1%, P=0.040). In logistic regression analysis, typical compression time (30 seconds) was the only risk factor for bleeding (odds ratio, 8.496; P=0.040).
CONCLUSION: Longer compression time was associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative bleeding after stapled hemorrhoidopexy.
