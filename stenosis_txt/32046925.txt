Title: Periprocedural Complications After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Their Impact on Resource Utilization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To examine the incidence and trends of peri-procedural complications after TAVR and their impact on resource utilization.
METHODS: The incidence of complications by type [acute kidney injury (AKI), permanent pacemaker (PPM), vascular, paravalvular leak, in-hospital mortality, others] was calculated for TAVR patients at a high-volume center between 2012 and 2018. Clinical data were matched with hospital-billing data of patients. Trends in high resource utilization (discharge to a rehabilitation facility or PLOS >7 days) (HRU) and complication rates were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of HRU.
RESULTS: Out of 1163 patients, 966 (83%) had no complications, others in 95 (8%), PPM in 56 (5%), AKI alone in 32 (3%), vascular in 31 (3%), in-hospital mortality in 28 (2%) and PVL in 10 (1%). A significant decreasing trend in the incidence of complications (29% vs 10%; p trend <0.001) and HRU (75% vs 12%; p trend <0.001) was observed between 2012 and 2018 respectively. Mean ± SD direct procedure cost of having a complication was $58,234 ± $24,568, was associated with an incremental cost of $10, 649 and a prolonged stay of 3-days. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, PPM, vascular complications, high STS risk score, NYHA class III/IV, frailty and ≥ moderate tricuspid regurgitation were significantly associated with HRU. TAVR year was protective against HRU.
CONCLUSIONS: We established that, post-TAVR resource utilization and morbidity is high among frail and patients with higher STS risk scores. However, these rates decrease over time with experience.
