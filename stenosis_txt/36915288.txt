Title: Association of high-sensitivity troponin T with outcomes in asymptomatic non-severe aortic stenosis: a post-hoc substudy of the SEAS trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: High-sensitivity Troponin T (hsTnT), a biomarker of cardiomyocyte overload and injury, relates to aortic valve replacement (AVR) and mortality in severe aortic stenosis (AS). However, its prognostic value remains unknown in asymptomatic patients with AS. We aimed to investigate if an hsTnT level >14 pg/mL (above upper limit of normal 99th percentile) is associated with echocardiographic AS-severity, subsequent AVR, ischaemic coronary events (ICE), and mortality in asymptomatic patients with non-severe AS.
METHODS: In this post-hoc sub-analysis of the multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled SEAS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00092677), we included asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate-severe AS. We ascertained baseline and 1-year hsTnT concentrations and examined the association between baseline levels and the risk of the primary composite endpoint, defined as the first event of all-cause mortality, isolated AVR (without coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)), or ICE. Multivariable regressions and competing risk analyses examined associations of hsTnT level >14 pg/mL with clinical correlates and 5-year risk of the primary endpoint.
FINDINGS: Between January 6, 2003, and March 4, 2004, a total of 1873 patients were enrolled in the SEAS trial, and 1739 patients were included in this post-hoc sub-analysis. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 67.5 (9.7) years, 61.0% (1061) were men, 17.4% (302) had moderate-severe AS, and 26.0% (453) had hsTnT level &gt;14 pg/mL. The median hsTnT difference from baseline to 1-year was 0.8 pg/mL (IQR, -0.4 to 2.3). In adjusted linear regression, log(hsTnT) did not correlate with echocardiographic AS severity (p = 0.36). In multivariable Cox regression, a hsTnT level &gt;14 pg/mL vs. hsTnT ≤14 pg/mL was associated with an increased risk of the primary composite endpoint (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70; p = 0.0002). In a competing risk model of first of the individual components of the primary endpoint, a hsTnT level &gt;14 pg/mL was associated with ICE risk (HR 1.71; 95% CI, 1.23-2.38; p = 0.0013), but not with isolated AVR (p = 0.064) or all-cause mortality (p = 0.49) as the first event.
INTERPRETATION: hsTnT level is within the reference range (≤14 pg/mL) in 3 out of 4 non-ischaemic patients with asymptomatic mild-to-moderate AS and remains stable during a 1-year follow-up regardless of AS-severity. An hsTnT level >14 pg/mL was mainly associated with subsequent ICE, which suggest that hsTnT concentration is primarily a risk marker of subclinical coronary atherosclerotic disease.
