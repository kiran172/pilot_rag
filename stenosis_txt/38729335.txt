Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Low Surgical Risk Patients: An Updated Metanalysis of Extended Follow-Up Randomized Controlled Trials.

Abstract: The long-term safety and effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in low surgical risk has not been evaluated in a pooled analysis. An electronic database search was conducted for randomized controlled trials with a maximal 5 years clinical and echocardiographic follow-up including low surgical risk patients who underwent TAVR or SAVR. We calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. Subgroups analysis was performed for permanent pacemaker implantation and paravalvular leaks. Three randomized controlled trials were included with a total of 2,611 low surgical risk patients (Society of Thoracic Surgeons score &lt;4%). Compared with SAVR, the TAVR group had similar rates of all-cause mortality (OR 0.94,95% CI 0.65 to 1.37, p = 0.75) and disabling stroke (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.36, p = 0.48). No significant differences were registered in the TAVR group in terms of major cardiovascular events (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.38, p = 0.83), myocardial infarction (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.40, p = 0.31), valve thrombosis (OR 3.11, 95% CI 0.29 to 33.47, p = 0.35), endocarditis (OR 0.71,95% CI 0.35 to 1.48, p = 0.36), aortic valve reintervention (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.66, p = 0.80), and rehospitalization (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.02, p = 0.07) compared with SAVR. However, TAVR patients had a higher risk of paravalvular leaks (OR 8.21, 95% CI 4.18 to 16.14, p &lt;0.00001), but lower rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation (OR 0.27,95% CI 0.17 to 0.30, p &lt;0.0001). The rates of permanent pacemaker implantation were comparable from 1 year up to a maximum of 5 years (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.97, p = 0.18). Lastly, TAVR had a greater effective orifice area (0.10 cm2/m2, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.15, p = 0.0001), but similar transvalvular mean gradients (0.60, 95% CI 3.94 to 2.73, p = 0.72). In conclusion, TAVR patients had similar long-term outcomes compared with SAVR, except for an elevated risk of paravalvular leaks in the TAVR group and increased rates of atrial fibrillation in the SAVR cohort.
