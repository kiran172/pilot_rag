Title: Transcatheter valve replacement: a revolution.

Abstract: Degenerative aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease worldwide; however, its physiopathology remains poorly understood. Although, developments in prevention of this disease have remained relatively stagnant, the last decade has brought about innovative treatment options incorporating different percutaneous and surgical approaches. These advances have allowed physicians to offer relief to high-risk patients, previously deemed nonsurgical. Increasingly, there is a shift toward offering percutaneous valve replacement to moderate and low-risk patients with aortic stenosis. Enthusiasm for a new treatment option must always be tempered by caution; as defining appropriate patient selection is essential to achieve optimal outcomes.
