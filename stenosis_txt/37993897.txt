Title: A clinical strategy to improve the diagnostic performance of 3T non-contrast coronary MRA and noninvasively evaluate coronary distensibility: combination of diastole and systole imaging.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The clinical application of coronary MR angiography (MRA) combining diastole and systole imaging has never been described comprehensively in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. We aimed to design an optimal non-contrast coronary MRA scan protocol combining diastolic and systolic imaging and to (1) evaluate its diagnostic performance for detecting significant coronary stenosis; (2) evaluate the feasibility of this protocol to noninvasively measure the coronary distensibility index (CDI).
METHODS: From June 2021 to May 2022, 33 healthy volunteers and 91 suspected CAD patients scheduled for X-ray coronary angiography (CAG) were prospectively enrolled. 3T non-contrast water-fat coronary MRA was carried out twice at diastole and systole. Significant coronary stenosis was defined as a luminal diameter reduction of ≥ 50% using CAG as the reference and was evaluated as follows: (1) by coronary MRA in diastole alone; (2) by coronary MRA in systole alone; (3) by combined coronary MRA in diastole and systole. According to CAG, the patients were divided into significant CAD patients and non-significant CAD patients. The difference in CDI among participants was evaluated.
RESULTS: Combined coronary MRA was completed in 31 volunteers and 76 patients. The per-patient sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of combined coronary MRA were 97.5%, 83.3%, and 90.8%, respectively. Compared with single diastolic mode, combined coronary MRA showed equally high sensitivity but improved specificity on a per-patient basis (83.3% vs. 63.9%, adjusted P = 0.013). The CDI tested by coronary MRA decreased incrementally from healthy volunteers to non-significant and significant CAD patients.
CONCLUSION: Compared with single-phase mode, 3 T non-contrast combined coronary MRA significantly improved specificity and may have potential to be a simple noninvasive method to measure CDI.
