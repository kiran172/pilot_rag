Title: Angioplasty with a stent retriever to treat vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage due to an aneurysm: a multicenter study of safety and efficacy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of angioplasty with a retrievable stent in treating vasospasm secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to an aneurysm.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from consecutive patients undergoing endovascular angioplasty with a retrievable stent to treat vasospasm related to SAH due to an aneurysm in four neurointerventional radiology departments between January 2018 and July 2019. We included patients aged >18 years with vasospasm >50% of the internal carotid artery (ICA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), and / or middle cerebral artery (MCA) secondary to SAH due to an aneurysm treated with endovascular angioplasty with a retrievable stent. The variables used to measure safety were complications of the procedure and clinical complications. The variables used to measure radiological efficacy were improvement in the degree of stenosis after endovascular treatment and improvement or normalization of cerebral circulation time CTT).
RESULTS: We included 16 angioplasty procedures with retrievable stents in 13 patients, in which 33 arterial segments were treated (10 ICA, 15 MCA, and 8 ACA). We observed no complications of the procedure in any patients and no clinical complications in patients who were not intubated. All but one of the patients who had delayed CTT at the beginning of the procedure showed improvements in CTT. The mean improvement in the degree of stenosis was 18% ± 11.65% in the ICA, 30.67% ± 18.45% in the MCA, and 28.38% ± 15.49% in the ACA. No statistically significant associations were observed between endovascular treatment variables and the degree of improvement in stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Angioplasty with a retrievable stent is a safe and efficacious treatment for vasospasm secondary to SAH due to an aneurysm, improving CTT and stenosis.
