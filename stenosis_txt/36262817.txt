Title: Subglottic tracheal stenosis complicating pregnancy: A case report.

Abstract: The case presented details an uncommon case of subglottic tracheal stenosis exacerbated by pregnancy. We outine the multidisciplinary management involved and the outcomes for the pregnancy. The case serves as a reminder that shortness of breath in pregnancy has a broad differential diagnosis, and stridor is always abnormal.
