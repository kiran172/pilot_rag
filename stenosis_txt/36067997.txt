Title: Laparoscopic radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection and ileal orthotopic neobladder by a total extraperitoneal approach: Our initial technique and short-term outcomes.

Abstract: PURPOSE: With the increasing application of laparoscopic or robot-assisted radical cystectomy, a reliable and promising method is needed for reducing postoperative complications. We describe the short-term outcomes of totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy (TELRC) with extraperitoneal pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) and extraperitoneal ileal orthotopic neobladder (EION) techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2020 to December 2021, we performed TELRC and EPLND with EION in 72 patients in our center. The accompanying video highlights our novel techniques. The patients' demographic data, intraoperative data, and perioperative complications were collected, and short-term oncological and functional results are reported.
RESULTS: All procedures were technically successful without conversion to open surgery. The patients' mean body mass index was 26.22±5.71. Median age was 57.51±12.34 years. Average hospital stay was 13.78±4.62 days. Median intraoperative blood loss was 112.92±88.56 mL. No blood transfusion was needed during the operations and only one blood transfusion was performed during the perioperative period. Mean operating time was 259.44±49.84 minutes. Average cost was US$9,875.71±1,873.08. Postoperative short-term complications included short-term ileus (n=3), infection (n=13), leakage of urine (n=11), and lymph fistula (n=7). One late complication of unilateral vesicoureteral anastomotic stenosis occurred. The mean follow-up was 13.42±8.77 months, and no patient developed local or systemic recurrence. The short-term follow-up and small cohort of patients limited our evaluation of outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: TELRC with PLND and EION was technically feasible and clinically promising, with a reduced potential harm of postoperative complications. Long-term follow-up and a larger cohort of patients are needed for further study.
