Title: Current status and outlook of biodegradable metals in neuroscience and their potential applications as cerebral vascular stent materials.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, biodegradable metals (BMs) have emerged as promising materials to fabricate temporary biomedical devices, with the purpose of avoiding potential side effects of permanent implants. In this review, we first surveyed the current status of BMs in neuroscience, and briefly summarized the representative stents for treating vascular stenosis. Then, inspired by the convincing clinical evidence on the in vivo safety of Mg alloys as cardiovascular stents, we analyzed the possibility of producing biodegradable cerebrovascular Mg alloy stents for treating ischemic stroke. For these novel applications, some key factors should also be considered in designing BM brain stents, including the anatomic features of the cerebral vasculature, hemodynamic influences, neuro-cytocompatibility and selection of alloying elements. This work may provide insights into the future design and fabrication of BM neurological devices, especially for brain stents.
