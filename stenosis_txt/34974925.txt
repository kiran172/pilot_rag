Title: [Tracheal lipoma: An exceptional cause of tracheal tumors].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Tracheal tumors are rare, they are most often malignant and can manifest themselves by a non-specific respiratory symptomatology with progressively increasing dyspnea orienting in the first place towards a COPD or even an asthma. Among them, tracheal lipoma is exceptional. Its management is based on removal by rigid bronchoscopy.
OBSERVATION: We report the case of a 73-year-old male patient who presented with non-specific dyspnea that progressively worsened over several months. The EFR showed a flattening of the flow-volume curves, the CT scan showed an anterolateral oval tracheal tumor with fatty density, the bronchial endoscopy showed a tumor lesion with stenosis of about 90% of the airway. Management consisted of a rigid bronchoscopy to delete obtruction with biopsies. Anatomopathology concluded to a tracheal lipoma.
CONCLUSION: Progressively worsening dyspnea, especially if there are signs of inspiratory dyspnea, required a systematic bronchial endoscopy to avoid the possibility of a tracheal tumor.
