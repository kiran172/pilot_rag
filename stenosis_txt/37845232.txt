Title: A multi-stage neural network approach for coronary 3D reconstruction from uncalibrated X-ray angiography images.

Abstract: We present a multi-stage neural network approach for 3D reconstruction of coronary artery trees from uncalibrated 2D X-ray angiography images. This method uses several binarized images from different angles to reconstruct a 3D coronary tree without any knowledge of image acquisition parameters. The method consists of a single backbone network and separate stages for vessel centerline and radius reconstruction. The output is an analytical matrix representation of the coronary tree suitable for downstream applications such as hemodynamic modeling of local vessel narrowing (i.e., stenosis). The network was trained using a dataset of synthetic coronary trees from a vessel generator informed by both clinical image data and literature values on coronary anatomy. Our multi-stage network achieved sub-pixel accuracy in reconstructing vessel radius (RMSE = 0.16 ± 0.07 mm) and stenosis radius (MAE = 0.27 ± 0.18 mm), the most important feature used to inform diagnostic decisions. The network also led to 52% and 38% reduction in vessel centerline reconstruction errors compared to a single-stage network and projective geometry-based methods, respectively. Our method demonstrated robustness to overcome challenges such as vessel foreshortening or overlap in the input images. This work is an important step towards automated analysis of anatomic and functional disease severity in the coronary arteries.
