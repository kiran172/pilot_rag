Title: Medical treatment of a symptomatic acute pulmonary vein stenosis following antral pulmonary vein isolation.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis is a rare but serious complication of PV isolation. It usually develops 3-6 months after the procedure, but may rarely develop in the acute phase. We present a case of symptomatic PV stenosis within 48 hours after antral PV isolation. Following the initiation of medical treatment including a glucocorticoid, acute changes in the PV wall regressed and the patient's complaint of dyspnea at rest improved rapidly. In addition, long-term renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers were given. The complaint did not recur during follow-up and PV stenosis was mild at 6 months.
