Title: Allium® ureteral stent, a new player in the treatment of ureteral stenosis: a prospective cohort study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Ureteral stricture is a chronic condition that can result in the obstruction of urinary drainage from the affected renal unit, leading to loss of renal function. Treatment methods can be categorized into two main headings: endourological and reconstructive procedures. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the self-expandable Allium® ureteral stent, which has been used in the minimally invasive treatment of ureteral stenosis in recent years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients who were applied Allium® ureteral stent between 2017 and 2021 included in the study. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, the details of the treatments applied to the patients, the perioperative and postoperative complications, the treatments applied for the complications and the findings in the follow-up were recorded and evaluated prospectively.
RESULTS: Etiology included urolithiasis in 16 patients (80%), malignancy in 3 patients (15%), and a previous gynecological operation in 1 patient (5%). Stent obstruction was found to be the most common complication in 3 patients (15%). Stent migration was the second most common complication in 2 patients (10%). Our follow-up continues with 15 patients without stent-related complications and stent obstruction. The mean follow-up period was 28 ± 15.7 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Allium ureteral stent is an effective and reliable method in the minimally invasive treatment of ureteral stricture with complications seen at acceptable rates and ease of treatment in the management of complications.
