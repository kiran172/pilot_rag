Title: Prognostic factors in the management of pediatric subglottic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We report outcomes of endoscopic interventions in the management of pediatric subglottic stenosis (SGS), and factors that lead to open airway reconstruction.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort review of all pediatric patients with SGS, treated by a single surgeon, at a tertiary academic medical center from 2012 to 2020 was conducted. Variables recorded included patient demographics, initial grade of stenosis, gestational age, length of intubation, comorbidities as well as total number of interventions.
RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were included in the study, of which 51% (n = 24) were female. Laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) was performed in 49% (n = 23) of patients. Decannulation was achieved in 25 of 32 tracheostomized patients. Fifteen patients did not have tracheostomy. There was a significant difference in gestational age (28.7 ± 5.36 vs 33.2 ± 6.13), initial grade of stenosis (2.3 ± 0.82 vs 1.6 ± 0.88), and total number of interventions (5.7 ± 2.8 vs 2.3 ± 1.5) when stratifying patients proceeding to LTR versus not (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference, however, in the length of intubation between the two groups. Of the comorbidities recorded, none were found to have a significant impact on the outcome.
CONCLUSION: Subglottic stenosis is a challenging condition to treat, often requiring multiple interventions including LTR. We propose a set of risk factors that may assist in the treatment of SGS patients with certain comorbidities to minimize interventions and maximize outcomes.
