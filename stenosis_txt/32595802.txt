Title: Peripheral Arterial Disease with Small Aorta Syndrome: A Case Report.

Abstract: We report a case of a 79-year-old woman who experienced difficulty in walking. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed severe stenosis and calcification of the infrarenal aorta. The minimum diameter of the infrarenal aorta was 8 mm and that of the common femoral artery was 4 mm. Other vessels with abnormalities were the hypoplastic left subclavian artery and the left-sided inferior vena cava. The patient was treated with right axillobifemoral bypass. In patients with small aorta syndrome, the graft patency rate is low, and long-term follow-up is important.
