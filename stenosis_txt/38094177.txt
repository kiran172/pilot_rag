Title: Late Outcome of a Left-Atrial-to-Coronary-Sinus Shunt.

Abstract: Frail patients with severe calcific mitral stenosis have few treatment options. We present a novel case successfully treated with a left-atrial-to-coronary-sinus shunt. However, the patient's symptoms returned, and, at surgery, the shunt was found to be occluded and associated with left atrial and ventricular fibrosis and calcification. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
