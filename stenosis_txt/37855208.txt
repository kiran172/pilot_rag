Title: Successful closure of transcatheter aortic valve replacement-induced Gerbode defect with valve-in-valve technique: A case report.

Abstract: We present the first documented case of a successful closure of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)-induced Gerbode defect using a valve-in-valve approach. A 90-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis underwent TAVR. Following post-dilatation, the patient experienced hemodynamic deterioration and collapse due to tamponade and sub-annular rupture leading to hemodynamic deterioration and the development of a Gerbode defect with communication between the left ventricle and right atrium. Hemodynamic stabilization was achieved through pericardiocentesis, followed by the low implantation of a second valve, effectively sealing the rupture. This case showcases a valuable alternative for managing rare challenging complications during TAVR procedures.
