Title: Relationship between uric acid to albumin ratio and saphenous vein graft disease in patients with coronary artery bypass graft.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Saphenous vein graft disease (SVGD) remains a challenging issue for patients with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). It is associated with poor outcomes and atherosclerosis is the major cause of SVGD. Uric acid to albumin ratio (UAR) is a new marker which associated with cardiovascular mortality. We aim to evaluate the relationship between the SVGD and UAR.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 237 patients who underwent elective coronary angiography (CAG) for stable angina or positive stress test results >1 year after CABG. The patients were divided into two groups; SVGD (+) patients and SVGD (-) patients. The SVGD was defined as presence of at least 50% stenosis in at least 1 SVG.
RESULTS: UAR were significantly higher in the SVGD (+) group ( P  < 0.001). Similarly, Hs-CRP, white blood cell count, and neutrophil count were significantly higher in SVGD (+) group ( P  = 0.03, P  = 0.027 P  = 0.01, respectively). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, time interval after CABG [OR = 1.161, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.078-1.250; P  < 0.001] and UAR (OR = 2.691, 95% CI 1.121-6.459; P  < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of SVGD.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that UAR could be a simple and available marker to predict SVGD in patients with CABG who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention.
