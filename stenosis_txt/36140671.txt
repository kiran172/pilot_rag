Title: Severe Lymphatic Disorder and Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia Treated with Trametinib in a Patient with Noonan Syndrome and SOS1 Mutation.

Abstract: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a multisystemic disorder caused by germline mutations in the Ras/MAPK cascade, causing a broad spectrum of phenotypical abnormalities, including abnormal facies, developmental delay, bleeding diathesis, congenital heart disease (mainly pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), lymphatic disorders, and uro-genital abnormalities. Multifocal atrial tachycardia has been associated with NS, where it may occur independently of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Trametinib, a highly selective MEK1/2 inhibitor currently approved for the treatment of cancer, has been shown to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy in two RIT1-mutated newborns with NS and severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Severe lymphatic abnormalities may contribute to decreased pulmonary compliance in NS, and pulmonary lymphangiectasias should be included in the differential diagnosis of a newborn requiring prolonged oxygen administration. Herein we report the case of a pre-term newborn who was admitted to our unit for the occurrence of severe respiratory distress and subentrant MAT treated with trametinib.
