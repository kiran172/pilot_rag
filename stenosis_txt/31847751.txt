Title: Mean Platelet Volume Does Not Predict Restenosis After Carotid Artery Stenting in Whites.

Abstract: Background and Purpose- Mean platelet volume (MPV) indicates platelet activity possibly affecting patient's risk for progressive atherosclerotic disease. A recent study identified elevated MPV as a predictor of in-stent restenosis (ISR) after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in a Chinese population. However, the role of MPV on the development of ISR following CAS in whites is yet unknown. Methods- We retrospectively identified all consecutive patients who underwent CAS for atherosclerotic disease at our center from 2005 to 2017. All patients were followed clinically and by duplex sonography at 1, 3, and 6 months and annually after CAS. ISR was defined as ≥50% stenosis (NASCET [North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial] criteria) in the treated vessel. MPV was assessed before CAS, at last follow-up and at the time of ISR detection. Results- Of 392 patients with CAS (mean age 68.5±9.5 years, 26.8% women, 42.3% symptomatic stenosis), 54 had ISR after a mean follow-up time of 32 months. Baseline MPV was not different in ISR compared with non-ISR patients (10.7 versus 10.6 fL, P=0.316). MPV levels did also not change from baseline to ISR detection (P=0.310) and were not associated with recurrent stroke or vascular events (P&gt;0.5). Multivariable analysis identified active smoking as the sole risk factor for carotid ISR (odds ratio, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.21-5.29]). Conclusions- We did not identify MPV as a risk factor for ISR after CAS in whites. Smoking cessation is an important target to avoid this complication.
