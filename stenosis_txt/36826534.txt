Title: Does Gender Influence the Indication of Treatment and Long-Term Prognosis in Severe Aortic Stenosis?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: It is a matter of controversy whether the therapeutic strategy for severe aortic stenosis (AS) differs according to gender.
METHODS: Retrospective study of patients diagnosed with severe AS (transvalvular mean gradient ≥ 40 mmHg and/or aortic valvular area &lt; 1 cm2) between 2009 and 2019. Our aim was to assess the association of sex on AVR or medical management and outcomes in patients with severe AS.
RESULTS: 452 patients were included. Women (51.1%) were older than men (80 ± 8.4 vs. 75.8 ± 9.9 years; p &lt; 0.001). Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed less frequently in women (43.4% vs. 53.2%; p = 0.03), but multivariate analyses showed that sex was not an independent predictor factor for AVR. Age, Charlson index and symptoms were predictive factors (OR 0.81 [0.82-0.89], OR 0.81 [0.71-0.93], OR 22.02 [6.77-71.64]). Survival analysis revealed no significant association of sex within all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities (log-rank p = 0.63 and p = 0.07). Cox proportional hazards analyses showed AVR (HR: 0.1 [0.06-0.15]), Charlson index (HR: 1.13 [1.06-1.21]) and reduced LVEF (HR: 1.9 [1.32-2.73]) to be independent cardiovascular mortality predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: Gender is not associated with AVR or long-term prognosis. Cardiovascular mortality was associated with older age, more comorbidity and worse LVEF.
