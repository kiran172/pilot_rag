Title: Protective defunctioning stoma in bowel segmental resection at the time of total hysterectomy for endometriosis: when less is more.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare postoperative complications in women undergoing total hysterectomy with segmental resection (TH-SR) for intestinal endometriosis with or without protective defunctioning stoma (PDS) confection.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted at the Gynecologic department of University Hospital of Lille (France) from January 2008 to January 2022 in patients undergone TH-SR for bowel endometriosis.
RESULTS: 100 women were considered for the analysis. PDS were performed in 56 women. The rate of rectal resections was significantly higher in the PDS group (p = 0.03). The mean operative time, AAGL scores and length of hospital stay were significantly higher in the PDS group (p = 0.002). The rate of grade III complication according to Clavien-Dindo classification was higher in the PDS group (p = 0.03). Among digestive complications, one case of anastomosis leakage (1.8%) and one case of recto-vaginal fistula (2.3%) was recorded in the non-PDS group, 4 cases of anastomosis stenosis were recorded in the PDS group (7.1%). Persisting bladder atony requiring self-catheterization over one month was the most common disturb (4.6% in the non-PDS group and 7.1% in the PDS group, p = 0.58). The distance of digestive lesion from anal margin was the only risk factor for digestive complications, persistent bladder atony, Clavien-Dindo IIIA and IIIB complications at the multivariate analysis (p = 0.04 and p = 0.06 respectively).
CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences were found in the rate of digestive complications in case of total hysterectomy and concomitant segmental resection when performing or not preventing stoma.
