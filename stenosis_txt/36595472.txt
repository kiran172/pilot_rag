Title: Investigation of a pervasive immune, cardiac, and behavioral phenotype in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: A case report.

Abstract: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder caused by genetic and epigenetic changes in the chromosome 11p15 region. The syndrome is characterized by a wide range of features including macrosomia, lateralized overgrowth, abdominal wall defects, and hypoglycemia. BWS presentation is variable across the entire patient population, but certain areas including immunology, cardiology, and behavioral differences are not well characterized. We present a case of a male patient with BWS due to the most common cause of BWS, loss of methylation at imprinting center 2 with a variable phenotype, including classical features (macrosomia, macroglossia, omphalocele, placentomegaly and mild lateralized overgrowth) in addition to uncommon features (immune deficiency, developmental delays, and pulmonary stenosis) not typically seen in BWS. This study defines a patient's clinical presentation and course and highlights the need to consider atypical organ systems in BWS as either an expansion of the phenotype or co-existing conditions to develop personalized care models.
