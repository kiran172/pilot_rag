Title: Mucomucosal anastomotic non-transecting augmentation (MANTA) urethroplasty: a ventral modification for obliterative strictures.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To present a surgical modification for the repair of bulbar urethral strictures containing short, highly obliterative segments and report on long-term objective and patient-reported outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We considered patients undergoing bulbar buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty (BMGU) between July 2016 and December 2019. Eligibility criteria for mucomucosal anastomotic non-transecting augmentation (MANTA) urethroplasty were strictures of ≥2 cm with an obliterative segment of ≤1.5 cm. The stricture is approached ventrally to avoid extensive dissection and mobilisation. Dorsally, the scar is superficially excised and the spongiosum is left intact. Dorsal mucomucosal anastomosis is complemented by ventral onlay graft. Perioperative characteristics were prospectively collected including uroflowmetry data and validated patient-reported outcome measures on voiding, erectile, and continence function. We evaluated functional follow-up, incorporating patient-reported (lower urinary tract symptoms [LUTS] score) and functional success. Recurrence was defined as need of re-treatment.
RESULTS: Of 641 men treated with anterior BMGU, 54 (8.4%) underwent MANTA urethroplasty. Overall, 26 (48%) and 45 (83%) had a history of dilatation and urethrotomy, respectively, and 14 (26%) were redo cases. Location was bulbar in 38 (70%) and penobulbar in 16 patients (30%), and the mean (SD) graft length was 4.5 (1.4) cm. At a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 41 (27-53) months, the functional success rate was 93%. Whereas the median LUTS score significantly improved from baseline to postoperatively (13 vs 3.5; P < 0.001), there was no change in erectile function (median International Index of Erectile Function - erectile function domain score 27 vs 24) or urinary continence (median International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence Short Form sum score 0 vs 0; all P ≥ 0.4). All patients were 'satisfied' (27%) or 'very satisfied' (73%) with the outcome of their operation.
CONCLUSION: With excellent long-term objective and patient-reported outcomes, MANTA urethroplasty adds to the armamentarium for long bulbar strictures with a short obliterative segment.
