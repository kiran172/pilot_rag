Title: Multidisciplinary treatment of esophageal cancer with hepatocellular carcinoma: A case report.

Abstract: Cancer remains a major cause of death globally. Esophageal cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies and has limited treatment options, thus resulting in high morbidity and mortality. We reported the case of a 65-year-old patient who came to the hospital for abdominal distension and loss of appetite. The patient's endoscopy before admission indicated the possibility of esophageal cancer. After admission, an enhanced c﻿omputed t﻿omography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen revealed esophageal stenosis and a liver tumor. The patient's final diagnosis was esophageal cancer concurrent with liver cancer, and a series of treatments were administered. However, esophageal cancer with liver cancer is rare. The patient was treated with targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization simultaneously. Then, regular follow-up was performed at 1 month, and at 3 months, the patient was discharged after immunotherapy. We hope that through this case, we can improve the clinical understanding of these two types of tumors and thereby contribute to their treatment. Research and collaboration among health-care professionals are essential for improving tumor diagnosis and treatment.
