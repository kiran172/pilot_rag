Title: Successfully Managed Access-Site Complication Was Not Associated With Worse Outcome After Percutaneous Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Up-to-Date Insights From the OCEAN-TAVI Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Access-site complications during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) cause serious issues in the future, if unresolved, but the best strategies to manage these complications remains unclear. This study aimed to comprehensively assess access-site complications during percutaneous TF-TAVI in terms of their management.
METHODS: Using the prospective, multicentre, observational registry OCEAN (Optimized Transcatheter Valvular Intervention), 1497 patients who underwent percutaneous TF-TAVI between October 2013 and May 2017 were identified. The incidence, predictors, temporal changes, and prognosis of access-site complications along with its treatment strategy and re-intervention rate were evaluated.
RESULTS: Access-site complications occurred in 105 patients (7.0%) and was predicted with lower body-mass-index (OR, 0.94; 95% CI; 0.89-0.99; p = 0.03) and higher sheath-to-femoral-artery-ratio (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24; p < 0.002). The incidence of access-site complications declined over time, irrespective of the increasing number of percutaneous TF-TAVI cases. Access-site complications were treated by conservative therapy (n = 19, 18%), interventional procedures (n = 42, 40%), rescue surgical repair (SR) (n = 10, 10%), and primary SR (n = 34, 32%). The severity of complications differed but the re-intervention rate was similar among 4 groups (p = 0.46). Re-intervention was not needed, except for a case of common femoral artery stenosis/occlusion induced by ProGlide. The need for all SRs decreased annually. Access-site complications were not associated with 30 days- and 1 year-survival rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of access-site complications was not low but has declined annually. Access-site complications are not related to worse outcomes after successful management. Interventional procedure is acceptable as the first-line strategy to treat access-site complications.
