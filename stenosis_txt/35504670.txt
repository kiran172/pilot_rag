Title: Aortic plaque dehiscence caused by rotational atherectomy with Kokeshi phenomenon in a patient with aortic stenosis successfully treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Rotational atherectomy (RA) is an important interventional technique to facilitate effective percutaneous coronary intervention of severely calcified lesions. Despite the improved probability of better procedural outcomes during angioplasty, the use of RA is associated with an inherent risk of complications. Here, we present a case of a woman in her mid-90s with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent RA facilitated angioplasty of the right coronary artery (RCA), with the procedure complicated by the Kokeshi phenomenon. Manual traction to retrieve the burr resulted in dehiscence of an aortic plaque near the ostium of the RCA. Unfortunately, the patient's risk profile precluded surgery. After a multidisciplinary discussion, a self-expanding Core Valve Evolut R prosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) was successfully implanted, with improvement in the AS and stabilisation of the aortic plaque. This is the first reported case of successful non-operative management of a mobile-aortic plaque caused by RA with a transcatheter prosthesis.
