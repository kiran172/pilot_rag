Title: Predictors of improvement for patients with CNS vasculitis stenoses: A high-resolution vessel wall MRI follow-up study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the predictors of the improvement for patients with isolated intracranial vasculitis stenoses using high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (HR VW-MRI).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from consecutive patients with confirmed intracranial vasculitis under the same conventional conservative treatment based on a prospectively established HR VW-MRI database between December 2016 and December 2020. According to the changes between the degree of stenosis at baseline compared to follow-up MR angiography, the patients were divided into an improvement group and a non-improvement group. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify the predictive factors associated with the improvement of stenoses secondary to intracranial vasculitis.
RESULTS: Overall, 41 patients (mean age 32.0 ± 10.1 years, 16 females) with isolated intracranial vasculitis stenoses were included (41.5 % [17/41] in the improvement group, and 58.5 % [24/41] were in the non-improvement group). The degree of wall enhancement on follow-up imaging was significantly reduced compared with that on the baseline imaging in the improvement group (P = 0.004). The multivariate analysis showed that the degree of enhancement (OR, 0.219, 95 % CI, 0.054 to 0.881; P = 0.033) at baseline was an independent predictive factor associated with the improvement in the intracranial vasculitis stenoses.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with isolated intracranial vasculitis stenoses, the less enhancement the vessel wall was, the more likely the degree of stenosis would be reduced by conventional conservative therapy.
