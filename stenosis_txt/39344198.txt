Title: Ventriculocoronary connection with mitral stenosis/aortic stenosis hypoplastic left heart: a case report.

Abstract: Ventriculocoronary connections develop most commonly in children with mitral stenosis/aortic atresia hypoplastic left heart. These connections can lead to myocardial ischaemia and dysfunction. We report a newborn with mitral stenosis/aortic stenosis hypoplastic left heart who endured systemic ventricular injury post-Norwood, secondary to a large ventriculocoronary fistula. He was treated medically and had favourable outcomes following bidirectional Glenn procedure.
