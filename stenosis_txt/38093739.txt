Title: Negative Impact of TET2 Mutations on Long-Term Survival After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is considered as being a novel age-related risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. By capture-sequencing of a 67-gene panel, we established a large spectrum of CHIP in 258 patients with aortic valve stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and assessed their association with long-term survival after TAVR. One or several CHIP variants in 35 genes were identified in 68% of the cohort, DNMT3A and TET2 being the 2 most frequently mutated genes. Patients carrying a TET2-CHIP-driver variant with low variant allele frequency (2%-10%) had a significant decrease in overall survival 5 years after TAVR.
