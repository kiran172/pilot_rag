Title: Impact of Perioperative Stroke on Midterm Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has evolved as an alternative therapy to open aortic valve replacement in most patients with aortic stenosis. Stroke associated with TAVR can be a devastating complication in the short term; however, little is known regarding midterm outcomes.
METHODS: All patients undergoing TAVR at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 2011 to 2018 were included. Modified Rankin Scale values as a measurement of stroke-related disability were extracted for patients who had neurologic deficits.
RESULTS: Neurologic events (NEs) developed in 51 (4.3%) of the 1193 patients during the study period (32 [2.7%] had disabling strokes; 19 [1.6%] had nondisabling strokes, including 5 [0.4%] transient ischemic attacks). Patients who had TAVR-related NEs were older (85.8 ± 4.2 years vs 81.5 ± 7.9 years; P &lt; .001) and predominantly female (68.6% vs 31.4%; P = .007), but they were comparable in terms of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted mortality score and vascular access. Patients with NEs had increased short term and midterm mortality (15.7% vs 2.6%, 29.4% vs 13.9%, and 47.1% vs 35.7% at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years, respectively). Severity of disability, determined by the modified Rankin Scale, was a risk factor for 30-day mortality (HR, 5.8; P = .003), 1-year mortality (HR, 2.1; P &lt; .001) and 3-year mortality (HR, 1.8; P &lt; .001). Predictors of TAVR NEs were older age (odds ratio [OR] per year of age, 1.11; P = .001), low body surface area (OR per m2, 0.22; P = .050), procedural duration (OR per minute, 1.01; P = .024), and administration of blood products (OR, 3.23; P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke increases short-term and midterm mortality after TAVR. Risk prediction for neurologic events in TAVR could aid the framework for patient selection and further improve outcomes.
