Title: Laryngotracheal Reconstruction for Subglottic and Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Laryngotracheal stenosis is the common endpoint for any process that results in the narrowing of the airway at the level of the glottis, subglottis, or trachea. Although endoscopic procedures are effective in opening the airway lumen, open resection and reconstruction can be necessary to reconstitute a functional airway. When resection and anastomosis are insufficient due to extensive length or location of the stenosis, autologous grafts can be used to expand the airway. Future directions in airway reconstruction include tissue engineering and allotransplantation.
