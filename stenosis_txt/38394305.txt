Title: Impact of an angulated aorto-septal relationship on cardio-cerebrovascular outcomes in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Abstract: Aortic and valvular calcification are well-known risk factors for cardio-cerebrovascular events in patients undergoing hemodialysis. We investigated the clinical impact of an angulated aorto-septal angle as a result of aortic elongation due to aortic calcification on cardio-cerebrovascular outcomes in patients undergoing hemodialysis. We investigated 306 patients (mean age 65.4 years, 68% male) who underwent pre-scheduled routine echocardiography between April and September 2018. The angle between the anterior wall of the aorta and the ventricular septal surface (ASA) was quantified. We determined aortic and mitral valve calcification scores based on calcified cardiac changes; the aortic and mitral valve scores ranged between 0-9 and 0-6, respectively. The primary endpoint was a composite including cardio-cerebrovascular events and cardio-cerebrovascular death. The mean duration of dialysis among the patients in this analysis was 9.6 years. The primary endpoint was observed in 54 patients during the observational period (median 1095 days). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses identified left ventricular ejection fraction (per 10% increase: hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 95% confidential interval [CI] 0.53-0.84, P = 0.001), left ventricular mass index (per 10 g/m2 increase: HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.05-1.24, P = 0.001), ASA (per 10 degree increase: HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54-0.88; P = 0.003), and aortic valve calcification score (HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.26, P = 0.005) as independent determinants of the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a higher incidence of the primary endpoint in patients with ASA <119.4 degrees than those with ASA â‰¥119.4 degrees (Log-rank P < 0.001). An angulated aorto-septal angle is an independent risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular events and cardio-cerebrovascular death in patients undergoing hemodialysis.
