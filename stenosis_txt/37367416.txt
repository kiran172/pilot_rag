Title: Clinical Use of Blood Flow Analysis through 4D-Flow Imaging in Aortic Valve Disease.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which affects 1% of the general population, results from the abnormal fusion of the cusps of the aortic valve. BAV can lead to the dilatation of the aorta, aortic coarctation, development of aortic stenosis (AS), and aortic regurgitation. Surgical intervention is usually recommended for patients with BAV and bicuspid aortopathy. This review aims to examine 4D-flow imaging as a tool in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for assessing abnormal blood flow and its clinical application in BAV and AS. We present a historical clinical approach summarizing evidence of abnormal blood flow in aortic valve disease. We highlight how abnormal flow patterns can contribute to the development of aortic dilatation and novel flow-based biomarkers that can be used for a better understanding of the disease progression.
