Title: Computational Modeling of Carotid Bruits.

Abstract: The sound generated by diseased carotid arteries was investigated through computational means using three-dimensional, idealized, stenosed carotid bifurcation models. Stenosis levels of 50% and 70% with axi-symmetric and asymmetric stenosis shapes were considered. The hemodynamic flow field was obtained by solving the incompressible, Navier-Stokes equations. The resulting pressure fluctuations at the vessel walls were then used as input for a linearized wave equation for the propagation of vibrations through the modeled surrounding tissue. As observed in prior studies, the sound spectra obtained at the tissue surface indicate a 'break frequency', i.e. a frequency beyond which there is a drop-off in sound spectra intensity. This frequency was found to scale with stenosis diameter and average velocity at the stenosis throat, provided the stenosis shape remained the same. This has important implications on past attempts to estimate stenosis diameter from the break frequency.
