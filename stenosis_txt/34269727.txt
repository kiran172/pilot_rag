Title: Portal Biliopathy and Cavernous Transformation of the Portal Vein Revealed by 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT.

Abstract: A 47-year-old man presented with right upper abdominal pain for 1 month. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed hilar bile duct stenosis with dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and his serum CA19-9 and CA242 levels were significantly elevated. 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT were performed for differential diagnosis. 18F-FDG PET/CT showed only mild FDG uptake in the hepatic hilum. Astonishingly, in 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT, intense radioactivity was presented on the same region, which indicated massive fibroblasts aggregation in hepatic hilum. The patient was finally diagnosed as portal biliopathy caused by cavernous transformation of the portal vein.
