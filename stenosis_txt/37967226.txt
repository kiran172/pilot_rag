Title: Clinical characteristics of tracheobronchial Talaromyces marneffei infection in non-HIV-infected patients in South China.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Tracheobronchial Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) infections among non-HIV-infected patients are rare. To improve understanding, we analysed the clinical features, immune mechanisms, treatment, and prognosis.
METHODS: Data on hospitalized patients with tracheobronchial T. marneffei infections from September 2013 to May 2022 were collected. The clinical and imaging features were analysed.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients were enrolled, with a median age of 52 years (45-62 years). The most common symptoms were cough, expectoration, fever, weight loss, and anaemia. The total white blood cell and neutrophil counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and globulin were increased, and the serum albumin levels were decreased. Chest CT manifestations included patchy shadows, masses, obstructive atelectasis, cavities, pleural effusion, and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The fibreoptic bronchoscopy findings included masses, polyps or nodules with mucosal oedema, hypertrophic bulges, lumen stenosis or obstruction, and purulent secretions. T. marneffei infection was confirmed in 10 patients by positive culture, in five by both culture and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), in two by mNGS, in one by culture and pathology and in 1 by histopathology. BALF (15/19, 78.9%) had the highest culture positive rate, followed by sputum (3/19), bronchial mucosa (1/1), lung biopsy (1/2); 36.8% of the patients were coinfected with other pathogens. For induction therapy, 7, 6, 2, and 4 patients received voriconazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole combined with amphotericin B, and fluconazole therapy, respectively, and 26.3% received treatment combined with nebulization and/or administration of amphotericin B under fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Four patients were treated for underlying diseases or coinfection, 31.6% were cured, 42.1% improved, and 26.3% died.
CONCLUSIONS: T. marneffei infection is common in the tracheobronchial airway tissue or secretions, and bronchoscopy has important diagnostic and treatment value. Antifungal therapy, including systemic therapy, involves triazoles and amphotericin administration, and aerosol inhalation and administration of amphotericin B under bronchoscopy are important.
