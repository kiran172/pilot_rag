Title: Endoscopic Anterior Laryngotracheal Reconstruction.

Abstract: This article introduces a new endoscopic technique for anterior laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) using costal rib cartilage grafting in a 2-year-old patient with acquired Grade III subglottic stenosis. The procedure involves an endoscopic incision in the cricoid cartilage's anterior midline and successful outcomes were achieved without complications. The study emphasizes the benefits of this approach, such as reduced hospital stays, shorter operation time, and decreased scarring, but acknowledges the necessity for further human trials to validate its effectiveness in treating different grades of laryngeotracheal stenosis.
