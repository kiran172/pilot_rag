Title: [A case of successful endovascular treatment of a patient with chronic pelvic pain and recurrent varicocele].

Abstract: Described in the article is a clinical case report regarding diagnosis and treatment of pelvic varicose veins in a 34-year-old male patient presenting with compressive stenosis of the left common iliac vein (May-Thurner syndrome). The man had developed clinical symptoms of the disease as varicocele when he was 17 years old. Multiple surgical interventions on the veins of the spermatic cord failed to result in significant success. The diagnosis was verified by means of ultrasound examination and contrast X-ray phlebography. The patient was subjected to balloon angioplasty and stenting of the compressive stenosis of the left common iliac vein. The endovascular treatment performed was followed by the patient's improved condition, confirmed by methods of instrumental diagnosis, as well as by regression of clinical symptomatology.
