Title: Contemporary Diagnosis and Management of Patients with MINOCA.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is defined as acute myocardial infarction (MI) with angiographically no obstructive coronary artery disease or stenosis ≤ 50%. MINOCA is diagnostically challenging and complex, making it difficult to manage effectively. This condition accounts for 6-8% of all MI and poses an increased risk of morbidity and mortality after diagnosis. Prompt recognition and targeted management are essential to improve outcomes and our understanding of this condition, but this process is not yet standardized. This article offers a comprehensive review of MINOCA, delving deep into its unique clinical profile, invasive and noninvasive diagnostic strategies for evaluating MINOCA in light of the lack of widespread availability for comprehensive testing, and current evidence surrounding targeted therapies for patients with MINOCA.
RECENT FINDINGS: MINOCA is not uncommon and requires comprehensive assessment using various imaging modalities to evaluate it further. MINOCA is a heterogenous working diagnosis that requires thoughtful approach to diagnose the underlying disease responsible for MINOCA further.
