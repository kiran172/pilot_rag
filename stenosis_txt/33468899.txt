Title: [The Efficacy of Endoscopic Esophageal Stent Placement for Malignant Esophageal Stenosis].

Abstract: Malignant esophageal stenosis adversely affects the quality of life(QOL)on account of poor oral intake. Endoscopic esophageal stenting is one of palliative therapy for improve QOL because of minimally invasive and simple procedure. We investigated the outcomes of esophageal stenting in our institution. Twenty patients with malignant esophageal stenosis who underwent esophageal stenting in our institution between April 2014 and December 2019 were included in this study. Six(30%)out of 20 patients showed fistula. Dysphagia score was improved significantly before and after stenting(3.3± 0.6 vs 1.8±0.9, p<0.01). Complications associated with stenting occurred in 6(30%)cases. Thirteen(65%)patients were able to be discharged from the hospital, but 7(35%)patients including 4 with fistula were outcomes of death in the hospital. Esophageal stenting for malignant esophageal stenosis improved food ingestion and QOL. The prognosis in the case of malignant esophageal stenosis with fistula is extremely poor.
