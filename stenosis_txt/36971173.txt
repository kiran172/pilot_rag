Title: [Degenerative aortic valve stenosis: looking for a pharmacological prevention].

Abstract: Degenerative calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a chronic disease whose prevalence has increased over the last decade because of the aging of the general population. CAVS pathogenesis is characterized by complex molecular and cellular mechanisms that promote valve fibro-calcific remodeling. During the first phase, referred to as initiation, the valve undergoes collagen deposition and lipid and immune cell infiltration due to mechanical stress. Subsequently, during the progression phase, the aortic valve undergoes chronic remodeling through osteogenic and myofibroblastic differentiation of interstitial cells and matrix calcification. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying CAVS development supports the resort to potential therapeutic strategies that interfere with fibro-calcific progression. Currently, no medical therapy has demonstrated the ability to significantly prevent CAVS development or slow its progression. The only treatment available in symptomatic severe stenosis is surgical or percutaneous aortic valve replacement. The aim of this review is to highlight the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in CAVS pathogenesis and progression and to discuss potential pharmacological treatments able to inhibit the main pathophysiological mechanisms of CAVS, including lipid-lowering treatment with lipoprotein(a) as emergent therapeutic target.
