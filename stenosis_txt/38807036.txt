Title: Predictive value of the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio for coronary atherosclerosis severity in patients with CKD.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR), which is defined as the percentage of neutrophils divided by the concentration of albumin, is a cost-effective and readily available biomarker of inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the NPAR and the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
METHODS: A total of 280 CKD patients who underwent coronary angiography were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The severity of coronary atherosclerosis was evaluated using the Gensini score (GS). Patients were divided into low-, medium- and high-NPAR groups according to the tertiles of the NPAR values. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between the NPAR and the GS. The cutoff points for the sensitivity and specificity of the NPAR in predicting the GS were estimated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
RESULTS: There was a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) among CKD patients with higher NPARs (P =0.041). More patients in the high-NPAR group had complex CAD (triple-vessel disease and/or left main coronary artery stenosis) and chronic total occlusion lesions, and more of these patients required revascularization therapy (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the NPAR and the severity of coronary stenosis (adjusted OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.25-5.76, p=0.012), particularly among female and older (age ≥65) patients. The ROC analysis indicated that the optimal cutoff value for the NPAR in predicting severe coronary artery stenosis (GS>60) in CKD patients was 1.91 (sensitivity 0.495, specificity 0.749), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.650 (95% CI 0.581-0.719, P<0.001). A subgroup analysis according to sex revealed that the NPAR exhibited stronger predictive value in female patients (AUC 0.730, 95% CI 0.643-0.817) than in male patients (AUC 0.565, 95% CI 0.460-0.670) (P<0.001), and the optimal cutoff value for the NPAR in female patients was 1.80 (sensitivity 0.667, specificity 0.705).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that the NPAR is independently associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in CKD patients, especially in female and elderly patients (≥65 years old). Moreover, the NPAR can effectively predict the severity of coronary atherosclerosis, exhibiting greater predictive value in females than in males.
