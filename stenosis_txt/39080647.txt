Title: Surgical management of native aortic valve leaflet avulsion during TAVR.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has increased in utilization since its approval for management of aortic stenosis patients across all risk strata. We report a rare case of aortic valve leaflet avulsion after balloon expandable TAVR managed with urgent surgery.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old male underwent TAVR complicated by avulsion of the native aortic valve leaflet's left coronary cusp. He was taken for urgent surgery for cusp resection to prevent thromboembolic complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Native aortic valve leaflet avulsion should be suspected during TAVR in instances of extreme hemodynamic instability after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. As TAVR expands in lower risk patients, surgeons should have a low threshold to intervene surgically to treat native leaflet avulsion or other complications.
