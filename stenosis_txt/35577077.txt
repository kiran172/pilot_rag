Title: Carotid Enadrterectomy for Thrombosis of the Internal Carotid Artery in Patients With COVID-19.

Abstract: Analysis of the results of emergency carotid endarterectomy (CEE) against the background of internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombosis in the acute period of acute cerebrovascular accident (ACVA) in patients with COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic (April 1, 2020-May 1, 2021), 43 patients with ICA thrombosis and a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result for SARS-CoV-2 were included in this prospective study. In all cases, CEE was performed in the acutest period of ACVA. These patients were included in group 1. The comparison group was represented by 89 patients who underwent CEE in the acute period of stroke, in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic (April 1, 2019-March 1, 2020). According to laboratory parameters, patients with COVID-19 had severe coagulopathy (with an increase in D-dimer: 3832 ± 627.2 ng/mL, fibrinogen: 12.6 ± 3.1 g/L, prothrombin: 155.7 ± 10, 2%), inflammatory syndrome (increased ferritin: 646.2 ± 56.1 ng/mL, C-reactive protein: 161.3 ± 17.2 mg/L, interleukin-6: 183.3 ± 51.7 pg/mL, leukocytosis: 27.3 ± 1.7 10E9/L). In the hospital postoperative period, the groups were comparable in terms of the incidence of deaths (group 1: 2.3%, n = 1; group 2: 1.1%, n = 1; P= 0.81; OR=2.09; 95 % CI = 0.12-34.3) myocardial infarction (group 1: 2.3%, n = 1; group 2: 0%; P= 0.7; OR = 6.3; 95% CI = 0.25-158.5), CVA (group 1: 2.3%, n = 1; group 2: 2.2%, n = 2; P= 0.55; OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0,.09-11.7). ICA thrombosis and hemorrhagic transformations were not recorded. However, due to severe coagulopathy with ongoing anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, patients with COVID-19 more often developed bleeding in the operation area (group 1: 11.6%, n = 5; group 2: 1.1%, n = 1; P= 0.02; OR = 11.5; 95% CI = 1.3-102.5). In all cases, the flow of hemorrhagic discharge came from the drainage localized in the subcutaneous fat. This made it possible to remove skin sutures in a dressing room, suturing the source of bleeding and applying secondary sutures under local anesthesia. Emergency CEE in the acute period of stroke is an effective and safe method of cerebral revascularization in case of ICA thrombosis in conditions of COVID-19.
