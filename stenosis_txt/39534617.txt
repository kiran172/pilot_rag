Title: Challenges in the Concurrent Management of Severe Mitral Stenosis With LAA Thrombus and Symptomatic Adenomyosis.

Abstract: A 49-year-old woman with untreated severe mitral stenosis faced complex management challenges in a resource-limited setting. Initially presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding, her cardiac condition was discovered during a preoperative work-up for a planned hysterectomy. This case emphasizes the necessity for tailored and transdisciplinary management approaches.
