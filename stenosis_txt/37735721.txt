Title: [Surgical Explantation of a Bioprosthesis Nine Months After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation].

Abstract: 82-year-old female. In October 2020, the patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation( TAVI)[Evolut PRO R 23 mm] via left subclavian artery approach for severe aortic valve stenosis. The patient was discharged home without any issues. However, nine months after surgery, the patient was hospitalized at another hospital for a right upper arm fracture and developed a fever. The patient was transferred to our hospital and was diagnosed with Enterococcal bacteremia while receiving antibiotic treatment. Echocardiography revealed leaflet thickening and cord-like structure on the artificial valve, and a diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) was made. The patient then underwent surgical removal of the valve. The patient had a good postoperative course and completed 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment before being transferred back to the referring hospital 31 days after surgery. TAVI made unprecendented revolution in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis. TAVI is often used for elderly patients with comorbidities because of high perioperative risk is for surgical aortic valve replacement. Although TAVI is widely promoted for its benefits, it is not without limitations. In cases with more than one year of follow-up, there are many complications and the risk of surgery is high. There have been few reports of cases from Japan requiring surgical removal of TAVI valve. In this case, PVE was diagnosed nine months after TAVI and the patient had a good outcome.
