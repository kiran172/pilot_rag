Title: Short- and Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With New-Onset Persistent Left Bundle Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The impact of new-onset persistent left bundle branch block (LBBB) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on all-cause mortality has been controversial.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of eleven studies (7398 patients) comparing the short- and long- outcomes in patients who had new-onset LBBB after TAVR vs. those who did not.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 20.5Â±14months, patients who had new-onset persistent LBBB after TAVR had a higher incidence of all-cause mortality (29.7% vs. 23.6%; OR 1.28 (1.04-1.58), p=0.02), rehospitalization for heart failure (HF) (19.5% vs. 17.3%; OR 1.4 (1.13-1.73), p=0.002), and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMi) (19.7% vs. 7.1%; OR 2.4 (1.64-3.52), p&lt;0.001) compared with those who did not. Five studies (4180 patients) reported adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality; new LBBB remained associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted HR 1.43 (1.08-1.9), p&lt;0.01, I2=81%).
CONCLUSION: Post-TAVR persistent LBBB is associated with higher PPMi, HF hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality. While efforts to identify patients who need post-procedural PPMi are warranted, more studies are required to evaluate the best follow-up and treatment strategies, including the type of pacing device if required, to improve long-term outcomes in these patients.
