Title: Persistence of FoxJ1+ Pax6+ Sox2+ ependymal cells throughout life in the human spinal cord.

Abstract: Ependymal cells lining the central canal of the spinal cord play a crucial role in providing a physical barrier and in the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid. These cells express the FOXJ1 and SOX2 transcription factors in mice and are derived from various neural tube populations, including embryonic roof and floor plate cells. They exhibit a dorsal-ventral expression pattern of spinal cord developmental transcription factors (such as MSX1, PAX6, ARX, and FOXA2), resembling an embryonic-like organization. Although this ependymal region is present in young humans, it appears to be lost with age. To re-examine this issue, we collected 17 fresh spinal cords from organ donors aged 37-83 years and performed immunohistochemistry on lightly fixed tissues. We observed cells expressing FOXJ1 in the central region in all cases, which co-expressed SOX2 and PAX6 as well as RFX2 and ARL13B, two proteins involved in ciliogenesis and cilia-mediated sonic hedgehog signaling, respectively. Half of the cases exhibited a lumen and some presented portions of the spinal cord with closed and open central canals. Co-staining of FOXJ1 with other neurodevelopmental transcription factors (ARX, FOXA2, MSX1) and NESTIN revealed heterogeneity of the ependymal cells. Interestingly, three donors aged > 75 years exhibited a fetal-like regionalization of neurodevelopmental transcription factors, with dorsal and ventral ependymal cells expressing MSX1, ARX, and FOXA2. These results provide new evidence for the persistence of ependymal cells expressing neurodevelopmental genes throughout human life and highlight the importance of further investigation of these cells.
