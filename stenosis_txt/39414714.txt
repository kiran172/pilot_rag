Title: A case report with literature review: long-term follow-up of kidney autotransplantation in fibromuscular dysplasia.

Abstract: Fibromuscular dysplasia is a rare, idiopathic, systemic, non-inflammatory, and non-atherosclerotic vascular disease that primarily affects young women. It often presents as renal artery stenosis. Fibromuscular dysplasia can induce tissue damage in the post-stenotic kidney. Treatment options include antihypertensive therapy, surgical revascularization, and transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation. However, kidney autotransplantation is an alternative when these treatments are not feasible. This study presents a case report of a 22-year-old woman with fibromuscular dysplasia, highlighting the long-term success of kidney autotransplantation and reviewing the related literature. A multidisciplinary approach was employed in the treatment of this patient presenting with intermittent headaches, hypertension, and acute kidney disease, and who was diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia. She underwent left aorta-renal bypass and right autotransplantation. Following the procedure, her serum creatinine level decreased from 2.74 to 1.1 mg/dL, with an eight-year follow-up confirming the favorable outcome. Renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to secondary hypertension, with fibromuscular dysplasia being a rare cause. While medical and interventional treatments are usually effective, complex cases may necessitate alternative approaches. Kidney autotransplantation, albeit uncommon, is an effective option for patients who are unresponsive to conventional therapies. This case demonstrates the successful management of fibromuscular dysplasia-associated renovascular hypertension via kidney autotransplantation, resulting in controlled blood pressure and preserved kidney function. In conclusion, kidney autotransplantation represents a valuable therapeutic option for severe renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dysplasia, particularly when percutaneous procedures are impractical.
