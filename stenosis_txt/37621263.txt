Title: Examining readmissions following outpatient microlaryngeal surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine readmissions following microlaryngeal surgery. It was hypothesized that airway surgical procedures would have higher rates of readmission.
DESIGN: Retrospective review.
METHODS: Outpatient microlaryngeal surgeries from May 1, 2018 to November 27, 2022 were reviewed. Readmissions related to the original surgery within a 30-day postoperative period were examined. Patient demographics, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologist class, comorbidities, type of surgery, ventilation techniques, and operative times were examined and compared.
RESULTS: Out of 480 procedures analyzed, 19 (4.0%) resulted in a readmission, 9 (1.9%) of which were for glottic stenosis management. Undergoing an airway procedure was significantly associated with a readmission (p = .002) and increased the odds of readmission by 5.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.22-16.16, p &lt; .001). Current/former smoking status increased the odds of readmission by 4.50 (95% CI: 1.33-15.19, p = .016). Each additional minute of operating time increased the odds of readmission by 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00-1.05, p = .04).
CONCLUSION: Readmissions from microlaryngeal surgery are seldom reported but nonetheless occur. Identifying factors that may place a procedure at risk for readmission can help improve surgical quality of care.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
