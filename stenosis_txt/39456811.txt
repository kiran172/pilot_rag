Title: Lipoprotein (a) as a Cardiovascular Risk Factor in Controversial Clinical Scenarios: A Narrative Review.

Abstract: Lipoprotein (a) is a complex lipid molecule that has sparked immense interest in recent years, after studies demonstrated its significant association with several cardiovascular conditions. Lp(a) promotes cardiovascular disease through its combined proatherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and prothrombotic effects. While the measurement of Lp(a) has become widely available, effective methods to reduce its concentration are currently limited. However, emerging data from ongoing clinical trials involving antisense oligonucleotides have indicated promising outcomes in effectively reducing Lp(a) concentrations. This may serve as a potential therapeutic target in the management and prevention of myocardial infarction, calcific aortic stenosis, and cerebrovascular accidents. In contrast, the role of Lp(a) in atrial fibrillation, in-stent restenosis, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration remains unclear. This review article aims to thoroughly review the existing literature and provide an updated overview of the evidence surrounding the association of Lp(a) and these cardiovascular diseases. We seek to highlight controversies in the existing literature and offer directions for future investigations to better understand Lp(a)'s precise role in these conditions, while providing a summary of its unique molecular characteristics.
