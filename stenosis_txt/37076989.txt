Title: Bicuspid aortic valve caused subaortic stenosis with bulging of valve calcification through subaortic area in a young patient.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cause for the development of aortic valve calcification and stenosis. Calcification cause valvular stenosis or valvular insufficiency due to coaptation failure. We report a unique case of calcification of bicuspid valve was extending to left ventricular outflow tract and attached to interventricular septum which caused subvalvular stenosis.
