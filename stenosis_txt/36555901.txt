Title: Leukocyte Count Predicts Carotid Artery Stenosis in Men with Ischemic Stroke: Sub Study of the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS).

Abstract: Background: Inflammation is important in the development of atherosclerosis. Research suggested sex-dependent differences for the value of inflammatory markers for risk stratification of stroke patients with internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS). We investigated whether leukocytes and thrombocytes were associated with ≥50% ICAS in acute stroke and whether this was sex-dependent. Patients included in the Preventive Antibiotics in Stroke Study (PASS) were used. PASS is a randomized controlled trial that randomized between four days of preventive ceftriaxone intravenously or standard stroke care alone. It investigated whether ceftriaxone could improve functional outcome at three months after stroke. Methods: Patients included in PASS were evaluated for the predictive value of leukocytes and thrombocytes for ICAS. Ischemic stroke and TIA patients were selected out of PASS patients. Logistic regression analysis was performed adjusting for NIHSS and other covariates. Results: 2550 patients were included in PASS. 1413 of 2550 patients (55%) were evaluated in this sub study. Female patients showed a mean of 8.55 × 109/L for leukocytes and 259 × 109/L for thrombocytes. Men showed a mean of 8.29 × 109/L for leukocytes and 224 × 109/L for thrombocytes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that leukocytes were independently associated with ICAS ≥ 50% in male patients (OR 1.094, p = 0.008), but not in female patients (OR 1.041, p = 0.360). Thrombocytes were not associated with ICAS. Conclusions: We conclude that blood leukocyte count independently predicts ICAS in men after acute stroke, but not in women. Clinical Trial unique identifier: ISRCTN66140176.
