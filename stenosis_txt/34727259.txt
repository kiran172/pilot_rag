Title: Evaluation of oversizing in association with conduction disorder after implantation of a rapid deployment valve.

Abstract: Rapid deployment valve has expanded surgical indication for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis despite its accommodated risk for conduction disorder (CD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree of oversizing in association with postoperative CD. During June 2019 to September 2021, 25 patients underwent aortic valve replacement with Edwards INTUITY. Device size selection was evaluated intraoperatively using provided sizers. Oversizing was evaluated retrospectively by measuring the difference of the dimension of the annulus and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) compared to the dimensions of the device used by preoperative-computed tomography. Although there was no incidence of pacemaker implantation, seven patients (28.0%) experienced CD after surgery. There was no difference in device area and annulus area (CD: - 37 ± 22.7 mm2 vs. no CD: - 56 ± 63.6 mm2, p = 0.47), and device circumference and annulus circumference (CD: - 4.4 ± 2.77 mm vs. no CD: - 6.9 ± 5.60 mm, p = 0.26) in patients with and without CD. However, there was a significant difference in area of the device skirt and sub-annular area at the LVOT (CD: 114 ± 28.4 mm2 vs. no CD: - 8 ± 80.0 mm2, p &lt; 0.001), and circumference of device skirt and the LVOT (CD: 3.9 ± 2.08 mm vs. no CD: - 4.6 ± 5.24 mm, p &lt; 0.001) between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that an area difference of 77.7 mm2 and circumference difference of 0.91 mm at LVOT were associated with postoperative CD with specificities of 0.83, 0.78 and sensitivity of 1.0, 1.0, respectively. Preoperative measurement of the LVOT may be useful in evaluating the risk of postoperative CD in patients receiving rapid deployment valve.
