Title: Outcomes of Patients With Very Severe Aortic Stenosis Treated With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Symptoms of aortic stenosis (AS) are not proportional to its severity and patients with very severe AS (VSAS) remain asymptomatic for a long time. The appropriate time for intervention in patients with VSAS and the effects of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) remain debated. Our aim was to compare the procedural and 30-day outcomes of TAVI between patients with VSAS and patients with severe AS (SAS) and the changes in LVH. We selected patients with an aortic peak velocity ≥5 m/s (VSAS) and those with aortic peak velocity 4 to 5 m/s (SAS) treated with TAVI. Patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<45%) were excluded. The primary end point was the incidence of all-cause death at 30 days. The secondary end points included the 30-day incidence of cardiac death, cardiac rehospitalization, and stroke/transient ischemic attack and the changes in LVH from baseline to 30 days. A total of 102 patients in the VSAS group and 535 in the SAS group were included. Patients in the VSAS group had a thicker septal wall (p <0.001) and a higher Agaston score (p <0.001) and calcium volume (p = 0.007). No differences were observed regarding the primary and secondary clinical end points. However, patients with VSAS showed a significantly greater improvement in concentric LVH, although the prevalence of concentric LVH remained higher than in patients with SAS. TAVI in patients with VSAS showed similar procedural and clinical outcomes to patients with SAS and experienced a more pronounced improvement in the prevalence of concentric LVH.
