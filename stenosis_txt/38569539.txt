Title: Dumon silicone stents can improve respiratory function in dogs with grade IV tracheal collapse: 12 cases (2019-2023).

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, complications, and outcome of Dumon silicone stent placement for dogs with grade IV tracheal collapse.
ANIMALS: 12 client-owned dogs.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Each dog was diagnosed with grade IV TC unresponsive to medical therapy and had severe obstructive respiratory failure.
RESULTS: 12 dogs were included in the study. By the end of the study, 5 of 12 (41.7%) remained alive, while 7 of 12 (58.3%) dogs died. Survival times after stent placement ranged from 97 to 1,310 days (mean, 822.43 days; median, 810 days). Three of the 12 (25%) dogs died spontaneously, while 4 of 12 (33.3%) were euthanized. The cause of death was determined for 6 of 7 (85.7%) dogs and was TC related for 3 of 7 (50%). Causes of death related to TC were progressive airway collapse (2/3 [66.6%]) and incoercible cough (1/3 [33.4%]). Complications occurred in 9 of 12 (75%) cases and included granulation tissue growth (3/12 [25%]), incoercible cough (2/12 [16.7%]), stent migration (1/12 [8.3%]), and stent deformation (1/12 [8.3%]). Reduction of obstructive dyspnea and episodes of asphyxiation was achieved after Dumon silicone stent placement.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The placement of an intraluminal Dumon silicone stent was a successful salvage treatment for TC in dogs that did not respond to medical management. Disease progression is inevitable, but substantial improvement of respiratory function may be achieved for months to years.
