Title: Long-term outcomes of endoscopic balloon dilation for intestinal strictures in patients with Crohn's disease during maintenance treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Efficacy of endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) for intestinal strictures in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies (anti-TNF) as maintenance therapy is unclear. We investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of EBD for intestinal strictures in patients with CD receiving anti-TNF.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from patients with CD who received anti-TNF as maintenance therapy from 2008 to 2017, underwent EBD, and were followed up for ≥6 months. The primary endpoint was the cumulative surgery-free rate. The main secondary endpoints were technical success, repeat EBD rate, risk factors affecting surgical outcomes, and safety.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with CD were assessed. The median observation period after EBD was 50 months. The technical success rate was 67%. The 3- and 5-year cumulative surgery-free rates were 81.1% and 73.5%, respectively. The repeat EBD rate was 74%. Multivariable analyses showed that risk factors affecting surgical outcomes were age at disease onset ≤16 years (hazard ratio 3.69; 95% confidence interval 1.36-10.01; P = 0.011). Serious complications requiring surgery developed in three patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic balloon dilation was an effective and safe short-term treatment and a useful long-term treatment for CD patients with intestinal strictures receiving anti-TNF as maintenance therapy.
