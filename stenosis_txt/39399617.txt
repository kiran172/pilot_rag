Title: Association Between Lumbar Spine Disorder and Genovarum: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is becoming increasingly important to study pathology at the knee and spine because of their role in causing pain and deformity in one another. Compression of the lumbar nerve root can disrupt innervation to the thigh muscles, cause an imbalance of muscle and result in varus deformity. In this study, we try to figure out the relation between lumbar spine disorders and genu varum and realize if lumbar spine disorders can cause varus deformity in a patient.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the number of 53 patients with knee varus greater than 20 degrees who visited the orthopedic clinics of Rasoul Akram and Moheb Mehr hospitals affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences between 2020 and 2022 were investigated in terms of association with lumbar disorders. The demographic characteristics and clinical findings of the patients were recorded and collected using a checklist by referring to the patient's medical profiles. Radiographic findings were evaluated by referring to the imaging department and using the Pacs system. The diagnosis of the patients was based on the history and findings of the knee graph, which was measured with a goniometer to measure the knee angle. The frequency of lumbar disorders caused by pressure on the lumbar nerves in patients with genu varum deformity including canal stenosis, osteoarthritis, spondylolisthesis, and disc herniation was investigated. To investigate lumbar problems, patients' history and radiographic images as well as lumbosacral and knee MRI of patients were used.
RESULTS: The mean age was 66.3 Â± 7.66 years. 40 (75.5%) cases were female and 13 (24.5%) cases were male. Lumbar canal stenosis with 28(52.8%) and disc herniation with 32(60.4%) were the most common lumbar disorders in patients with knee varus more than 20 degrees. The mean age of patients with varus of more than 20 degrees with lumbar disorders was significantly higher than that of patients without lumbar disorders. (P: 0.001) There was no significant difference between gender distribution and lumbar disorders in patients with varus more than 20 degrees. Significant positive correlation between genu varum with lumbar canal stenosis (r: 0.53, P: 0.001), osteoarthritis (r: 0.38, P: 0.004), spondylolisthesis (r: 0.39, P: 0.002) and disc herniation (r: 0.46, P: 0.001) was reported2.
CONCLUSION: An association between lumbar disorders and varus more than 20 degrees was found to be considerable.
