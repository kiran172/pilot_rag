Title: Echocardiographic guided, transatrial closure of a patent foramen ovale.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The management of an incidental patent foramen ovale found during planned cardiac surgery remains a challenge, and current guidelines are not helpful. Although evidence is accumulating, that closure of an incidental found patent foramen ovale might be beneficial, especially in planned off-pump procedures, the diagnosis of a formerly unknown patent foramen ovale with the patient on the operation table has vast consequences by making it necessary to switch to on pump, bi-caval cannulation for patent foramen ovale closure. We therefore developed a technique for transatrial closure of a patent foramen ovale, guided by transesophageal echocardiography.
RESULTS: We have performed this surgery in 9 patients. None of them had a previously diagnosed patent foramen ovale. Mean age was 74 (±5) years, Operation time was 175 min (± 34 min), Clamp time 35 min (± 16 min) and Cardiopulmonary bypass time 80 (±17 min). Mortality was 0%. Periprocedural transesophageal echocardiography revealed closure of the patent foramen ovale in all cases.
CONCLUSION: We report a new surgical method for transoesophageal echocardiography controlled closure of a patent foramen ovale without the need for an atriotomy. This new technique is especially useful for the closure of patent foramen ovale in the setting of on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgeries alike.
