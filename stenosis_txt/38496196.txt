Title: Preoperative Evaluation for Carotid Endarterectomy Using CT and MRI Fusion Images Without Contrast Media.

Abstract: The usefulness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for carotid artery stenosis has been established even in the era of endovascular treatment. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA) are used for preoperative evaluation of CEA; however, contrast agents cannot be used in patients with renal dysfunction or contrast agent allergy. Since the introduction of a three-dimensional image analysis software, SYNAPSE VINCENT (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) in February 2016, we initially fused cervical CT, carotid three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography, and carotid plaque imaging using 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate carotid artery stenosis in patients with renal dysfunction. Since then, we have gradually accumulated several cases, and at present, this fusion imaging is our first choice for preoperative evaluation of CEA instead of DSA or 3D-CTA. This evaluation method has many advantages over DSA and 3D-CTA, including the fact that it does not require contrast media. We report its usefulness, limitations, and cautions.
