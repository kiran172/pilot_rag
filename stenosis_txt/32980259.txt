Title: Anatomical study of the human sacral hiatus and implications for successful caudal epidural injection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Caudal epidural injection (CEI) is a commonly used procedure to treat back and leg pain secondary to nerve root irritation, predominantly in the context of spinal canal stenosis. Key to a successful outcome is correct needle placement. Although fluoroscopic guidance confirms accurate needle placement, it does not help in determining the starting point, which can lead to multiple needle insertions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the variability in size and position of the sacral hiatus and to identify reproducible surface landmarks to locate its position.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: 250 human sacral bones were examined, measuring morphology and structure. Vernier callipers accurate to 0.1 mm were used for measurements. Results were analysed using SPSS statistical software.
RESULTS: Two specimens were excluded due to agenesis of the hiatus (0.8%). Of the remaining 248 specimens, it was found that the mean internal diameter of the sacral hiatus was 5.12 mm (SD 1.61). The position of the hiatus was variable but was most commonly found at the level of the fourth sacral vertebrae (62.9%, n = 156). Mean distance between the two superolateral sacral prominences was 64.15 mm (SD 6.5) and between superolateral sacral prominences (left and right) and apex of the hiatus were 63.21 mm (SD 10.9) and 63.34 mm (SD 10.87) respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although there is a clear anatomical variance in the position and size of the sacral hiatus, this study suggests that surface anatomy landmarks can be used to form an equilateral triangle of which the inferior apex should correspond to the sacral hiatus. Knowledge of this surface anatomy may assist the correct location of the sacral hiatus and hence subsequently improve the efficacy of CEI.
