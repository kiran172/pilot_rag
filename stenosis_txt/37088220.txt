Title: Spine or Hip First? Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Sequential Lumbar Spine or Hip Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lumbar spine pathology frequently coexists in patients who have hip arthrosis. There is controversy on whether lumbar or hip pathology should be first addressed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of sequential lumbar spine (LSP) or hip arthroplasty (THA).
METHODS: Using a large national database from 2010 to 2020, we reviewed the records of 241,279 patients who had concurrent hip arthritis and lumbar spine disease defined as spinal stenosis, lumbar radiculopathy, or degenerative disc disease. During the study period, 6,458 (2.7%) patients with concurrent hip/spine disease underwent sequential operative treatment of either the hip joint or lumbar spine within 2 years. The rates of subsequent surgery in either the hip or the spine, opioid requirements, and rates of hip dislocation were determined and analyzed using compared Chi-squared analyses.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing THA first had lower risk of subsequent spinal procedure compared to patients who had spinal procedures first (5.7 versus 23.7%, P < .001). This disparity was maintained up to 5 years (P < .001). Opioid requirements at 1 year were highest in patients who underwent spinal procedures only (836 pills/patient) compared to any other group THA only (566 pills/patient), LSP and then THA (564 pills/patient), THA and LSP (586 pills/patient). Also, THA following LSP was associated with significantly higher rates of dislocation compared to patients undergoing THA first (3.2 versus 1.9%, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Total hip arthroplasty first in patients who have concurrent spine disease was associated with lower risk of subsequent surgery, opioid requirement, and risk of postoperative instability compared to patients having lumbar procedure first.
