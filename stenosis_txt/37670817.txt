Title: Ectasia and slow flow phenomena of coronary artery related to apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Although the combination of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and slow flow coronary artery is a rare phenomenon, but a comprehensive evaluation of these patients is essential. Because timely diagnosis and treatment can prevent irreversible complications.
ABSTRACT: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-related coronary artery ectasia and slow flow phenomena is an extremely rare association that can cause manifestations of ischemic heart disease in patients. Distinguishing these cases and prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent possible complications. In this current case, a 72-year-old man complaining of typical exertional dyspnea for 6â€‰months was admitted to the hospital in December 2022. An echocardiogram was conducted and revealed apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A coronary angiogram showed ectasia and slow flow pattern in the coronary artery without significant stenosis. The patient was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with ectasia via electrocardiography, echocardiography, and coronary angiography. Medical treatment was started for the patient. The patient did not appear to suffer from dyspnea or other symptoms during the follow-up period.
