Title: Atrial myxoma and associated Cushing syndrome: Carney complex.

Abstract: A 33-year-old woman with a history of high blood pressure since she was 8 years old, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome, multiple nevi, and a maternal family history of death at age 50 due to malignant high blood pressure and heart failure. Cushing's syndrome secondary to a secretory pituitary microadenoma was diagnosed, being the cause of secondary arterial hypertension, and ruling out other causes such as renal stenosis and coarctation of the aorta. A transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which detected a left atrial myxoma. Given the presence of an atrial myxoma, Cushing's syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome, a diagnosis of Carney Complex was made due to the presence of positive Stratakis criteria. The cardiac tumor was resected, and pathology confirmed that it was an atrial myxoma. She evolved clinically stable in outpatient controls in a 6-month follow-up. Resection of the pituitary microadenoma is planned as a curative treatment for Cushing's syndrome and arterial hypertension.
