Title: Median arcuate ligament syndrome: a rare cause of abdominal pain.

Abstract: MALS, also called celiac artery compression syndrome, celiac axis syndrome, or Dunbar syndrome, is a rare entity caused by progressive stenosis of the celiac trunk secondary to extrinsic compression of the fibers of the median arcuate ligament. The prevalence is unknown, but it is estimated that it is a casual finding in up to a third of autopsies2,3, being more prevalent in women between 30 and 50 years of age4. Symptoms and signs include postprandial abdominal pain, exercise-induced pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss3. However, most cases are asymptomatic. The case that we present was a 56-year-old man, with a history of dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic ischemic heart disease. He was a former smoker. He reported a history of recurrent abdominal pain, especially postprandial.
