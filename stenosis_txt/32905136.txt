Title: [Operate, cancel, postpone or select?].

Abstract: Regional centers performing vascular surgery in Austria (n = 15) were invited in mid-April 2020 by the Austrian Society of Vascular Surgery (ÖGG) to participate in a nationwide survey about implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, a total of 12 centers (80%) answered the questionnaire.All centers were confronted with patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and 75% also had medical personnel who were positive. In contrast, only 25% of the departments of vascular surgery had positively tested patients and 33% had positive staff members. In all departments of vascular surgery elective vascular procedures were either stopped (cancelled or deferred) or selectively limited, including patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, aortic aneurysms smaller than 7 cm, peripheral arterial aneurysm, peripheral artery occlusive disease Fontaine stage II and varicosities. All centers continued to carry out operations for all types of vascular surgical emergencies. The strategies of the centers were heterogeneous for patients with chronic ulcers, chronic mesenteric insufficiency, asymptomatic aortic aneurysms larger than 7 cm and shunt surgery.Decisions on surgery cancellation seemed to be particularly problematic due to the uncertain time period of the COVID-19 measures. As a consequence, the risk associated with cancellation or delayed treatment was difficult to assess. At present, especially indications with nonuniform management strategies need selective attention and additional analysis in single center and multicenter studies. In addition, patients might suffer from relevant psychological problems because of surgery cancellations. Changes in the daily routine due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a long-term impact on health status and may show significant demographic and geographic variations.
