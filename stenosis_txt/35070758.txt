Title: Carinal resection and reconstruction with complete pulmonary parenchyma preservation: a single-institution analysis of 36 cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carinal resection, performed in only a few high-volume centers, remains one of the most complicated and technically demanding surgeries. Few studies have examined the outcomes of carinal resection and reconstruction with complete pulmonary parenchyma preservation.
METHODS: Patients who underwent isolated carinal resection and reconstruction at the Shanghai Chest Hospital between 2006 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathological, perioperative, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were included, including 19 men and 17 women. The average age was 50.7Â±14.8 years. Right posterolateral thoracotomy (n=33, 91.7%) and cross-field intubation during anastomosis (n=31, 86.1%) were selected for the majority of the carinal surgeries. The average intraoperative blood loss was 225.0 mL, and the mean operation duration was 196.1 minutes. Postoperative complications were observed in 14 patients (38.9%), including cicatricial stenosis (n=8, 22.2%), anastomotic fistula (n=3, 8.3%), air leak (n=1, 2.8%), cardiac arrhythmia (n=4, 11.1%), pneumonia (n=2, 5.6%), respiratory failure (n=1, 2.8%), and pulmonary embolism (n=1, 2.8%). There were 2 perioperative deaths (5.6%). Multivariate analysis revealed that being overweight was an independent favorable factor for postoperative complications [P=0.042, odds ratio (OR) =0.092, 95%, confidence interval (CI): 0.009-0.922]. Pathological diagnoses included squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n=12, 33.3%), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) (n=15, 41.7%), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) (n=2, 5.6%), stricture (n=1, 2.8%), and other rare histological types. An R0 resection was achieved in 14 patients, while 21 patients (60.0%) had microscopically positive margins. Lymph node metastasis was confirmed in 6 patients (17.1%). Overall survival (OS) was 94.4% at 1 year and 79.4% at 5 years, with 107 months as the median survival time (95% CI: 64.0-150.0 months). All patients with negative margins remained alive during the follow-up period, while those who received R1 resections had much poorer survival rates due to tumor recurrence [P=0.042, hazard ratio (HR) =4.938, 95% CI: 1.062-22.950].
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients, carinal resection and reconstruction with complete pulmonary parenchyma preservation was a feasible option to achieve an appreciable long-term survival at the risk of acceptable operative mortality and morbidity, particularly when complete resection with negative margins could be realized.
