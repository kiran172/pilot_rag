Title: The Usefulness of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing to Detect Functional Improvement after Transcatheter Valve Procedures: What Do We Know So Far?

Abstract: Transcatheter valve procedures have become a cornerstone in the management of patients with valvular heart disease and high surgical risk, especially for aortic stenosis and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is generally considered the gold standard for objectively quantifying functional capacity, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the human body's performance, particularly in patients with heart failure (HF). Its accurate assessment is valuable for exploring the pathogenetic mechanisms implicated in HF-related functional impairment. It is also useful for objectively staging the clinical severity and the prognosis of the disease. The improvement in functional capacity after transcatheter valve procedures may be clinically relevant and may provide prognostic information, even in this setting. However, it remains to be fully determined as data on the topic are limited. This review aims to summarize the available evidence on the usefulness of CPET to assess functional improvement in patients undergoing transcatheter valve procedures.
