Title: FACTFINDERS for PATIENT SAFETY: Preventing procedure-related complications: Epidural lipomatosis and postpartum steroid exposure.

Abstract: This series of FactFinders presents a brief summary of the evidence and outlines recommendations to improve our understanding and management of potential procedure-related complications. Evidence in support of the following facts is presented. (1) Epidural Steroid injections for Radicular Pain Due to Spinal Stenosis Caused by Lipomatosis -- There is low-level evidence of an association between epidural steroid injections (ESIs) and the development and/or worsening of spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL). However, there is insufficient evidence to establish whether ESIs independently result in an increase in spinal stenosis with neurological compromise in individuals with pre-existing SEL. (2) Steroid Exposure Postpartum -- There is no absolute contraindication to steroid injections based on postpartum or lactating status, but there may be disruption of both maternal and breastfed child hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to steroid administration. For the duration of breastfeeding, milk production may be affected after steroid exposure, and withholding breast milk produced for several hours after exposure minimizes infant exposure.
