Title: Restenosis of Bilateral Aorta-Renal Saphenous Vein Grafts after the Surgical Repair of Takayasu Arteritis-induced Bilateral Renal Arteries Stenosis: Case Report.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a nonspecific and chronic inflammatory vasculitis that mainly affects the aorta and its main branches, resulting in stenosis or occlusion of the aorta or its main branches with related symptoms. Up to 60% of TA patients have renal artery involvement, which often lead to refractory hypertension and impaired renal function. Surgical repair and endovascular intervention are commonly employed in clinical practice. Surgical bypass with prosthetic or autologous vein graft is preferred for complicated lesions not suitable for endovascular intervention or patients who are allergic to contrast. Restenosis of bypass graft is one of the complications that vascular surgeons need to fix. Restenosis of graft is consistently eliminated by angioplasty based on the current studies. Limited literature reported surgical repair of restenosis of bypass graft. We report a patient with TA-induced bilateral renal arteries stenosis who underwent aorta-renal artery bypass and suffered from restenosis of bilateral grafts in a short period. Twice surgical bypass with saphenous vein graft for the initial treatment and with prosthetic graft for the second restenosis elimination was performed. The details of procedures, choice of graft, and analysis of restenosis will be discussed.
