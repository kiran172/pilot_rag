Title: Left ventricular end-systolic volume response post-stress echocardiography: Dilation as a marker of multi-vessel coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transient ischemic dilation of the left ventricle (LV) during stress echocardiography indicates extensive myocardial ischemia. It remains unclear whether the change of LV end-systolic volume (ESV) or end-diastolic volume (EDV) better correlated with significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Meanwhile, the clinical significance of the extent of the volumetric change post-stress has not been investigated.
METHODS: One hundred and five individuals (62 ± 12 years and 75% men) who underwent coronary angiography following exercise treadmill echocardiography were enrolled retrospectively. An additional 30 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were included for comparison. LV dilation was defined as any increase in LV volume from rest to peak exercise. Patients who had at least two coronary arteries with significant stenosis were considered as having multi-vessel CAD.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients had ESV dilation during exercise echocardiography. On the contrary, ESV decreased at peak exercise in all healthy subjects. Forty-one patients had multi-vessel CAD, and its prevalence was higher in patients with ESV dilation (65% vs 27%, p = 0.001). The extent of ESV increase correlated with CAD severity. ESV dilation is associated with multi-vessel CAD (Odds ratio [OR] 5.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.09 - 12.07, p < 0.001). After adjustment for EDV increase, clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic variables, the association remained significant (adjusted OR 5.57, 95% CI 1.37-22.64; p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: ESV dilation independently correlated with multi-vessel CAD, whereas EDV dilation did not. The amount of ESV increase correlated with the severity of CAD. Our findings provide a rationale for incorporating volume measurements into stress echocardiography practice.
