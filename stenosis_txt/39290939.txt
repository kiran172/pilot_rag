Title: Retrograde Arterial Flow Secondary to Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome as a Contraindication to Gastroduodenal Artery Angioembolization.

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare condition in which the median arcuate ligament (MAL) exerts external compression on the celiac trunk. Most cases are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on radiographic imaging; however, some patients may experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms related to foregut ischemia and/or celiac neuropathy. In the following case, we present a patient with hemorrhagic peptic ulcer disease of the duodenum, which resulted in episodes of hemodynamic instability requiring multiple blood transfusions. Upon attempted transarterial angioembolization of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA), celiac stenosis and retrograde arterial flow from the superior mesenteric artery confirmed the presence of MALS. This rendered GDA angioembolization a contraindication, as the GDA became the dominant arterial supply for the distal celiac organs. The patient then received open surgical MAL release with concurrent surgical ligation of the hemorrhaging duodenal artery, which resolved his symptoms without the need for further intervention.
