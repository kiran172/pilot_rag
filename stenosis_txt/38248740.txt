Title: Incidence of Tracheal Stenosis in ICU Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: Results from a Prospective, Observational, Multicenter Study.

Abstract: Background: Tracheal stenosis represents a fearsome complication that substantially impairs quality of life. The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic increased the number of patients requiring invasive ventilation through prolonged intubation or tracheostomy, increasing the risk of tracheal stenosis. Study design and methods: In this prospective, observational, multicenter study performed in Lombardy (Italy), we have exanimated 281 patients who underwent prolonged intubation (more than 7 days) or tracheostomy for severe COVID-19. Patients underwent CT scan and spirometry 2 months after hospital discharge and a subsequent clinical follow-up after an additional 6 months (overall 8 months of follow-up duration) to detect any tracheal lumen reduction above 1%. The last follow-up evaluation was completed on 31 August 2022. Results: In the study period, 24 patients (8.5%, CI 5.6-12.4) developed tracheal stenosis in a median time of 112 days and within a period of 200 days from intubation. Compared to patients without tracheal stenosis, tracheostomy was performed more frequently in patients that developed stenosis (75% vs 54%, p = 0.034). Tracheostomy and alcohol consumption (1 unit of alcohol per day) increased risk of developing tracheal stenosis of 2.6-fold (p = 0.047; IC 0.99-6.8) and 5.4-fold (p = 0.002; CI 1.9-16), respectively. Conclusions: In a large cohort of patients, the incidence of tracheal stenosis increased during pandemic, probably related to the increased use of prolonged intubation. Patients with histories of prolonged intubation should be monitored for at least 200 days from invasive ventilation in order to detect tracheal stenosis at early stage. Alcohol use and tracheostomy are risk factors for developing tracheal stenosis.
