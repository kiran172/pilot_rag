Title: Barbed suture in gastro-intestinal surgery: A review with a meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The laparoscopic approach is a very popular technique for many gastrointestinal operations and barbed sutures may improve the difficulties of intracorporeal anastomosis by eliminating the need for knot tying. The aim of this systematic review with a meta-analysis is to explore literature to establish the security profile of barbed suture compared with conventional laparoscopic sutures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in all electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE) and 12 studies were included in the analysis, involving 27,133 patients, whereof 3372 cases (patients undergone barbed suture usage) and 23,761 controls (patients undergone conventional suture usage). We found 3 studies discussing differences between barbed and conventional sutures in colorectal surgery and 8 studies presenting results in bariatric surgery, both in Roux-en-y gastric bypass and Mini Gastric/One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass.
RESULTS: We found comparable rate of leaks, bleedings and stenosis. The meta-regression analysis demonstrated that, both in case of bariatric and colorectal surgery, the demographic characteristic of patients and the oncological features of neoplasms did not impact of these findings. As expected, operative time is significantly shorter when barbed suture is used.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis on current literature define an acceptable security profile for barbed suture with effective results particularly in terms of shorter operative time.
