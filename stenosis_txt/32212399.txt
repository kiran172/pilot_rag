Title: Right ventricle assessment in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Limited data are available regarding the evaluation of right ventricular (RV) performance in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of RV dysfunction in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI and long-term changes.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI from January 2016 to July 2017 were included. RV anatomical and functional parameters were analyzed: RV diameters, fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), S-wave tissue Doppler of the tricuspid annulus (RV-S'TDI), global longitudinal strain (RV-GLS), and free wall strain (RV-FWS). Preprocedure and 1-year echo were analyzed.
RESULTS: Final population included 114 patients, mean age 83.63 ± 6.31 years, and 38.2% women. The prevalence of abnormal RV function was high, variable depending on the parameter that we analyzed, and it showed a significant reduction 1 year after TAVI implantation: 13.9% vs 6.8% (TAPSE < 17mm), P = .04; 26.3% vs 20% (fractional area change < 35%), P = .048; 41.2% vs 29.2% (RV-S'TDI < 9.5cm/s), P = .04; 48.7% vs 39.5% (RV-GLS > [20]), P = .049; and 48.7% vs 28.9% (RV-FWS > [20]), P = .03. Significant differences were noted between patients with low-flow (LF) vs normal-flow (NF) AS in RV dysfunction prevalence as well as in RV function recovery which is less evident in LF compared with NF patients.
CONCLUSIONS: RV dysfunction is high among symptomatic AS patients undergoing TAVI, with variable prevalence depending on the echocardiographic parameter used.
