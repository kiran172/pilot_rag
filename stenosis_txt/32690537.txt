Title: Cohort profile: BIOVASC-late, a prospective multicentred study of imaging and blood biomarkers of carotid plaque inflammation and risk of late vascular recurrence after non-severe stroke in Ireland.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Inflammation is important in stroke. Anti-inflammatory therapy reduces vascular events in coronary patients. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) identifies plaque inflammation-related metabolism. However, long-term prospective cohort studies investigating the association between carotid plaque inflammation, identified on 18F-FDG PET and the risk of recurrent vascular events, have not yet been undertaken in patients with stroke.
PARTICIPANTS: The Biomarkers Imaging Vulnerable Atherosclerosis in Symptomatic Carotid disease (BIOVASC) study and Dublin Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (DUCASS) are two prospective multicentred observational cohort studies, employing near-identical methodologies, which recruited 285 patients between 2008 and 2016 with non-severe stroke/transient ischaemic attack and ipsilateral carotid stenosis (50%-99%). Patients underwent coregistered carotid 18F-FDG PET/CT angiography and phlebotomy for measurement of inflammatory cytokines. Plaque 18F-FDG-uptake is expressed as maximum standardised uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) and tissue-to-background ratio. The BIOVASC-Late study is a follow-up study (median 7 years) of patients recruited to the DUCASS/BIOVASC cohorts.
FINDINGS TO DATE: We have reported that 18F-FDG-uptake in atherosclerotic plaques of patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis predicts early recurrent stroke, independent of luminal narrowing. The incorporation of 18F-FDG plaque uptake into a clinical prediction model also improves discrimination of early recurrent stroke, when compared with risk stratification by luminal stenosis alone. However, the relationship between 18F-FDG-uptake and late vascular events has not been investigated to date.
FUTURE PLANS: The primary aim of BIOVASC-Late is to investigate the association between SUV<sub>max</sub> in symptomatic 'culprit' carotid plaque (as a marker of systemic inflammatory atherosclerosis) and the composite outcome of any late major vascular event (recurrent ischaemic stroke, coronary event or vascular death). Secondary aims are to investigate associations between: (1) SUV<sub>max</sub> in symptomatic plaque, and individual vascular endpoints (2) SUV<sub>max</sub> in asymptomatic contralateral carotid plaque and SUV<sub>max</sub> in ipsilateral symptomatic plaque (3) SUV<sub>max</sub> in asymptomatic carotid plaque and major vascular events (4) inflammatory cytokines and vascular events.
