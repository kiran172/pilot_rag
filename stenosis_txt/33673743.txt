Title: Use of a VBX balloon expandable stent-graft for management of right brachiocephalic vein stenosis.

Abstract: Here we describe the use of a VBX balloon expandable stent-graft (WL Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) to treat a right brachiocephalic vein stenosis in a haemodialysis patient prior to ipsilateral upper limb arterio-venous (AV) fistula formation. Balloon expandable stent-grafts are unsuitable for treating peripheral fistula stenoses due to their susceptibility of being crushed. The right brachiocephalic vein is both relatively short in comparison to the left and is less susceptible to extrinsic compression and the use of such a device to treat stenosis here allows for very accurate placement and restoration of luminal diameter. The advantages and disadvantages of using these devices in haemodialysis access circuits are also discussed herein, in what we believe to be the first report of the application of a dedicated commercially available balloon expandable stent graft in a haemodialysis patient.
