Title: [Current status and progress of percutaneous spinal endoscopy in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis].

Abstract: Percutaneous endoscopic spine decompression(PSED) in recent years in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis(DLSS) achieved excellent results.Compared with traditional open surgery, which is characterized by large trauma, much bleeding, longer bed stay and slow recovery, the rapid development of PSED technology has greatly reduced the surgical trauma, postoperative recovery time and complications of DLSS patients. PSED core as the target therapy, with minimal trauma at the same time to achieve satisfactory decompression effect for lumbar spinal stenosis. Depending on the level, location, and degree of lumbar spinal stenosis, it is important to determine the ideal treatment. However, in practice, PSED has insufficient understanding of the treatment of different pathological types of lumbar spinal stenosis, such as indication selection, surgical approach selection, advantages and limitations of various approaches, and endoscopic vertebral fusion.At present, with the deepening of PSED research and the improvement of endoscopic instruments, great progress has been made in the treatment of DLSS.In this paper, the research progress in the treatment of DLSS by PSED in recent years will be described from four aspects, namely, the grasp of indications, the selection of approaches, the advantages and disadvantages of endoscopic approaches, and endoscope-assisted vertebral fusion, in order to provide certain guidance for the clinical treatment of DLSS by PSED.
