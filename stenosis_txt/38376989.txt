Title: Assessment of suitability for percutaneous mitral commissurotomy: a contemporary review of key anatomical criteria and predictive models.

Abstract: The immediate result of percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy is largely determined by the anatomy of the mitral valve complex. Several scores and models have been developed to assess anatomical suitability for percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy. Although none has an optimal predictive power, these models look at the valvular apparatus from different perspectives bearing the potential for a complementary role.
