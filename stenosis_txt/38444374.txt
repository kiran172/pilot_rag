Title: Lipoaspirate Injection in Relapsing Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis: Preliminary Results.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The management of idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) poses a clinical challenge due to high recurrence rates following both endoscopic and open approaches, often leading to tracheostomy. The activation of abnormal T-cells and cytokine pathways has been linked to iSGS pathogenesis. Autologous adipose tissue centrifugation yields lipoaspirate, offering optimal anti-inflammatory effects and biocompatibility widely utilized in various medical settings. This report presents the first 3 cases employing endoscopic dilation (ED) in combination with local lipoaspirate injection to address recurrent iSGS.
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted, involving multidisciplinary evaluation by the Tracheal Team at the University of Modena. Patients meeting specific criteria were directed to undergo ED + lipoaspirate injection.
RESULTS: Three patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean number of prior endoscopic procedures performed was 8. Endoscopic examination revealed 90% stenosis in patient A, 60% stenosis in patient B, and 60% stenosis in patient C. All patients presented inflammatory tissue or incipient granulations at the stenotic site, with an average time of 6 months between previous procedures. After 15 months, none of the patients required further procedures, and endoscopic examination revealed a significant reduction or disappearance of inflammatory tissue with a stable airway lumen.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed results are encouraging in terms of reducing local inflammation and halting stenosis progression, especially in cases of short-term relapsing iSGS.
