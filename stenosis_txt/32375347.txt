Title: Possible Roles of Periostin in the Formation of Hemodialysis Vascular Access Stenosis after Polytetrafluoroethylene Graft Implantation in Dogs.

Abstract: Periostin, a recently found matricellular protein, has been implicated in neointima formation after balloon injury. However, the relationship between periostin and hyperplastic intima formation after PTFE graft implantation is unclear. Under mixed anesthesia, PTFE grafts were implanted between the canine carotid artery and jugular vein, and PTFE graft samples were harvested 1, 2, and 4 months after implantation. Intima formation started on the luminal surface of PTFE grafts at the venous anastomotic region 1 month after implantation. Thereafter, the increase in intimal volume was not only observed in the venous and arterial anastomotic regions, but also in the middle region of the PTFE grafts. In accordance with the increased intimal formation, time-dependent increases in mRNA expressions of periostin and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), as well as a strong positive correlation between periostin and TGF-β1, were observed. These findings suggest that periostin may play a very important role in the pathogenesis of hemodialysis vascular access stenosis through the acceleration of intimal formation. Thus, periostin may be a very important therapeutic target for the treatment of vascular access graft dysfunction in hemodialysis patients.
