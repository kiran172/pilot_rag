Title: Carotid Artery Stenting by Direct Punctures of Cervical Carotid Artery Stenoses Using an Exoscope in a Hybrid Operating Room: A Technical Report.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been established as an effective surgical treatment for internalÂ carotid artery stenosis and/or common carotid artery stenosis (ICAS/CCAS). Typically, CAS is performed via a transfemoral, transbrachial, or transradial approach. However, direct puncture CAS (DP-CAS) is preferred in cases where conventional access routes are challenging, such as in the presence of cervical vascular tortuosity or thoracic aortic aneurysm. Since 2020, our institution has selectively adopted DP-CAS, utilizing 3D exoscopy through the ZEISS KINEVO 900 microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) or the ORBEYE exoscope (Sony Olympus Medical Solutions Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for carotid artery surgical exposure and puncture under high magnification in a hybrid operating room. In the hybrid operating room, exoscopic and angiographic fluoroscopic monitors were positioned side by side, enabling the surgeon to simultaneously visualize both during the puncture procedure. In cases utilizing the ORBEYE exoscope, its compact design minimized interference with the fluoroscopic arm, thereby facilitating improved working angles during CAS. This technical report reveals the current status of DP-CAS at our institution and focuses on the effectiveness of DP-CAS using an exoscope based on our clinical experience.
