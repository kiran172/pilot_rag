Title: Anesthetic management of pulmonary artery banding in adult patient with single ventricle and uncorrected transposition of the great arteries.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery banding (PAB) is a procedure mainly performed during the neonatal period as an initial stage to definitive palliative reconstruction, a scenario in which the criteria for banding adjustment are well defined. However, the indication for BAP in the adult is extraordinarily rare, even more in patients with single ventricle and unrepaired transposition of the great arteries (TGA), and there are no established criteria for banding adjustment. Due to the small number of these procedures, there is limited experience in their anesthetic management and complications. We describe a case of a 29-year-old patient diagnosed with a cyanotic congenital heart disease of double-inlet left ventricle with TGA and unrepaired mitral stenosis, who underwent to a hybrid procedure of PAB and enlargement of the communication between the two atria.
