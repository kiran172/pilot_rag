Title: The relationship between neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and cerebral collateral circulation in patients with symptomatic severe intracranial artery stenosis or occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been considered a prognostic indicator for determining the systemic inflammatory response and atherosclerosis. We aimed to determine the relationship between NLR and the development of cerebral collateral circulation in patients with symptomatic severe stenosis or occlusion of intracranial arteries.
METHODS: All patients underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within 14 days of admission and were divided into a group with good collateral circulation (77 patients) and a group with poor collateral circulation (86 patients) according to the DSA collateral compensation grading method. Apo B, total cholesterol, LDL, and Neutrophil count in the poor side branch group were significantly higher than in the good side branch group. Multifactorial analysis showed that high NLR levels were a valid predictor of poor collateral circulation in patients with symptomatic severe intracranial artery stenosis or occlusion. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the size of the collateral branch score was negatively correlated with NLR (r = -0.509, P < 0.001) and cholesterol content (r = -0.249, P = 0.002). NLR predicted poor collateral circulation with an AUC of 0.620 (sensitivity 66.7 %, specificity 61.3 %, 95 % CI = 0.517-0.723,P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a correlation between NLR levels and the development of collateral circulation in the brain in patients with symptomatic severe stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial arteries.
