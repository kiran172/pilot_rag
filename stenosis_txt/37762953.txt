Title: Retinal Microvascular Changes in Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Purpose: We aimed to analyze retinal microvascular parameters, measured by optical coherence tomography angiography in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis compared to healthy individuals. Materials and Methods: A total of 41 eyes from 30 patients who had varying degrees of carotid stenosis, and 42 eyes from 42 healthy controls, were enrolled in this study. Depending on the degree of stenosis evaluated by Doppler ultrasonographic imaging, the patient group was further subclassified into mild, moderate, and severe carotid artery stenosis. Superficial and deep capillary plexus vessel densities, radial peripapillary capillary vessel density, foveal avascular zone, and flow densities in the choriocapillaris and outer retina were evaluated by optical coherence tomography angiography. Results: The superficial and deep capillary plexus vessel densities were significantly reduced among the groups, only sparing the foveal region. The mean superficial plexus vessel density was 45.67 ± 4.65 and 50.09 ± 4.05 for the patient and control group, respectively (p = 0.000). The mean deep capillary plexus density was 46.33% ± 7.31% and 53.27% ± 6.31% for the patient and control group, respectively (p = 0.000). The mean superficial and deep capillary vessel densities in the foveal region did not show any statistical difference between the patient and control groups (p = 0.333 for the superficial and p = 0.195 for the deep plexus vessel density). Radial peripapillary capillary vessel density was decreased in the patient group (p = 0.004). The foveal avascular zone area was wider in the patient group but this difference did not show a significant difference (p = 0.385). Conclusions: Retinal microvascular changes are a prominent outcome of internal carotid disease, and even mild stenosis can lead to alterations in the retinal microvascular bed which could be detected by OCTA. By early detection of microvascular changes in the retina in this patient group, we might speculate the overall vascular condition.
