Title: Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries.

Abstract: Major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) are congenital vessels that arise from the aorta or its first-order branches and are distally connected to the pulmonary arterial vasculature, thereby providing pulmonary blood flow. MAPCAs are commonly associated with several congenital heart diseases that have compromised pulmonary circulation due to severe stenosis involving pulmonary valves or arteries or due to pulmonary atresia. Embryologically, MAPCAs are presumed to be persistent segmental arteries. MAPCAs can be imaged with CT and MRI, and such imaging findings are important for surgeons and interventionists. The management options for MAPCAs include unifocalization, surgical ligation, and endovascular interventions, such as coil embolization. This review highlights the role of reporting certain critical features of MAPCAs at CT and MRI, which will help to facilitate management decisions for systemic-to-pulmonary collateral vessels observed in patients with congenital heart disease.
