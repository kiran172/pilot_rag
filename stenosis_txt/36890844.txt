Title: MINOCA mimic: Type 2 myocardial infarction due to severe aortic stenosis complicated by cardiogenic shock.

Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction without significant obstructive coronary disease presents a challenging clinical entity that requires timely intervention. The term myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) describes a working diagnosis attributed to varying etiologies in patients with a presumed ischemic cardiac condition. Several overlapping etiologies can be classified as type 2 myocardial infarction (MI). The 2019 AHA statement established diagnostic criteria and clarified the associated confusion, aiding in appropriate diagnosis. In this report, we present a case of demand-ischemia MINOCA and cardiogenic shock in a patient with severe aortic stenosis (AS).
