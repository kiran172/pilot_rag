Title: Endovascular eSheath Predilation to Facilitate Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Delivery.

Abstract: Iliofemoral anatomy plays an important role in determining transfemoral (TF) transcatheter aortic valve replacement candidacy. Herein, we present the novelty of endovascular eSheath balloon dilation to facilitate valve delivery. This technique, in addition to or instead of intravascular lithotripsy, may facilitate TF valve delivery in patients who do not otherwise meet traditional criteria for TF access.
