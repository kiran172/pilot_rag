Title: The Association of In-Hospital Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Availability on Outcomes of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Elderly Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been performed more and more frequently in elderly patients with aortic stenosis. We investigated the association of in-hospital availability of TAVR on outcomes of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in the era of TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We utilized data from the Japan Adult Cardiovascular Surgery Database. Between October 2013 and December 2016, 9,330 patients aged ≥80 years underwent isolated SAVR or SAVR with coronary artery bypass grafting in 557 centers in Japan. We assessed the associations of in-hospital TAVR availability with operative mortality and composite complications adjusting for each patient's characteristics, JapanSCORE predicted the risk scores, and hospital volumes of SAVR using generalized estimation equation methods. Observed operative mortality rates were 3.4% in all centers, 2.0% in TAVR centers and 4.0% in non-TAVR centers. The multivariable analyses showed that TAVR centers had statistically significantly lower operative mortality compared with non-TAVR centers among all patients (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.89, P=0.01) and among intermediate/high-risk patients (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.32-0.85, P<0.01) but not among low-risk patients (odds ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.44-1.51, P=0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital TAVR availability was associated with better outcomes of SAVR among elderly patients. This association was statistically significant among intermediate/high-risk patients but not significant among low-risk patients.
