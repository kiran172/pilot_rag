Title: [Coronary CT angiography derived fractional flow reserve: the consideration and practice of functional evaluation for cerebral arterial diseases].

Abstract: Cerebrovascular disease is a significant global public health concern, despite the diagnosis and treatment of stroke has made great progress in recent years, however, its mainly guided by anatomical indicators, which still needs to be further improved, and there is an urgent need to explore a more accurate and comprehensive functional imaging assessment method. Rapid development of coronary CT angiography derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) has become an important technique for noninvasive evaluation of coronary artery disease, and these successful application experiences inspiried neurologists to explore the functional evaluation technique of cerebral arteries and demonstrated broad application prospects. In this paper, by analyzing and comparing the coronary CT-FFR technology, the progress, existing problems and possible solutions of the functional evaluation for cerebral arterial stenosis are discussed from the aspects of coronary CT-FFR study, cerebral artery functional evaluation study, and the comparison and consideration of cerebral arterial and coronary CT-FFR.
