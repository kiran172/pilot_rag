Title: Skull Base Neurointerventional Techniques.

Abstract: Neurodiagnostic and neurointerventional radiology (NIR) play a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of skull base disorders. Noninvasive imaging modalities, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are important in lesion localization, evaluation of lesion extent, and diagnosis, but cannot always be definitive. Image-guided skull base biopsy and percutaneous and endovascular treatment options are important tools in the diagnosis and treatment of head, neck, and skull base disorders. NIR plays an important role in the treatment of vascular disorders of the skull base. This article summarizes the imaging evaluation and interventional therapies pertinent to the skull base.
