Title: Transradial Renal Angioplasty and Stent Placement for Systemic Hypertension Caused by Severe Unilateral Renovascular Stenosis.

Abstract: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement for renovascular hypertension is a recognized albeit seldom used therapy. We present a case of severe renovascular hypertension, due to renal artery atherosclerosis, treated successfully with stent placement via the radial artery access approach.
