Title: Robotic Aortic Valve Replacement versus Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Propensity Matched Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports equipoise between surgical valve replacement and TAVR for the management of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS). For patients of lower risk, controversy exists regarding the optimal interventional management. Minimally invasive robotic aortic valve replacement (RAVR) was developed as a potential option.
METHODS: A total of 605 consecutive patients (2017-2023) managed by the identical structural heart team, 174 RAVR and 431 TAVR, were propensity matched and evaluated for in-hospital and one-year outcomes.
RESULTS: There were 288 low-intermediate risk (STS PROM <8%) patients matched in two well-balanced groups (144 RAVR vs 144 TAVR). In-hospital and 30-day mortality were similar. There were two conversions to sternotomy in the TAVR group (cardiac arrest and coronary occlusion), and none in the RAVR group. Eight RAVR patients (5.6%) required re-operation for hemothorax evacuation. TAVR was associated with higher new pacemaker (11 vs 3, p=0.028) and major vascular complications (13 vs 0, p<0.0001), and higher post-procedural stroke trend (6 vs 1, p=0.056). There was no difference in 30-day transfusions or atrial fibrillation, or 1-year mean valve gradients. However, 1-year mortality (12.5% vs 1.4%, p<0.0001) and paravalvular leak (PVL) greater than mild (32.6% vs 2.3%, p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight lower pacemaker and vascular complications, as well as less one-year PVL and mortality with RAVR compared to TAVR. RAVR may provide a safe and effective minimally invasive alternative to TAVR for low-intermediate risk patients presenting with severe symptomatic AS.
