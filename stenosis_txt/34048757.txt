Title: Novel Designed V-shaped Silicone Stent for the Treatment of Unilateral Main Bronchial Stenosis.

Abstract: Benign main bronchial stenosis may cause a potentially life-threatening condition. Airway silicone stenting is an important option of bronchoscopic treatments for patients with main bronchial stenosis. However stent migration is 1 of the most frequent complications and requires repeated bronchoscopic interventions. To resolve this issue we therefore describe here a novel designed V-shaped silicone stent for the treatment of unilateral main bronchial stenosis. This method may be widely applied to clinical practice to prevent stent migration.
