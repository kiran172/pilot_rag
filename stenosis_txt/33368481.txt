Title: MAGPI under local anaesthesia without catheter as an alternative to standard TIP procedure in distal hypospadias repair.

Abstract: To evaluate the surgical outcomes of meatal advancement and glanuloplasty incorporation (MAGPI) and tubularised incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty. We retrospectively reviewed the patient records who had hypospadias repairing surgery between March 2017 and March 2020 in terms of age, meatal position, operative and anaesthesia techniques and surgical outcomes. Hypospadias repair was performed in 85 patients. TIP urethroplasty was performed in 17 patients where MAGPI was performed in 63 patients. Preoperative meatal stenosis was present in 10. Coronal glanular and subcoronal hypospadias were present in 65 and 15 patients respectively. Mean operative time was 41.3 ± 28 min. The mean duration of the catheter was 7.56 days. A significant chordee was present in 35 patients where 45 patients had no chordee. The overall success rate was 93.75%. MAGPI ended up with an unfavourable result in 1 and TIP urethroplasty in 4. Postoperative urethral stenosis was seen in 1. Of those who ended up with an unfavourable result, 4 were with subglandular hypospadias. Urethral catheter required in 4 of those who failed, whereas 1 had no catheter following surgery. Therefore, MAGPI is a useful method in selected glandular and subglandular hypospadias repair with favourable surgical outcomes including no stent requirement.
