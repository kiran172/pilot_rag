Title: Combined pulmonary vein stenosis stenting and left atrial appendage occlusion in a patient with hemoptysis after atrial fibrillation ablation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) after radiofrequency ablation for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is an uncommon but serious complication. PVS stenting can rapidly restore pulmonary flow and improve symptoms with long-term low incidence of restenosis. However, high risk of thrombosis remains if AF is recurrent, especially for CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc &gt;â€‰2.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension and a history of stroke underwent radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation for persistent AF 1 year ago. Six months later he developed recurrent respiratory infection and massive hemoptysis. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography revealed severe left pulmonary vein stenosis. Simultaneous percutaneous PVS stenting and left atrial appendage occlusion were performed to resolve recurrent hemoptysis and prevent stroke. The clinical follow-up indicated a good short and mid-term result with significant improvement of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous PVS stenting and left atrial appendage occlusion is feasible and effective in patients with recurrence of AF and hemoptysis induced by radiofrequency ablation for AF.
