Title: A novel surgical technique for treatment of cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (wobbler syndrome) in a filly.

Abstract: Cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (CVSM), also known as equine wobbler syndrome or cervical ataxia, is a devastating neurological syndrome resulting from compression of the spinal cord at the cervical region. This report describes a novel surgical technique for treatment of 16-month-old Arabian filly with CVSM. The filly showed grade 4 ataxia, hypermetria, weakness of the hind limbs, stumbling during walking, and abnormal gait. Case history, clinical signs and myelography revealed spinal cord compression between the C3 and C4 and C4-C5. The filly underwent a novel surgical interference for decompression and stabilization of the point of stenosis using specially designed titanium plate and intervertebral spacer. Evidence of arthrodesis with absence of complications was confirmed by periodic radiography over eight months of postoperative care. The new technique applied in this cervical surgery was efficient for the decompression and stabilization of the vertebrae, allowing arthrodesis development and remission of the clinical signs. The obtained results encourage further assessment of this novel procedure in horses clinically affected by CVSM.
