Title: Single-stage repair for ascending aortic aneurysm, artery stenosis and occlusion of neck vessels caused by Takayasu arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis results in a variety of vascular symptoms, and there are some cases in which progressive vascular lesions require surgical intervention. We present a case with ascending aortic aneurysm, right common carotid artery stenosis, left common carotid artery occlusion and left subclavian artery stenosis caused by Takayasu arteritis that was successfully treated with total arch replacement and ascending aorta to right internal carotid artery bypass.
