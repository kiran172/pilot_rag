Title: Association between α1-antitrypsin and acute coronary syndrome.

Abstract: α1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein released as part of the anti-inflammatory response. It regulates the activity of serine proteinases and has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The present study aimed to examine its role in patients with ACS. The plasma samples of 117 patients were collected at the Cardiology Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Youjiang Medical University (Baise, China). These included 46 cases of ACS (who met the diagnostic criteria for ACS and had ≥50% luminal stenosis of any coronary vessel), 35 cases of stable angina (SA; with ≥50% luminal stenosis of any coronary vessel but in a stable condition) and 36 normal healthy controls (subjects with no luminal stenosis in their coronary arteries). Plasma AAT protein concentrations were measured by ELISA and clinical data were collected. The plasma levels of AAT protein in patients with ACS were lower than those in controls and cases of SA (P<0.05), and the levels tended to decrease with the number of coronary artery lesions involved. There were no significant associations of the expression of plasma AAT protein and the number of diseased vessels in patients or the degree of stenosis. There was no correlation between the plasma protein levels of AAT and Gensini scores of patients with ACS. In conclusion, the plasma AAT protein levels in patients with ACS may contribute to the occurrence and development of coronary artery disease.
