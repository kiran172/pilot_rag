Title: [Perineal and penile urethrostomy: surgical outcome and risk assessment of complications].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Urethral repair in the complex urethral strictures (US) is associated with a high risk of failure. In some cases, urethrostomy is justified when choosing a method of treatment for this category of patients.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To assess the results of perineal and penile urethrostomy and identify factors associated with the development of early surgical complications and urethrostomy stenosis (USs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 85 patients aged 53.9 years underwent urethrostomy from 2010 to 2019: permanent - 48 (56.5%), due to refusal of urethroplasty - 37 (43.5%). Penile urethrostomy was formed in 41 (48.2%) patients, perineal USs - in 44 (51.8%), respectively. The US etiology was as follows: inflammatory - 32.9%, iatrogenic - 29.4%, idiopathic - 28.2%, traumatic - 9.4%. The US length was 6 cm or more in 58.8% patients, multifocal lesions occurred in 22.4% cases, subtotal - in 28.2%. The criterion for successful treatment was the absence of complications requiring repeated surgery on the urethra and / or systemic bougienage (median follow-up - 58 mo). The contribution of various factors to the increased risk of developing USs was assessed using univariate analysis by calculating the odds-ratio (OR, 95% CI). Statistical significance was tested using the 2 test, Fishers test. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Early postoperative complications (EPCs) were detected in 7 (8.2%) patients [urethritis (2), wound phlegmon (2), scrotal hematomas (1), unrecovered urination (1), acute urinary retention (1)]. Of these, only 2 (2.4%) cases required additional surgical intervention. USs was detected in 14 (16.5%) patients during the follow-up period from 3 to 200 mo (median - 8 mo). USs surgical correction was required in 12 (14.1%) cases, systemic bougienage - in 2 (2.4%) cases. Independent risk factors for all complications were UTIs (OR=3.3; 95% CI - confidence interval (CI)=1,17 - 9,1; p=0.013), arterial hypertension (OR=2.3; 95% CI=1.02 - 5.05; p=0.044), bougienage (OR=2.4; 95% CI=1.08 - 5.33; p=0.031), the US multifocal localization (OR=2.8; 95% CI=1.28 - 6.05; p=0.011), and for stenoses, in particular, UTIs (OR=6.1; 95% CI=1.45 - 25.22; p=0.003), arterial hypertension (OR=2.6; 95% CI=1.05 - 6.40; p=0.035), previous hypospadias repair (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.27 - 8.55; p=0.031) and EPCs (OR=4.1; 95% CI=1.74 - 9.41; p=0.004). The combination of unfavorable factors identified in multivariate analysis determines development from 21.8% to 49.9% cases of early and late complications.
CONCLUSION: Urethrostomy may be the ultimate treatment for spongy complex US with an 82.4% primary success rate. The main factors negatively affecting the surgery outcomes are arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, US multifocal localization, previous bougienage, previous hypospadias repair, urethrocutaneous fistulas and EPCs.
