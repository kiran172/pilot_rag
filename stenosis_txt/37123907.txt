Title: Case report: Ioversol induced Kounis syndrome and cardiogenic shock.

Abstract: A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to the Cardiology Department of our hospital for intermittent chest pain for 9 days. Coronary angiography showed approximately 70% stenosis in the middle part of the left anterior descending branch. When the procedure was about to end, the patient experienced dyspnea, facial flushing and fall of blood pressure suddenly. At this time, the angiography showed severe spasm and stenosis of the left coronary artery. With antianaphylaxis, pressor therapy, fluid resuscitation and intracoronary administration of nitroglycerin, the left coronary spasm was relieved. A diagnosis of type II kounis syndrome induced by ioversol with cardiogenic shock was made.
