Title: Adipokines and adipocytokines in men with coronary atherosclerosis and overweight.

Abstract: Aim    To study concentrations of adipokines and their associations with proinflammatory cytokines in overweight men with coronary atherosclerosis. Material and methods    This study included 79 men aged 45-60 years with atherosclerosis who had undergone coronary endarterectomy during a coronary bypass surgery, and were overweight (body weight index (BWI), 25.0-29.9 kg /m2). Based on a histological analysis of plaques, the patients were divided into two subgroups: 43 men with stable atherosclerotic plaques and 36 men with unstable plaques in coronary arteries. The control group consisted of 40 age- and BWI-matched men without clinical manifestations of IHD. Blood concentrations of adipokines, including adiponectin, adipsin, lipocalin-2, resistin, and plasminogen 1 activator inhibitor were measured by a multiplex analysis with a MILLIPLEX MAP Human Adipokine Panel 1. Concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Results    The blood concentration of lipocalin -2 was higher in patients with coronary atherosclerosis and stable or unstable atherosclerotic plaques than in the control group (p&lt;0.01). Both subgroups of men with coronary atherosclerosis were characterized by significant differences from the control group in concentrations of TNF-α (p&lt;0.05), CRP, and IL-6 (p&lt;0.01). The most significant direct correlations were found between adipokines and TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP (p&lt;0.01). Results of a logistic regression analysis showed that relative odds for the presence of significant coronary stenoses increased with increasing blood concentrations of lipocalin-2 (OR=1.005, 95 % CI: 1.002-1.008, р=0.011) and IL-6 (OR=1.582 , 95 % CI: 1.241-2.017, р=0.001).Conclusion    The changes in blood concentrations of adipokines associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines may represent a factor that increases the probability of clinically significant coronary stenosis in overweight men with coronary atherosclerosis.
