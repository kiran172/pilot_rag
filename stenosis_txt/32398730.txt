Title: A Pilot Study Comparing Aortic Valve Area Estimates Derived from Fick Cardiac Output with Estimates Based on Cheetah-NICOM Cardiac Output.

Abstract: Cardiac output during cardiac catheterization is often estimated using the modified Fick method (CO<sub>Fick</sub>). In this proof-of-concept, prospective non-randomized study carried out in a single academic healthcare centre, we examined whether replacing CO<sub>Fick</sub> in the Gorlin formula with Cheetah-NICOM monitor cardiac output (CO<sub>Cheetah</sub>) could produce an accurate and precise estimate of aortic valve area in patients with severe aortic stenosis. In twenty-six subjects, CO<sub>Fick</sub> and CO<sub>Cheetah</sub> were obtained concurrently. A spot and 3-minute running average of CO<sub>Cheetah</sub> was used. Bland and Altman analysis was used to derive bias, 95% limits of agreement (LOA) and confidence intervals (CI). The mean difference (bias) between AVA<sub>Cheetah</sub> (average) and AVA<sub>Fick</sub> was 0.11 cm2 and the 95% LOA were ±0.42 cm2. The 95% CI of the bias was 0.02-0.2 cm2. The bias and 95% LOA of AVA<sub>Cheetah</sub> (spot value) were 0.14 ± 0.42cm2, with a 95% CI of 0.06-0.23 cm2. No proportional bias was present. AVA<sub>Cheetah</sub> thus appears to be a reasonably accurate measure of AVA in patients with severe aortic stenosis compared to AVA<sub>Fick</sub> measured using a modified Fick CO. However, the limits of agreement were not narrow enough to consider AVA<sub>Cheetah</sub> and AVA<sub>Fick</sub> interchangeable.
