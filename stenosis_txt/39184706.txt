Title: Mimicking Metastasis: Endobronchial Tuberculosis Presenting as a Mass in a Pediatric Patient With Yolk Sac Tumor.

Abstract: Before the advent of an effective antitubercular treatment for tuberculosis and bronchoscopy, endobronchial tuberculosis (EBTB) often greatly contributed to airway stenosis and lung atelectasis in children. Even after the advent of efficacious therapy, EBTB poses major challenges for pediatric patients, manifesting as airway stenosis or obstruction. We report a case of a two-year-old male with a previous history of yolk sac testicular tumor whose follow-up PET-CT scan showed right middle lobe collapse. Flexible bronchoscopy demonstrated endobronchial mass, and biopsy revealed EBTB, excluding metastasis. This case illustrates varied presentations of tuberculosis and highlights the significance of early diagnosis with bronchoscopy in treating this condition before it can lead to severe complications. Antitubercular therapy must be initiated at the earliest when managing EBTB. The follow-up procedures must be diligent, and timely interventions should be made for optimal patient outcomes despite the availability of improved diagnostic techniques and treatment methods.
