Title: Stent-assisted coiling of dural sinus diverticula: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Dural sinus diverticula are a rare vascular etiology of pulsatile tinnitus. Patients typically present with disabling symptoms and undergo an extensive workup for common causes of pulsatile tinnitus. Endovascular treatment has been shown to be effective in several case reports. We present the largest case series of eight patients treated with endovascular therapy using stent-assisted coiling and describe the unique details of intervention.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent endovascular dural sinus stenting.
RESULTS: One-hundred-twenty patients underwent dural sinus stetnting from August 2012 to February 2020. Eight of these had symptomatic pulsatile tinnitus secondary to a dural sinus diverticulum and were successfully treated with stent-assisted coil embolization. No complications occurred.
CONCLUSION: Our case series demonstrates that endovascular dural sinus stent-assisted coil embolization for symptomatic dural sinus diverticula is a safe and effective treatment.
