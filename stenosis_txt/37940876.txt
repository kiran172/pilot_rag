Title: Carotid free-floating thrombus stemming from carotid web: co-occurrence of two rare causes of ischemic stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid web (CaW) and carotid free-floating thrombus (CFFT) are rare yet critical causes of ischemic stroke in young adults.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old woman presented with a fluctuating right sensory-motor faciobrachial syndrome. A brain MRI scan revealed multiple small recent asynchronous cortico-subcortical ischemic foci in the vascular territory of the left internal carotid artery. A CT angiography identified a CFFT in the left internal carotid artery arising from an underlying CaW. The patient was treated with excellent clinical outcomes with carotid artery stenting and dual antiplatelet therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a structured pathophysiological rationale connecting CaW and CFFT and highlight pivotal therapeutic implications. Further studies are needed to investigate this relationship and guide assessment and treatment.
