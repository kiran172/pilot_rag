Title: Diagnostic Value of 99mTc-MIBI Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in Detecting Myocardial Ischemia of Children with Kawasaki Disease and Coronary Artery Lesions.

Abstract: Pediatric patients with coronary artery lesions (CALs) after Kawasaki disease (KD) may be complicated with myocardial ischemia. Although previous studies in adults have proven the diagnostic value of 99mTc-MIBI myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for ischemic heart disease, its feasibility and accuracy in this pediatric population remain uncertain. In this retrospective study, we collected data of 177 pediatric patients (Age range: 6 months to 14 years) who had undergone MPI and coronary artery angiography (CAG) between July 2019 and February 2023. Using the positive result of CAG as the reference standard of myocardial ischemia, we compared the results of 99mTc-MIBI MPI with other non-invasive examinations, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), echocardiogram, and comprehensive electrocardiogram-related examinations. All patients finished adenosine triphosphate stress MPI without major side effects. The sensitivity of MPI was 79.17%, which was greater than CMRI and echocardiogram (P &lt; 0.05). The negative predictive value and the accuracy of MPI were 89.9% and 71.75%, indicating the advantages over others. Composite monitoring strategy of MPI and CMRI effectively improved the diagnostic performance (P &lt; 0.001). In 4 cases diagnosed with myocardial ischemia by "MPI + CMRI," despite the absence of significant stenosis, multiple giant coronary artery aneurysms (GCAA) were all observed in CAG. 99mTc-MIBI MPI is the preferred non-invasive examination for detecting myocardial ischemia in pediatric patients with CAL after KD. When combined with CMRI, it can enhance diagnostic accuracy. Multiple GCAAs without stenosis may be an isolated risk factor of myocardial ischemia.
