Title: Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging with D-SPECT camera in patients with ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with a novel D-SPECT camera maintains excellent prognostic value compared to conventional SPECT. However, information about the relationship between D-SPECT MPI and the prognosis in patients with ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA) is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of MPI with D-SPECT in INOCA and obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.
METHODS: All consecutive patients with suspected CAD and without prior CAD who underwent D-SPECT MPI and invasive coronary angiography within 3 months were considered. INOCA and obstructive CAD were defined as < 50% and ≥ 50% coronary stenosis, respectively. Patients were followed-up for the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE: cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, stroke, heart failure and angina-related rehospitalization).
RESULTS: Among 506 patients, 232 (45.8%) were INOCA patients. A total of 33.2% of the INOCA patients had abnormal D-SPECT MPI, whereas 77.7% of the obstructive CAD patients had abnormal D-SPECT MPI. In both groups, patients with abnormal D-SPECT MPI demonstrated higher MACE rates and lower survival free of MACE. In addition, patients with INOCA and abnormal D-SPECT MPI had a poor prognosis similar to that of the obstructive CAD patients. Cox regression analysis showed that the risk-adjusted hazard ratios for abnormal D-SPECT MPI were 2.55 [1.11-5.87] and 2.06 [1.03-4.10] in the INOCA and obstructive CAD patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: D-SPECT MPI provides excellent prognostic information, with a more severe prognosis in patients with abnormal D-SPECT MPI. INOCA patients with abnormal D-SPECT MPI experience a poor prognosis similar to that of patients with obstructive CAD.
