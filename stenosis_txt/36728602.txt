Title: Unilateral renal atrophy 4 years after renal sympathetic denervation: a case report.

Abstract: Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) carries a low risk of renal artery stenosis, and most cases occur within the first year. However, limited data are available on long-term incidence. Here, we present a case of a 68-year-old woman who underwent radiofrequency RDN for resistant hypertension. Ambulatory blood pressure improved following RDN and uptitration of antihypertensive drugs. Between year 3 and 4 after RDN, eGFR reduced from 87 to 50 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . Ultrasound imaging revealed left renal atrophy, while subsequent magnetic resonance angiography showed a haemodynamically significant stenosis of the left renal artery. The patient remained in good clinical condition with stable blood pressure, while eGFR mildly deteriorated during a 6-year follow-up period. This case of renal artery stenosis occurred in a patient with multiple risk factors. A causal relationship to the RDN procedure cannot be confirmed nor ruled out. Long-term surveillance for adverse events should be considered in all RDN patients.
