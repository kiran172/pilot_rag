Title: Effect of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonism on Aortic Valve Stenosis Risk: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.

Abstract: Background: Aortic valve repair is currently the only effective treatment for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS), as no pharmacological therapies exist to prevent or slow its progression. Recent promising results showed that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) attenuates the calcification of aortic valve interstitial cells. Therefore, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonism (GLP-1Ra) on the risk of CAVS. Methods: The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used to obtain the primary causal inference, and several sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger, were performed to assess the robustness of the results. Results: Based on the IVW estimates, the GLP-1Ra showed a neutral effect on the risk of CAVS (odds ratio [OR] per 1 mmol/mol decrease in glycated hemoglobin = 0.87, 95% CI = [0.69, 1.11], p = 0.259; I2 = 4.5%, Cohran's Q = 2.09, heterogeneity p = 0.35; F statistic = 16.8). A non-significant effect was also derived by the sensitivity analyses. No evidence of horizontal pleiotropy was identified. Conclusions: GLP-1Ra was not significantly associated with the risk of CAVS. Furthermore, pragmatically designed studies are required to evaluate the effect of GLP-1Ra on the clinical course of CAVS in different patient subgroups.
