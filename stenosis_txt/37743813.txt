Title: Successful Simultaneous Treatment of Benign Stricture and Colonic Neoplasm Arising from Colonic Interposition after Esophagectomy: A Case Report.

Abstract: Colonic interposition is the main procedure used in esophageal reconstruction. We report a rare case of simultaneous treatment of an anastomotic site stricture and a neoplasm in the interpositioned colon. A 69-year-old female visited our outpatient clinic with symptoms of progressive dysphagia for 1 year. At the age of 30 years, the patient underwent esophagectomy with retrosternal colonic interposition because of severe esophageal burns after chemical ingestion. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed stricture at the anastomosis site and a 10-mm flat elevated high-grade dysplasia in the interpositioned colon. First, through-the-scope balloon dilatation was performed for strictures. However, stenosis was observed during the second upper gastrointestinal endoscopy session. Therefore, a second session of through-the-scope balloon dilatation was performed, and simultaneously, endoscopic submucosal dissection was also successfully performed. After 2 months of follow-up, stenosis persisted; consequently, balloon dilatation was performed. No recurrence of neoplasm was confirmed endoscopically. Through-the-scope balloon dilatation of the stricture site and simultaneous endoscopic submucosal dissection of the neoplasm in the interpositioned colon were successfully performed.
