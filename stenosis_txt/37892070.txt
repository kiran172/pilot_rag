Title: Atherogenic Index of Plasma Predicts Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease in Patients with Stable Angina Pectoris.

Abstract: AIMS: Chronic coronary syndrome is associated with several risk factors, such as dyslipidemia and hypertension. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) has been demonstrated to be a biochemical risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to determine whether the AIP is an effective parameter for estimating obstructive CAD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 345 patients (with a mean age of 62.2 ± 10.3; 63% male) who underwent coronary angiography were included in this study. Obstructive CAD is defined as having one or more vessels with a stenosis level of ≥50%. Depending on the presence of obstructive CAD, all patients were divided into two groups. The mean AIP value was found to be 0.538 ± 0.26 in the study group. The AIP values were significantly higher in the obstructive coronary artery group (AIP; 0.49 ± 0.26 vs. 0.58 ± 0.27, p = 0.002). According to a univariable analysis, AIP values were significantly associated with obstructive coronary artery disease [OR: 3.74 (CI 95% 1.62-8.64), p = 0.020]. The AIP was further adjusted for confounding risk factors in three multivariable analysis models and, all three models showed a significant association. According to an ROC analysis, 0.49 is the cut-off value for AIP, and a value above 0.49 indicates 50% coronary artpery stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The AIP may be used in the assessment of cardiovascular risk for patients with stable angina pectoris, and it may also be used to estimate obstructive CAD.
