Title: Association of serum lipoprotein(a) level with the severity and prognosis of calcific aortic valve stenosis: a Chinese cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There was a causal relationship between elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels and increased risk of calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) in whites and blacks. The present study aimed to investigate whether Lp(a) levels were associated with aortic stenosis (AS) severity and clinical events in Chinese patients.
METHODS: Levels of serum Lp(a) were measured in 652 patients with CAVS, whom all underwent baseline echocardiographic examination. The clinical endpoint was defined as a composite of aortic valve replacement (AVR) and cardiac death.
RESULTS: Patients in the tertile 3 of Lp(a) had a higher percentage of severe AS compared with those in the tertile 1 and 2 of Lp(a) (46.2% vs. 33.9%, P = 0.005). Moreover, the top tertile of Lp(a) was an independent predictor of severe AS (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.18-2.66, P = 0.006). However, there was no significant association between tertile 3 of Lp(a) and clinical events (hazard ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.43-1.24; P = 0.239) in the multivariate Cox regression analysis during a mean follow-up time of 3.16 Â± 2.74 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Lp(a) level was an independent predictor of severe AS by echocardiography in the Chinese population, but was not associated with the increased risk of AVR and cardiac death, suggesting that Lp(a) levels might be helpful in the risk stratification of patients with CAVS.
