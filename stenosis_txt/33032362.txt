Title: Aorto-innominate artery bypass for migrated stent.

Abstract: We report a case of a 64-year-old female who first presented with a transient ischemic attack in 2007 due to an innominate artery stenosis, which indicated an endovascular stent placement. In 2008, she presented with recurrence of symptoms and was diagnosed with in-stent restenosis alongside an unusual occurrence of retrograde migration into the ascending aortic arch. We performed an aorto-innominate bypass through a median sternotomy. The patient was discharged without any complications thereafter, and the graft has shown excellent patency. As of 2019, the patient remains well.
