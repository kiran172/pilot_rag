Title: Ulcerated Stenosis of the Small Intestine Associated With Hepatic Portal Venous Gas After Treatment for Cytomegalovirus Enteritis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Due to its rarity, cytomegalovirus (CMV) enteritis remains poorly described with regard to its endoscopic and radiological findings. A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain and was treated with an antiviral agent for CMV enteritis. She was readmitted to our hospital 10 days after discharge due to a recurrence of abdominal pain. Emergency computed tomography revealed hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) and ileal dilatation involving focal stenosis of the ileum. The patient underwent laparoscopic partial resection of the small intestine and was finally diagnosed with ulcered stenosis of the small intestine after treatment for CMV enteritis. This report represents a valuable addition to the literature describing a rare case of ulcerated stenosis of the small intestine associated with HPVG after treatment for CMV enteritis.
