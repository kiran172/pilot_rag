Title: Anesthetic Concerns of Children With Skeletal Dysplasia.

Abstract: Children with skeletal dysplasia present unique challenges for safe anesthetic care including differences in the anatomy of the respiratory system, possibility of cervical spine instability or spinal stenosis, and a unique body habitus. Even seemly routine anesthesia can result in respiratory arrest or spinal cord injury. These complications can largely be avoided by proper planning such as appropriate techniques for the intubation of difficult airways, recognition of cervical instability, neuromonitoring for any anesthesia over an hour in patients with severe spinal stenosis, and preoperative assessment of the trachea and avoidance of neuraxial anesthesia in children with Morquio syndrome.
