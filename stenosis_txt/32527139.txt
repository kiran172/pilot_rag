Title: Increased Serum CRP-Albumin Ratio Is Independently Associated With Severity of Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenosis (CAS), mainly caused by carotid atherosclerosis, is related to ischemic stroke. We investigated whether C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin ratio (CAR) was associated with increased severity of carotid stenosis in patients undergoing carotid angiography. A total of 269 patients who were undergoing carotid angiography were included in this study. The patients were divided into 2 groups with respect to the severe CAS: group 1 (stenosis &lt; 70%, n = 189) or group II (stenosis ≥ 70%, n = 80). C-reactive protein to albumin ratio was higher in group II compared to group I (0.56 ± 0.25 vs 0.14 ± 0.01, P &lt; .001). The CAR (odds ratio [OR]: 1.051, 95%CI: 1.027-1.076, P &lt; .001), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and total cholesterol levels were independent predictors of severe CAS. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (area under the curve) for the CAR to predict severe CAS was 0.798 (95% CI: 0.741-0.854, P &lt; .001). C-reactive to protein albumin ratio was an independent risk factor of severe CAS. Therefore, CAR might be considered a potential index in the severity of carotid artery disease.
