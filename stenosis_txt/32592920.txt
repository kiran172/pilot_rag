Title: From clinic to hypothesis, an innovative operation for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis in a minimal invasive way.

Abstract: Concerning the damage to back muscles and posterior ligament complex (PLC) by posterior open approach for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), the oblique lateral intervertebral fusion (OLIF) is pretty popular nowadays. However, oblique lateral approach has obvious drawbacks, which are limited vision and operative scope for achieving spinal canal decompression. Herein, we present a hypothesis that lumbar canal decompression can be well achieved by OLIF combined with spinal endoscope operative system. Nerval decompression and spinal reconstruction are achieved in a minimal invasive way, which may play an instructive role for the treatment of serious LSS.
