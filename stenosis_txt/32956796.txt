Title: The impact of endovascular treatment on clinical outcomes of stable symptomatic patients with spontaneous superior mesenteric artery dissection.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment for superior mesenteric artery dissection (SMAD) and its effect on superior mesenteric artery (SMA) remodeling compared with medical management alone after successful initial medical management.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, all patients with spontaneous SMAD at a single institution were identified from March 2007 to August 2019. The primary outcomes were freedom from major adverse events (MAEs, a composite of dissection-related death, the recurrence of mesenteric ischemia symptoms, and a requirement for intervention). The secondary outcomes were morphologic remodeling of the dissections and stenosis or occlusion of the SMA.
RESULTS: A total of 94 patients with SMAD who underwent successful initial medical management (91 males; mean age, 50.4 ± 6.3 years) were enrolled in the study. Fifty-seven (60.6%) received medical management alone, and 37 (39.4%) underwent endovascular repair after initial medical management. In the endovascular group, the technical success rate was 86.5% (32 of 37). During a mean follow-up period of 33.6 ± 26.2 months (range, 1-120 months), nine (9.6%) patients experienced a recurrence of abdominal pain, and six had additional interventions for SMAD. The patients in the endovascular group showed more complete or partial remodeling (22 [81.1%] vs 24 [44.4%]; P < .0001) or unchanged dissections (5 [13.5%] vs 23 [42.6%]; P = .0001) than those in the conservative group. Survival analysis showed that the estimated MAE-free survival rates were 95.6%, 88.9%, and 85.4% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. There was a higher freedom from SMA stenosis or occlusion in the endovascular group (log rank P = .046).
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment and medical management alone result in similar MAE-free survival for patients with SMAD after successful initial medical management. Moreover, endovascular therapy is associated with a higher complete remodeling rate and greater freedom from SMA stenosis or occlusion.
