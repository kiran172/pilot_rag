Title: Treating Multifocal Ureteral Strictures with Combined Techniques: 14 Cases of Initial Experience.

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of lingual mucosal graft ureteroplasty (LMGU) combined with ureteral reimplantation (UR) for repairing managing multifocal ureteral strictures (MUS). Methods: Between December 2020 and December 2022, 14 patients underwent LMGU combined with UR. Their perioperative data were collected retrospectively and analyzed. For the proximal diseased ureter, the narrow segment was incised longitudinally to open the ventral wall of ureter, and a lingual mucosal graft was placed as an onlay graft. Meanwhile, UR was applied to treat distal ureteral strictures. Results: Of 14 patients, three (21.4%) had previously undergone a failed ureteral reconstruction. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) proximal stricture length was 4.0 cm (1.56), and distal ureteral stricture length was 4.3 cm (0.94). The mean (SD) operative time was 236 minutes (57), the estimated blood loss was 78 mL (41.5), and the length of postoperative stay was 6 days. One (7%) patient underwent double LMGU to treat proximal 2 segments of ureteral stricture. No open conversions and intraoperative complications occurred. With a mean follow-up of 15 months (range 6-29), the recurrence-free rate was 14/14 (100%). Conclusions: LMGU combined with UR is a feasible and effective technique for managing MUS and can be an alternative to ileal ureteral replacement or renal autotransplantation in some selected patients with MUS.
