Title: Glans Diameter and Meatus Localization Are the Sole Predictors of Primary Distal Hypospadias Surgery Complications: A Multivariate Analysis of Single Surgeon Series.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Tubularized incised plate urethroplasty (TIPU) surgery is among the most successful techniques for distal hypospadias. Our objective was the investigation of complication rates and their predictors.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2021, 150 patients with distal hypospadias were operated on consecutively by a single surgeon using the TIPU technique. The primary outcome was the complication rates including fistula, meatal stenosis, and glans dehiscence. Secondary outcomes were predictor factors of complications.
RESULTS: The average glans diameter was 13.9 ± 0.10 mm and 57.0% of the patients had a glans diameter greater than 14 mm. Single-layer and double-layer urethroplasty were used in 55.3% (n = 83) and 44.7% (n = 67) of patients, respectively. Overall complication rate was 23.3% (n = 35), which included fistula (3.3%, n = 5), glans dehiscence (12.7%, n = 19), and meatal stenosis (8.6%, n = 13). Glandular meatus localization (OR = 58.8, p = 0.001) and smaller glans diameter (OR = 0.39, p = 0.001) were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis of overall complications. For fistula complications, only short operation time (OR = 0.83, p = 0.03) was found as a significant predictor. Glans width (<14 mm) was the only significant predictor of both glans dehiscence (OR = 3.4, p = 0.03) and stenosis (OR = 5.67, p = 0.013) complication.
CONCLUSION: TIPU technique for distal hypospadias has notable success and acceptable complication rates. Dartos augmented single-layer urethral closure seems adequate for complication prevention. Preoperative assessment of the glans width and meatus site is advised to predict complication rates.
