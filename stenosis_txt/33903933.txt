Title: A new designed self-expandable metal stent for the management of benign radiotherapy-induced hypopharyngeal or cervical esophageal strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The management of patients with hypopharyngeal or cervical esophageal refractory benign strictures (RBS) after surgery and radiotherapy ± chemotherapy for laryngeal cancer is challenging. We aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of a new designed fully covered SEMS in these patients.
METHODS: We reviewed the results of a prospectively collected database of 40 consecutive patients with dysphagia due to RBS of the cervical esophagus or hypopharynx after surgery and radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy for laryngeal cancer, unfit for surgery, referred in two tertiary-care endoscopic centers from June 2005 to December 2018. All of them were treated with placement of a Niti-S Conio cervical stent.
RESULTS: After placement of the first stent, dysphagia improved in all patients. The total number of adverse events was 35 out of a total of 299 procedures (11.7%): 25 (8.4%) stent migrations, 6 (2%) tumor overgrowth, 3 severe pain and 1 pharyngo-cutaneous fistula. Stents were periodically changed. In only one patient with a cervical esophageal stricture the stent was definitively removed after 7 sessions of stent placement because of stricture resolution. Patients were followed-up for a median of 11.6 months and a significant improvement in dysphagia was reported in all patients (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of this conformable, small caliber new designed Niti-S stent, exchanged periodically, appeared safe and permitted durable oral intake in patients with difficult-to-treat hypopharyngeal or cervical esophagus strictures, avoiding the need for periodic dilations.
