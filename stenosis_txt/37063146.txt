Title: Analysis of risk factors associated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after surgical repair of peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Acute lung injury is a known complication of pulmonary artery reconstruction for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Severe cases may require support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after pulmonary artery reconstruction.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 150 patients who underwent surgical repair of peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis at our institution from 2002 to 2022. Underlying diagnoses included Williams syndrome (n = 44), Alagille syndrome (n = 43), elastin arteriopathy (n = 21), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 21), and other (n = 21). Characteristics of patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were compared with those who did not require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
RESULTS: Eleven of the 150 patients undergoing pulmonary artery reconstruction (7.3%) required postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (10 for acute lung injury and 1 for cardiac insufficiency). Four patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation had Williams syndrome, 3 patients had Alagille, and 4 patients had tetralogy of Fallot. Patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation had a higher preoperative right ventricle to aortic peak systolic pressure ratios (mean 1.14 vs 0.95), greater number of pulmonary artery ostial interventions (median, 23 vs 17), and longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (median, 597 vs 400 minutes). There were 3 in-hospital deaths (2.0%), 2 of whom required postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate multiple differences between patients who did and did not require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after surgical repair of peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. These results suggest that the preoperative extent of disease may predispose to the development of acute lung injury requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
