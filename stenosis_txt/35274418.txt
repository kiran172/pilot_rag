Title: Diagnostic office hysteroscopy; why is it still painful procedure despite the surgical experience and mini-hysteroscope?

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the effect of cervical canal features on pain during outpatient hysteroscopy performed by experienced surgeons using mini-hysteroscope.
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on 303 women undergoing diagnostic hysteroscopy without anesthesia. Pain intensity was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) when the cervical canal was passed. The patients were divided into two groups according to the VAS score: painless or mild pain (VAS <4) and moderate or severe pain (VAS ≥ 4). The relationship between cervical canal characteristics (length, version, and flexion positions, history of cervical intervention, stenosis, synechiae), obstetric and gynecological history, preoperative anxiety level, procedure duration, and pain intensity was examined.
RESULTS: Moderate pain (4 ≤ VAS < 7) was observed in 38% of patients (n = 117) and 14 patients (5%) experienced severe pain (VAS ≥ 7). In multivariate analysis, nulliparity (p = 0.01; OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.7-13.2), postmenopausal state (p = 0.02; OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.3), excessive flexion of the cervix and retroverted uterus (p <0.001; OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.0-8.5) were identified as risk factors for a painful procedure. Diagnostic hysteroscopy was successful in 98% of the patients. The pain was the primary cause of the failed hysteroscopy.
CONCLUSION: In addition to nulliparity and postmenopausal status, unfavorable features of the cervical canal, such as the excessive flexion position of the cervix and uterine retroversion are significant causes of pain during outpatient hysteroscopy.
