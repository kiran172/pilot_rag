Title: Ultrasmall catechol-PEG-anchored ferrite nanoparticles for highly sensitive magnetic resonance angiography.

Abstract: Highly sensitive iron oxide nanoparticles with stable, safe and efficient surface functionalization, as potential substitutes for gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) with increasing biosafety concerns, exhibit great potential for high-performance magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Herein, we developed ultrasmall catechol-PEG-anchored ferrite nanoparticles (PEG-UMFNPs) for highly sensitive MRA. The obtained nanoprobe has a high T<sub>1</sub> relaxivity value (7.2 mM-1 s-1) due to its ultrasmall size and Mn doping. It has a suitable hydrodynamic size of 20 nm, which prevents rapid vascular extravasation and renal clearance and prolongs its blood circulation time. In vivo MRA at 3.0 T using the nanoprobe shows that the arteries and veins of rats, even blood vessels as small as 0.32 mm, are distinctly visible, and the contrast enhancement can last for at least 1 h. In addition, due to the outstanding contrast enhancement and long circulation time, the stenosis and recanalization process of the rat's carotid artery can be continuously monitored with a single injection of the nanoprobe. Our study indicates that PEG-UMFNPs are outstanding MR imaging nanoprobes that can be used to diagnose vascular diseases without the biosafety issues of GBCAs.
