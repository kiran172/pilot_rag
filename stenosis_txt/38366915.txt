Title: Thick endothelialization of the self-expandable valve causes delayed coronary obstruction.

Abstract: Delayed coronary obstruction is a rare complication occurring after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Although TAVR has become popular, in some cases, the therapeutic strategy should be carefully selected depending on the patient's anatomical and/or functional restrictions. We report a rare case of delayed coronary obstruction in which coronary obstruction was caused by thick endothelialization of the nitinol frame of the prosthetic valve. A 79-year-old female who had undergone TAVR 4 months before presented with mild chest pain and was admitted to our institution. Computed tomography and coronary angiography revealed that the space from the sinus of Valsalva to the nitinol frame was narrow and separated from the inside of the nitinol frame because of critical endothelialization. Therefore, an emergency surgical aortic valve replacement was performed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged 20â€‰days postoperatively without any complications.
