Title: Stress-only dynamic computed tomography perfusion protocol (CTP) alone without computed tomography coronary angiography (CCTA) has limited specificity to diagnose ischemia: A retrospective two-center study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate diagnostic performance of stress-only dynamic myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) without computed tomography coronary angiography (CCTA) to diagnose ischemia with invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) as a reference standard.
METHOD: 135 datasets (68 positive for ischemia with invasive FFR < 0.8) acquired with a 256-slice CT system (Revolution, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) were retrieved, postprocessed with a deep learning-based algorithm (Advanced intelligent Clear-IQ Engine (AiCE), Canon Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan) (FC03/cardiac kernel, 8 mm slice thickness), analyzed using a dedicated workstation (Vitrea research 7.11.0. Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN, USA), and loaded into a clinical workstation (CardIQ, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) for review. Ten observers with various experience from two research sites evaluated the post-processed images, perfusion slices and maps to indicate presence vs absence of perfusion defect and its probability (five-point Likert scale). Binary decisions and probability scores were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity for each reader, and to create receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed. ROC AUC of a purely quantitative analysis was obtained thanks to a color-coded map with a fixed scale superimposed on myocardial walls displaying myocardial blood flow (MBF) values.
RESULTS: The overall case-based sensitivity and specificity for the detection of perfusion deficit were 0.79 and 0.30, respectively. No significant differences were detected in the AUC across readers (p value = 0.66). The AUC values were 0.50, 0.58, 0.63, 0.59, 0.45, 0.60, 0.56, 0.61, 0.52, 0.61. Absolute reader agreement ICC was 0.60 (good agreement) for an average case.
CONCLUSION: Dynamic CTP alone has good sensitivity, but low specificity when analyzed without CCTA. These findings reinforce the need to guide the interpretation functional test with the knowledge of coronary artery anatomy.
