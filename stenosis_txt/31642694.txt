Title: SCOT-HEART trial: reshuffling our approach to stable ischemic heart disease.

Abstract: The role of diagnostic testing in triaging patients with stable ischemic heart disease continues to evolve towards recognizing the benefits of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) over functional testing. The SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed Tomography of the HEART) trial highlights this paradigm shift finding a significant reduction of death from coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial infarction without a significant increased rate of invasive coronary angiography over a 5â€‰year follow-up period when implementing CCTA with standard care vs standard care alone. The better negative predictive value and ability to identify nonobstructive coronary artery disease to optimize medical therapy highlight the benefits of a CCTA first strategy. With the advent of noninvasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) and widespread availability and ease of CT, CCTA continues to establish itself as a pivotal diagnostic exam for patients with stable ischemic heart disease. In this commentary, we review the SCOT-HEART trial and its impact on CCTA for patients with stable ischemic heart disease.
