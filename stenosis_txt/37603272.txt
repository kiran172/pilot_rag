Title: Extracellular Vesicles and Ischemic Cardiovascular Diseases.

Abstract: Characterized by coronary artery obstruction or stenosis, ischemic cardiovascular diseases as advanced stages of coronary heart diseases commonly lead to left ventricular aneurysm, ventricular septal defect, and mitral insufficiency. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by diverse cells in the body exert roles in cell-cell interactions and intrinsic cellular regulations. With a lipid double-layer membrane and biological components such as DNA, protein, mRNA, microRNAs (miRNA), and siRNA inside, the EVs function as paracrine signaling for the pathophysiology of ischemic cardiovascular diseases and maintenance of the cardiac homeostasis. Unlike stem cell transplantation with the potential tumorigenicity and immunogenicity, the EV-based therapeutic strategy is proposed to satisfy the demand for cardiac repair and regeneration while the circulating EVs detected by a noninvasive approach can act as precious biomarkers. In this chapter, we extensively summarize the cardioprotective functions of native EVs and bioengineered EVs released from stem cells, cardiomyocytes, cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), endothelial cells, fibroblast, smooth muscle cells, and immune cells. In addition, the potential of EVs as robust molecule biomarkers is discussed for clinical diagnosis of ischemic cardiovascular disease, attributed to the same pathology of EVs as that of their origin. Finally, we highlight EV-based therapy as a biocompatible alternative to direct cell-based therapy for ischemic cardiovascular diseases.
