Title: Surgical aortic valvuloplasty is a better primary intervention for isolated congenital aortic stenosis in children with bicuspid aortic valve than balloon aortic valvuloplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Surgical aortic valvuloplasty (SAV) and balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) are two main treatments for children with isolated congenital aortic stenosis (CAS). We aim to compare the two procedures' midterm outcomes, including valve function, survival, reintervention, and replacement.
METHODS: From January 2004 to January 2021, children with isolated CAS undergoing SAV (n = 40) and BAD (n = 49) at our institution were included in this study. Patients were also categorized into subgroups based on the aortic leaflet number(Tricuspid = 53, Bicuspid = 36) to compare the two procedures' outcomes. Clinical and echocardiogram data were analyzed to identify risk factors for suboptimal outcomes and reintervention.
RESULTS: Postoperative peak aortic gradient (PAG) and PAG at follow-up in the SAV group were lower compared with the BAV group (p < 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). There was no difference in moderate or severe AR in the SAV group compared with the BAV group before discharge (5.0% vs 12.2%, p = 0.287) and at the last follow-up (30.0% vs 32.7%, p = 0.822). There were no early death but three late deaths (SAV = 2, BAV = 1). Kaplan-Meier estimated survivals were 86.3% and 97.8% in SAV and BAV groups respectively at 10 years (p = 0.54). There was no significant difference in freedom from reintervention (p = 0.22). For patients with bicuspid aortic valve morphology, SAV achieved higher freedom from reintervention (p = 0.011) and replacement (p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis indicated that residual PAG was a risk factor for reintervention (p = 0.045).
CONCLUSIONS: SAV and BAV achieved excellent survival and freedom from reintervention in patients with isolated CAS. SAV performed better in PAG reduction and maintenance. For patients with bicuspid AoV morphology, SAV was the preferred choice.
