Title: Stent Angioplasty in Coronary Artery Anomalies With Intramural Course: When, Why, How, With What Results?

Abstract: Although coronary artery anomalies include multiple disorders, few are likely to require intervention, given that the risk for critical sequelae (ie, sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death) is generally low. This article addresses which coronary artery anomaly carriers may need intervention and which interventions may be required. The recent introduction of stent angioplasty is discussed in particular, along with general reviews of nomenclature, various anatomical and functional presentations, quantitative diagnosis methods, and indications for surgical versus percutaneous intervention. Novel criteria for defining severe stenosis also are proposed. Optimal risk quantification depends on precise imaging that only intravascular ultrasonography or optical coherence tomography can reliably obtain. Accordingly, the technique of intravascular ultrasonography-monitored stent angioplasty is described in detail. Initial results from our group's study of 100 patients with right or left anomalous origin of a coronary artery from an opposite sinus of Valsalva with intramural course are reported. Future efforts should prospectively evaluate stent angioplasty in multicenter studies based on precise, consistent techniques and follow-up protocols, such as those initiated by our group. Comparisons with surgical results should be part of the program, with the understanding that detailed and complete results from those techniques will require long-term (5- to 10-year) studies.
