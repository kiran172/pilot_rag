Title: Moyamoya Disease Causing Stroke in the Setting of Cocaine Use and Uncontrolled Hypertension Due to Primary Hyperaldosteronism.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular disease characterized by stenosis of large intracranial arteries and the development of smaller collateral vessels. Moyamoya may cause strokes and stroke-like symptoms in young patients. It has also been linked to autoimmune diseases and neuropsychiatric conditions. We present a case of moyamoya disease in a young patient with concomitant hyperaldosteronism, uncontrolled hypertension, and cocaine use disorder, along with features of antisocial personality disorder. This is a unique presentation of an underlying neurological disease causing psychiatric features exacerbated by cocaine use, and it describes a rare clinical presentation that physicians should consider in patients with moyamoya disease.
