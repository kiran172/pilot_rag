Title: Transcatheter Embolization of Renal-Splenic Shunt to Treat Hematemesis.

Abstract: Although sequelae of chronic liver disease are the most common causes of altered pressure dynamics in the portal and splanchnic circulations, there are other mechanisms resulting in increased venous pressures with subsequent development of splenic and gastric varices. We report a case of a patient without portal hypertension, but with bleeding gastric varices with a presumed splenorenal shunt (SRS) on CT. Venography revealed flowÂ reversal through the shunt (directed from the renal vein, into the splenic vein and out the portal vein; a renal-splent shunt (RSR)) and thus an anatomically similar but functionally distinct systemic to mesenteric variant. While being anatomically similar to the well-known SRS, the different flow dynamics necessitate a different approach for treatment and important considerations for the use of any liquid embolic.
