Title: Vessel Patency and Associated Factors of Drug-Coated Balloon for Femoropopliteal Lesion.

Abstract: Background Although clinical trials have reported favorable outcomes after drug-coated balloon (DCB) therapy for femoropopliteal lesions, their real-world performance and predictors have not been well evaluated. This study aimed to elucidate 1-year freedom from restenosis and to explore the associated factors after a DCB for femoropopliteal lesions in clinical settings. Methods and Results This multicenter, prospective cohort registered 3165 de novo or restenotic femoropopliteallesions (mean lesion length, 13.5±9.3 cm; chronic total occlusion, 25.9%; severe calcification, 14.6%) that underwent successful DCB (Lutonix [24.2%] and IN.PACT Admiral [75.8%]) treatment between March 2018 and December 2019. Patency was assessed at 12±2 months. The primary outcome measure was 1-year freedom from restenosis and its associated factors. Bailout stenting was performed in 3.5% of patients. The postprocedural slow flow phenomenon was observed in 3.9% of patients. During a median follow-up of 14.2 months, 811 patients experienced restenosis. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom from restenosis was 84.5% at 12 months (79.7% at 14 months). Focal, tandem, diffuse, and occlusive restenosis accounted for 37.4%, 9.8%, 18.9%, and 33.9%, respectively. Freedom from target lesion revascularization was 91.5% at 12 months. Risk factors independently associated with 1-year restenosis were a history of revascularization, smaller distal reference vessel diameter, severe calcification, chronic total occlusion, low-dose DCB, and residual stenosis. Conclusions The 1-year clinical outcomes after DCB use for femoropopliteal lesions in real-world practice was favorable. The additive risk factors were associated with a lower rate of freedom from restenosis.
