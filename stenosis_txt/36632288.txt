Title: Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition on Coronary Atherosclerosis Regression of Nontarget Lesions after Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients.

Abstract: AIMS: To evaluate the regression of coronary atherosclerosis with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Methods and Result. We examined 40 nontarget lesions in 17 ACS patients who underwent PPCI and were treated with PCSK9 inhibitors. At 1 year, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and atherogenic index (AI) decreased significantly by 2.5 mmol/L, 2.01 mmol/L, and 1.86, respectively. On quantitative coronary angiography, treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors reduced significantly the atherosclerotic area stenosis in nontarget lesions (61.18 ± 14.55 at baseline vs. 52.85 ± 15.51 at 1 year, P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: After 1 year of PCSK9 inhibition treatment for ACS patients, the area stenosis of non-TLR was considerably reduced.
