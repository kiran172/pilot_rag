Title: Laser hemorrhoidoplasty versus hemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of surgically indicated hemorrhoids in inflammatory bowel patients: a randomized comparative clinical study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess and compare the outcomes of traditional surgery and laser surgery for anal hemorrhoids in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: This is a single-center prospective randomized comparative clinical trial performed at Zagazig University Hospitals from September 2023 to September 2024. The study comprised 48 patients who were admitted during this period and had inflammatory bowel disease along with hemorrhoids. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups: Group I consisted of 24 patients who underwent laser hemorrhoidoplasty, selected based on odd numbers, while Group II consisted of 24 patients who underwent traditional surgery, selected based on even numbers.
RESULTS: Group I, which underwent laser treatment for hemorrhoids in inflammatory bowel patients, demonstrated significantly better outcomes than traditional surgery (p < 0.001) regarding operation time, pain score and duration, postoperative anal discharge, return to work time, and patient satisfaction. Moreover, laser treatment was found to be more effective than traditional surgery for treating hemorrhoids in inflammatory bowel patients in terms of postoperative bleeding and anal stenosis. Additionally, there was a higher frequency of residual hemorrhoids in laser group.
CONCLUSION: Laser treatment is mostly superior to traditional surgery for hemorrhoids in inflammatory bowel patients.
