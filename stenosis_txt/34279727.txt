Title: Tree nut consumption and prevalence of carotid artery plaques: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: While tree nut consumption has been shown to be cardioprotective, a few studies have examined the relationship between tree nut consumption and carotid atherosclerosis. We tested the hypothesis that tree nut consumption would be inversely related with carotid atherosclerosis in adults.
METHODS: We cross-sectionally analyzed data from 4536 participants of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Family Heart Study conducted in the United States. Dietary patterns among participants were variable, tree nut consumption was self-reported using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and B-mode ultrasound of the carotid arteries was used to assess for the presence of carotid artery plaques (primary outcome) and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of prevalent carotid artery plaques and linear regression was used to estimate adjusted mean cIMT across categories of nut consumption.
RESULTS: The mean age was 52.3 years (SD = 13.6), 95.6% of the participants were white, and 54% were female. The median tree nut intake was 1-3 servings/month. Odds ratios (95% CI) for prevalent carotid artery plaques were 1.0 (reference), 1.03 [0.86, 1.4], 0.89 [0.70, 1.13], and 0.96 [0.73, 1.26] for tree nut consumption of almost never, 1-3 times/month, 1/week, and 2+/week, respectively, adjusting for age, sex, race, field center, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, creatinine, energy intake, fruit and vegetable consumption, exercise, and education. In secondary analysis, there was a suggestive inverse association of tree nut consumption with cIMT in the internal carotid artery, but not the common carotid or bifurcation.
CONCLUSION: Our data showed no association between tree nut consumption and prevalence of carotid artery plaques in adults.
