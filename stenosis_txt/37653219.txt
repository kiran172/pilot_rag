Title: Extracellular matrix stiffness aggravates urethral stricture through Igfbp3/Smad pathway.

Abstract: Urethral stricture refers to the narrowing of the urethral lumen. While previous studies have hinted at inflammation as the initial driver of this condition, the reasons and mechanisms behind its progression remain largely unknown. By Atomic force microscope (AFM), researchers measured the matrix stiffness of urethra to be 5.23 ± 0.37 kPa for normal tissue and 41.59 ± 2.48 kPa for stricture urethral scar. Similar results were observed in rat urethral stricture models, where the matrix stiffness of normal urethra was 4.29 ± 0.82 kPa, while 32.94 ± 7.12 kPa for urethral stricture scar. Notably, the matrix stiffness increased in rat models over time. To further investigate, polyacrylamide hydrogels were employed to mimic different levels of stiffness for normal and stricture condition. Interestingly, higher matrix stiffness led to an increased fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) in rat urethral fibroblasts, indicated by enhanced expression of α-SMA and Collagen I, as well as changing in the morphology of fibroblast. RNA-seq analysis suggested that Igfbp3/Smads might regulate the progressive FMT in urethral stricture. In the experiment where the expression of Igfbp3 was inhibited, increasing matrix stiffness lose the potential to stimulate FMT progression and the expression of p-Smad2/3 decreased. On the contrary, overexpression of Igfbp3 promoted the process of FMT in urethral fibroblasts. In conclusion, Igfbp3/Smad pathway appeared to be involved in the progression of urethral fibrosis. This finding suggested that Igfbp3/Smad might be an promising target for future research and treatment in this filed.
