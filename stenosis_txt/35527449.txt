Title: [Preliminary experience of surgical treatment for torus tubarius hypertrophy in children].

Abstract: Objective: To assess the incidence of symptomatic torus tubarius hypertrophy (TTH) in recurred OSA in children, and to explore the preliminary experience of partial resection of TTH assisted with radiofrequency ablation. Methods: From January 2004 to February 2020, 4 922 children, who diagnosed as OSA and received adenotonsillectomy at the Department of Otolaryngology, The 4th Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital, were retrospectively reviewed. There were 3 266 males and 1 656 females, the age ranged from 1 to 14 years old(median age of 5.0 years). Twenty-two cases were identified with recurrence of OSA syndrome, and the clinical data, including sex, age of primary operation, age of recurrence and presentation, and opertation methods were analyzed. Follow-up was carried out by outpatient visit or telephone. Graphpad prism 5.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Twenty-two cases were identified as recurred OSA and received revised surgery in 4 922 cases. Among these 22 cases, 11 cases were diagnosed as TTH resulting in an incidence of 2.23‰(11/4 922), 1 case was cicatricial adhesion on tubal torus (0.20‰, 1/4 922), 10 cases were residual adenoid combined with tubal tonsil hypertrophy (2.03‰, 10/4 922). Median age of primary operation was 3.0 years (range:2.4 to 6.0 years) in 11 TTH cases. Recurrent interval varied from 2 months to 5.5 years (2.4±1.9 years) after first operation. Age of revised partial resection of TTH was 7.0±2.7 years (range: 4.0 to 12.0 years). Average time interval between primary operation and revised operation was 3.5±2.1 years (range: 0.5 to 6.0 years). Individualized treatments were carried out based on partial resection of TTH assisted with radiofrequency ablation. All of 11 cases received satisfied therapeutic results without nasopharyngeal stenosis occured. Twenty-two cases were followed up for 1.6 to 13 years (median follow-up time was 6.2 years). Conclusions: TTH contributed to recurred OSA in child. TTH might be misdiagnosed as tubal tonsil hypertrophy. Partial resection of TTH assisted with radiofrequency ablation was a safty and effective treatment.
