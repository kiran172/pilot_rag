Title: Use of Large Balloon Catheter to Treat Infants With Pulmonary Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty is a safe and effective treatment for isolated pulmonary valve stenosis. Several balloon catheters are available for this procedure in neonates and infants. However, obtaining additional vascular access for the double-balloon technique in this population is troublesome, and tricuspid valve injury is a concern. We used a TMP PED balloon catheter to perform valvuloplasty in 2 infants with isolated pulmonary valve stenosis. This thin-walled, relatively large 12-mm balloon catheter can be delivered through a small-diameter sheath. In both cases, the transpulmonary pressure gradient was reduced without causing any valvular or vascular injuries. Neither patient had recurrent pulmonary valve stenosis. Together, these cases highlight the suitability and feasibility of using the 12-mm TMP PED balloon catheter for treating young infants with valvular stenosis.
