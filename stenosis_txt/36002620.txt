Title: Fluid dynamic assessment of positive end-expiratory pressure in a tracheostomy tube connector during respiration.

Abstract: High-flow oxygen therapy using a tracheostomy tube is a promising clinical approach to reduce the work of breathing in tracheostomized patients. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is usually applied during oxygen inflow to improve oxygenation by preventing end-expiratory lung collapse. However, much is still unknown about the geometrical effects of PEEP, especially regarding tracheostomy tube connectors (or adapters). Quantifying the degree of end-expiratory pressure (EEP) that takes patient-specific spirometry into account would be useful in this regard, but no such framework has been established yet. Thus, a platform to assess PEEP under respiration was developed, wherein three-dimensional simulation of airflow in a tracheostomy tube connector is coupled with a lumped lung model. The numerical model successfully reflected the magnitude of EEP measured experimentally using a lung phantom. Numerical simulations were further performed to quantify the effects of geometrical parameters on PEEP, such as inlet angles and rate of stenosis in the connector. Although sharp inlet angles increased the magnitude of EEP, they cannot be expected to achieve clinically reasonable PEEP. On the other hand, geometrical constriction in the connector can potentially result in PEEP as obtained with conventional nasal cannulae.
