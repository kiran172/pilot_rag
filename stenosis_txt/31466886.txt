Title: FFR<sub>CT</sub> and CT perfusion: A review on the evaluation of functional impact of coronary artery stenosis by cardiac CT.

Abstract: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is at the frontline of the diagnostic strategies to detect coronary artery disease (CAD). Anatomical information have proven to be insufficient to detect hemodynamic significant epicardial stenosis. In the present invited review we discuss on FFR<sub>CT</sub> and stress CTP, emerging technologies for an accurate and comprehensive evaluation of patients with suspected CAD, offering both anatomical (i.e. luminal and plaque) and functional assessment in one single technique.
