Title: Risk factors for instent restenosis of sirolimus-coated stents in coronary intervention for patients with unstable angina.

Abstract: To investigate the instent restenosis rate of sirolimus-coated stents in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and risk factors for in-stent restenosis, patients with unstable angina (UA) caused by coronary artery stenosis were enrolled, and all clinical and imaging data were analyzed. Among 143 enrolled patients with UA aged 35-83 (mean 60.9 ± 10.0) years enrolled, there were 114 (79.7%) male and 29 (20.3%) female patients. Arterial stenosis was present in one coronary artery in 6 (4.2%) patients, in two coronary arteries in 20 (14.0%) patients, in three arteries in 116 (81.1%), and in four coronary arteries in 1 (0.7%) patient. Stenting was successfully performed in all (100%) patients, and 181 stents were deployed. The quantitative flow ratio (QFR) was 0.92 ± 0.03 (range 0.84-0.96) immediately after stenting, and the TIMI was grade 3 in all patients. The diameter of the stents deployed ranged 2.25-4 mm (mean 3.04 ± 0.44) with a length ranging 10 mm to 104 mm (mean 32.73 ± 15.5). Follow-up angiography was performed in all patients with a duration of 1-92 (mean 15.0 ± 18.8) months. Instent restenosis ≥ 50% occurred in 25 (17.5%) patients. In univariate logistic regression analysis, significant (P < 0.05) risk factors for instent restenosis ≥ 50% were QFR (OR 0.036, 95% CI 0.13-0.97), stent diameter (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.18-0.92), hypertension (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.02-9.82), smoking (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.89), and neutrophil count (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.10-5.44). In multivariate analysis, QFR (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.002-0.19), stent diameter (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.005-0.59), hypertension (OR 6.75, 95% CI 1.83-35.72) and neutrophil count (OR 276.07, 95% CI 12.32-10,959.95) were significant (P < 0.05) independent risk factors for instent restenosis ≥ 50%. In conclusion, certain instent restenosis rates occurs after the sirolimus-eluted coronary stent deployment for the treatment of coronary artery stenosis in patients with UA, and quantitative flow ratio after stenting, stent diameter, hypertension, and neutrophil count are significant risk factors for instent restenosis of the sirolimus-coated stents in coronary intervention.
