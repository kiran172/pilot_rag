Title: Split right coronary artery and shepherd's crook course of direct origin of the conal artery: An unhitherto association in a case of rheumatic mitral stenosis.

Abstract: In a 47-year-old lady, planned for redo percutaneous mitral commissurotomy for recurrent mitral valve stenosis, there was incidental detection of splitting of right coronary artery and direct origin and shepherd's crook course of the conal artery. Though these two anomalies have no hemodynamic significance, correct nomenclature and potential clinical implications have been described.
