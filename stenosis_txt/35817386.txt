Title: Imaging Characteristics and Reintervention in Patients after Radiation Induced Carotid Artery Stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate and describe the radiographic imaging findings in a series of patients who underwent reintervention after radiation induced carotid artery stenting (RICAS).
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with prior RICAS and subsequent reintervention.
RESULTS: We describe 10 patients including 8 male and 2 female patients with 12 reinterventions due to prior diagnosed radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis and subsequent stenting during the period 2000-2019. The rate of reintervention was found to be 10%. The pattern of stenosis is unique to this patient population including specifically long-segment stenosis, proximal and distal to the stent location, which tends not to occur in the atherosclerotic patient population.
CONCLUSIONS: Careful surveillance after RICAS is necessary to assess for the risk and the unusual pattern of stenosis to offer reintervention in this high-risk patient population.
