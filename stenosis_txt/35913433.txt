Title: Evaluating Tools for Characterizing Anterior Urethral Stricture Disease: A Comparison of the LSE System and the Urethral Stricture Score.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We evaluated if scores generated by the LSE classification system and the Urethral Stricture Score system are associated with intraoperative surgical complexity and stricture recurrence risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all consenting patients who underwent single-stage anterior urethroplasty by a single surgeon at 2 institutions. Urethral Stricture Score and a numerical LSE "score" was calculated for each patient. Pearson's correlation and linear regression analyses were used to assess for a relationship between increasing Urethral Stricture Score and LSE score and surgical complexity. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess for an association between Urethral Stricture Score and LSE score and stricture recurrence risk.
RESULTS: A total of 187 patients with a mean age of 48 years (SD 16) and mean stricture length of 4.2 cm (SD 3.3) were included. Mean follow-up was 21 months. Forty-six patients recurred over time. We found a strong positive linear correlation between Urethral Stricture Score and LSE score (P &lt; .001). Both increasing Urethral Stricture Score and LSE score independently linearly correlated with increasing surgical complexity (both P &lt; .0001). Univariable analysis demonstrated that increasing LSE score was significantly associated with an increased risk of stricture recurrence (HR 1.2, P = .02) but Urethral Stricture Score was not. Patients with a high LSE score (â‰¥7) were nearly 3 times as likely to recur versus patients with a low LSE score (HR 2.7, P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing Urethral Stricture Score and LSE score are both associated with increasing surgical complexity, but only LSE score is associated with stricture recurrence risk. Conversion of the LSE classification system into a numeric score adds functionality to this novel system.
