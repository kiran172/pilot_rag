Title: Optimizing Physiotherapeutic Approaches in Parkinson's Disease Post-spinal Fixation Surgery: A Case Report.

Abstract: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit both a severe neuromuscular disorder and low bone quality at presentation. These issues are made worse by inactivity and a chairbound state. Each and every pathologic and degenerative process that affects the naturally aging spine also affects these individuals. Stooped posture is a symptom of a disease and can easily cause spinal degeneration. PD is associated with many physical abnormalities that cause a unique and specific need for rehabilitation. Patients' experiences highlight the challenges doctors face in diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. This case report details the rehabilitation of a 67-year-old patient with PD who underwent spinal fixation for spinal stenosis and presented with complaints of weakness in both lower limbs. An advanced rehabilitation program was devised, primarily emphasizing strength training to enhance overall functionality. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were conducted, encompassing range of motion (ROM), manual muscle testing (MMT), Oswestry Disability Index, Functional Independence Measure, Lower Limb Functional Scale, and Berg Balance Scale, all of which demonstrated noteworthy improvements in joints ROM, strength, functional independence, balance, and lower limb function. This case report underscores the significance of rehabilitation programs in such cases, highlighting their important role in enhancing overall functioning.
