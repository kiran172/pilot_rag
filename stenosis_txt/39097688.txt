Title: Outcomes of delayed tracheostomy among intubated patients during the coronavirus disease pandemic.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Respiratory distress and failure is a complication of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and tracheostomy may be necessary in cases of prolonged intubation in order to reduce mechanical ventilation duration. However, according to the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, which our institution applies, patients should not undergo tracheostomy unless cleared of the virus to reduce its spread among healthcare workers because tracheostomy is an aerosolized procedure. This study aimed to identify the outcomes of prolonged intubation in patients with and without COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy and to determine the morbidity and mortality rates in both groups.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit of King Fahad Hospital of the University, Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia, between March 1 and October 31, 2020. This study compared and analyzed the outcomes of delayed tracheostomy in patients with and without COVID-19 in terms of complication, morbidity, and mortality rates.
RESULTS: Of the 228 study participants, 111 (48.68%) had COVID-19. The mean age of the study participants was 58.67 years (SD = 17.36, max.=93, min.=20), and the majority were males (n = 149, 65.35%). Regarding tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19, 11 (9.91%) patients underwent tracheostomy; however, four (36.36%) of them had prolonged intubation. The mean intensive care unit admission length of stay for tracheostomy patients was 37.17 days, while it was 12.09 days for patients without tracheostomy (t(226)=-9.32, p < 0.001). Regarding prolonged intubation among patients with COVID-19 (n = 7, 6.31%), the complications were as follows: six people (85.71%) had dysphonia, one (14.29%) had vocal cord granuloma, and two (28.57%) had subglottic tracheal stenosis. The mortality rate among our study participants was 51.32%, and the risk was significantly higher in older people (Odds ratio = 1.04, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.02-1.06) and in delayed tracheostomy cases (OR = 2.95, 95% CI = 1.31-6.63). However, COVID-19 status was not significantly related to the risk of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Delaying tracheostomy increases the risk of mortality. Therefore, we recommend weighing the risks and benefits for each patient to benefit both healthcare workers and patients with COVID-19.
