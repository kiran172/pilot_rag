Title: Analysis identifying minimal governing parameters for clinically accurate in silico fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Personalized hemodynamic models can accurately compute fractional flow reserve (FFR) from coronary angiograms and clinical measurements (FFR  baseline    ), but obtaining patient-specific data could be challenging and sometimes not feasible. Understanding which measurements need to be patient-tuned vs. patient-generalized would inform models with minimal inputs that could expedite data collection and simulation pipelines.
AIMS: To determine the minimum set of patient-specific inputs to compute FFR using invasive measurement of FFR (FFR  invasive    ) as gold standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Personalized coronary geometries ( N = 50 ) were derived from patient coronary angiograms. A computational fluid dynamics framework, FFR  baseline    , was parameterized with patient-specific inputs: coronary geometry, stenosis geometry, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, hematocrit, and distal pressure location. FFR  baseline    was validated against FFR  invasive    and used as the baseline to elucidate the impact of uncertainty on personalized inputs through global uncertainty analysis. FFR  streamlined    was created by only incorporating the most sensitive inputs and FFR  semi-streamlined   additionally included patient-specific distal location.
RESULTS: FFR  baseline    was validated against FFR  invasive    via correlation ( r = 0.714 , p &lt; 0.001 ), agreement (mean difference: 0.01 ± 0.09 ), and diagnostic performance (sensitivity: 89.5%, specificity: 93.6%, PPV: 89.5%, NPV: 93.6%, AUC: 0.95). FFR  semi-streamlined   provided identical diagnostic performance with FFR  baseline    . Compared to FFR  baseline    vs. FFR  invasive    , FFR  streamlined    vs. FFR  invasive    had decreased correlation ( r = 0.64 , p &lt; 0.001 ), improved agreement (mean difference: 0.01 ± 0.08 ), and comparable diagnostic performance (sensitivity: 79.0%, specificity: 90.3%, PPV: 83.3%, NPV: 87.5%, AUC: 0.90).
CONCLUSION: Streamlined models could match the diagnostic performance of the baseline with a full gamut of patient-specific measurements. Capturing coronary hemodynamics depended most on accurate geometry reconstruction and cardiac output measurement.
