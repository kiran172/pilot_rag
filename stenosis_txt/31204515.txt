Title: Fluctuating patency of atherosclerotic cervical internal carotid artery treated by carotid endarterectomy successfully: a case report.

Abstract: Spontaneous recanalization of an atherosclerotic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion has been previously reported as a rare phenomenon, but spontaneous re-occlusion shortly after recanalization under antiplatelet therapy has not been documented yet. A 63-year-old man presented with impaired consciousness and left-sided hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed new infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory because of right cervical internal carotid artery occlusion, which became spontaneously patent on computed tomography angiography on the sixth day of admission. So carotid endarterectomy was planned. However, the ICA was recurrently occluded on the preoperative magnetic resonance angiogram three weeks later on admission, which condition was also confirmed during the subsequent surgery. In patients with severe ICA stenosis, patency may dynamically change even under antiplatelet therapy.
