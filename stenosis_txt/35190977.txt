Title: Can computed tomography-antral wall thickness predict response to endoscopic balloon dilation in patients with caustic-induced gastric outlet obstruction?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Caustic-induced gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) remains one of the important causes of long-term morbidity in patients with caustic ingestion. Though endoscopic balloon dilation is an effective modality, response to caustic GOO is poorer as compared to peptic stricture. Computed tomography (CT)-antral wall thickness (AWT) has not been previously explored to predict the procedural success in patients with caustic GOO.
METHODS: In a retrospective single-center study of prospectively maintained database, all patients with symptomatic caustic GOO who underwent CT scan prior to endoscopic balloon dilation were included. Gastric AWT was measured at the site of maximum visible thickness on CT scan. Details regarding caustic ingestion and endoscopic dilation were retrieved. Patients were divided into two groups, based on CT-AWT (< or ≥9 mm) and compared for outcome measures.
RESULTS: Mean age of included patients (n=35) was 33.51 ± 13.65 years and 22 were male. Procedural success was achieved in 29 (82.85%) patients. Number of mean dilation sessions required were 5.28 ± 2.96 for achieving procedural success. The mean CT-AWT was 10.73 ± 2.80 mm (range 4-18 mm). There was no significant association between the CT-AWT and the number of dilations and procedural success. On univariate analysis, size of the first balloon used was a predictor of refractory stricture (p=0.011). However, no other factors predicted either refractory stricture or procedural success.
CONCLUSION: There is no additional role of CT-AWT in predicting response to endoscopic balloon dilation or to predict refractory stricture in patients with caustic GOO.
