Title: Of aortic valve and bleeding: Heyde's syndrome.

Abstract: An 80-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis presented with relapsing enterorrhagia and severe anemia. A video capsule pan-endoscopy showed multiple sites of complex mucosal angiodysplasia in the jejunum. Direct hemostatic treatment of accessible angiodysplasia was done with argon plasma coagulation, and the patient was urgently referred for trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). At follow-up 1 month and 3 months later, she was doing well with no further episodes of bleeding. Heyde's syndrome is referred to as the association of aortic stenosis, gastrointestinal angiodysplasia, bleeding, and anemia. It is an acquired type2A von Willebrand syndrome caused by the proteolysis and loss of the largest polymers of vWF due to the high shear forces generated through the stenotic aortic valve. The qualitative and quantitative vWF defects play a central role in the angiogenesis and development of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia The vWF abnormalities are closely associated with the hemodynamic severity of the aortic valve stenosis. Valve replacement is the pivotal strategy to achieve the long-term resolution of bleeding recurrences. TAVR is a valuable option particularly in high-risk patients for whom surgical valve replacement is not feasible.
