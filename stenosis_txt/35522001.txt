Title: Successful surgical aortic valve replacement in a patient with progeria.

Abstract: The progeroid syndrome includes a group of rare, severe genetic disorders clinically characterized by premature physical ageing. Severe aortic stenosis has been described in progeria patients, but no previous surgical aortic valve replacement was reported. We describe a successful surgical aortic valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass grafting in a progeria patient with severe aortic stenosis and a small aortic annulus.
