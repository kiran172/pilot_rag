Title: Mid-term effect of balloon aortic valvuloplasty on mitral regurgitation in aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) offers an alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement in elderly and frail patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) for whom there are no other effective options. We aimed to investigate the mid-term effect of BAV on mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with severe AS.
METHODS: Our analysis was based on the data from 83 patients with severe AS (mean age, 86 ± 5 years; female, 68) treated using BAV. Echocardiography was performed before the procedure and at 1 and 3 months after. MR was quantified by measuring the MR jet area, with more-than-moderate MR being clinically significant.
RESULTS: Forty patients were classified in this group (MR group). Significant reduction of MR was observed in the MR group at 1 month and 3 months after procedure, with no improvement in patients in the non-MR group. At 3 months, 15 of the 40 patients in the MR group still had significant MR, with the change at 1 month in the left ventricular end-systolic dimension (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05-1.76; P = 0.022) and MR jet area (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.16-3.29; P = 0.012) being predictive of persisting significant MR at 3 months after BAV. The prevalence of New York Heart Association functional class III or IV decreased at 1 and 3 months after BAV in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: BAV provides a useful therapeutic strategy for elderly patients with severe AS who are not candidates for surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement, especially in those with significant MR.
