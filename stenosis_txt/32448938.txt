Title: Comparison of infective endocarditis risk between balloon and self-expandable valves following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: This study aimed to compare incidence of IE between BE and SE valves by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. We comprehensively searched the databases of MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to November 2019. Included studies were published observational studies that compared the risk of IE among patients undergoing TAVR employing BE versus SE valves, using the random-effects to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Ten cohort studies from April 2013 to November 2019 were included in this meta-analysis involving 13,478 subjects (6289 SE and 7189 BE types). Our study showed no statistical difference in IE rates between each type of valves (pooled OR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.68-1.35, p = 0.801 with I2 = 14.7%).Â There was no difference in IE rate between BE and SE valves following TAVR. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings.
