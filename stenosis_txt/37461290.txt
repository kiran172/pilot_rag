Title: Efficacy and safety of fetal posterior cerebral artery stented coil embolization for fetal posterior cerebral aneurysms.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Aneurysms at the origin of the fetal posterior cerebral artery (fPCA) often show fPCA bifurcation from the aneurysm dome, impeding complete embolization and dense coil packing. The recanalization rate for fPCA aneurysms is therefore high. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stenting into fPCA for aneurysms with fPCA incorporated into the aneurysm to determine whether stenting can provide effective embolization results and prevent recanalization.
METHODS: A total of 19 consecutive coil embolization procedures between February 2012 and June 2022 for unruptured fPCA aneurysms with fPCA branching from the dome of the aneurysm were divided into two groups: non-stenting (NS) group (n = 11) and stenting into fPCA (PS) group (n = 8). Data were obtained retrospectively and compared regarding embolization results, complications, and recanalization.
RESULTS: Compared with the NS group, the PS group achieved significantly higher complete occlusion rate and packing density (p < 0.001, p = 0.01, respectively). No symptomatic complications were observed in the PS group. Both immediately after stenting and at the 1-year follow-up, no stent kinking, stenosis, occlusion, or malposition were observed in any patients in the PS group. During 1-year follow-up, the cumulative minor and major recanalization-free rate after coil embolization for fPCA aneurysms were significantly higher in the PS group compared with the NS group (p = 0.022, 0.0024, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Stenting into fPCA for aneurysms with fPCA incorporated into the aneurysm achieved high-density complete embolization without increasing complications, and prevented recanalization. The fPCA stent-assisted coil embolization can offer an alternative treatment for fPCA aneurysms.
