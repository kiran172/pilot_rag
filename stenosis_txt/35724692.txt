Title: Comparison of focal cryoballoon ablation with 10- and 8-second doses for treatment of Barrett's esophagus-related neoplasia: results from a prospective European multicenter study (with video).

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Focal cryoballoon ablation (FCBA) is currently being investigated for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus (BE)-related neoplasia in a European multicenter study (Euro-Coldplay study). After inclusion of 28 of 107 patients, the initial dose of 10 seconds was lowered to 8 seconds. The current study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of a single FCBA treatment session with 10 seconds versus 8 seconds.
METHODS: Treatments were performed at 7 European BE referral centers. All 28 patients treated with 10 seconds were compared with 28 consecutive patients treated with 8 seconds. The gastroesophageal junction was ablated circumferentially followed by all visible BE. To assess efficacy and safety, 3 expert adjudicators, blinded to physician and dose, compared pre- and post-treatment images. Primary outcomes were median BE surface regression and stricture rate after single-session FCBA.
RESULTS: We included 56 patients (10-second cohort, n = 28; 8-second cohort, n = 28) with a median BE length of C0M2 (Prague classification). Baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between the cohorts. The median BE surface regression after a single FCBA session was comparable for 10 seconds and 8 seconds (80% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 75-90] and 80% [95% CI, 66-90], respectively; P = .65). Strictures requiring dilation were seen in 19% (95% CI, 4-33) and 15% (95% CI, 4-30) of the 10-second and 8-second groups, respectively (P = 1.00). Two patients in the 10-second group developed a severe stricture requiring >3 dilations.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with limited BE, single-session FCBA with 8 seconds showed similar BE surface regression as compared with 10 seconds and may theoretically result in fewer and less severe strictures. Therefore, we suggest using 8 seconds as the standard dose for FCBA. (Clinical trial registration number: NL7253.).
