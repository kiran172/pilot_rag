Title: When Arteria lusoria meets Truncus bicaroticus: one of the rarest combinations of aortic arch anomalies.

Abstract: The Arteria lusoria or aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) constitutes one of the rarest malformations of the aortic arch, it can be associated with other congenital anomalies of the heart and large vessels, in particular the bi-carotid trunk or common origin of the carotid arteries (COCA) which is the presence of a single branch from the aorta giving off both right and left common carotid arteries. We report the case of a patient followed for severe mitral stenosis, and hospitalized for an ischemic cerebral vascular accident, a chest CT scan was performed in front of her clinical and biological degradation, which allowed the fortuitous discovery of an Arteria lusoria (aberrant retro-esophagealartery) associated with a Truncus bicaroticus.
