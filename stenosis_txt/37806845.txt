Title: Multimodality assessment of high- vs. low-gradient aortic stenosis using echocardiography and cardiac CT.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve area (AVA) using CT-LVOT area (AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub>) &lt;1.2 ​cm2 has been shown comparable to echocardiography AVA of &lt;1.0 ​cm2 for severe aortic stenosis (AS). Current study evaluates how AS diagnosis will be affected when we substitute CT-LVOT with echo derived LVOT.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 367 patients who underwent cardiac CTA and echocardiogram for assessment of high- and low-gradient AS (HG-AS and LG-AS). AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> was derived from CT-LVOT area and echo doppler data. Three AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> categories were created (&lt;1.0, 1.0-1.2 and ​&gt; ​1.2 ​cm2). Outcomes were defined as composite of all-cause mortality and/or valve intervention.
RESULTS: Median echocardiographic profiles were consistent with severe AS across three AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> categories for HG-AS. HG-AS patients with AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> &gt;1.2 ​cm2 had larger median CT-LVOT area (5.06 ​cm2) and AVC (2917AU). Among LG-AS with AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> ​≤1.2 cm2, 57% met echo criteria for low-flow LG-AS and 63% met criteria for severe AS using aortic valve calcium (AVC). Additionally, 45% with AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> &gt;1.2 ​cm2 had larger median CT-LVOT area (5.43 ​cm2) and AVC (2389AU). Patients with AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> &gt;1.2 ​cm2 and high AVC had large body surface area and were mostly characterized as severe with indexed AVA and AVC. Stroke volume index using CT-LVOT reclassified 70% of low-flow, LG-AS as normal flow, LG-AS. Composite outcomes were higher among patients with AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> ≤1.2 ​cm2 (p ​&lt; ​0.01), however, with no superior net reclassification improvement compared to AVA<sub>echo</sub> &lt;1.0 ​cm2.
CONCLUSION: AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> ≤1.2 ​cm2 is a reasonable CT criterion for severe AS. Large LVOT with elevated AVC identified a severe AS phenotype despite an AVA<sub>CT-LVOT</sub> &gt;1.2 ​cm2, best characterized by indexed AVA and AVC.
