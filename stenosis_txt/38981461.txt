Title: Prevalence and Factors Associated with Carotid Stenosis in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Among stroke patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), it is not uncommon to identify carotid atherosclerosis. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of, and factors associated with, carotid atherosclerosis among patients with AF and acute ischemic stroke.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospectively collected data from consecutive patients with anterior ischemic stroke and AF who underwent carotid imaging from 10 stroke registries were categorized retrospectively according to the degree of stenosis in: no atherosclerosis, stenosis &lt;50%, stenosis ≥50%, and occlusion. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with ipsilateral carotid atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: Among 2,955 patients with ischemic stroke and AF, carotid atherosclerosis was evident in 1,022 (34.6%) patients, while carotid stenosis ≥50% and occlusion were identified in 204 (6.9%) and 168 (5.7%) patients, respectively. Ipsilateral carotid stenosis ≥50% or occlusion was associated with higher age (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.32, per decade), previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.29-2.25), peripheral artery disease (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.23-2.78), coronary artery disease (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.16-2.04), and statin treatment on admission (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.01-1.67). Patients with lacunar stroke had a lower likelihood of stenosis ≥50% or occlusion (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.13-0.68). Compared to the absence of atherosclerotic disease, atherosclerosis in one and two arterial beds was associated with the identification of ipsilateral carotid stenosis (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.22-2.98 and OR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.85-5.49, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Among acute ischemic stroke patients with AF, 1 out of 3 had ipsilateral carotid atherosclerosis, and 1 out of 8 had ipsilateral carotid stenosis ≥50% or occlusion. Atherosclerosis in two arterial beds was the most important predictor for the identification of ipsilateral carotid stenosis. Among ischemic stroke patients with AF, carotid atherosclerosis is common, while carotid imaging should not be overlooked, especially in those with coronary or/and peripheral artery disease.
