Title: [Spinal neurosurgery: radiculopathy and myelopathy].

Abstract: The field of spinal neurosurgery covers degenerative conditions and trauma as well as tumors, malformations and vascular disorders of spine and spinal cord. This article focuses on the Swedish spinal neurosurgical care regarding radiculopathy and myelopathy. Disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression due to degenerative disorders or tumors are discussed. Treatment options such as anterior cervical decompression and fusion, posterior forami-notomy, laminectomy and approaches to spinal intradural tumors are briefly presented. The aim is to present symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options of common conditions to facilitate early detection and referral to neurosurgical centers to avoid delayed dia-gnosis and neurological impairment.
