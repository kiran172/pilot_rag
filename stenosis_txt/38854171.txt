Title: Revolutionizing Relief: Cervical Radiculopathy With Neurological Deficits Rescued by Cervical Disc Replacement.

Abstract: Cervical radiculopathy is a common condition characterized by neck pain radiating to the upper and lower limbs, often accompanied by tingling sensations, numbness, and weakness. We present the case of a 32-year-old male who presented with left-sided cervical radiculopathy and neurological deficits. Clinical examination revealed left C5/C6/C7 hypoesthesia, diminished grip strength, reduced power in the left upper and lower extremities, and a positive Spurling test. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed multilevel cervical disc herniations at C4-C5 and C5-C6 levels, resulting in stenosis. The patient underwent anterior cervical discectomies with artificial disc replacement (cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA)) at the C5-C6 level. The surgical procedure was uneventful, and the patient experienced prompt relief from neurological symptoms within two weeks postoperatively. Follow-up radiographs at one week post-surgery demonstrated a preserved range of motion at each operated level with the artificial disc in situ. This case highlights the successful management of cervical radiculopathy with neurological deficits using anterior cervical discectomy and artificial disc replacement. The timely intervention led to the resolution of symptoms and restoration of function, demonstrating the efficacy of this surgical approach in alleviating radicular symptoms and preserving cervical spine mobility. Further studies and long-term follow-up are warranted to validate the long-term outcomes and durability of artificial disc replacement in such cases.
