Title: Predicting the presence of coronary plaques featuring high-risk characteristics using polygenic risk scores and targeted proteomics in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The presence of coronary plaques with high-risk characteristics is strongly associated with adverse cardiac events beyond the identification of coronary stenosis. Testing by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) enables the identification of high-risk plaques (HRP). Referral for CCTA is presently based on pre-test probability estimates including clinical risk factors (CRFs); however, proteomics and/or genetic information could potentially improve patient selection for CCTA and, hence, identification of HRP. We aimed to (1) identify proteomic and genetic features associated with HRP presence and (2) investigate the effect of combining CRFs, proteomics, and genetics to predict HRP presence.
METHODS: Consecutive chest pain patients (n = 1462) undergoing CCTA to diagnose obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were included. Coronary plaques were assessed using a semi-automatic plaque analysis tool. Measurements of 368 circulating proteins were obtained with targeted Olink panels, and DNA genotyping was performed in all patients. Imputed genetic variants were used to compute a multi-trait multi-ancestry genome-wide polygenic score (GPS<sub>Mult</sub>). HRP presence was defined as plaques with two or more high-risk characteristics (low attenuation, spotty calcification, positive remodeling, and napkin ring sign). Prediction of HRP presence was performed using the glmnet algorithm with repeated fivefold cross-validation, using CRFs, proteomics, and GPS<sub>Mult</sub> as input features.
RESULTS: HRPs were detected in 165 (11%) patients, and 15 input features were associated with HRP presence. Prediction of HRP presence based on CRFs yielded a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) ± standard error of 73.2 ± 0.1, versus 69.0 ± 0.1 for proteomics and 60.1 ± 0.1 for GPS<sub>Mult</sub>. Combining CRFs with GPS<sub>Mult</sub> increased prediction accuracy (AUC 74.8 ± 0.1 (P = 0.004)), while the inclusion of proteomics provided no significant improvement to either the CRF (AUC 73.2 ± 0.1, P = 1.00) or the CRF + GPS<sub>Mult</sub> (AUC 74.6 ± 0.1, P = 1.00) models, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected CAD, incorporating genetic data with either clinical or proteomic data improves the prediction of high-risk plaque presence.
