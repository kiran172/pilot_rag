Title: Beyond VICs: Shedding light on the overlooked VECs in calcific aortic valve disease.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is prevalent in developed nations and has emerged as a pressing global public health concern due to population aging. The precise etiology of this disease remains uncertain, and recent research has primarily focused on examining the role of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) in the development of CAVD. The predominant treatment options currently available involve open surgery and minimally invasive interventional surgery, with no efficacious pharmacological treatment. This article seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of valvular endothelial cells (VECs) from the aspects of valvular endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), valvular endothelial mechanotransduction, valvular endothelial injury, valvular endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and valvular neovascularization, which have received less attention, and aims to establish their role and interaction with VICs in CAVD. The ultimate goal is to provide new perspectives for the investigation of non-invasive treatment options for this disease.
