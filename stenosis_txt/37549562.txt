Title: Generation of iPSC line NCHi012-A from a patient with Alagille syndrome and heterozygous pathogenic variant in the JAG1 gene.

Abstract: Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is an autosomal dominant disease affecting the liver, heart and other organs with high variability. About 95% of ALGS cases are associated with pathogenic variants in JAG1, encoding the Jagged1 ligand that binds to Notch receptors. The iPSC line NCHi012-A was derived from an ALGS patient with cholestatic liver disease and mild pulmonary stenosis, who is heterozygous for a 2â€¯bp deletion in the JAG1 coding sequence. We report here an initial characterization of NCHi012-A to evaluate its morphology, pluripotency, differentiation potential, genotype, karyotype and identity to the source patient.
