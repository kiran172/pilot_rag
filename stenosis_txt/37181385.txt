Title: Can Most Calcified Coronary Stenosis Be Optimized With Coronary Intravascular Lithotripsy?

Abstract: Intravascular lithotripsy can be used as an effective therapy for lesion preparation in severely calcified lesions. The mechanism, as shown by optical coherence tomography, is calcium fractures. The aforementioned modification is performed with minimal risk of perforation, no-reflow and a low incidence of flow-limiting dissection and myocardial infarctions. Other techniques, such as cutting or scoring balloons and rotational atherectomy have also been shown to increase luminal diameter, but other complications, such as distal embolization, induced by these treatment modalities, are a source of concern. This review describes a single-center study of all-comer patients, including those with complex characteristics. This therapy is very effective, with a very low risk of complications. In this article, we characterize the mechanism of action of the intravascular lithotripsy catheter, its optical coherence tomography validation, clinical applications, and comparison with other calcium-modifying technologies, as well as future directions, which can be used to improve the technology.
