Title: The Reliability of the Arabic Version of the Dyspnea Index Questionnaire for Upper Airway-Related Dyspnea.

Abstract: Objectives This study aimed to translate the Dyspnea Index (DI) questionnaire into the Arabic language and determine whether this version is valid and reliable for Arabic-speaking patients with upper airway-related dyspnea. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the King Saud University Medical City otolaryngology clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The DI questionnaire was translated into Arabic and then back-translated into the English language. Inclusion criteria were preoperative patients presenting to the otolaryngology clinic with upper airway-related dyspnea between November and December 2020. The results of internal consistency and factor analysis among the items were compared to the original DI development results to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. Results Among a total of 57 recruited patients, 50 questionnaires were completed with an 88% response rate. The mean age of the included patients was 38 ±14 years. Women constituted 58% of the patients. The most common diagnosis was subglottic stenosis (72%). Principle component extraction in factor analysis revealed a single underlying factor for all the questions. Factor loading ranged from 0.69 to 0.85. Reliability statistics showed a high value of internal consistency among the items. The mean inter-item correlation was 0.58. Conclusion Based on our findings, the Arabic version of the DI questionnaire is a reliable instrument for evaluating upper airway dyspnea.
