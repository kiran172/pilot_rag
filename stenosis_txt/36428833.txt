Title: Incidental Vascular Findings in Computed Tomography Performed in the Qualification for the TAVI Procedure.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now a very widespread treatment method for symptomatic and severe aortic stenosis as an alternative for patients at intermediate or high risk of surgery or contraindications to surgery. The key role of imaging examinations before TAVI is to assess the morphology of the aortic valve, the routes of surgical access, and non-cardiac and extravascular structures. The objective of this article is to present and discuss the importance of selected accidental vascular findings in computed tomography examinations of the heart and large vessels performed in the TAVI qualification procedure: persistent left superior vena cava (SVC) with absent right SVC, right aortic arch, ectopic right coronary artery ostium, and left superior pulmonary vein draining into left brachiocephalic vein.
