Title: Novel use of the double kissing crush technique to stent complex pulmonary artery stenosis in a child with Alagille syndrome.

Abstract: Coronary bifurcation lesions and treatment with two-stent techniques have been developed, including the double kissing (DK) crush technique. The use of this technique in children or noncoronary vessels, including pulmonary arteries, has not been described. We present a 12-year-old girl with Alagille syndrome, a ventricular septal defect (VSD), and complex bilateral pulmonary artery (PA) stenoses who is status post six catheterizations for PA angioplasty and stenting to improve her marked right ventricular hypertension. With collaboration between the congenital and structural teams, she successfully underwent the DK crush technique for a complex lesion in her PA. This improved pulmonary flow and allowed for successful surgical VSD closure.
