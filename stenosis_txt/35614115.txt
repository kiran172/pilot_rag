Title: Preclinical evaluation of endoscopic placement of a steroid-eluting metal stent in an in vivo porcine benign biliary stricture model.

Abstract: Treatment of benign biliary strictures (BBS) using fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) has a high success rate, but recurrence can occur. Corticosteroids may be useful based on their anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid-eluting FCSEMS in an animal model. BBSs were created by radiofrequency ablation in 12 mini-pigs. Four weeks later, FCSEMS coated with 0 mg (control), 15 mg (steroid 1 × group), or 30 mg (steroid 2 × group) triamcinolone were inserted endoscopically. The in vitro drug release assay revealed that the optimal stent had 15 mg of triamcinolone and a hydrophilic membrane. No transmural necrosis or perforation occurred in any animal. Fibrous wall thickness tended to decrease macroscopically and microscopically in a triamcinolone dose-dependent manner (control vs. steroid 2 × group: 773.1 vs. 468.5 µm, P = 0.037). Thickness also decreased over time in the steroid 2 × group (3 days vs. 4 weeks: 907.9 vs. 468.5 µm, P = 0.025). Blood parameters tended to improve after stent insertion. In a porcine BBS model, steroid-eluting FCSEMS showed potential as a safe and effective treatment modality to reduce fibrotic tissue. Studies are required to confirm their safety and efficacy in humans with refractory BBS.
