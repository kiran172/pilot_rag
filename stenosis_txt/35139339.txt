Title: On the possibility of photodynamic inactivation of tracheobronchial tree pathogenic microbiota using methylene blue (in vitro study).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients after mechanical ventilation of lungs suffering from a multi-species infection of the tracheobronchial tree can be complicated.. The situation is aggravated in patients with post-intubation tracheal stenosis, where infection plays a leading pathogenetic role in damage to the tracheal wall. As a result of such a pathological process, cicatricial stenosis of the trachea of purulent-inflammatory infectious genesis or infected tracheal stenosis (ITS) may occur.
METHODS: In this work, we studied the possibility of photodynamic inactivation of pathogenic microbiota typical for patients with ITS using methylene blue (MB) as a photosensitizer.
RESULTS: 13 clinical isolates of 8 species of bacteria from 9 patients were susceptible to photodynamic inactivation with MB. 30 μM of MB at a light irradiation dose of 25 J/cm2 and incubation with MB for 15 min allows to completely inactivate bacteria found in the tracheobronchial secretions of patients with ITS.
CONCLUSIONS: MB retains its optico-physical properties in the range of 3-30 μM and provides effective inactivation of isolated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multi- and pan-resistant to antibiotics.
