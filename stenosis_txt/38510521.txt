Title: Endovascular Approach in Treating Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) is a significant medical condition that results from a lack of adequate blood flow to the posterior circulation of the brain. The first-line treatment involves the use of antiplatelet therapy, but in cases where patients are not responsive to drug therapy, surgical management is the next viable option. In the past, open endarterectomy was the preferred surgical approach for treating critical VBI patients. However, due to its high mortality rates and severe peri-procedural complications, its usage has decreased. Instead, the endovascular approach has emerged as an alternative surgical option for resolving VBI. This review explores the current literature to assess the effectiveness of endovascular interventions in treating VBI patients. It also highlights potential complications and adverse effects associated with these treatments while identifying gaps in the current research that warrant further investigation. The review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to extensively search relevant literature on endovascular approaches for treating VBI patients on PubMed, BioMed Central, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The findings suggest that endovascular treatments have demonstrated significant technical success in treating VBI, with low mortality rates and minor adverse effects, such as intracranial hemorrhage and restenosis. The overall incidence of these complications is relatively low. Combining medical therapies with endovascular interventions has improved outcomes and reduced restenosis rates. However, there are methodological limitations and inconsistencies in the current literature that necessitate further investigation. Future research should focus on larger, randomized clinical trials and direct comparisons with other treatment options to obtain more conclusive evidence.
