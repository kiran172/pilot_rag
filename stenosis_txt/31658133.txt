Title: Anatomical features and clinical outcome of a honeycomb-like structure in the coronary artery: reports from 16 consecutive patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recanalization of thrombus in coronary artery tree is defined as a honeycomb-like structure. However, the anatomic features and appropriate treatment of honeycomb-like structure still remain largely unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2014 July and 2017 December, 17 honeycomb-like structure in 16 patients based on optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound were included. Fractional flow reserve was measured for patients who had thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 3. Angiographic and optical coherence tomography/intravascular ultrasound-derived variables were studied. Clinical events (until to 2018 December) were collected. Honeycomb-like structures mostly involved left anterior descending artery (68.8%) and localized at proximal-mid (88.2%) segment of vessels. Eight patients had a side branch â‰¥ 2 mm in diameter taking from honeycomb-like structure. Only one patient had a normal fractional flow reserve. Fifteen patients underwent implantation of a stent. Stent implantation was associated with side branch compromise or closure (4 in each). Of 4 patients with side branch closure, all had a creatine kinase myocardial band > 5 times increase in hospital, with 3 deaths and 1 target lesion revascularization during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of recanalization, most honeycomb-like structure lesion have a positive fractional flow reserve. Further study is required to address how to protect a large side branch taking from honeycomb-like structure.
