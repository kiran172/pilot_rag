Title: A single centre experience on the formation of double barrelled uro-colostomy in pelvic exenteration surgery: a cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Double barrelled uro-colostomy (DBUC) is an alternative to traditional ileal conduit (IC) and separate colostomy in patients requiring simultaneous urinary and faecal diversion for reconstruction in pelvic exenteration surgery (PES).
METHODS: This cohort study evaluated short- and long-term morbidity and mortality associated with DBUC formation in 20 consecutive adult patients undergoing PES in an Australian Complex Pelvic Surgical Unit. Data were obtained from a prospective database.
RESULTS: Mean age 59 years (range 27-76 years). PES was performed for malignant disease in 18 patients (curative intent in 17). Mean operative duration 11.8 h (range 7-17 h). Mean follow-up duration 29.1 months (range 2.6-90.1 months). Early DBUC-related complications occurred in four patients (20.0%): urinary tract infection (UTI)/urosepsis (n = 4) and early ureteric stenosis requiring intervention (n = 1). Late DBUC-related complications occurred in five patients (25.0%): recurrent UTI/urosepsis (n = 4), chronic kidney disease (n = 4), ureteric stenosis (n = 2) and parastomal hernia (n = 4). No mortality occurred secondary to a DBUC complication.
CONCLUSION: DBUC is a safe reconstructive option with acceptable morbidity profile in patients requiring simultaneous urinary and faecal diversion.
