Title: A Case Report on Fibromuscular Dysplasia With Extrarenal Involvement.

Abstract: Fibromuscular dysplasia is a vascular disorder characterized by nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory arterial abnormalities, primarily affecting renal arteries. While extrarenal involvement is rare, it poses diagnostic challenges due to diverse clinical presentations. We present the case of a middle-aged female who presented with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain and hypertension. Physical examination revealed tenderness, guarding, and hypertensive urgency. Diagnostic workup, including laboratory investigations and computed tomography, identified multifocal arterial stenosis in both renal and mesenteric arteries, consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia. A multidisciplinary team initiated antihypertensive medications and performed angioplasty to address vascular stenosis. The patient showed significant improvement post intervention, highlighting the efficacy of a comprehensive management strategy. This case underscores the clinical complexities of fibromuscular dysplasia, emphasizing the diagnostic challenges posed by extrarenal manifestations. The successful multidisciplinary intervention highlights the importance of timely and targeted measures in addressing both renal and extrarenal complications.
