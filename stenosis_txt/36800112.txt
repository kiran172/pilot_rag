Title: Diagnostic performance of deep learning-based vessel extraction and stenosis detection on coronary computed tomography angiography for coronary artery disease: a multi-reader multi-case study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Post-processing and interpretation of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) imaging are time-consuming and dependent on the reader's experience. An automated deep learning (DL)-based imaging reconstruction and diagnosis system was developed to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
METHODS: Our study including 374 cases from five sites, inviting 12 radiologists, assessed the DL-based system in diagnosing obstructive coronary disease with regard to diagnostic performance, imaging post-processing and reporting time of radiologists, with invasive coronary angiography as a standard reference. The diagnostic performance of DL system and DL-assisted human readers was compared with the traditional method of human readers without DL system.
RESULTS: Comparing the diagnostic performance of human readers without DL system versus with DL system, the AUC was improved from 0.81 to 0.82 (p < 0.05) at patient level and from 0.79 to 0.81 (p < 0.05) at vessel level. An increase in AUC was observed in inexperienced radiologists (p < 0.05), but was absent in experienced radiologists. Regarding diagnostic efficiency, comparing the DL system versus human reader, the average post-processing and reporting time was decreased from 798.60 s to 189.12 s (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of using DL system alone were 93.55% and 59.57% at patient level and 83.23% and 79.97% at vessel level, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: With the DL system serving as a concurrent reader, the overall post-processing and reading time was substantially reduced. The diagnostic accuracy of human readers, especially for inexperienced readers, was improved. DL-assisted human reader had the potential of being the reading mode of choice in clinical routine.
