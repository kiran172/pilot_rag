Title: Endoscopic management of stricturing Crohn's disease.

Abstract: The natural history of Crohn's disease (CD) usually begins with primary intestinal inflammation, which progresses gradually to stricturing lesions. Stricture is a complicated, intractable but very common clinical problem in the management of CD. Difficulties remain in treating stricturing CD because of the limited efficacy of drug therapy and relapse of stricturing lesions cannot be completely avoided by surgery. Endoscopic management is a bridging therapy between drug therapy and surgical intervention, mainly including endoscopic balloon dilatation and endoscopic stricturotomy, and has been found to be effective for treating stricturing CD. Its explicit curative effect, less invasiveness and high safety performance make endoscopic management more acceptable by both the physician and patient. Although some patients require repeated endoscopic treatment and ultimately cannot avoid surgery, yet it can significantly delay the time to surgery and improve the quality of life. Physicians carrying out the endoscopic procedure need to be trained for performing this procedure. In this review we summarized the diagnosis and endoscopic treatment of stricturing CD.
