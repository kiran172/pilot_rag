Title: [Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in a Large Aortic Annulus: A Case Report].

Abstract: In patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (SAS), who are at high surgical risk and who require transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), anatomic factors can determine if patients are suitable for this technique. A very large aortic annulus is a technical challenge given the limited options of adequate valve sizes, and, in most of them, using them in this type of patient is an off-label indication. We present the case of a 59-year-old man with symptomatic ASOS with surgical risk secondary to chronic liver damage referred for TAVI with an aortic annulus greater than 900 mm2. A Myval #32 valve was implanted with overexpansion without complications and early discharge.
