Title: Canine infantile left ventricular noncompaction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare form of cardiomyopathy currently described in humans and cats. It consists of a spongy myocardium characterized by prominent trabeculation and deep recesses involving more than 50% of the ventricular thickness. We describe the clinical and pathological features of LVNC combined with tricuspid valve dysplasia, double-orifice tricuspid valve and severe pulmonary stenosis in a puppy. In addition, we briefly review the LVNC causes, pathogenesis, forms and current diagnostic criteria.
CASE PRESENTATION: A seven-week-old intact German Shorthaired Pointer-cross male was presented with a poor body condition, exercise intolerance and dyspnea. Clinical exam identified a bilateral systolic murmur (grade IV/VI over the right heart base and grade III/VI over the left heart base). Echocardiography identified tricuspid valve dysplasia, mild mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonic stenosis with a trans-valvar systolic pressure gradient of 106Â mmHg. Left ventricular noncompaction was diagnosed by necropsy and further confirmed histopathologically by the presence of two distinct myocardial layers: an inner noncompacted zone covering more than 50% of ventricular thickness containing prominent trabeculation and deep recesses, and an outer zone of compact myocardium.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case describing LVNC in a canine patient, supporting the introduction of this form of heart disease as a differential diagnosis for cardiomyopathies in juvenile and adult dogs.
