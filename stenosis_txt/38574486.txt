Title: A new variant in the GATA6 gene associated with tracheoesophageal fistula, pulmonary vein stenosis and neonatal diabetes.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: GATA6 is a gene that encodes a transcription factor with a key role in the development of several organ systems, including the development of the pancreas. It is associated with neonatal diabetes but also with other extra-pancreatic anomalies.
CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes the association of tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS), and neonatal diabetes caused by a novel mutation of the GATA6 gene in a small-for-gestational-age male neonate born at 32 weeks of gestation. Next-Generation Sequencing revealed the novel heterozygous variant c.1502C>G in the GATA6 gene, which determines the introduction of the premature stop codon p.Ser501Ter at the protein level. This de novo nonsense variant was not detected in the analyzed parental DNA samples and has not been previously described in the literature. At about two months of life, a PVS was suspected. The PVS progressively increased with the development of an intramural component, resulting in severe postcapillary pulmonary hypertension. The child died at about 4 months of life.
CONCLUSION: TEF can be associated with GATA6 variants. In the case of neonatal diabetes and TEF, neonatologists should be aware of this association and should also investigate the child for complex congenital heart disorders, such as in our case, with a cardiac computed tomography.
