Title: Insights from intravascular pressure measurement of renal artery revascularization in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia: The DYSART study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The indication of percutaneous renal transluminal angioplasty (PTRA) in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is mainly based on renal artery stenosis (RAS) due to atherosclerosis criteria, which are not specific to FMD. Consequently, the selection of patients who could benefit from this treatment and its effectiveness remain uncertain. The aims of this study were to: (1) report the effects of PTRA guided by trans-stenotic pressure measurements on hypertension 7 months after treatment; (2) assess the impact of pressure measurement to guide treatment efficacy in comparison to visual angiographic parameters; and (3) evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of the stenosis measurement using a 4F catheter in comparison to a pressure guidewire.
METHODS: This prospective multi-centric study analyzed 24 patients with hypertension with RAS due to FMD that required PTRA. Clinical, duplex ultrasound, and angiographic indices were collected, and patients were followed up for 7 months (±1 month). Angiographic indices were measured twice both by a pressure guidewire and a 4F catheter. Assessment of procedural and clinical success of angioplasty was performed for all patients.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (96%) had procedural success (considered as a post-PTRA translesional systolic gradient ≤10 mmHg or reduced by at least 80%) with a significant decrease in the systolic gradient after angioplasty (26.50 mmHg; [interquartile range, 16.75-38.75] vs 0.00 [interquartile range, 0.00-2.00]; P < .01). Three patients (12%) had complications, including two renal artery dissections and one partial renal infarction. Twenty-one patients (88%) were clinical responders to angioplasty at follow-up. Visual stenosis assessment showed a poor correlation with systolic gradient measurement before and after PTRA (R from -0.05 to 0.41; P = 0.06-0.82). High correlations were found between pressure measurements made by a 4F catheter and guidewire (R from 0.64 to 0.89; P ≤ .003).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients selected by clinical indicators and duplex ultrasound, reaching a translesional systolic gradient ≤10 mmHg or reduced by at least 80% after angioplasty, promotes a high success rate for PTRA in hypertension due to FMD RAS.
