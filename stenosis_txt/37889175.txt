Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With or Without Active Cancer.

Abstract: Background Data on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in specific cancer types or the presence of metastatic disease remain sparse. This study aimed to investigate the impact of active cancer on short-term mortality, complications, and readmission rates after TAVR across different cancer types. Methods and Results The authors assessed the Nationwide Readmissions Database for TAVR cases from 2012 to 2019. Patients were stratified by specific cancer types. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included bleeding requiring blood transfusion and readmissions at 30, 90, and 180 days after TAVR. Overall, 122 573 patients undergoing TAVR were included in the analysis, of whom 8013 (6.5%) had active cancer. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of active cancer was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.06 [95% CI, 0.89-1.27]; P=0.523). However, active cancer was associated with an increased risk of readmission at 30, 90, and 180 days after TAVR and increased risk of bleeding requiring transfusion at 30 days. Active colon and any type of metastatic cancer were individually associated with readmissions at 30, 90, and 180 days after TAVR. At 30 days after TAVR, colon (aOR, 2.51 [95% CI, 1.68-3.76]; P&lt;0.001), prostate (aOR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.05-1.86]; P=0.021), and any type of metastatic cancer (aOR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.23-2.22]; P=0.001) were individually associated with an increased risk of bleeding requiring transfusion. Conclusions Patients with active cancer had similar in-hospital mortality after TAVR but higher risk of readmission and bleeding requiring transfusion, the latter depending on certain types of cancer.
