Title: Drug-Coated Balloon Treatment in Symptomatic Intracranial High Grade Stenosis : A Retrospective Study of 33 Patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Endovascular therapy (EVT) represents an alternative treatment modality for symptomatic intracranial high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS); however, periprocedural complication rates as well as midterm restenosis rates represent relevant limitations of EVT. Drug-coated balloon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (DCB-PTA) may overcome some of these shortcomings. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility and safety as well as the stroke recurrence rate in 33 patients.
METHODS: A retrospective, monocentric cohort study of sICAS patients treated with DCB-PTA. Outcome measures were the periprocedural intracranial complication rate, the recurrent stroke rate and mortality during follow-up.
RESULTS: This cohort study included 33 patients with 35 sICAS treated with DCB-PTA. The median age was 72 years (interquartile range, IQR 66-77 years); median clinical and mean radiological follow-up time was 9 months (IQR 3-22 months). Median preprocedural degree of stenosis (WASID) was 80% (IQR 73-80%) and median postprocedural residual stenosis degree (WASID) was 50% (IQR 33-60%). Intracranial periprocedural complications occurred in 2 (6%) patients. The overall restenosis rate was 15% (n = 5). In four patients a symptomatic ischemic re-event occurred within 7 months after the initial treatment. None of the patients died.
CONCLUSION: This DCB-PTA cohort study showed a relatively low intracranial complication rate of 6% with a symptomatic recurrence rate of 12%. Larger trials are needed to validate these promising observations.
