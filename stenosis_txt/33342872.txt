Title: Magnetic Resonance Evaluation of Lumbar Disc Degenerative Disease as an Implication of Low Back Pain: A Prospective Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The main objectives of this study are MR characterization of disc degeneration and sequelae, analysis of lumbar disc degeneration patterns in patients with low back pain, and evaluation of the extent of involvement. This unique study evaluates the number of discs involved and the Modic changes at prolapsed, degenerated nonprolapsed, and at nondegenerated, nonprolapsed levels.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, magnetic resonance imaging-based radiological study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1000 whole spine and lumbosacral spines were subjected to MRI examination, including spin echo with T1, T2, and STIR sequences. The Modic classification, Pfirrmann disc classification method, Borenstein criteria for central spinal canal stenosis, and Weishaupt Classification for Facet Degeneration were used for evaluation.
RESULTS: The commonest level of disc degeneration was L4-L5 (41.2%) and the commonest type was disc protrusion (69.4%). Disc height reduction was common at L5-S1 level (32.2%). Multidisc involvement is the commonest presentation (38.2%) followed by contiguous double level (34.7%) with disc bulges frequently reported at L3-L4 (27.2%) and L4-L5 (26.9%) levels. Majority of discs (56.1%) demonstrated Modic changes at prolapsed levels. Spondylolisthesis was commonly reported at L5-S1 level (87.5%) and was mostly associated with lumbar canal stenosis (38.4%). Posterior osteophytes were frequent at L3-L4 (31.1%) and L5-S1 (31.1%) levels. D12-L1 was least affected (4.1%) in lumbar disc degenerative disease.
CONCLUSION: The clinicians evaluated multiple variables associated with intervertebral disc degeneration and its sequelae such as lumbar canal stenosis and found the evaluation methods to be simple and practical in evaluating lumbar spine degeneration and simple communication.
