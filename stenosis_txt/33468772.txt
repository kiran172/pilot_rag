Title: [A Case of Laparoscopic Assisted Resection for Small Intestinal Cancer Diagnosed Preoperatively].

Abstract: A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to intermittent epigastric pain and vomiting for 2 months. Contrast enhanced CT scan showed stenosis in the upper jejunum. She was diagnosed with small intestinal ileus. A small enteroscopy revealed a peripheral type 2 lesion in the upper jejunum, approximately 10 cm from the Treitz's ligament. Upon biopsy, she was diagnosed with a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. A laparoscope-assisted extracorporeal operation was performed due to the ease of raising the umbilical wound. Swollen lymph nodes were found in the mesentery. A surgical margin of 5 cm on the oral side and 20 cm on the anal side was secured. We performed partial resection of the small intestine, including the mesentery with the enlarged lymph nodes. The histopathological diagnosis was a Type 2, 3×2 cm, tub2, pT4aN1aM0, pStage Ⅲb small intestinal cancer. Due to the development of small intestinal ileus, the small bowel cancer was diagnosed preoperatively. Hence, it was slightly we will report including the literature consideration of.
