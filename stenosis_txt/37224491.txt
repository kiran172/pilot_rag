Title: Severe Esophageal Lichen Planus Treated With Tofacitinib.

Abstract: Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory immune disorder that most commonly affects the skin and mucous membranes. Esophageal lichen planus (ELP) is a frequently misdiagnosed and poorly understood form of lichen planus that can be asymptomatic or present with dysphagia and odynophagia caused by the formation of erosions and strictures in the esophagus. These strictures often reduce a patient's quality of life and may lead to emaciation in more severe cases. We present the case of an 89-year-old woman with a history of cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) and mucosal lichen planus that were successfully managed with topical corticosteroids and oral cyclosporine rinses who presented with an esophageal stricture and erosions that were treated unsuccessfully with surgery. Our patient's condition continued to worsen until she presented in an emaciated state and was treated with tofacitinib, which resulted in complete resolution of oral lichen planus (OLP), ELP, and genital lichen planus.
