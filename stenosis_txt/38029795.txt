Title: Venous air emboli during esophagoscopy confirmed by computed tomographic pulmonary angiography -a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is vital for the diagnosis and treatment of various gastrointestinal conditions but carries a low risk of venous air embolism (VAE). We report a case of VAE during EGD, confirmed by computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA).
CASE: A 56-year-old male with a history of hypopharyngeal cancer underwent EGD for dysphagia-related esophageal dilation. Signs of VAE were noted, prompting swift interventions, including oxygen therapy, positional changes, and CTPA. CTPA revealed the Mercedes-Benz sign, pneumomediastinum, and a minimal pneumothorax. The patient's oxygen saturation improved within 30 min before undergoing CTPA, and he was discharged on postoperative day 4.
CONCLUSIONS: Timely recognition of VAE, resulting in appropriate interventions supported by CTPA, resulted in favorable patient outcomes.
