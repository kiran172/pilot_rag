Title: Effects of left bundle branch block on echocardiographic coronary flow assessment: A systematic review.

Abstract: This systematic review investigates the diagnostic and prognostic utility of coronary flow reserve (CFR) assessment through echocardiography in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB), a condition known to complicate the clinical evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). The literature search was performed on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, was guided by PRISMA standards up to March 2024, and yielded six observational studies that met inclusion criteria. These studies involved a diverse population of patients with LBBB, employing echocardiographic protocols to clarify the impact of LBBB on coronary flow dynamics. The findings emphasize the importance of CFR in stratifying cardiovascular risk and guiding clinical decision-making in patients with LBBB. Pooled results reveal that patients with LBBB and significant left anterior descending (LAD) artery stenosis exhibited a marked decrease in stress-peak diastolic velocity (MD = -19.03 [-23.58; -14.48] cm/s; p < .0001) and CFR (MD = -.60 [-.71; -.50]; p < .0001), compared to those without significant LAD lesions, suggesting the efficacy of stress echocardiography CFR assessment in the identification of clinically significant CAD among the LBBB population. This review highlights the clinical relevance of echocardiography CFR assessment as a noninvasive tool for evaluating CAD and stratifying risk in the presence of LBBB and underscores the need for standardized protocols in CFR measurement.
