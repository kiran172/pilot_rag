Title: Influencing factors of stroke occurrence and recurrence in hypertensive patients: A prospective follow-up studies.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To understand the related risk factors of occurrence and recurrence of hypertension and provide scientific basis for relevant departments to better guide prevention and control work.
METHODS: From September 2017 to September 2018, a prospective follow-up study was performed on patients with hypertension who visited the Second People's Hospital of Wuhu City, Anhui Province. Multivariate Cox regression was used to analyze influencing factors of stroke occurrence and recurrence in follow-up of hypertensive patients.
RESULTS: A total of 769 hypertensive patients were enrolled in this study. The average age of hypertensive patients was 65.66 ± 11.70 years old and the BMI index was 24.99 ± 4.17. In this study, 769 patients with hypertension were followed up for 1 year, and the incidence of stroke was 14.69%. This study found that higher levels of blood glucose (RR = 2.027, 95% CI: 1.195-3.438), HCY (RR = 5.928,95% CI: 1.438-24.440), aggravated extent of carotid artery stenosis (RR = 2.620, 95% CI: 1.532-4.481), and drinking (RR = 3.867, 95% CI: 2.038-7.339) were risk factors, and maintaining exercise (RR = 0.325, 95% CI: 0.117-0.907) was a protective factor for stroke occurrence; however, aggravated extent of carotid artery stenosis (RR = 3.158, 95% CI: 1.797-5.550) and smoking (RR = 2.271, 95% CI: 1.142-4.517) were risk factors for stroke recurrence for hypertensive patients.
CONCLUSIONS: For people with high blood pressure, it is necessary to exercise properly, control body weight, avoid obesity, quit smoking, reduce alcohol consumption, and reasonably control blood pressure, blood sugar, and blood lipid.
