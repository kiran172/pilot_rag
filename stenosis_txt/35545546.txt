Title: [Non-surgical management using pancreatic duct drainage for a traumatic pancreatic injury with main pancreatic rupture: a case report].

Abstract: After an abdominal injury, a woman in her 20s presented to our hospital with abdominal pain. Pancreatic trauma was discovered on computed tomography, along with a pancreatic duct injury and pancreatic juice leakage. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed a 10-mm rupture of the pancreatic body's main pancreatic duct (MPD) and intraperitoneal leakage of contrast enzyme from the MPD. The pancreatic injury was treated with the placement of a 5-Fr endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube in the ruptured distal side of the pancreatic duct;however, 3 months later, the MPD stenosis occurred. The MPD stenosis was improved using a 7-Fr pancreatic stent, and finally, placement of the pancreatic stent was not required for MPD drainage.
