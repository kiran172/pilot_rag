Title: Efficacy and Safety of Intravascular Lithotripsy in Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel technique for plaque modification during endovascular revascularisation for peripheral artery disease (PAD) with severe calcification. The aim of this paper was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of contemporary data to elucidate the efficacy and safety of IVL in lower extremity PAD.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search with pre-defined search terms was performed using PubMed, Web of Sciences, OvidSP, and EMBASE.
REVIEW METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Patient characteristics, lesion calcification, pre-IVL and post-IVL diameter stenosis, complications, and stent rates were evaluated.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included, encompassing a total of 681 patients (769 lesions) with IVL performed for PAD, of which 75.53% (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.08% - 83.03%) of the lesions were reported to have severe calcification. Comparison between pre-IVL and post-IVL diameter stenosis demonstrated a diameter stenosis reduction of 59.3% (95% CI 53.30% - 65.31%). Vascular complications were rare, with flow limiting or type D/E/F dissection occurring in only 1.25% (95% CI 0.60% - 2.61%) of cases. The overall pooled event rate for stent placement was 15.89% (95% CI 5.22% - 39.34%).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis supports IVL as an effective and safe approach for calcified plaque modification in lower extremity PAD, achieving a diameter stenosis reduction of 59.3% (95% CI 53.30% - 65.31%) with minimal vascular complications. Routine use of this device is not recommended; further high quality evidence is required to elucidate the efficacy of IVL with respect to different clinical characteristics such as lesion location and length, and in comparison with other treatment modalities such as atherectomy.
