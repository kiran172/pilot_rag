Title: Systemic Venous Reconstructions During Pediatric Heart Transplantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease continues to be an important indication for pediatric heart transplantation (HT) and is often complicated by systemic venous anomalies. The need for reconstruction, surgical technique used, as well as the outcomes of these have limited documentation.
METHODS: Descriptive, retrospective study of patients transplanted at Emory University between 2006 and 2017. We reviewed surgical data, follow-up, and interventions for patients necessitating venous reconstruction during transplantation.
RESULTS: A total of 179 transplants were performed during the time period of which 74 (41%) required systemic venous reconstruction. Mean age at transplant was 6.3 (Â±6.16) years, and 74.3% of these patients carried a diagnosis of single ventricle; 51 (68.9%) of 74 patients required pulmonary artery reconstruction at the time of HT. Forty patients required superior vena caval reconstruction, while 22 patients required inferior vena caval reconstruction due to prior palliation or anomaly. Venous anomalies along with other anatomic features necessitated biatrial transplantation in four patients. Posttransplant evaluation revealed systemic venous stenosis in 14 (18.9%) of 74 patients. Eight (10.8%) patients required 12 interventions for the systemic veins. Patients with bilateral Glenn anastomosis prior to transplant were at high risk for the development of stenosis and needing interventions. Systemic venous complications were uncommon in those with native systemic veins without Glenn or Fontan procedure.
CONCLUSION: Systemic venous reconstruction needs are high in pediatric HT. Posttransplant stenosis and the need for interventions are relatively common. Current techniques for systemic venous reconstruction for complex congenital heart disease patients may deserve further review to optimize these outcomes.
