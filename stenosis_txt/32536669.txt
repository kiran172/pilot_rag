Title: [A case of pneumococcal meningitis with reversible arterial stenosis].

Abstract: A 72-year-old male was diagnosed pneumococcal meningitis and we started treatment with antibacterial drugs and corticosteroids. On the 6th day, his consciousness level decreased. On the 7th day DWI of MRI showed a new infarction in bilateral cerebellar, and MRA showed multiple arterial stenosis. On the 12th day, CT angiography showed expansion of cerebral infarction and progress of diffuse stenosis. After that the stenosis improved over time, it disappeared on the 39th day. These results suggest that vasospasm is involved in the pathology of vascular stenosis.
