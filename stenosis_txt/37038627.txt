Title: Right heart echocardiographic variables and prediction of clinical severity in dogs with pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary stenosis (PS) usually is evaluated using echocardiography. A multiparametric approach, in addition to the maximum pressure gradient (PG), might be indicated to better characterize PS severity and address its management.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Our hypothesis was that right heart size and function are associated with echocardiographic and clinical severity of pulmonary stenosis in dogs.
ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs with PS.
METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, observational study. Enrolled dogs underwent complete echocardiographic examination. Associations among right heart echocardiographic variables, PS transvalvular PG >80 mm Hg and presence of clinical signs (exercise intolerance, syncope, right-sided congestive failure, or some combination of these) were assessed using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight dogs with PS. Twenty-eight dogs were symptomatic. Increased right ventricular end-diastolic free wall thickness (odds ratio [OR] > 100; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 50- > 100; P = .01) and decreased aorta-to-pulmonary artery velocity time integral ratio (OR, < 0.001; 95%CI, 0.0-0.001; P = .005) were independently associated with PS PG >80 mm Hg. Decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (OR, 0.35; 95%CI, 0.15-0.77; P = .01) and increased right ventricular end-diastolic area (OR, 1.4; 95%CI, 1.08-2.02; P = .01) were independently associated with clinical severity.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Structural and functional right heart echocardiographic variables are associated with echocardiographic and clinical severity in dogs with PS. A multiparametric approach is advised to better assess PS severity.
