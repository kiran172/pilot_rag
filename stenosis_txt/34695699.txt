Title: Adequate short- and long-term pain control with non-opiate analgesics after microdirect laryngoscopy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In otolaryngology, it is important to minimize the use of opioids for post-operative analgesia given the rise in opioid abuse and mortality due to overdose in the United States. We sought to quantitatively determine the efficacy of non-opiate analgesia in postoperative pain management after microdirect laryngoscopy (MDL).
METHODS: This is a single institution prospective study monitoring post-operative pain using a visual analog scale (VAS, 1-10). Patients with a history of vocal fold lesions, paralysis, and stenosis who underwent MDL were surveyed for one month following their procedure (daily for the first week and weekly thereafter). Student's t-test was used to determine whether short (1 week) and long term (1 month) pain was controlled by over-the-counter (OTC) medications. We defined adequate pain control as an average daily VAS score below 4 for the first 4 days and below 1 in the following 3 weeks and hypothesized that patients would report adequate pain control without the use of opioids.
RESULTS: Post-operative pain after MDL was generally mild. The average daily VAS score was 2.16 (95% CI [0.0-5.2], P = 0.0014) in the first 4 days post-procedure and 0.28 (95% CI [0.0-1.3], P = 0.0007) in the 3 weeks post-procedure confirming our hypothesis. On average, patients used 3.14 (CI: [0.0-12.8]) pills of acetaminophen and 0.57 (CI: [0.0-4.7]) pills of an NSAID per day in the first week. Only three patients required opioid analgesia, all of whom used opioids in the first 48 h.
CONCLUSIONS: OTC analgesics provide sufficient pain control after microdirect laryngoscopy for most patients. Given the potential for substance abuse from opioid medications, this study demonstrates that adequate pain control requires, at most, 48 h of opioid medications. Further study is needed to determine factors that contribute to increased pain after laryngoscopy.
