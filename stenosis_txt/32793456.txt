Title: Stricture Following Esophageal Reconstruction.

Abstract: Owing to varying clinical definitions of anastomotic stricture following esophageal reconstruction, its reported incidence rate varies from 10% to 56%. Strictures adversely impact patients' quality of life. Risk factors, such as the anastomosis method, leakage, ischemia, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and underlying disease have been mentioned, but conflicting information has been reported. Balloon dilation is regarded as a safe and effective treatment method for patients with benign anastomotic strictures. Reoperations are seldom required. The etiology and management of anastomotic strictures are reviewed in this article.
