Title: Investigation of Flow Changes in Intracranial Vascular Disease Models Constructed with MRA Images.

Abstract: This study aimed to develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible flow delivery system and individualized models of circle of Willis (CoW), which include 50% and 100% blockage in internal carotid artery (ICA50 and ICA100), and 100% blockage in vertebral artery (VA100). Images were obtained using 3D time-of-flight and phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) sequences, and changes in velocity and flow direction at CoW models were analyzed. For the ICA50 and VA100 models, the flow was similar to that of the normal model. For the ICA 50 model, it was found that 50% blockage did not affect cerebral blood flow. For the VA100 model, decreased flow in the posterior cerebral artery and a change to the flow direction in the posterior communicating artery were found. For the ICA100 model, particularly, decreased flow in the ipsilateral middle and anterior cerebral arteries and a change to the flow direction in the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery of the CoW were found. These results demonstrated that the flow system with various CoW disease models tailored to individual characteristics could be used to predict stroke onset more quickly. For the ICA50 and VA100 models, the possibility of cerebral infarction was significantly lower. On the other hand, for the ICA100 model, there was a high possibility of decreased flow, which could lead to cerebral infarction.
