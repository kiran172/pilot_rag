Title: Supra-Annular Self-Expanding Versus Balloon-Expandable Valves for Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Self-expanding (SE) and balloon-expandable (BE) transcatheter heart valves (THVs) have not been extensively studied in valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We compared outcomes of supra-annular SE and BE THVs used for ViV-TAVR through a retrospective analysis of institutional data (2013 to 2023) including all patients who underwent ViV-TAVR (TAVR in previous surgical aortic valve replacement). Unmatched and propensity-matched (1:1) comparisons of clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were undertaken in SE and BE THVs along with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. A total of 315 patients who underwent ViV-TAVR were included, of whom 73% received an SE THV. Median age was 77 years, and women comprised 42.5% of the population. Propensity-score matching (1:1) yielded 81 matched pairs. Implanted aortic valve size was comparable in the groups (23 mm [23 to 26] vs 23 mm [23 to 26], p = 0.457). At 30 days after ViV-TAVR, the SE group had a lower mean aortic valve gradient (14 mm Hg [11 to 18] vs 17.5 mm Hg [13 to 25], p = 0.007). A greater number of patients with BE THV had severe prosthesis-patient mismatch (16% vs 6.2%, p = 0.04). At 1-year follow-up, the SE THV group had a lower aortic valve gradient (14.0 mm Hg [9.6 to 19] vs 17 mm Hg [13 to 25], p = 0.04) than that of the BE THV group; 30-day mortality was 2.7%, whereas 1-year mortality was 7.5% and comparable in the groups. Survival and stroke incidence were similar in the groups up to 5 years. In conclusion, SE and BE THVs had comparable survival after ViV-TAVR. The higher residual aortic valve gradients in BE THVs are likely due to valve design and warrant long-term evaluation for potential structural valve degeneration.
