Title: Bilateral vocal cord paralysis after endoscopic placement of fully covered self-expandable metal stent for palliative treatment of malignant proximal esophageal obstruction: two case reports.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Oesophageal stents have several well-known respiratory complications, including aspiration pneumonia, fistula and airway compression. However, bilateral vocal cord paralysis has rarely been described.
METHODS: We describe two patients who presented with refractory dysphagia due to malignant proximal oesophageal strictures. Both received palliative treatment consisting of fully covered self-expandable metal stents that were placed across the strictures.
RESULTS: Both patients developed inspiratory stridor and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure shortly after the stent was placed. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed vocal cord paralysis in paramedian position, potentially due to extrinsic compression of the posterior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve following the progressive opening of the esophageal prosthesis. One patient recovered after the stent was removed.
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral vocal cord paralysis is a rare but potentially fatal complication of proximal esophagus stenting.
