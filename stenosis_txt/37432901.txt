Title: Surgeon Experience Matters: An Exact Matched Analysis of TLIF Outcomes Demonstrates No Difference in Surgical Outcomes Between Experienced Neurosurgeons and Orthopedic Surgeons.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To compare surgical and medical complications profile between neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) procedures.
BACKGROUND: Studies comparing the impact of spine surgeon specialty (neurosurgery vs. orthopedic spine) on TLIF outcomes have been inconclusive and failed to control for operative learning curves and surgical maturity. Orthopedic spine surgeons perform fewer spine procedures in residency, although these differences may be attenuated by mandatory fellowship before starting practice. Any observed differences are likely attenuated with increasing surgeon experience.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an all-payer claims database, PearlDiver Mariner, 120 million patient records were analyzed between 2010 and 2022, to identify individuals with lumbar stenosis or spondylolisthesis who underwent index one- to three-level TLIF procedures. International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Edition (ICD-9), International Classification of Diseases-10th Edition (ICD-10) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were used to query the database. Only Neurosurgeons and Orthopedic spine surgeons who had performed at least 250 procedures were included in the study. Patients undergoing surgery for tumor, trauma, or infection were excluded. 1:1 exact matching was performed using demographic factors, medical comorbidities, and surgical factors which were significantly associated with all-cause surgical or medical complications in a linear regression model.
RESULTS: 1:1 exact matching created two equal groups of 18,195 patients without baseline differences who underwent TLIF procedures by neurosurgeons or orthopedic surgeons. There was no difference in all-cause surgical complications between neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons (relative risk=1.008, 95% CI: 0.850-1.195, P =0.965). All-cause medical complication rate was higher in the neurosurgery cohort (relative risk=1.144, 95% CI: 1.042-1.258, P =0.005).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that after accounting for surgical maturity, neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons have similar surgical outcomes. However, neurosurgeons have higher all-cause medical complication rates compared with orthopedic spine surgeons. Further research is warranted to validate this relationship in other spine procedures and for other outcomes.
