Title: Endovascular Recanalization of Symptomatic Chronic ICA Occlusion: Procedural Outcomes and Radiologic Predictors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular recanalization has been attempted in patients with symptomatic chronic ICA occlusion, however, the heterogeneity of recanalization outcomes and the perioperative complications present challenges for the clinical application. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endovascular recanalization for symptomatic chronic ICA occlusion and identify potential predictors for successful recanalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 47 consecutive patients with symptomatic chronic ICA occlusion who underwent endovascular recanalization at our institution. Patients' clinical information, radiologic characteristics, procedural results, and outcomes were recorded. Factors related to technical success were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The technical success rate was 74.5% (35/47); 12.8% of patients (6/47) experienced intraoperative complications, but none had permanent neurologic deficits. Three months after recanalization, 21 of the 29 recanalized patients (72.4%) and 3 of the 10 failed patients (30.0%) demonstrated improved mRS scores. Restenosis or re-occlusion occurred in 12.9% of patients (4/31) with successful recanalization. Multivariate analysis showed that tapered or blunt stump (P  = .016), distal ICA occlusion segment (below the cavernous segment versus at or above the ophthalmic segment, P  = .003; at the cavernous or clinoid segment versus at or above the ophthalmic segment, P  = .027), and radiologic occlusion to recanalization of ≤3 months (P  = .044) were significantly associated with successful recanalization. Patients were assigned points according to the coefficients of the prediction model, and the technical success rates were 0%, 46.2%, 90.5%, and 100% in patients with 1, 2, 3, and 4 points, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular recanalization is a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic chronic ICA occlusion in selected patients. A residual stump, low levels of the distal ICA occlusion segment, and a short radiologic occlusion time were identified as positive predictors of technical success.
