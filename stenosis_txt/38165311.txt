Title: Silent choker: Unveiling tracheal stenosis as an atypical manifestation of mucormycosis.

Abstract: Airway mucormycosis is a fatal opportunistic infection typically seen in immunocompromised individuals. In this case report, we present an unusual instance of tracheal stenosis in a patient with diabetes mellitus who had recently recovered from coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Our patient was a 69-year-old male with poorly controlled type-II diabetes mellitus, on oral hypoglycemic agents, who had successfully completed treatment for COVID-19. Approximately one month later, he developed a cough, fever and breathlessness. Several factors, including advanced age, history of smoking and tobacco chewing, the nodular appearance of the trachea on bronchoscopy, hypermetabolic wall of the trachea on positron emission tomography scan and dysplasia on biopsy, initially raised suspicion of malignancy. However, repeated biopsies from multiple sites confirmed the diagnosis of tracheal mucormycosis. The patient was treated with amphotericin-B and posaconazole. We extensively reviewed the literature and found only 14 reported cases to discuss compared to ours.
