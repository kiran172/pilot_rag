Title: Prevalence and descriptive epidemiology of choanal atresia and stenosis in Texas, 1999-2018.

Abstract: Choanal atresia and stenosis are common causes of congenital nasal obstruction, but their epidemiology is poorly understood. Compared to bilateral choanal atresia/stenosis, unilateral choanal atresia/stenosis is generally diagnosed later and might be under-ascertained in birth defect registries. Data from the population-based Texas Birth Defects Registry and Texas vital records, 1999-2018, were used to assess the prevalence of choanal atresia/stenosis. Poisson regression models were used to evaluate associations with infant and maternal characteristics in two analytic groups: isolated choanal atresia/stenosis (n = 286) and isolated, bilateral choanal atresia/stenosis (n = 105). The overall prevalence of choanal atresia/stenosis was 0.92/10,000, and the prevalence of isolated choanal atresia/stenosis was 0.37/10,000 livebirths. Variables associated with choanal atresia/stenosis in one or both analytic groups included infant sex, pregnancy plurality, maternal race/ethnicity, maternal age, and maternal residence on the Texas-Mexico border. In general, adjusted prevalence ratios estimated from the two analytic groups were in the same direction but tended to be stronger in the analyses restricted to isolated, bilateral defects. Epidemiologic studies of isolated choanal atresia/stenosis should consider focusing on cases with bilateral defects, and prioritizing analyses of environmental, social, and structural factors that could account for the association with maternal residence on the Texas-Mexico border.
