Title: Biliary complications following split liver transplantation in adult recipients: a matched pair analysis on single-center experience.

Abstract: The utilization of split liver grafts can increase access to liver transplantation (LT) for adult patients, particularly when liver grafts are shared between 2 adult recipients. However, it is yet to be determined whether split liver transplantation (SLT) increases the risk of biliary complications (BCs) compared with whole liver transplantation (WLT) in adult recipients. This retrospective study enrolled 1441 adult patients who underwent deceased donor LT at a single-site between January 2004 and June 2018. Of those, 73 patients underwent SLTs. Graft type for SLT includes 27 right trisegment grafts, 16 left lobes, and 30 right lobes. A propensity score matching analysis selected 97 WLTs and 60 SLTs. Biliary leakage was more frequently seen in SLTs (13.3% vs. 0%; p <0.001), whereas the frequency of biliary anastomotic stricture was comparable between SLTs and WLTs (11.7% vs. 9.3%; p=0.63). Graft and patient survival rates of patients undergoing SLTs were comparable to those undergoing WLTs (p=0.42 and 0.57, respectively). In the analysis of the entire SLT cohort, BCs were seen in 15 patients (20.5%) including biliary leakage in 11 patients (15.1%) and biliary anastomotic stricture in 8 patients (11.0%) [both in 4 patients (5.5%)]. The survival rates of recipients who developed BCs were significantly inferior to those without BCs (p <0.01). By multivariate analysis, the split grafts without common bile duct increased the risk of BCs. In conclusion, SLT increases the risk of biliary leakage compared with WLT. Biliary leakage can still lead to fatal infection and thus should be managed appropriately in SLT.
