Title: Paraoxonase-1 and Symptomatic Status in Carotid Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated hydrolase that appears to have a protective action against atherosclerosis. The aim of our study is to identify whether PON-1 levels may be associated with the manifestation of symptoms in patients with carotid artery stenosis.
METHODS: We studied all patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy in the Vascular Surgery Department of Laikon Hospital, Athens, Greece, from July 2012 to July 2014. Medical history was recorded and PON-1 glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides levels were measured. Variables were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the accuracy of PON-1 to predict symptoms.
RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were included, 41 were asymptomatic and the mean age was 68.5 years. The 2 groups appear to differ significantly with regards to the PON-1 levels, with the symptomatic group showing lower levels (5.3 ± 1.19 vs. 4.6 ± 1.36 ng/mL; P = 0.025). ROC analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.654 (P = 0.023).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced PON-1 levels showed a significant association with symptomatic status, which was independent of other traditional cardiovascular factors. Further studies are required to prospectively assess the role of PON-1 in predicting cerebrovascular events in patients with carotid artery disease.
