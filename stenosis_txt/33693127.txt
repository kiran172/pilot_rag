Title: Risk Factors for Mortality and Morbidity of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis　- Risk Model From a Japan Cardiovascular Surgery Database.

Abstract: Background:  The aim of this study was to determine adequate indication for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We analyzed risk factors of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) not only for mortality, but also for morbidity, including long hospital stay (≥90 days) and patient activity at discharge, in patients who underwent SAVR for aortic stenosis (AS). Methods and Results:  Using the Japan Adult Cardiovascular Surgery Database (JCVSD), 13,961 patients with or without coronary artery bypass grafting who underwent elective SAVR for AS were identified from January 2008 to December 2012. The hospital mortality rate was 3.1%. The percentage of patients who had long hospital stay (≥90 days) and who had moderately or severely decompressed activity at discharge (modified Rankin scale ≥4) was 2.9% and 6.5%, respectively. Eleven and 20 preoperative predictors of hospital mortality and morbidity, respectively, including long hospital stay and compromised status at discharge, were identified. Based on these risk factors, the risk model predicted hospital mortality (area under the curve [AUC], 0.732) and morbidity (AUC, 0.694). Conclusions:  Using JCVSD, a risk model of SAVR was developed for AS. This model can identify patients at high risk not only for mortality, but also for mortality and morbidity, including long hospital stay and status at discharge.
