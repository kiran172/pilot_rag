Title: Jejunal stenosis as a sequela after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity: a case series.

Abstract: Porto-mesenteric venous thrombosis (PMVT) is a rare complication that is encountered in less than 1% of patients following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). This condition could be conservatively managed in stable patients with no evidence of peritonitis or bowel wall ischemia. Nonetheless, conservative management may be followed by ischemic small bowel stricture, which is poorly reported in the literature. Herein, we present our experience regarding three patients who presented with manifestations of jejunal stricture after initial successful conservative management of PMVT. Retrospective analysis of patients who developed jejunal stenosis as a sequela after LSG. The three included patients had undergone LSG with an uneventful post-operative course. All of them developed PMVT that was conservatively managed mainly by anticoagulation. After they were discharged, all of them returned with manifestations of upper bowel obstruction. Upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of jejunal stricture. The three patients were explored via laparoscopy, and resection anastomosis of the stenosed segment was performed. Bariatric surgeons should be aware of the association between PMVT, following LSG, and ischemic bowel strictures. That should help in the rapid diagnosis of the rare and difficult entity.
