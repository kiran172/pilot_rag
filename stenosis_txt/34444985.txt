Title: Breastmilk Feeding during the First 4 to 6 Months of Age and Childhood Disease Burden until 10 Years of Age.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is recommended due to its beneficial effects on human health. However, the effect of breastfeeding on health differs, resulting in various childhood diseases.
OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the association between breastfeeding at least in the first 4 months and the subsequent development of 15 certainly defined childhood diseases until 10 years of age, the all-cause hospitalization rate and growth at 6-7 years of age.
METHODS: Participants included propensity-score matched 188,052 children born between January 2008 and December 2009, who were followed up till 10 years of age. Data were taken from the National Investigation of birth Cohort in Korea study 2008 database. Risk ratios were obtained using a modified Poisson regression and weighted risk differences using binomial regression.
RESULTS: Compared to formula feeding, breastfeeding was associated with decreased risks of febrile convulsion, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, pneumonia, acute bronchiolitis, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, asthma, all-cause hospitalization, overweight/obesity and short stature. Exclusive breastfeeding at 4 to 6 months of age had similar results to exclusive breastfeeding over 6 months of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding in early infancy reduces the risk for various childhood diseases, all-cause hospitalization rate, obesity, and short stature during childhood.
