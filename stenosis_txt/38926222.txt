Title: Efficacy and Safety of Endoscopic Stricturotomy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Related Strictures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Luminal strictures, common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease (CD), are typically treated with endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD). The newer endoscopic stricturotomy (ESt) approach shows promise, but data is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the effectiveness and safety of ESt in IBD-related strictures.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted until November 2023 for studies assessing ESt efficacy and safety in IBD. Primary outcomes were clinical and technical success, with secondary endpoints covering adverse events, subsequent stricture surgery, additional endoscopic treatments (ESt or EBD), medication escalation, disease-related emergency department visits, and hospitalization post-ESt. Technical success was defined as passing the scope through the stricture, and clinical success was defined as symptom improvement. Single-arm meta-analysis (CMA version 3) calculated the event rate per patient with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included, involving 640 ESt procedures on 287 IBD patients (169 CD, 118 ulcerative colitis). Of these, 53.3% were men, with a mean age of 43.3 ± 14.3 years and a mean stricture length of 1.68 ± 0.84 cm. The technical success rate was 96.4% (95% CI 92.5-98.3, p-value &lt; 0.0001), and the clinical success rate was 62% (95% CI 52.2-70.9, p-value = 0.017, I2 = 34.670). The bleeding rate was 10.5% per patient, and the perforation rate was 3.5%. After an average follow-up of 0.95 ± 1.1 years, 16.4% required surgery for strictures post-ESt, while 44.2% needed additional endoscopic treatment. The medication escalation rate after ESt was 14.7%. The disease-related emergency department visit rate was 14.7%, and the disease-related hospitalization rate post-procedure was 21.3%.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that ESt is safe and effective for managing IBD-related strictures, making it a valuable addition to the armamentarium of endoscopists. Formal training efforts should focus on ensuring its widespread adoption.
