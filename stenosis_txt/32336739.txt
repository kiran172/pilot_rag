Title: Predictor and Mid-Term Outcome of Clinically Significant Thrombocytopenia After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Selection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The frequency and predictors of thrombocytopenia after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study enrolled 342 patients undergoing TAVI (245 with a percutaneous transfemoral approach, 65 with transfemoral surgical cutdown, and 32 with a non-transfemoral approach). Balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves were implanted in 235 and 107 patients, respectively. Platelet counts started to drop immediately, reaching a nadir 2-4 days after TAVI. Clinically significant thrombocytopenia (CSTP) was defined as a platelet count ≤50×109/L at the time of the nadir or both a platelet count between 80 and 51×109/L and a decrease in platelet count ≥50%. CSTP occurred in 16.7% patients. Approach site and TAVI valve selection significantly predicted CSTP. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of CSTP were liver cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR] 7.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-49.82), baseline platelet count ≤120×109/L (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.20-7.38), multiple blood transfusions (OR 4.03; 95% CI 1.72-9.41), and the use of balloon-expandable valves (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.04-5.46). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with a generalized Wilcoxon test revealed that mid-term (2 years) mortality was greater for patients with than without CSTP (31.4% vs. 15.5%; P=0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI-related CSTP was not rare and was associated with poor mid-term outcomes. CSTP was not only caused by patients' comorbidities and TAVI complications, but also related to TAVI procedural factors.
