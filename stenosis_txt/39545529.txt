Title: [Combined single coronary artery by-pass graft surgery and aortic valve replacement through bilateral mini-thoracotomies].

Abstract: The efficiency of minimally invasive aortic valve surgery via right anterior thoracotomy is now well established. As far as coronary artery bypass graft surgery is concerned, many specialized centres are performing minimally invasive procedures with a left mini-thoracotomy either off-pump or on-pump. Multivessel operation is feasible. Up to date, only few authors described both procedures (coronary bypass graft surgery and valve surgery) in the same patient with a minimally invasive approach. We report a case of a female patient undergoing a single arterial coronary bypass surgery on the left anterior descending artery combined with an aortic valve replacement through bilateral anterior mini-thoracotomies.
