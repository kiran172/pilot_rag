Title: Clinical Effectiveness of Automated Coronary CT-derived Fractional Flow Reserve: A Chinese Randomized Controlled Trial.

Abstract: Background Coronary CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) has been used in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD); however, whether it decreases invasive coronary angiography (ICA) use and affects prognosis remains insufficiently evidenced. Purpose To explore the effectiveness of adding CT-FFR to routine coronary CT angiography (CCTA) on short-term ICA rate and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a Chinese setting. Materials and Methods A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted in 17 Chinese centers, with patient inclusion from May 2021 to September 2021. Eligible individuals with 25%-99% stenosis at CCTA were randomly assigned 1:1 to a strategy of CCTA plus automated CT-FFR or CCTA alone for guiding downstream care. The primary end point was the ICA rate 90 days after enrollment. Secondary end points included 90-day and 1-year MACE rates (comprised of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization) and 1-year cardiac events (comprised of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization). The Cox proportional hazards model with center effect adjustment was used for survival comparisons. Results A total of 5297 participants (mean age, 63.5 years ± 10.8 [SD]; 3178 male) were included. During the 90-day follow-up, ICA was performed in 263 of 2633 participants (10.0%) in the CCTA plus CT-FFR group and 327 of 2640 participants (12.4%) in the CCTA-alone group (absolute rate difference: -2.40%; 95% CI: -4.10, -0.70; P = .006). The MACE rates at 90 days (0.5% [12 of 2633 participants] vs 0.8% [21 of 2640 participants]; P = .12) and 1 year (2.9% [74 of 2546 participants] vs 2.8% [72 of 2531 participants]; P = .90) were similar for both groups. At 1-year follow-up, fewer cardiac events were observed in the CCTA plus CT-FFR group compared with the CCTA-alone group (0.5% vs 1.1%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.99; P = .047). Conclusion CT-FFR added to CCTA led to a lower 90-day ICA rate and similar 1-year MACE rate in a Chinese real-world setting. Further follow-up is warranted to demonstrate the long-term prognostic value of this management approach. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.
