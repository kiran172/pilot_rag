Title: A New Approach to Cloaca: Laparoscopic Separation of the Urogenital Sinus.

Abstract: Introduction: Cloaca malformation repair strategy is strongly dictated by common channel and urethral lengths. Mid to long common channel cloacas are challenging and often require laparotomy for dissection of pelvic structures. The balance of common channel and urethral lengths often dictates the approach for reconstruction. Laparoscopy has been utilized for rectal dissection but not for management of the urogenital (UG) structures. We hypothesized that laparoscopy could be applied to UG separation in reconstruction of cloaca malformations. Methods: Records were reviewed for 9 children with cloaca who underwent laparoscopic rectal mobilization and UG separation. Clinical parameters reviewed included demographics, relevant anatomic lengths, operative duration, transfusion requirements, and perioperative complications. Results: Repair was perfomed at a median (interquartile range) age of 12 (7, 15) months. Common channel length as measured by cystoscopy was 3.5 (3.3, 4.5) cm. There were no intraoperative complications. Transfusion requirements were minimal. Postoperative length of stay was 6 (5, 11) days. One patient developed a urethral web and 2 developed vaginal stenosis. One patient later underwent a laparotomy for obstruction due to a twisted rectal pull-through. Conclusions: Laparoscopic rectal mobilization and UG separation in long common channel cloaca are safe and well tolerated. Laparoscopy affords full evaluation of Mullerian structures and enables separation of the common UG wall, which may ultimately enhance long-term urinary continence.
