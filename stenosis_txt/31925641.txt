Title: Post ureteroscopic stone surgery ureteral strictures management: a retrospective study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To share experience in managing ureteral strictures following ureteroscopic lithotripsy.
METHODS: Ninety five patients diagnosed as ureteral strictures after ureteroscopic lithotripsy between January 2013 and January 2018 were included. 53 received endourological treatment, 34 underwent reconstruction, 6 underwent nephrectomy for severe renal impairment, and 2 chose routine ureteral stent replacement. Therapeutic success was defined as absence of clinical symptoms and radiologic relief of obstruction.
RESULTS: The follow-up time ranged from 13 to 57 months, with a median time of 24. It lasted more than 13 months in all patients, exception for 2 nephrectomies. Two patient groups including 69 endourological procedures and 37 reconstructions were used to compare therapeutic effects and complications. The overall success rate was 60.9% (42/69) in endourological intervention vs. 97.3% (36/37) in reconstruction (p < 0.001), while 74.4% (29/39) patients with stricture less than 1 cm and 68.8% (33/48) patients with mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis achieved success in endourological group. All except 1 failure appeared within the first year postoperatively. Subgroup analyses for endourological procedures revealed significant differences in the success rate of different stricture lengths and hydronephrosis (p = 0.004 and p = 0.043). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that reconstruction was significantly related to a more successful outcome, compared with endourological procedures (HR 0.052, 95% CI 0.007-0.394, p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Reconstruction performs better than endourological procedures in surgical outcome. Endourological procedure provides an acceptable success rate in patients with stricture shorter than 1 cm and slight hydronephrosis. Most stricture recurrence appeared within the first year postoperatively.
