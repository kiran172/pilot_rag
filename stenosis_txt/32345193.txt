Title: [The Incidence and Possible Predictors of Coronary Restenosis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Assess time and possible predictors of restenosis after the implantation of first- and second-generation coronary stents and bare metal stents (BMSs) in patients with stable coronary artery disease after elective coronary stenting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2010 to 2014, 3,732 (2,897 males, 60 [53; 68] years old) patients with stable exertional angina of functional class I-III underwent coronary stenting. From 2014 to 2017, 1,487 (1,173 males and 314 females) patients returned. Repeat coronary angiography was performed in 699 patients.
RESULTS: A total of 644 first-generation stents, 5,321 second-generation stents, and 473 BMSs were implanted. During the control coronary angiography, contrasting was repeated for 193 first-generation stents, 899 second-generation stents, and 77 BMSs. Restenosis (stenosis of 50 % or more in the previously stented segment) was detected in 28 (14 % of angiographic control) first-generation drug-eluting stents, 94 (10 %) second-generation drug-eluting stents, and 21 (27 %) BMSs. Patients with BMS restenosis returned significantly earlier than patients with restenosis of the first- and second-generation drug-eluting stents (11 [6, 27] months vs. 32 [11; 48]) months and 24 [12; 42] months, respectively; p&lt;0.05). The initial and repeat levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were higher in patients with restenosis (2.2 [1.2, 5.0] mg / L vs. 2.1 [1.0, 4.6] mg / L, respectively; p&gt; 0.05) than in patients without restenosis (2.0 [0.9, 4.2] mg / L vs. 1.9 [0.7, 3.5] mg / L respectively, p&gt;0.05). Blood levels of hs-CRP ≥2 mg / L according to receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis at return visit were used as a predictor to identify restenosis of stents with a diameter &lt;3 mm and a length &gt;25 mm - area under the curve (AUC) 0.67 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.84), p &lt;0.05, odds ratio 3.7 (95 % CI 1.1-12.1), p&lt;0.05. Stent type had a significant effect on the time to restenosis in the survival analysis (p&lt;0.0005).
CONCLUSION: The time from coronary stenting to the return visit of patients presenting with restenosis after the implantation of first- and second-generation drug-eluting stents is consistent; median time of the return visit of patients with restenosis of the first-generation stents was 2-3 years after coronary stenting. Blood levels of hs-CRP ≥2 mg / L at the return visit is a predictor of restenosis of stents with a diameter &lt;3 mm and a length &gt;25 mm.
