Title: Comparison of left ventricular with right ventricular rapid pacing on tamponade during TAVI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Small studies have suggested left ventricular (LV) rapid pacing has similar safety and efficacy to conventional right ventricular (RV) rapid pacing in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, there are limited data on the comparative rates of tamponade. The study compared the rate of cardiac tamponade between LV and RV-pacing during TAVI.
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2021, 1226 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral or transaxillary TAVI were included. 470(38.3%) patients had TAVI deployment with RV-pacing and 756(61.7%) with LV-pacing. The primary outcome was the frequency and cause of cardiac tamponade. Secondary outcomes included efficacy, procedure duration and crossover rates.
RESULTS: There was a trend to less tamponade with LV-pacing, which did not reach statistical significance [11(2.3%) vs 11(1.5%);P = 0.27]. There was no significant difference in the frequency of tamponade due to annular tear [4(0.9%) vs 9(1.2%);P = 0.59] or LV free-wall perforation [1(0.2%) vs 2(0.3%);P = 0.86]. The frequency of tamponade due to RV perforation was significantly lower in the LV-pacing group [0 vs 6(2.3%);P < 0.005)]. Two patients with tamponade due to RV perforation required emergency sternotomy of whom one died. Deployment success was similar (99% vs 99.6%;P=NS). Procedure duration was shorter with LV-pacing (70 vs 80 mins;P < 0.005). Crossover to RV-pacing was low (0.9%). There were no embolizations caused by loss-of-capture in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: LV-pacing appears equally efficacious and is associated with a lower risk of tamponade due to RV perforation caused by the temporary pacing wire. LV-pacing was not associated with an increased risk of tamponade due to LV free-wall perforation.
