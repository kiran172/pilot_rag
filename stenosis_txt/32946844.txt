Title: Surgical Techniques in Management of Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis in Children.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple techniques exist for the repair of supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), but given the lesion's rarity, analyses comparing the efficacy of each repair have been limited.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all children at a single institution who underwent repair of SVAS from June 1995 to May 2019 was performed. Anatomic and physiologic measurements across time points were compared between 2 predominant surgical techniques. Time-to-event outcomes were compared using the log-rank test.
RESULTS: SVAS was repaired in 89 patients, by using a single-patch in 31 (35%) and the Doty repair in 58 (65%). Median age at operation was 2.5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.0 to 6.8 years), with median follow-up of 5.8 years (IQR, 1.8 to 10.7 years). Reoperation was required in 8 (9%) patients at a median of 1.5 years postoperatively (IQR, 0.3 to 4.8 years). There was 1 death after multiple reinterventions. The change from the preoperative to the postoperative sinotubular junction z-score was greater for patients after Doty repair (median change +2.5; IQR, 1.5, 4.1) than for patients after single-patch repair (median change +0.8; IQR, -0.1, 2.1; P = .001). Freedom from reoperation was longer for patients after Doty repair than after the single-patch technique (P = .008).
CONCLUSIONS: The Doty repair provides longer freedom from reoperation after supravalvular aortic stenosis repair compared with a single-patch technique, likely through a greater increase in the sinotubular junction at the time of initial operation.
