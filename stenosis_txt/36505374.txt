Title: Coronary microvascular dysfunction as assessed by angiography-derived index of microvascular resistance co-localizes with and may explain the presence of ischemia in stress-cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the absence of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Ischemia with no obstructive coronary disease (INOCA) is a frequent phenomenon in the cath lab. A possible cause is coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which may be assessed by invasive testing with possible complications; therefore, less invasive approaches have emerged, such as the angiography-derived index of microvascular resistance (aIMR). The aim of our study was to investigate the association of single-vessel aIMR as a measure of CMD with areas of INOCA in stress testing.
METHODS: We measured aIMR in 286 vessels from 102 patients undergoing both stress cMRI and coronary angiography. Groups were (a) INOCA group (93 vessels, 32 patients); (b) coronary artery disease (CAD) control group (116 vessels, 42 patients) with ischemia due to relevant stenosis; and (c) control group (77 vessels, 28 patients) without ischemia or relevant stenosis.
RESULTS: INOCA patients presented higher mean aIMR (28.3 ± 5.7) compared to both CAD patients (17.4 ± 5.7, p &lt; 0.001) and controls (22.1 ± 5.9, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, in INOCA patients aIMR was significantly increased (33.0 ± 8.1 vs. 25.8 ± 6.3, p = 0.021) in vessels with vs. without ischemia. Single vessel aIMR presented a very good diagnostic efficiency in detecting INOCA [AUC 0.865 (0.804-0.925), optimal cut-off 27.1, p &lt; 0.001].
CONCLUSION: CMD, as assessed by 3-vessel aIMR, co-localizes with and may explain the presence of ischemia in stress-cMRI in INOCA.
