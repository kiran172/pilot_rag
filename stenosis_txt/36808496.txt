Title: [Results of a single center vascular screening program in Germany].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in Europe with a relevant socioeconomic burden. A screening program for vascular diseases in asymptomatic persons with a defined risk constellation can lead to an early diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: The study examined a screening program for carotid stenosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in persons without any known vascular disease with respect to demographic data, risk factors, pre-existing conditions, medication intake, detection of pathological findings and/or findings requiring treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Test subjects were invited using various information material and filled in a questionnaire on cardiovascular risk factors. The screening took place with measurement of the ABI and duplex sonography as a monocentric prospective single arm study within 1 year. Endpoints were the prevalence of risk factors and pathological and/or results requiring treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 391 persons participated, 36% presented with at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor, 35.5% with 2 and 14.4% with 3 or more. The sonography showed results requiring control with a carotid stenosis of < 50-> 75% or occlusion in 9%. An AAA with a diameter of 3.0-4.5 cm was diagnosed in 0.9% and a pathological ABI < 0.9 or > 1.3 in 12.3%. The indications for a pharmacotherapy were found in 17% and no operation was recommended.
CONCLUSION: The practicability of a screening program for carotid stenosis, PAOD and AAA of a defined risk population was shown. Vascular pathologies that required treatment were hardly found in the catchment area of the hospital. Consequently, the implementation of this screening program in Germany based on the collected data cannot currently be recommended in this form.
