Title: Comparison of clinical outcomes in patients with mixed angina and pure vasospastic angina.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study investigated differences in clinical outcomes between mixed angina (MA) and pure vasospastic angina (PVA).
METHODS: A total of 524 vasospastic angina patients who did or did not have >50% coronary artery stenosis from January 2005 to January 2021 were divided into two groups (Group 1: PVA, N  = 399; Group 2: MA, N  = 125) and then three groups [Group 1: PVA, N  = 399; Group 2: MA without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), N  = 67; Group 3: MA with PCI, N  = 58] for assessment. We recorded the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE: the composite of death, myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or rehospitalization) during 3-year clinical follow-up.
RESULTS: Compared to the PVA group, there were significant differences in MACCE (20.8% vs. 11.8%, P  = 0.011) and rehospitalization (20.0% vs. 9.8%, P  = 0.002) in the MA group. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients in the MA with PCI group had the highest cumulative incidence rate of MACCE during the 3-year follow-up (log-rank P  < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Compared with the PVA patients, MA patients had significantly worse clinical outcomes during long-term follow-up.
