Title: Skull shape abnormalities in ischemic cerebrovascular and mental diseases in adults.

Abstract: Morphological changes in the child skull due to mechanical and metabolic stimulation and synostosis of the suture are well known. On the other hand, few studies have focused on clinical conditions relevant for adult skull deformity. We retrospectively reviewed computed tomography (CT) findings obtained from 365 cases that were treated for head injuries, moyamoya disease, cervical internal carotid artery stenosis, and mental diseases, and investigated the morphological changes in the skull associated with these diseases. The findings from head injuries were used not only for control subjects, but also for the analysis of generational changes in skull shape based on birth year. Head shape had a brachiocephalic tendency with occipital flattening in people born from the 1950s onwards. Cases of moyamoya disease, cervical internal carotid artery stenosis, and mental diseases showed significantly thicker frontal and occipital bone than those of control subjects. The skull thickening was especially noticeable in the frontal bone in moyamoya disease. Plagiocephaly was significantly frequent in moyamoya disease. These uncommon skull shapes are useful CT findings in screening subjects for early evidence of mental diseases and intracranial ischemic diseases with arterial stenosis.
