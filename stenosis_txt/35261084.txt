Title: Impact of a shorter replacement interval of plastic stents on premature stent exchange rate in benign and malignant biliary strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: The main disadvantage of plastic stents is the high rate of stent occlusion. The usual replacement interval of biliary plastic stents is 3 months. This study aimed to investigate if a shorter interval of 6-8 weeks impacts the median premature exchange rate (mPER) in benign and malignant biliary strictures.
METHODS: All cases with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and plastic stent placement were retrospectively analyzed since establishing an elective replacement interval of every 6-8 weeks at our institution and mPER was determined.
RESULTS: A total of 3979 ERCPs (1199 patients) were analyzed, including 1262 (31.7%) malignant and 2717 (68.3%) benign cases, respectively. The median stent patency (mSP) was 41 days (range 14-120) for scheduled stent exchanges, whereas it was 17 days (1-75) for prematurely exchanged stents. The mPER was significantly higher for malignant (28.1%, 35-50%) compared with benign strictures (15.2%, 10-28%), P < 0.0001, respectively. mSP was significantly shorter in cases with only one stent (34 days [1-87] vs 41 days [1-120]) and in cases with only a 7-Fr stent (28 days [2-79]) compared with a larger stent (34 days [1-87], P = 0.001). Correspondingly, mPER was significantly higher in cases with only one stent (23% vs 16.2%, P < 0.0001) and only a 7-Fr stent (31.3% vs 22.4%, P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: A shorter replacement interval does not seem to lead to a clinically meaningful reduction of mPER in benign and malignant strictures. Large stents and multiple stenting should be favored as possible.
