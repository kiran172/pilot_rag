Title: [Application of acellular dermal matrix in prevention of laryngeal stenosis in glottic carcinoma].

Abstract: Objective:To investigate the effect of acellular dermal matrix in preventing laryngeal stenosis in glottic carcinoma patients. Methods:Fifty-five patients with glottic carcinoma（T2, T3） from February 2018 to December 2022 were divided into experimental group（28 cases） and control group（27 cases） according to their wishes. Acellular dermal matrix was placed in the operation cavity in the experimental group after laryngofission, while control group 12 cases were sutured by pulling the upper and lower edges, 15 cases were repaired with sternohyoid muscle fascia flap. Results:In the experimental group, 1 case had laryngeal stenosis caused by laryngeal mucosa swelling after operation, and extubated successfully after symptomatic treatment. In the control group, 7 cases had laryngeal stenosis after operation, of which 3 cases were caused by granulation tissue hyperplasia in laryngeal cavity, and extubated after symptomatic treatment. 2 cases extubated after operation suffered from progressive dyspnea during radiotherapy, and underwent tracheotomy again, extubation successful after treatment. 2 cases caused by laryngeal mucosa swelling, after symptomatic treatment, one case was successfully extubated, and one case had long-term intubation. The laryngeal stenosis rate of the experimental group was 3.6%（1/28） , which was lower than control group 25.9%（7/27）, and the therapeutic effect of the experimental group was significantly better than control group （χ²=5.526, P=0.019）. Conclusion:Implanting acellular dermal matrix in the operation cavity of glottic carcinoma can reduce the occurrence of laryngeal stenosis and have satisfactory preventive effect on laryngeal stenosis.
