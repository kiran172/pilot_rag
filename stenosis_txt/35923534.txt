Title: Drug-coated balloon angioplasty for severe pulmonary vein stenosis resulting from cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: We performed a drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for severe pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis resulting from cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation. Three and fourteen months after the angioplasty, follow-up multidetector computed tomography did not show restenosis. Lesion regression was observed at 14-month follow-up. Two years after PV angioplasty with DCB, the patient was well without any symptoms. DCB angioplasty may become an alternative effective procedure for PV stenosis.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: The usefulness and safety of drug-coated balloon angioplasty for severe pulmonary vein stenosis resulting from cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation was observed at 14-month follow-up.
