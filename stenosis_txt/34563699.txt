Title: Optimal Medical Therapy Following Deep Venous Interventions: Proceedings from the Society of Interventional Radiology Foundation Research Consensus Panel.

Abstract: The optimal medical management of patients following endovascular deep venous interventions remains ill-defined. As such, the Society of Interventional Radiology Foundation (SIRF) convened a multidisciplinary group of experts in a virtual Research Consensus Panel (RCP) to develop a prioritized research agenda regarding antithrombotic therapy following deep venous interventions. The panelists presented the gaps in knowledge followed by discussion and ranking of research priorities based on clinical relevance, overall impact, and technical feasibility. The following research topics were identified as high priority: 1) characterization of biological processes leading to in-stent stenosis/rethrombosis; 2) identification and validation of methods to assess venous flow dynamics and their effect on stent failure; 3) elucidation of the role of inflammation and anti-inflammatory therapies; and 4) clinical studies to compare antithrombotic strategies and improve venous outcome assessment. Collaborative, multicenter research is necessary to answer these questions and thereby enhance the care of patients with venous disease.
