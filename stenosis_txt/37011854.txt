Title: Incidental detection of malignancy during preprocedural workup for transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A longitudinal cohort study.

Abstract: The aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate the prevalence and prognostic importance of incidental malignancy detected during pre-TAVI computed tomography. Among 579 patients, CT-work-up for TAVI exposed previously undetected malignancy in 4.5% of patients. TAVI patients with a new malignancy had a 2.9-fold increased risk of death at 1 year, and a 16 month shorter mean survival time compared to patients with no malignancy.
