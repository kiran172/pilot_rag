Title: Low-dose CT perfusion with combined use of CTP and CTP-derived coronary CT angiography at 70 kVp: validation with invasive fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diagnostic performance of 70-kVp stress dynamic myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) as a low-dose, one-stop cardiac CT examination in clinical application.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive symptomatic patients were prospectively recruited and scanned with stress dynamic myocardial CTP. The CTP phase with the best enhancement of the coronary arteries was selected and extracted as the CTP-derived single-phase coronary CT angiography (SP-CTA). The diagnostic performance of CTP and CTP+SP-CTA for functionally significant CAD was assessed. Invasive coronary angiography and fractional flow reserve were used as the reference standard for the myocardial ischemia evaluation.
RESULTS: In total, 71 patients (43 men and 28 women; 63.6 ± 8.8 years old) underwent the stress dynamic myocardial CTP; 63 vessels (36.2%) from 42 of the patients (59.2%) were identified as causing ischemia. On a per-vessel basis, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy for CTP and CTP+SP-CTA were 77.8%, 93.7%, 87.5%, 88.1%, and 87.9% and 84.1%, 93.7%, 88.3%, 91.2%, and 90.2%, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of CTP+SP-CTA (AUC = 0.963; 95%CI, 0.938-0.989) was significantly superior to that of CTP (AUC = 0.922; 95%CI, 0.880-0.964) and that of SP-CTA (AUC = 0.833; 95%CI, 0.765-0.900) alone (all p < 0.01). The mean radiation dose of the CTP examination was 3.8 ± 1.4 mSv.
CONCLUSION: CTP-derived SP-CTA improved the diagnostic value of CTP. With a promising performance of myocardial ischemia detection and low radiation dose, the innovative low-dose, one-stop CTP examination is clinically feasible for patients who need to receive a myocardial perfusion assessment.
KEY POINTS: • Myocardial CTP performed well in the evaluation of hemodynamically significant CAD. • CTP-derived single-phase CCTA improved the diagnostic value of CTP. • The combined use of low-dose CTP and CTP-derived CCTA at 70 kVp is clinically feasible for CAD patients who need to receive a myocardial perfusion assessment.
