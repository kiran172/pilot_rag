Title: Confocal endomicroscopy for the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions.

Abstract: Confocal endomicroscopy (EMC) is a thriving technology that allows real-time and non-invasive imaging in vivo. EMC demonstrated its effectiveness to differentiate neoplastic from normal tissue and to search dysplasia. In addition to the significant developments of this technique in Barrett oesophagus, celiac disease, characterization of colonic polyps, or monitoring of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, EMC is currently developing in bilio-pancreatic pathology. Indeed, it is currently used to characterize biliary stenosis as well as pancreatic lesions (especially cystic). The aim of our study was to evaluate through a review of the literature the value of this technique in the characterization of pancreatic lesions.
