Title: Nonhyperemic Pressure Ratios-All the Same or Nuanced Differences?

Abstract: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) has become the gold standard for invasively assessing the functional significance of coronary artery disease (CAD) to guide revascularization. The amount of evidence supporting the role of FFR in the cardiac catheterization laboratory is large and still growing. However, FFR uptake in the daily practice is limited by a variety of factors such as invasive instrumentation of the coronary artery that requires extra time and need for vasodilator medications for hyperemia. In this review, we describe the details of wire-based alternatives to FFR, providing insights as to their development, clinical evidence, and limitations.
