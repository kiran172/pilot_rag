Title: Living donor kidney transplant following nephrectomy for renal artery stenosis with arterial reconstruction and viability assessment using ex vivo normothermic perfusion.

Abstract: Ex vivo normothermic perfusion (EVNP) is increasingly recognised as a viability tool to increase organ utilisation in deceased donor transplantation. We report the use of EVNP to assess graft perfusion quality following indication nephrectomy and back-bench arterial reconstruction in a case of renal artery stenosis, unamenable to endovascular treatment. Once explanted, it was not possible to effectively cold perfuse the graft through the main renal artery or collaterals. An arterial reconstruction was performed with patch angioplasty using the largest collateral creating a single common stem. EVNP was used to assess organ perfusion and, therefore, viability. Excellent global perfusion was evident alongside urine production, demonstrating that the arterial reconstruction was satisfactory. A patient with end-stage renal disease was consented with particular attention to the uncertainty of the underlying donor disease process and long-term outcome of the reconstruction. Primary function was achieved and recipient estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) remains stable at 58 mL/min/1.73 m² at 6 months.
