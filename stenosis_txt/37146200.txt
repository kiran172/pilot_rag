Title: The impact of moderate aortic stenosis in acute myocardial infarction: A multicenter retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with myocardial ischemia through different mechanisms and may impair coronary arterial flow. However, data on the impact of moderate AS in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) is limited.
AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of moderate AS in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (MI).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who presented with acute MI to all Mayo Clinic hospitals, using the Enterprise Mayo PCI Database from 2005 to 2016. Patients were stratified into two groups: moderate AS and mild/no AS. The primary outcome was all cause mortality.
RESULTS: The moderate AS group included 183 (13.3%) patients, and the mild/no AS group included 1190 (86.7%) patients. During hospitalization, there was no difference between both groups in mortality. Patients with moderate AS had higher in-hospital congestive heart failure (CHF) (8.2% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.025) compared with mild/no AS patients. At 1-year follow-up, patients with moderate AS had higher mortality (23.9% vs. 8.1%, p < 0.001) and higher CHF hospitalization (8.3% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.028). In multivariate analysis, moderate AS was associated with higher mortality at 1-year (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval [1.4-4.1], p = 0.002). In subgroup analyses, moderate AS increased all-cause mortality in STEMI and NSTEMI patients.
CONCLUSION: The presence of moderate AS in acute MI patients was associated with worse clinical outcomes during hospitalization and at 1-year follow-up. These unfavorable outcomes highlight the need for a close follow-up of these patients and for timely therapeutic strategies to best manage these coexisting conditions.
