Title: Ocular Ischemic Syndrome and Its Related Experimental Models.

Abstract: Ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) is one of the severe ocular disorders occurring from stenosis or occlusion of the carotid arteries. As the ophthalmic artery is derived from the branch of the carotid artery, stenosis or occlusion of the carotid arteries could induce chronic ocular hypoperfusion, finally leading to the development of OIS. To date, the pathophysiology of OIS is still not clearly unraveled. To better explore the pathophysiology of OIS, several experimental models have been developed in rats and mice. Surgical occlusion or stenosis of common carotid arteries or internal carotid arteries was conducted bilaterally or unilaterally for model development. In this regard, final ischemic outcomes in the eye varied depending on the surgical procedure, even though similar findings on ocular hypoperfusion could be observed. In the current review, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of OIS from various experimental models, as well as several clinical cases. Moreover, we cover the status of current therapies for OIS along with promising preclinical treatments with recent advances. Our review will enable more comprehensive therapeutic approaches to prevent the development and/or progression of OIS.
