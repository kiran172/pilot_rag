Title: The Modified History of Juvenile Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis Following Percutaneous Transmitral Commissurotomy: Intermediate-Term Outcomes From a Decadal Follow-Up Study.

Abstract: AIM: There are few studies that have looked at the long-term outcomes of juvenile mitral stenosis (JMS) following percutaneous transmitral commissurotomy (PTMC). This study sought to analyse the modified history of JMS in children following PTMC.
METHOD: We describe a longitudinal, observational follow-up study of all children and young adults aged <20 years who underwent PTMC at Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bangalore, India from 2012 to 2021. Children were followed up for progression of mitral stenosis (MS), development of mitral regurgitation (MR), need for repeat interventions (percutaneous or surgical), and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 114 children and adolescents underwent the procedure. The mean age of children in the study was 15.1Â±2.5 years. After immediate procedural success, there was a tendency towards restenosis with respect to valve areas and transmitral gradients at follow-up. Severe MR after the procedure was noted in 2.6%. Compliance with penicillin prophylaxis was noted in 42.5%. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate over 10 years showed a mortality rate of 1.98/100 patient-years and a re-intervention rate (re-do PTMC or surgery) of 5.50/100 patient-years. Additional valvular lesions were noted in 13.1% of children during follow-up. Severe symptomatic status at presentation (New York Heart Association class 4) was predictive of mortality, and children aged <15 years often needed re-intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: With a mortality rate of 6.1% and re-do intervention rate of 15.8% during extended follow-up, JMS has considerable healthcare implications in terms of morbidity and mortality in children and young adults.
