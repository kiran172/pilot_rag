Title: Mucosal Congestion on the First Day Following Endoscopy Predicts Anastomotic Stricture After Esophagectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anastomotic stricture is a relatively common postoperative complication after esophagectomy. Previous studies have indicated that impaired perioperative blood perfusion at the anastomosis is associated with the occurrence of stricture. Therefore, we analyzed the association between endoscopically assessed blood perfusion during the early postoperative period and anastomotic stricture.
METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated patients who underwent esophagectomy at Tokyo Medical and Dental University between 2010 and 2015. The patients had undergone nasal endoscopy on the 1st and 8th postoperative days. The findings were used to evaluate blood perfusion at the anastomosis and gastric tube, which was classified based on mucosal color as ischemia (white) or congestion (blue or black). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for anastomotic stricture.
RESULTS: The study included 197 patients and anastomotic stricture was observed in 60 patients (30.4%). The multivariable analysis revealed that postoperative gastric tube congestion was a risk factor for stricture (odds ratio [OR]: 6.440, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.660-15.600; p < 0.001). Lower risks of anastomotic stricture were associated with pathological stage III-IV disease (OR: 0.325, 95% CI: 0.161-0.656; p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that endoscopically detected congestion at the anastomosis on the first postoperative day was a risk factor for anastomotic stricture.
