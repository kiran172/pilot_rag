Title: [To optimize the management of patients after tracheostomy and reconstructive operations on larynx and trachea].

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The relevance of the study is due to the need to improve the methods of managing patients after reconstructive surgery on the larynx and trachea.
OBJECTIVES: To optimize the management of wounds after tracheostomy and/or reconstuctive operations on larynx and trachea on the basis of use of modern dressings in the inpatient and outpatient settings.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were divided into two: group I tracheostomy after reconstructive operations on the larynx and trachea. The postoperative area was ligated with drugs based on sodium alginate. Tracheostomy of group II patients was carried out according to the standard technique.
RESULTS: In the first group of patients, postoperative wounds healed by primary intention on the 5-6th day after the operation in patients with bilateral paralysis of the larynx and on the 8-10th day in patients with chronic cicatricial stenosis of the larynx and trachea. In group II, postoperative wounds in the tracheostomy foramen area healed on day 7 in patients with bilateral paralysis of the larynx and on days 10-14 in patients with chronic cicatricial stenosis of the larynx and trachea.
CONCLUSIONS: The Proposed algorithm for the management of patients after reconstructive operations on the larynx and trachea, of tracheostomy have improved clinical outcomes after surgery and to reduce the economic costs for this group of patients.
