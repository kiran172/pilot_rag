Title: Interpreting the ECG in patients with chest pain and right bundle branch block: A case report.

Abstract: A patient with right bundle branch block (RBBB) presented with chest pain. An ECG showed ST-elevation in leads V1, V2, and aVR, with widespread ST-depression in leads II, aVF, I, aVL, and V4-6. The initial ECG interpretation missed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as ST-elevation thresholds were not reached. Non-urgent angiography showed severe left anterior descending artery stenosis requiring percutaneous coronary intervention. The course was complicated by cardiac arrest necessitating resuscitation and dual chamber pacemaker placement with left bundle branch pacing. This case report outlines the deficiencies of the current voltage criteria for identification of anterior STEMI in patients with RBBB.
