Title: [Characteristics of single subcortical small infarction in the middle cerebral artery territory].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the characteristics and possible mechanisms of differtent stroke patterns of single subcortical small infarction (SSSI) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. Methods: The clinical and imaging data of patients with acute SSSI in MCA territory admitted to the Neurology Department of People's Hospital of Zhengzhou City from January 2016 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the presence of MCA stenosis and whether the lesion sites on axial DWI-MRI involved the lowest basal ganglia, SSSl were divided into different patterns. The clinical and imaging characteristics of patients with different stroke patterns were compared. Results: Of the 91 patients, 24 (26.37%) were SSSI with parental artery disease (SSSIPAD), 28 (30.77%) were proximal SSSI without PAD (pSSSI-PAD) and 39 (42.86%) were distal SSSI without PAD (dSSSI-PAD). There were significant differences in age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, NIHSS score, low density lipoprotein cholesterin (LDL-C) level, infarct layers â‰¥3, lesion diameter, white matter hyperintensity, lacunar infarction, enlarged perivascular space, cerebral microbleed, concomitant intracranial and extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis among the three groups (all P&lt;0.05). Compared with SSSIPAD(-), patients with SSSIPAD(+) had significantly higher prevalence of smoking, proximal SSSI, ICAS, ECAS, NIHSS score, LDL-C level and larger lesion diameter (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The clinical characteristics and imaging features were different among different SSSI stroke patterns. SSSIPAD is an important infarct type. pSSSI-PAD may showed intermediate features of SSSIPAD and dSSSI-PAD, and evidence of atherosclerosis should be carefully searched for such patients.
