Title: Challenges and experience of setting up an aortic service.

Abstract: Aortic surgery is a complex procedure posing high risks in comparison to other adult cardiac surgeries. Novel surgical approaches including minimally invasive procedures, sutureless aortic valve replacement, and transcatheter aortic valve implantation have been found to be acceptable alternatives to conventional surgeries. In addition, novel endovascular repair techniques and hybrid procedures have been introduced for the management of patients with thoracoabdominal aortic pathologies. However, these modalities are not readily available in every center, and such novel procedures impose a learning curve for surgeons and high costs for affected patients. In this review, we discuss the challenges of setting up an aortic service, having regard to the Iranian experience.
