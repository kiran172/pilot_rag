Title: Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement on Severity of Chronic Kidney Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effect of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on kidney function stage in patients with aortic stenosis remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that in some patients, TAVR results in improved kidney function by alleviating cardiorenal syndrome.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess change in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage following TAVR, identify variables associated with pre- and post-TAVR estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and assess association of post-TAVR eGFR with mortality.
METHODS: Patients (n = 5,190) receiving TAVR in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 1, 2, and PARTNER 2 S3 trials between April 2007 and October 2014 were included. Pre-TAVR and procedural variables associated with post-TAVR eGFR, change in CKD stage at ≤7 days post-TAVR, and association of post-TAVR eGFR on intermediate-term mortality were assessed.
RESULTS: At baseline, CKD stage ≥2 was present in 91% of patients. CKD stage either improved or was unchanged following TAVR in the majority of patients (77% stage 1, 90% stage 2, 89% stage 3A, 94% stage 3B, and 99% stage 4). Progression to CKD stage 5 occurred in 1 (0.035%) of 2,892 patients within 7 days post-TAVR. Of 3,546 patients in whom data were available, 70 (2.0%) underwent post-TAVR dialysis. Higher pre-TAVR eGFR and transfemoral approach were strongly associated with higher post-TAVR eGFR. Lower baseline and longitudinal post-TAVR eGFR were associated with lower intermediate-term survival.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR, even with baseline impaired eGFR, CKD stage is more likely to stay the same or improve than worsen. Aortic stenosis may contribute to cardiorenal syndrome that improves with TAVR.
