Title: Midterm Results of an Algorithmic 3-Pronged Approach to Bicuspid Aortic Valve Repair.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluated midterm outcomes of a 3-pronged algorithm for bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) repair. Valve-sparing root reimplantation (VSRR) was performed for patients with aortic root dilatation. In those without a root aneurysm, external subannular ring (ESAR) was performed for annuli ≥28 mm and subcommissural annuloplasty (SCA) for annuli <28 mm.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 242 patients undergoing primary BAV repair from April 29, 2004, to March 1, 2023, at a single institution. Primary end points were mortality, structural valve degeneration (SVD), which was defined as a composite of more than moderate aortic insufficiency or severe aortic stenosis, and reintervention.
RESULTS: The algorithm was used to treat 201 patients; of these, 130 underwent VSRR, 35 had ESAR, and 36 underwent SCA. Most were men with mean age of 43.8 years (SD, 12.0 years), which was similar between groups. Preoperative aortic insufficiency more than moderate was more common for ESAR compared with VSRR and SCA (74.3% vs 37.7% vs 44.4%, P < .001). At 30 days, mortality was 0.8% (n = 1) for VSRR and 0% for ESAR and SCA. At 6 years, overall Kaplan-Meier survival was 98.9% (95% CI, 97.3%-100%), with no differences between groups (P = .5). The cumulative incidence of SVD was 4.7% (95% CI, 0.1%-9.2%) for VSRR, 6.4% (95% CI, 0%-14.6%) for ESAR, and 0% for SCA (P = .4). Similarly, the cumulative incidence of reintervention with all-cause mortality as a competing risk was 2.2% (95% CI, 0.4%-6.9%), 6.1% (95% CI, 1%-17.9%), and 0% for VSRR, ESAR, and SCA, respectively (P = .506).
CONCLUSIONS: A 3-pronged algorithmic approach to BAV repair results in excellent survival and freedom from reoperation at 6 years.
