Title: Frequency, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis in Stroke Patients From the Southern Region of Saudi Arabia.

Abstract: Background Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis (ICAS) represents a noteworthy cerebrovascular pathology linked to ischemic stroke, contributing to a considerable burden of morbidity and mortality on a global scale. The present study was undertaken with the primary objective of investigating the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of ICAS in stroke patients within the Southern Region of Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care hospital located in the southern region of Saudi Arabia, from June 2022 to December 2022. The study population consisted of patients aged 18 years and above who were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke during the designated research period. Patients with hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or incomplete medical records were excluded from the analysis. Data pertaining to the patients were retrieved from their respective medical records. Results Out of 201 patients admitted with stroke, 92 (45.77%) were found to have intracranial stenosis. The majority of patients were female (52.2%) and aged over 55 years (60.9%). The presence of hypertension exhibited a statistically significant correlation with varying degrees of stenosis (p=0.02), as did ischemic heart disease and obesity (p=0.04) and active smoking (p=0.01). Hypertension displayed a marginal association with intracranial stenosis, with an odds ratio of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.25, 4.11) and a p-value of 0.02. Similarly, dyslipidemia showed a potential correlation, with an odds ratio of 1.16 (95% CI: 0.44, 3.03) and a p-value of 0.014. On the other hand, obesity showed a stronger association, with an odds ratio of 4.53 (95% CI: 1.05, 19.51) and a p-value of 0.04. Among the patients, 25 (27.17%) underwent revascularization procedures, while 44 (47.83%) were not eligible for such intervention. During the three-month follow-up, 4 (16%) experienced an ipsilateral stroke, and 3 (12%) suffered from a contralateral transient ischemic attack (TIA). Encouragingly, 18 (72%) of the treated patients showed no recurrence during the follow-up period. Conclusion This study concludes that approximately half (45.77%) of stroke patients had intracranial stenosis, and significant associations were found between varying degrees of stenosis and hypertension, ischemic heart disease, obesity, and active smoking. Hypertension demonstrated a marginal correlation, while obesity exhibited a stronger association with intracranial stenosis.
