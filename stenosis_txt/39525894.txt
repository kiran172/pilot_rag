Title: Fibroepithelial polyp in the urethra: Diagnostic challenges and endoscopic treatment outcomes.

Abstract: Fibroepithelial polyps (FEPs) are rare benign tumors that can occur in the urinary tract and are especially uncommon in the urethra. This report presents a case of a young man with obstructive symptoms caused by a urethral polyp, which was treated endoscopically. Fibroepithelial polyps can be a cause of urethral stenosis in young men and may also be encountered during the treatment of other causes of urethral narrowing.
