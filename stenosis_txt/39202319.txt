Title: The Possible Associations between Tauopathies and Atherosclerosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Dyslipidemias, Metabolic Syndrome and Niemann-Pick Disease.

Abstract: Clinical evaluation and treatment of tauopathic syndromes remain a challenge. There is a growing interest in theories concerning their possible associations with metabolic diseases. The possible connection between those diseases might be linked with cerebrovascular dysfunction. The endothelial cell damage and impairment of the blood-brain barrier observed in atherosclerosis or diabetes may play a role in contributing to tauopathic syndrome development. Additionally, the inflammation evoked by pathological metabolic changes may also be involved in this process. Multiple cases indicate the coexistence of metabolic disorders and tauopathic syndromes. These findings suggest that modifying the evolution of metabolic and cerebrovascular diseases may impact the course of neurodegenerative diseases. Obtained data could indicate the possible benefits of introducing routine carotid artery sonography, revascularization operation or antihypertensive medications among patients at high risk for tauopathies. This review has identified this understudied area, which is currently associated with several diseases for which there is no treatment. Due to the pathomechanisms linking metabolic diseases and tauopathies, further investigation of this area of research, including cohort studies, is recommended and may provide new pharmacological perspectives for treatment.
