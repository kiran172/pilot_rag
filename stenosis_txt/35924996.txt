Title: The current practice of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in China.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to summarize the current practice and experience of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in China.
METHODS: The relevant articles were identified through computerized searches of the CNKI, WANFANG, VIP, and PubMed databases through February 1, 2022, using the search terms: "transcatheter aortic valve replacement," "transcatheter aortic valve implantation," "China."
RESULTS: The database searches identified 22 articles, 2092 patients, 57.65% were male, with a mean age of 74.2 ± 6.0 years, 71.51% of patients were classified by New York Heart Association as class Ⅲ/Ⅳ, Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 8.4 ± 4.1, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 52.8 ± 14.2%, mean transvalvular aortic pressure gradient 59.9 ± 18.9 mmHg. The overall procedural success rate was 97.85%, and 2.15% of patients were converted to sternotomy, mainly due to transcatheter aortic bioprosthesis dislocation. The most common vascular access approach was transfemoral (1071 patients, 51.20%). General anesthesia (48.90%) was the commonly used anesthesia technique. The incidence of postprocedural complications was as follows: permanent pacemaker implantation (10.47%), bleeding events (8.60%), mild paravalvular leakage (17.73%), moderate and severe paravalvular leakage (4.16%), vascular complications (3.30%), stroke (1.43%), respectively. The overall periprocedural period and postprocedural 30-day mortality was 2.72%.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement in China, device implantation success was achieved in 97.85% of cases. The most common vascular access approach was transfemoral. General anesthesia was the most commonly used anesthetic technique. Paravalvular leakage (458 patients, 21.89%) was the most common complication.
