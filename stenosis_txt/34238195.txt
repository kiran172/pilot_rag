Title: Contrast-induced Nephropathy in Non-cardiac Vascular Procedures, A Narrative Review: Part 2.

Abstract: This is Part 2 of a narrative review summarizing the literature on CIN after non-cardiac vascular diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, focusing on Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and Renal Artery Stenosis (RAS). Part 1 discussed CIN in relation to aortic aneurysms and carotid stenosis. We comment on the incidence, biomarkers, risk factors and consequences of CIN in patients with PAD or RAS, as well as on strategies to prevent CIN. Future perspectives in the field of CIN in relation to non-cardiac vascular procedures are also considered.
