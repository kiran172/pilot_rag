Title: Secondary sclerosing cholangitis from percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage in a patient with gallbladder cancer after surgery: A case report.

Abstract: Secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by fibrosis and stricture of the bile ducts. SSC in association with multiple factors such as spontaneous choledochoduodenal fistula and metastatic gallbladder cancer has rarely been reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, reports of SSC after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), especially in cases with diffuse calcification of the bile duct walls, have not been reported. We report a case of SSC from PTBD in a patient with gallbladder cancer after surgery. The patient underwent external percutaneous biliary drainage for malignant bile duct obstruction after cholecystectomy. Repeated exchanges were performed at the first and the sixth month after PTBD using an internal and external drainage catheter. Two months after the third catheter exchange, findings of laboratory and imaging examinations were suggestive of SSC. The liver function tests of the patient were suggestive of cholestasis. Multidetector computed tomography showed diffuse calcification of the bile duct walls. Cholangiography showed intrahepatic biliary stenosis or dilatation.
