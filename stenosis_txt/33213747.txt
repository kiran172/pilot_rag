Title: Risk of Coronary Obstruction Due to Sinus Sequestration in Redo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of coronary obstruction due to sinus sequestration in redo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using post-TAVR computed tomography (CT).
BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding the risk of coronary obstruction due to sinus sequestration in redo TAVR inside a previously implanted TAV.
METHODS: Post-TAVR CT of 66 patients who received an Evolut R or Evolut PRO and 345 patients who received a SAPIEN 3 were analyzed. Redo TAVR was considered at risk of coronary obstruction due to sinus sequestration if: 1) the prior TAV commissure level was above sinotubular junction (STJ); and 2) the distance between TAV and STJ was <2.0 mm in each coronary sinus.
RESULTS: In total, 45.5% in the Evolut R/Evolut PRO group and 2.0% in the SAPIEN 3 group had CT-identified risk of sinus sequestration at 1 or both coronary arteries (p < 0.001). CT-identified risk of sinus sequestration was observed in 39.4% for the left coronary artery and 24.2% for the right coronary artery in the Evolut R/Evolut PRO group, while those percentages were 2.0% for the left coronary artery and 0.6% for the right coronary artery in the SAPIEN 3 group. In a coronary-level analysis, overlaps between the first TAV commissural posts and coronary ostium were observed in 45.2% in the Evolut R/Evolut PRO group and 11.1% in in the SAPIEN 3 group among coronary arteries at CT-identified risk of sinus sequestration.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sinus sequestration in redo TAVR should be carefully screened by CT, especially in patients with low STJ height. TAV with low commissure height that was designed to achieve commissure-to-commissure alignment with the native aortic valves may be preferable to avoid the risk of coronary obstruction due to sinus sequestration and allow for a preventive leaflet laceration procedure in future redo TAVR.
