Title: Long-Term Follow-Up After Cervical Laminectomy without Fusion for Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to study the effect of cervical laminectomy without fusion on the incidence of further cervical surgeries, the risk for cervical misalignment, and current functional status.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 340 patients who had undergone simple laminectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) at Helsinki University Hospital between 2000 and 2011.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients (12.1%) had later undergone another cervical surgery during the follow-up of a mean of 8.5 years (maximum, 17.5 years). The most common indication for further surgery was residual stenosis at adjacent or other cervical levels (34%). Five patients (1%) required further surgery for correction of a sagittal balance problem. The mean Neck Disability Index was 28% at a median of 9.0 years after laminectomy. The mean EQ-5D (EuroQol 5 Dimension 3 Level) index score was 58.8 for patients and 77.2 for age-matched and gender-matched general population controls (P = 0.000), indicating patients' reduced health-related quality of life. Worse preoperative condition in the Nurick score was related to a lower (i.e., worse) EQ-5D score. In an additional arm of the study with radiographic imaging (40 patients), the mean change in sagittal alignment was 4.0° toward lordotic, and a newly developed kyphosis was found in 7.5% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Because CSM is a serious degenerative progressive condition resulting in decreased health-related quality of life even after surgical treatment, the low rate of corrective surgery needed for alignment issues per se indicates that simple laminectomy can be a viable treatment option in treating multilevel CSM.
