Title: Ultrasonographic optic nerve sheath diameter monitoring of elevated intracranial pressure: two case reports.

Abstract: Ultrasonography assessments of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is a non-invasive method that may help identify elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). However, this technique was used to evaluate the elevated ICP caused by traumatic brain injury. The objective of this study was to examine clinical cases of the changes in ICP with venous sinus stenosis and venous sinus thrombosis found the advantage of this technique in the application. And we dynamically monitor ONSD and ICP as a lens for understanding the dynamic assessment for ICP. The first case of venous sinus stenosis with elevated ICP identified in real-time by changes in ONSD, which are correlated with ICP before and after stenting. Another case of venous sinus thrombosis with elevated ICP. And after treatment, the patient underwent an ultrasound ONSD examination and lumbar puncture (LP) at the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd month of follow-up. The previously enlarged ONSDs retracted and LP opening pressure gradually returned to normal. These cases indicate that ONSD examination may help dynamically assess ICP changes and evaluate the efficacy of ICP treatment. These results provide utile, evidence based, preliminary clinical recommendations and indicate that ONSD examination might be a useful method of evaluating ICP, especially if repeated evaluations are needed.
