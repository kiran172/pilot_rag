Title: Importance of preoperative coronary artery examination before performing procedures for carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) often occur simultaneously, with one being an important risk factor in the treatment of the other. This study aimed to perform coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) as a preoperative evaluation for carotid artery stenosis treatment.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) performed at our hospital as well as CAD complications.
RESULTS: Among the 54 and 166 CEA and CAS cases from May 2014 to February 2022, 53 and 148 cases were analyzed for atherosclerotic stenosis, respectively. Among those who underwent CEA and CAS, 7 (13.2%) and 17 (11.5%) received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 44 (83%) and 97 (65.5%) received symptomatic carotid stenosis treatment and 43 (81.1%) and 110 (74.3%) received preoperative coronary CTA, respectively. Coronary artery stenosis was noted in 14 (32.6%) and 46 (41.8%) patients who had undergone CTA in the CEA and CAS groups, respectively. PCI before carotid treatment was performed in two cases in the CEA group (3.8% of all patients who had undergone CEA) and eight cases in the CAS group (5.4% of all patients who had undergone CAS).
CONCLUSION: Screening may detect asymptomatic coronary artery lesions in carotid artery stenosis even in patients without chest symptoms and suspicion of ischemic heart disease. Preoperative coronary artery screening is important considering that pre and postoperative coronary artery treatment may improve long-term prognosis.
