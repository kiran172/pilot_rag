Title: Association of post-intervention pressure gradient with symptom-free at 6 months in idiopathic intracranial hypertension with venous sinus stenosis treated by stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the key factors that might affect the clinical outcome of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and Venous sinus stenting (VSS).
METHODS: We performed an analysis of a prospectively collected database of patients with IIH and VSS who underwent stenting. The trans-stenotic pressure gradient was measured before and after intervention. In additional, patients' baseline characteristics, procedure details and clinical outcomes at 6-month follow-up (including changes in headache, visual impairment, papilledema, etc.) were recorded. The effects of post-intervention pressure gradient on symptom-free at 6 months were explored using logistic regression analysis, generalized additive model and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: Of 101 patients included in this study, the median pressure gradient across stenosis decreased from 19 mmHg before intervention to 2 mmHg after intervention. At 6 months, symptom-free was observed in 58 cases (57.4%). Multivariable logistic analysis and generalized additive model showed that post-intervention pressure gradient (increased by 1 mmHg) was independently and linearly correlated with symptom-free (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67-0.94). Moreover, the post-intervention pressure gradient revealed moderate discrimination with an area under ROC curve of 0.68 (95% CI = 0.57-0.78). Similar associations were observed for the disappearance of headache and papilledema, but not for the visual recovery.
CONCLUSION: The post-intervention pressure gradient may be a valid and reliable predictor of 6-month clinical outcome in patients with IIH and VSS treated by stenting. Nevertheless, external validation with blinded outcome is still needed to confirm its performance before clinical application.
