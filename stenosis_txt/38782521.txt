Title: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is defined by headaches and a decline in visual acuity due to increased intracranial pressure. Treatment options historically included weight loss, acetazolamide, and/or cerebrospinal fluid diversion surgery. Recent understanding of the contributions of dural venous sinus hypertension and stenosis has led to venous sinus stenting as a treatment option.
