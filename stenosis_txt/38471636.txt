Title: Tubularized Bladder Flap as a Continent Catheterizable Channel in Adults.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe a modified, less invasive, surgical technique to create a continent catheterizable channel (CCC) in adults: the tubularized bladder flap (TBF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of patients in whom a TBF CCC was constructed at adult age between 2019 and 2023. We reported on demographics, operative outcomes, and 30-day and post-30-day complications.
RESULTS: A total of 11 patients (10 female) were described. The median operative time was 96 (range 90-115) minutes in patients with only TBF creation. Estimated blood loss was <100 cc in all patients. Within 30 days postoperatively, 6/11 (55%) patients developed a complication, all grade 1 Clavien Dindo. No bowel complications occurred (paralytic ileus, mechanical obstruction, or leakage/perforation). Median follow-up was 25 (range 6-56) months. In 2/11 (18%) patients surgical revision for stenosis was done; 3/11 (27%) patients underwent surgical revision for stomal leakage.
CONCLUSION: TBF as a means to create a CCC avoids intraperitoneal surgery, and bowel closure (appendicovesicostomy) or anastomosis (retubularized ileum). Postoperative bowel complications were not seen in any of our patients. Surgical revision rates for a TBF CCC appear to be comparable to other CCCs. Therefore, TBF could be considered in patients with sufficient bladder capacity as TBF is less invasive than other CCC techniques and avoids potential bowel complications.
