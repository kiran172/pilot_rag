Title: A Novel CT Perfusion-Based Fractional Flow Reserve Algorithm for Detecting Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The diagnostic accuracy of fractional flow reserve (FFR) derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) (FFR-CT) needs to be further improved despite promising results available in the literature. While an innovative myocardial computed tomographic perfusion (CTP)-derived fractional flow reserve (CTP-FFR) model has been initially established, the feasibility of CTP-FFR to detect coronary artery ischemia in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been proven.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 93 patients (a total of 103 vessels) who received CCTA and CTP for suspected CAD. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) was performed within 2 weeks after CCTA and CTP. CTP-FFR, CCTA (stenosis ≥ 50% and ≥70%), ICA, FFR-CT and CTP were assessed by independent laboratory experts. The diagnostic ability of the CTP-FFR grouped by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) in mild (30-49%), moderate (50-69%) and severe stenosis (≥70%) was calculated. The effect of calcification of lesions, grouped by FFR on CTP-FFR measurements, was also assessed.
RESULTS: On the basis of per-vessel level, the AUCs for CTP-FFR, CTP, FFR-CT and CCTA were 0.953, 0.876, 0.873 and 0.830, respectively (all p &lt; 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTP-FFR for per-vessel level were 0.87, 0.88, 0.87, 0.85 and 0.89 respectively, compared with 0.87, 0.54, 0.69, 0.61, 0.83 and 0.75, 0.73, 0.74, 0.70, 0.77 for CCTA ≥ 50% and ≥70% stenosis, respectively. On the basis of per-vessel analysis, CTP-FFR had higher specificity, accuracy and AUC compared with CCTA and also higher AUC compared with FFR-CT or CTP (all p &lt; 0.05). The sensitivity and accuracy of CTP-FFR + CTP + FFR-CT were also improved over FFR-CT alone (both p &lt; 0.05). It also had improved specificity compared with FFR-CT or CTP alone (p &lt; 0.01). A strong correlation between CTP-FFR and invasive FFR values was found on per-vessel analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.89). The specificity of CTP-FFR was higher in the severe calcification group than in the low calcification group (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A novel CTP-FFR model has promising value to detect myocardial ischemia in CAD, particularly in mild-to-moderate stenotic lesions.
