Title: Relative clinical value of coronary computed tomography and stress echocardiography-guided management of stable chest pain patients: a propensity-matched analysis.

Abstract: AIMS: The European Society of Cardiology recommends coronary computed tomography (CCT) for the assessment of low-risk patients with suspected stable angina. We aimed to assess in a real-life setting the relative clinical value of stress echocardiography (SE)- and CCT-guided management in this population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with stable chest pain and no prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent CCT or SE as the initial investigative strategy were propensity-matched (990 patients each group-age: 59 ± 13.2 years, males: 47.9%) to account for baseline differences in cardiovascular risk factors. Inconclusive tests were 6% vs. 3% (P < 0.005) in CCT vs. SE. Severe (≥70% stenosis) on CCT and inducible ischaemia on SE detected obstructive CAD by invasive coronary angiography in 63% vs. 57% patients (P = 0.33). Over the follow-up period (median 717, interquartile range 93-1069 days) more patients underwent invasive coronary angiography (21.5% vs. 7.3%, P < 0.005), revascularization (7.3% vs. 3.5%, P < 0.005), further functional testing 33.4% vs. 8.7% (P < 0.005), but more patients were prescribed statins 8.8% vs. 3.8% (P < 0.005) in the CCT vs. the SE arm, respectively. Combined all-cause mortality and acute myocardial infarction was low-CCT-2.3% and SE-3.3%-with no significant difference (P = 0.16).
CONCLUSION: Initial SE-guided management was similar for the detection of obstructive CAD, demonstrated better resource utilization, but was associated with reduced prescription of statins although with no difference in medium-term outcome compared to CCT in this very low-risk population. However, a randomized study with longer follow-up is needed to confirm the clinical value of our findings.
