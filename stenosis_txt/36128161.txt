Title: Successful treatment of focal hand dystonia after cervical whiplash injury by thalamotomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic focal hand dystonia after cervical whiplash injury is rare. Moreover, the treatment of peripheral posttraumatic dystonia is usually ineffective. Herein, we report a case of successful thalamotomy for a patient with focal hand dystonia after cervical whiplash injury.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 39-year-old woman was hit from behind by a car; subsequently, she felt strange in the right hand and was diagnosed with whiplash injury. A month later, she developed a persistent abnormal posture of the right hand. Brain imaging showed no lesions, and cervical magnetic resonance imaging showed stenosis but no spinal cord signal changes. Posttraumatic dystonia was diagnosed, for which the patient underwent left ventro-oral (Vo) thalamotomy. One year after the first surgery, the patient underwent left Vo and ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) thalamotomy due to recurrence of dystonia. Nine years after the second surgery, the patient continues to be able to maintain her normal physical routine.
CONCLUSION: Vo-Vim thalamotomy may be a feasible and effective treatment for focal hand dystonia after cervical whiplash injury.
