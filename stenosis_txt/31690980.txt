Title: Japanese Patients Treated in the IMPERIAL Randomized Trial Comparing Eluvia and Zilver PTX Stents.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to report 12-month efficacy and safety results from the subgroup of Japanese patients in the prospective IMPERIAL 2:1 randomized controlled trial (RCT).
METHODS: The global IMPERIAL RCT was designed to compare performance of the Eluvia Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) with the Zilver PTX Drug-Eluting Peripheral Stent (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) for treatment of femoropopliteal artery lesions. Patients with symptomatic (Rutherford category 2-4) disease were included. Post-procedural technical success was defined as delivery and deployment of the assigned study stent to the target lesion to achieve residual angiographic stenosis no greater than 30% by visual assessment. Twelve-month assessments included primary patency (core laboratory-assessed duplex ultrasound peak systolic velocity ratio ≤ 2.4 in the absence of clinically driven TLR or bypass of the target lesion) and major adverse events (MAEs).
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients in the Eluvia group and 28 in the Zilver PTX group were treated at Japanese centers. Mean lesion length was 91.8 ± 38.0 mm for Eluvia and 87.4 ± 41.7 mm for Zilver PTX. Technical success was 100% for both groups. At 12 months, the observed primary patency rate was 90.9% for Eluvia and 84.6% for Zilver PTX. The 12-month MAE rate was 1.8% for Eluvia and 7.7% for Zilver PTX. All MAEs were clinically driven TLRs.
CONCLUSION: The results show excellent vessel patency and a good safety profile up to 1 year in the subgroup of Japanese patients in IMPERIAL treated with Eluvia for femoropopliteal artery disease.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3; subgroup analysis of randomized trial.
