Title: Lingual Mucosal Graft Ureteroplasty for Long Proximal Ureteral Stricture: 6 Years of Experience with 41 Cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Management of a long proximal ureteral stricture is challenging. Lingual mucosal graft ureteroplasty (LMGU) is a novel minimally invasive technique for ureteral reconstruction that avoids the morbidity of bowel interposition or autotransplantation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of LMGU for managing long, complex proximal ureteral strictures in a multi-institutional cohort of patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective study involved data for 41 patients treated with LMGU at three centers between June 2015 and January 2021.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: LMGU was performed using either an onlay ureteroplasty in which the diseased ureter was incised ventrally and repaired with a lingual mucosal graft (LMG) to widen the ureteral lumen, or an augmented anastomotic technique in which the obliterated segment of the ureter was excised and reanastomosed primarily on dorsal side, and an LMG was placed on the ventral side.
MEASUREMENTS: Pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables and outcomes were assessed. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of 41patients, 40 were operated with laparoscopic procedures and one with a robot. Twenty-four (59%) patients underwent an onlay ureteroplasty, and 17 (41%) underwent an augmented anastomotic ureteroplasty. The reconstructed ureter was wrapped with omentum in 90% of cases. The median (range) stricture length was 4.8 cm (2.0-8.0), operative time was 166 min (98-306), and estimated blood loss was 65 ml (15-220). No open conversions and intraoperative complications occurred. At a median follow-up of 35 mo (range 13-80), the overall success rate was 97.6% (40/41).
CONCLUSIONS: LMGU is a safe, feasible, and effective long-term technique for managing long, complex proximal ureteral strictures.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We reported a novel technique for long proximal complex ureteral strictures using an onlay lingual mucosal graft (LMG). Our 6-yr outcomes demonstrate that onlay LMG ureteroplasty is a safe, feasible, and effective long-term procedure for ureteral reconstruction.
