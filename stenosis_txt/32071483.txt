Title: [Hybrid treatment for symptomatic long-segment chronic internal carotid artery occlusion without stump].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To summarize the preliminary experience of hybrid operation for the treatment of symptomatic long-segment chronic internal carotid artery occlusion (CICAO) without stump.
METHODS: Clinical data of 12 patients of symptomatic long-segment CICAO without stump undergoing hybrid operation treatment from July 2015 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The safety and efficacy of hybrid operation for the treatment of symptomatic long-segment CICAO without stump were preliminarily assessed. CICAO was defined as occlusion time being more than 4 weeks. The primary outcome was defined as any stroke (including ischemic or hemorrhagic) or deaths from any cause after hybrid operation within 30 days. The secondary outcome was defined as successful revascularization and occurrence of >50% in-stent restenosis during the follow-up period.
RESULTS: In this group, the symptomatic long-segment CICAO of 11 patients were successfully recanalized. Technical success rate was 91.7% (11/12). The main complication rate was 8.3% (1/12). This patient encountered iatrogenic internal carotid artery cavernous sinus fistula caused by micro-guide wire in the midway of the hybrid operation, the proximal segment of this internal carotid artery was ligated and the iatrogenic internal carotid artery cavernous sinus fistula disappeared in the following digital subtraction angiography image. No patient encountered hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. No death complications occurred. In this group 10 patients of them were followed up. The follow-up period ranged from 10 to 32 months [mean, (19Â±9) months]. During the follow-up period, 1 patients developed in-stent restenosis and improved after reoperation of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty by the right size balloon without stenting treatment.
CONCLUSION: Hybrid operation for the treatment of highly screened patients with symptomatic long-segment CICAO without stump is safe and effective, could reduce the incidence of complications and improve procedural success rate.
