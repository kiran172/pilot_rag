Title: Does contralateral carotid artery occlusion affect the clinical and long-term outcomes of carotid artery stenting?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been used with increasing frequency in recent years as an alternative to surgery. Contralateral carotid occlusion (CCO) is present in approximately 2.3% to 25% of cases of revascularised carotid atherosclerotic stenosis. We aimed to compare the outcomes of 30-day, 6-month and 1-year stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA), death and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with and without CCO who underwent CAS in our clinic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted with 288 consecutive patients who underwent CAS between September 2010 and June 2018. Patients with carotid stenting were divided into two groups: with (48 patients) and without CCO (240 patients).
RESULTS: Total mortality (2.08% vs. 2.08% p = 1), stroke (2.08% vs. 0.83%, p = 0.43), TIA (0% vs. 0.83%, p = 0.52), MI (0% vs. 0%), and composite outcome (4.17% vs. 3.33%, p = 0.77) at 30 days were not significantly different between CCO and non-CCO groups. Also there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the 6-month and 1-year outcomes (p &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between 30-day, 6-month and 1-year non-fatal MI, TIA, ischaemic stroke and mortality in the comparison of patients with and without CCO who underwent CAS. The outcomes were similar in terms of age and symptoms, and these data should be supported by prospective multicenter studies.
