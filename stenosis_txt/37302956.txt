Title: Prophylactic use of a lidocaine constant rate infusion versus saline in dogs undergoing balloon valvuloplasty for management of pulmonic stenosis: A randomized control trial.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a prophylactic lidocaine constant rate infusion (CRI) on the incidence and malignancy of catheter-induced ventricular ectopic complexes (VECs) during balloon valvuloplasty for management of pulmonic stenosis in dogs.
STUDY DESIGN: Single-centre, prospective, randomized study.
ANIMALS: Client-owned dogs (n = 70) with pulmonic stenosis.
METHODS: Dogs were randomly assigned to one of two anaesthetic protocols: administration of lidocaine 2 mg kg-1 bolus followed by a CRI (50 μg kg-1 minute-1; group LD) or a saline placebo (group SL) during balloon valvuloplasty. All dogs were premedicated with methadone (0.3 mg kg-1) intramuscularly and a digital three-lead Holter monitor was applied. Anaesthetic co-induction was performed with administration of alfaxalone (2 mg kg-1) and diazepam (0.4 mg kg-1), and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane vaporised in 100% oxygen. CRIs were started on positioning of the dog in theatre and discontinued as the last vascular catheter was removed from the heart. All dogs recovered well and were discharged 24 hours postoperatively. Blinded Holter analysis was performed by an external veterinary cardiologist using commercially available dedicated analysis software; p &lt; 0.05.
RESULTS: Of the 70 dogs enrolled in the study, 61 were included in the final analysis: 31 in group LD and 30 in group SL. There was no significant difference between sinus beats (p = 0.227) or VECs (p = 0.519) between groups. In group LD, 19/31 (61.3%) dogs had a maximum ventricular rate ≥250 units and 20/30 (66.7%) dogs in group SL (p = 0.791).
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In this study, the use of a prophylactic lidocaine bolus followed by CRI in dogs undergoing balloon valvuloplasty for management of pulmonic stenosis did not significantly decrease the incidence nor the malignancy of VECs during right heart catheterization compared with a saline CRI.
