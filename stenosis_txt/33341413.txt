Title: High-Risk Coronary Plaque Regression After Intensive Lifestyle Intervention in Nonobstructive Coronary Disease: A Randomized Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to study the impact of diet and lifestyle intervention on changes in atherosclerotic plaque volume and composition.
BACKGROUND: Lifestyle and diet modification are the leading strategies to manage coronary artery disease; however, their direct impact on atherosclerosis remains unknown. Coronary plaque composition is related to the risk of future cardiovascular events independent of stenosis severity and can be conveniently evaluated with computed tomography angiography (CTA).
METHODS: We enrolled 92 patients (41% women; mean age 60 ± 7.7 years) with nonobstructive (<70% stenosis) coronary atherosclerosis identified by CTA. Participants were randomized (1:1) to either the DISCO (Dietary Intervention to Stop Coronary Atherosclerosis in Computed Tomography) intervention group (systematic follow-up by a dietitian to adhere to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension nutrition model together with optimal medical therapy [OMT]) or the control group (OMT alone). In all patients, CTA was repeated after 66.9 ± 13.7 weeks. The outcome was change (Δ) in atheroma volume and plaque composition. Based on atherosclerotic tissue attenuation ranges in Hounsfield units (HU), the following components of coronary plaque were distinguished: dense calcium (>351 HU), fibrous plaque (151 to 350 HU), and fibrofatty plaque combined with necrotic core (-30 to 150 HU), referred to as noncalcified plaque.
RESULTS: Percent atheroma volume increased in the control arm (Δ = +1.1 ± 3.4%; p = 0.033) versus no significant change in the experimental arm (Δ = +1.0% ± 4.2%; p = 0.127; intergroup p = 0.851). There was a reduction in noncalcified plaque in both the experimental arm (Δ = -51.3 ± 79.5 mm3 [-1.7 ± 2.7%]; p &lt; 0.001) and the control arm (Δ = -21.3 ± 57.7 [-0.7 ± 1.9%]; p = 0.018), which was greater in the DISCO intervention group (intergroup p = 0.045). No differences in fibrous component or dense calcium changes were observed between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Controlled diet and lifestyle intervention together with OMT may slow the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce noncalcified plaque volume compared to OMT alone. (Dietary Intervention to Stop Coronary Atherosclerosis in Computed Tomography [DISCO-CT]; NCT02571803).
