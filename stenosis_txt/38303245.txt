Title: [A Case of an Advanced Gastric Cancer Patient with Outlet Obstruction and Malnutrition Who Successfully Underwent Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy with Enteral Nutrition].

Abstract: We reported a case of an advanced gastric cancer patient with gastric outlet obstruction and malnutrition who successfully underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with enteral feeding. The patient is a 72-year-old man. The diagnosis was advanced gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis. Both decompression and enteral nutrition was performed with a W-ED®. Chemotherapy was markedly effective and nutritional status improved. He underwent robot-assisted distal gastrectomy(D2)and Billroth Ⅱ reconstruction under good nutritional status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with intragastric decompression and nutritional management using a W-ED® tube. W-ED® tube is a useful tool for the proper nutritional management of patients with advanced gastric cancer who have pyloric stenosis by adequate decompression and enteral feeding.
