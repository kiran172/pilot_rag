Title: Normalized wall index, intraplaque hemorrhage and ulceration of carotid plaques correlate with the severity of ischemic stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Carotid atherosclerosis is considered an important cause of ischemic stroke. Tthis study aimed to explore the relationship between plaque features and the severity of stroke, and to identify plaque risk factors for the assessment of the severity of ischemic stroke.
METHODS: Symptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerotic plaques were prospectively recruited and underwent high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VW-MRI). Two trained MRI readers independently identified intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), calcification (CA), surface CA, deep CA, and ulceration. They measured and calculated the maximum vessel diameter (Max VD), maximum wall thickness (Max WT), total vessel area, lumen area, normalized wall index (NWI), plaque volume, IPH volume, IPH proportion, CA volume, and CA proportion. Patients were divided into two groups according to their National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (NIHSS ≤1 vs. NIHSS >1). Clinical characteristics and carotid plaque features were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test or Chi-square test as appropriate. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of plaque features to distinguish patients with NIHSS >1 were calculated. Spearman's rank correlations or Pearson correlations were determined for plaque features and NIHSS scores.
RESULTS: Of the 97 included patients, 34 (35.05%) with NIHSS >1 had significantly greater NWI (p < 0.05), larger IPH volume (p < 0.01), and greater IPH proportion (p < 0.01), and higher prevalence of IPH (OR, 5.654; 95%CI, 2.272-14.070; p < 0.01) and ulceration (OR, 2.891; 95%CI, 1.090-7.667; p = 0.033) than patients with NIHSS ≤1. Max WT (r = 0.24, p = 0.018), NWI (r = 0.22, p = 0.032), IPH (r = 0.27, p = 0.007), IPH volume (r = 0.35, p < 0.01), IPH proportion (r = 0.28, p = 0.005), and ulceration (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) had positive correlations with NIHSS scores.
CONCLUSIONS: NWI, IPH, and ulceration of carotid atherosclerotic plaque based on high-resolution VW-MRI may be useful indicators for assessing the severity of ischemic stroke in patients with atherosclerosis. NIHSS score is related to max WT, NWI, IPH, IPH volume, IPH proportion, and ulceration.
