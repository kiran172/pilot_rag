Title: Surgically treated genital chronic graft-versus-host disease in women: A report of three cases.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a crucial treatment for hematological malignancy. Gonadal dysfunction occurs at an early stage after this treatment, and such patients may require hormone replacement therapy. Genital chronic graft-versus-host disease is a lesser-known complication of HSCT that begins with vulvar discomfort and dysuria and progresses to sexual dysfunction and retention of menstrual blood due to vaginal stenosis and obstruction; thus, significantly impairing the patient's quality of life. We describe three women who underwent vaginal reconstruction because of genital chronic graft-versus-host disease. We discuss the surgical techniques, including double cross plasty that were performed in each case. Surgical interventions enabled the continuation of HRT and facilitated sexual intercourse. In conclusion, gynecologists should be aware that genital chronic graft-versus-host disease can occur after HSCT, and that surgical treatment options are available to improve patients' symptoms and quality of life.
