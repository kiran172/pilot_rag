Title: [Ureteral obstruction and segmental ureteral stents].

Abstract: Currently, various types of stents are widely used in urological practice. One of the indications is the presence of upper urinary tract strictures. The factors leading to the development of strictures can be endogenous and exogenous, iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic, benign and malignant. After open, laparoscopic and X-ray-endoscopic procedures a double-J stent is usually placed or, less often, nephrostomy tube. It should be noted that both methods have certain side effects and may affect the patient's quality of life. To reduce the stent-related symptoms and increase their tolerability, various modifications of ureteral stents have been developed. In this article, we analyze the publications devoted to the most commonly used segmental stents without renal and bladder coils, such as Memokath, Uventa, Allium, Memotherm and nitinol stents manufactured by MIT LLC.
