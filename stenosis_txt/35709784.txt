Title: Lumen reconstruction with magnetic compression anastomosis technique in a patient with complete esophageal stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complete esophageal obstruction (CEO) is a rare condition of which treatment options are challenging. Surgery is the main treatment with high morbidity and mortality rates. Magnetic compression anastomosis (MCA) is a novel technique developed to restore lumen patency in gastrointestinal and biliary tracts. However, MCA experience is limited in respect of esophageal strictures.
CASE REPORT: We present a 26-year-old patient having CEO. Magnets are inserted endoscopically to both sides of the obstructed area via oral and retrograde (through the gastrostomy tract) route. On day 8, magnets stuck together and were removed endoscopically through the oral route. Subsequently, sessions of balloon dilatations and triamcinolone injection were performed. The patient's complaint of aphagia resolved after the treatment process.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, MCA is an alternative technique that can be used to restore lumen patency in esophageal strictures and also avoids complications of surgical interventions.
