Title: A Novel Low-Cost Technique to Allow for Jet Ventilation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Traditional jet ventilation requires the use of a catheter that is inserted either through an endotracheal tube or laryngoscope. Specially designed laryngoscopes with a built-in luer lock adapter to which the high-pressure tubing may be attached exist but are not always available. We present our experience with an adapter which allows connection of the high-pressure tubing to the suction side port of suitable laryngoscopes that is easily assembled using readily available materials in the operating room.
METHOD: We designed a jet ventilator adapter using a high-pressure jet ventilation tubing assembly and a 3-way stopcock extension set which we have used for the past 13 years. A retrospective case series of all adult patients who underwent direct laryngoscopy and/or bronchoscopy using this jet ventilation adapter between January 2017 and August 2021 was performed.
RESULT: A total of 100 consecutive patients underwent laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy using jet ventilation between January 2017 and August 2021 was identified. The mean age was 56.3 years, and the mean BMI was 31.2. The most common diagnoses were idiopathic subglottic/tracheal stenosis (46.4%), acquired tracheal stenosis (34.1%), and acquired subglottic stenosis (14.8%). The median duration of the surgical procedure was 53 minutes with an interquartile range of 23. The CO<sub>2</sub> laser was used in all cases. There was no disconnection of the adapter, episodes of postoperative respiratory compromise, or extraluminal air on chest radiography for any of our cases. Oxygen saturations remained above 90% intraoperatively for all cases.
CONCLUSION: Our simple jet ventilator adapter connects the jet ventilator to the suction side port of suitable laryngoscopes and eliminates the need for a jet ventilation catheter or specialized laryngoscope at a minimal cost.
