Title: Consistency of spectral results in cardiac dual-source photon-counting CT.

Abstract: We evaluate stability of spectral results at different heart rates, acquisition modes, and cardiac phases in first-generation clinical dual-source photon-counting CT (PCCT). A cardiac motion simulator with a coronary stenosis mimicking a 50% eccentric calcium plaque was scanned at five different heart rates (0, 60-100 bpm) with the three available cardiac scan modes (high pitch prospectively ECG-triggered spiral, prospectively ECG-triggered axial, retrospectively ECG-gated spiral). Subsequently, full width half max (FWHM) of the stenosis, Dice score (DSC) for the stenosed region, and eccentricity of the non-stenosed region were calculated for virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) at 50, 70, and 150 keV and iodine density maps at both diastole and systole. FWHM averaged differences of - 0.20, - 0.28, and - 0.15 mm relative to static FWHM at VMI 150 keV across acquisition parameters for high pitch prospectively ECG-triggered spiral, prospectively ECG-triggered axial, and retrospectively ECG-gated spiral scans, respectively. Additionally, there was no effect of heart rate and acquisition mode on FWHM at diastole (p-values < 0.001). DSC demonstrated similarity among parameters with standard deviations of 0.08, 0.09, 0.11, and 0.08 for VMI 50, 70, and 150 keV, and iodine density maps, respectively, with insignificant differences at diastole (p-values < 0.01). Similarly, eccentricity illustrated small differences across heart rate and acquisition mode for each spectral result. Consistency of spectral results at different heart rates and acquisition modes for different cardiac phase demonstrates the added benefit of spectral results from PCCT to dual-source CT to further increase confidence in quantification and advance cardiovascular diagnostics.
