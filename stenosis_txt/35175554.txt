Title: Translocation of the Mitral Valve in an Acute Large Animal Model.

Abstract: Current repair options for functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) are not durable and do not adequately address underlying pathophysiology including leaflet tethering and insufficient coaptation. The feasibility of mitral valve translocation as a repair strategy for FMR was examined in normal swine. Seven pigs (median 62 kg, IQR 55-65 kg) with normal cardiac function were implanted with a 1-cm frustum-shaped pericardial patch inserted between the native mitral annulus and intact mitral leaflets. Operative survival was 100% with no post-procedure mitral stenosis, systolic anterior motion, or central mitral regurgitation observed on echocardiography. Post-translocation mean gradient was 3.5 mmHg (IQR 1.5-4 mmHg); trace or mild suture line leaks on the atrial suture line were noted in 5/7 pigs. Median leaflet coaptation increased from 2.4 (IQR 2.1-4.3 mm) to 12.4 mm (IQR 10.8-13.4 mm) after translocation (P = 0.016). Translocation dramatically increases leaflet coaptation without impairing diastolic function in animals with normal left ventricular function and is a promising technique for repair of FMR. Implantation of a 1.0-cm circumferential pericardial patch (mitral valve translocation) increases leaflet coaptation in a normal animal model.
