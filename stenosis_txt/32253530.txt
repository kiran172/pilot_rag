Title: Preprocedural valvuloarterial impedance as a predictor of left ventricular ejection fraction improvement after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Predictors of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improvement after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with a preoperative reduced LVEF are limited.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between preprocedural valuvuloarterial impedance (ZVa), which represents the global LV afterload, and LVEF improvement after TAVR.
METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective study, which included patients with symptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AS) with a reduced baseline LVEF (< 50%) underwent TAVR. Based on the difference in the LVEF before and 1 month after the procedure, they were divided into two groups: improved group (≥ 10% improvement) and non-improved group (< 10% improvement or worsening). Preprocedural ZVa and clinical outcomes were then compared. ZVa was calculated using preprocedural transthoracic echocardiography data.
RESULTS: Among 473 cases of TAVR performed from May 2012 to July 2017 at Queen's Medical Center (Honolulu, HI, USA), 99 patients (improved group, n = 42; mean age 82.0 ± 8.6 years vs. non-improved group, n = 57, mean age 81.4 ± 9.5 years) were included. The improved group had a higher baseline ZVa {4.83 (4.15-6.89) mmHg/ml/m2 vs. 4.04 (3.56-4.63) mmHg/ml/m2, respectively, p = 0.0009} and prevalence of ZVa &gt; 5 mmHg/ml/m2 (45.2% vs. 17.5%, respectively, p = 0.0028). Multivariable analysis of predictors of LVEF improvement ≥ 10% at 1 month identified ZVa &gt; 5 mmHg/ml/m2 [odds ratio (OR): 3.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-11.8] as a predictor. The improved group had a lower readmission rate due to heart failure than the non-improved group (log-rank test, p = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Zva is a simple, noninvasive marker that shows promise as a predictor of LVEF improvement after TAVR in reduced LVEF patients.
