Title: Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Disparities in Valvular Heart Failure Management.

Abstract: Racial, ethnic, and gender disparities are present in the diagnosis and management of valvular heart disease. The prevalence of valvular heart disease varies by race, ethnicity, and gender, but diagnostic evaluations are not equitable across the groups, which makes the true prevalence less clear. The delivery of evidence-based treatments for valvular heart disease is not equitable. This article focuses on the epidemiology of valvular heart diseases associated with heart failure and the related disparities in treatment, with a focus on how to improve delivery of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments.
