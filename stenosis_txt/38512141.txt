Title: Correlation analysis of serum miR-145 and miR-210 with carotid artery stenosis and their predictive value for cerebral ischemic events.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the significance of serum miR-145 and miR-210 expression levels in the diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis.
METHODS: During the same period, 55 healthy individuals who received physical examination in the same hospital were recruited as controls and assigned to a non-stenosis group. Among the included patients, there were 45 cases of mild stenosis, 14 cases of moderate stenosis, and 6 cases of severe stenosis after carotid color Doppler ultrasonography. The expression levels of miR-145 and miR-210 in serum were measured using real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technology.
RESULTS: The expression levels of serum miR-145 and miR-210 in carotid artery stenosis group were significantly lower than those in non-stenosis group (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that smoking history, diabetes, hypertension and total cholesterol were positively correlated with the occurrence of carotid artery stenosis (p &lt; 0.05). The expression levels of miR-145 and miR-210 were significantly negatively correlated with carotid artery stenosis (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, patients with carotid artery stenosis and low expression levels of miR-145 and miR-210 had a greater risk of cerebral ischemia (p &lt; 0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that the low expression of miR-145 and miR-210 were independent predictors of cerebral ischemic events. ROC analysis confirmed that miR-145 and miR-210 had good diagnostic efficacy in cerebral ischemia (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The decreased expression of miR-145 and miR-210 in serum is closely related to the diagnostic significance of carotid artery stenosis, and may be used to predict the occurrence of cerebral ischemic events.
