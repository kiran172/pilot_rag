Title: A critical review of surgical strategies to minimise venous stenosis in arteriovenous grafts.

Abstract: It is inevitable that complications arising from surgical procedures are ascribed to surgical technique, and this applies to venous stenosis (VS) in arteriovenous grafts. However, despite a wide range of cellular studies, computer modelling, observational series and clinical trials, there remains uncertainty on whether surgical technique contributes to VS. This article reviews evidence from basic science, fluid dynamics and clinical data to try and rationalise the main surgical options to modify the occurrence of venous stenosis. There is sufficient data from diverse sources to make recommendations on clinical practice (size of target vein, shape of anastomosis, angle of approach, distance from venous needling, trauma to the target vein) whilst at the same time this emphasises the need to carefully report the practical aspects of surgical technique in future clinical trials.
