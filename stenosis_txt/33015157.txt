Title: Circulating miRNA-23b and miRNA-143 Are Potential Biomarkers for In-Stent Restenosis.

Abstract: In-stent restenosis (ISR) is one of the main complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasty, and microRNAs participate in the contractile-to-synthetic phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells, a hallmark of restenosis development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be released into circulation from injured tissues, enticing a potential role as noninvasive biomarkers. We aimed to evaluate circulating levels of miRNA-23b, miRNA-143, and miRNA-145 as diagnostic markers of ISR. 142 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing successful angioplasty and a follow-up angiography were included. Subjects were classified according to the degree of obstruction at the angioplasty site into cases (â‰¥50%) or controls (&lt;50%). Total RNA was isolated from plasma to quantify circulating miRNAs levels, and the ROC curves were constructed. Among circulating miRNAs assessed, miRNA-23b and miRNA-143 were significantly lower in cases (miRNA-23b: 18.4x10-5 and miRNA-143: 13.7x10-5) than controls (miRNA-23b: 5.2x10-5, p &lt; 0.0001; miRNA-143: 4.0x10-5, p &lt; 0.0001). Plasma levels of miRNA-145 showed no significant differences. The analysis of the ROC curves showed an area under the curve for miRNA-23b of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62-0.80, p &lt; 0.0001) and 0.69 for miRNA-143 (95% CI: 0.60-0.78; p &lt; 0.0001). Our data suggest that plasma levels of miRNA-23b and miRNA-143 could be useful as noninvasive biomarkers of ISR.
