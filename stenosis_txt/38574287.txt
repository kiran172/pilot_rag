Title: Decreased diffusivity along the perivascular space and cerebral hemodynamic disturbance in adult moyamoya disease.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) causes cerebral arterial stenosis and hemodynamic disturbance, the latter of which may disrupt glymphatic system activity, the waste clearance system. We evaluated 46 adult patients with MMD and 33 age- and sex-matched controls using diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS) measured with diffusion tensor imaging (ALPS index), which may partly reflect glymphatic system activity, and multishell diffusion MRI to generate freewater maps. Twenty-three patients were also evaluated via 15O-gas positron emission tomography (PET), and all patients underwent cognitive tests. Compared to controls, patients (38.4 (13.2) years old, 35 females) had lower ALPS indices in the left and right hemispheres (1.94 (0.27) vs. 1.65 (0.25) and 1.94 (0.22) vs. 1.65 (0.19), P &lt; 0.001). While the right ALPS index showed no correlation, the left ALPS index was correlated with parenchymal freewater (ρ = -0.47, P &lt; 0.001); perfusion measured with PET (cerebral blood flow, ρ = 0.70, P &lt; 0.001; mean transit time, ρ = -0.60, P = 0.003; and oxygen extraction fraction, ρ = -0.52, P = 0.003); and cognitive tests (trail making test part B for executive function; ρ = -0.37, P = 0.01). Adult patients with MMD may exhibit decreased glymphatic system activity, which is correlated with the degree of hemodynamic disturbance, increased interstitial freewater, and cognitive dysfunction, but further investigation is needed.
