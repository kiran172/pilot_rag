Title: Outcomes of Clampless Real Chimney Technique with Dacron Graft and Sleeve Banding of the Ascending Aorta for Total Debranching Endovascular Arch Repair.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hybrid aortic arch repair with debranching of the supra-aortic vessels carries a high risk of cerebral infarction and fatal complications associated with side clamping of the ascending aorta. A previous study had reported the "real chimney" technique, a novel method for clamp-free total debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair with the ascending aortic sleeve banding with dacron. In this study, we aim to build upon this foundation by presenting our experience with the early and midterm outcomes of this technique.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 61 consecutive older adult patients with aortic arch pathologies and a high risk of open repair who underwent total debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair using the real chimney technique at our institution between January 2014 and June 2022. This technique was used to anastomose the ascending aorta with the main trunk of the triple-branched prosthetic graft.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 75.1 years, and 54% of patients were transferred from medical facilities with cardiothoracic surgery departments. The comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (49.2%), chronic kidney disease (63.9%), coronary artery disease (27.9%), and history of stroke (31.1%). No 30-day mortality was observed. Complications included postoperative renal failure requiring permanent hemodialysis (4; 6.6%), stroke (modified Rankin scale score: ≥2 in 5; 8.2%), permanent paraplegia (1; 1.6%), and permanent paraparesis (4; 6.6%). The median follow-up period was 40.5±28.5 months. The postoperative survival rates at 5 years were 66.8%. No patients experienced complications associated with the aorta or anastomosis site; only 1 patient required an additional procedure for stenosis of the anastomosis site (midterm). An aneurysmal diameter reduction of ≥3 mm was observed in 37 cases (60.7%), and the mean aneurysmal diameter reduction was 5.3 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative outcome of total debranching thoracic endovascular aortic arch repair is not only acceptable but also promising, particularly in patients at high risk of open repair.
CLINICAL IMPACT: Our novel real chimney technique for total debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair of aortic arch pathologies in patients who were at a high-risk for open repair resulted in no 30-day mortality and no complications related to the aorta or the real chimney anastomosis site.The real chimney technique is effective for managing aortic arch pathologies and enables less invasive total debranching thoracic endovascular aortic arch repair without the need for extracorporeal circulation and clamping of the ascending aorta.
