Title: Prognostic impact of permanent pacemaker implantation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Conduction disturbances requiring permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) remain a common complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic impact of PPI after TAVR according to the timing of implantation relative to TAVR.
METHODS: A total of 1199 patients (median age 83 years; interquartile range 78-86 years; 549 [45.8%] female) were included in the analysis, of whom 894 (70.8%) had not undergone PPI, 130 (10.8%) had undergone previous PPI, 116 (9.7%) had undergone in-hospital PPI, and 59 (4.9%) had undergone PPI during follow-up. Median follow-up was 2.94 years (1.42-4.32 years). The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure.
RESULTS: PPI during follow-up was associated with a higher occurrence of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-3.20) whereas previous PPI and in-hospital PPI were not (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.71-1.29 and HR 1.26; 95% CI 0.88-1.81, respectively). PPI during follow-up was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for heart failure (sub-HR 3.21; 95% CI 2.02-5.11), while this relationship was only borderline significant for previous PPI (sub-HR 1.51; 95% CI 0.99-2.29). In contrast, there was no relationship between in-hospital PPI and the subsequent risk of hospitalization for heart failure.
CONCLUSION: Previous PPI and in-hospital PPI had no long-term prognostic impact on the risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure, whereas PPI during follow-up was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for heart failure. The present study questions the deleterious influence of periprocedural post-TAVR PPI, which has previously been suggested by certain studies.
