Title: Evaluation of Stent Apposition in the LVIS Blue Stent-Assisted Coiling of Distal Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysms : Correlation with Clinical and Angiographic Outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stent apposition of a low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS) device in distal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms, examine its correlation with clinical and angiographic outcomes, and determine the predictive factors of ischemic adverse events (IAEs) related to stent-assisted coiling.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively maintained database of 183 patients between January 2017 and February 2020. The carotid siphon from the cavernous ICA to the ICA terminus was divided into posterior, anterior, and superior bends. The anterior bends were categorized into angled (V) and non-angled (C, U, and S) types depending on the morphology and measured angles. Complete stent apposition (CSA) and incomplete stent apposition (ISA) were evaluated using unsubtracted angiography and flat-panel detector computed tomography. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 200 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg was administered. Clopidogrel resistance was defined as fewer responders (≥10%, <40%) and non-responders (<10%) based on the percent inhibition (%INH) of the VerifyNow system. These were counteracted by a dose escalation to 150 mg for fewer responders or substitution with cilostazol 200 mg for non-responders. IAEs included intraoperative in-stent thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarction, and delayed in-stent stenosis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictive factors for ISA and IAEs.
RESULTS: There were 33 ISAs (18.0%) and 27 IAEs (14.8%). The anterior bend angle was narrower in ISA (-4.16°±25.18°) than in CSA (23.52°±23.13°) (p<0.001). The V- and S-types were independently correlated with the ISA (p<0.001). However, treatment outcomes, including IAEs (15.3% vs. 12.1%), aneurysmal complete occlusion (91.3% vs. 88.6%), and recanalization (none of them), did not differ between CSA and ISA (p>0.05). The %INH of 27 IAEs (13.78%±14.78%) was significantly lower than that of 156 non-IAEs (26.82%±20.23%) (p<0.001). Non-responders to clopidogrel were the only significant predictive factor for IAEs (p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: The angled and tortuous anatomical peculiarity of the carotid siphon caused ISA of the LVIS device; however, it did not affect clinical and angiographic outcomes, while the non-responders to clopidogrel affected the IAEs related to stent-assisted coiling.
