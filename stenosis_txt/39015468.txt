Title: Left ventricular reverse remodeling after aortic valve replacement or repair in bicuspid aortic valve with moderate or greater aortic regurgitation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Bicuspid aortic valve (AV) patients with aortic regurgitation (AR) differ from tricuspid AV patients given younger age, greater left ventricle (LV) compliance, and more prevalent aortic stenosis (AS). Bicuspid AV-specific data to guide timing of AV replacement or repair are lacking.
METHODS: Adults with bicuspid AV and moderate or greater AR who underwent aortic valve replacement or repair at our center were studied. The presurgical echocardiogram, and echocardiograms within 3 years postoperatively were evaluated for LV geometry/function, and AV function. Semiquantitative AS/AR assessment was performed in all patients with adequate imaging.
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five patients (85% men, aged 44.5 ± 15.9 years) were studied (63% pure AR, 37% mixed AS/AR). Following aortic valve replacement or repair, change in LV end-diastolic dimension and change in LV end-diastolic volume were associated with preoperative LV end-diastolic dimension (β = 0.62 Δcm/cm; 95% CI, 0.43-0.73 Δcm/cm; P &lt; .001), and LV end-diastolic volume (β = 0.6 ΔmL/mL; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7 ΔmL/mL; P &lt; .001), respectively, each independent of AR/AS severity (P = not significant). Baseline LV size predicted postoperative normalization (LV end-diastolic dimension: odds ratio, 3.75/cm; 95% CI, 1.61-8.75/cm, LV end-diastolic volume: odds ratio, 1.01/mL; 95% CI, 1.004-1.019/mL, both P values &lt; .01) whereas AR/AS severity did not (P = not significant). Indexed LV end diastolic volume outperformed LV end-diastolic dimension in predicting postoperative LV normalization (area under the curve = 0.74 vs 0.61) with optimal diagnostic cutoffs of 99 mL/m2 and 6.1 cm, respectively. Postoperative indexed LV end diastolic volume dilatation was associated with increased risk of death, transplant/ventricular assist device, ventricular arrhythmia, and reoperation (hazard ratio, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.7-21.5; P &lt; .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Remodeling extent following surgery in patients with bicuspid AV and AR relates to preoperative LV size independent of valve disease phenotype or severity. Many patients with LV end-diastolic dimension below current surgical thresholds did not normalize LV size. LV volumetric assessment offered superior diagnostic performance for predicting residual LV dilatation, and postoperative indexed LV end diastolic volume dilatation was associated with adverse prognosis.
