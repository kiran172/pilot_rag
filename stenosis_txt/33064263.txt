Title: The relationships of serum homocysteine levels and traditional lipid indicators with disease activity and coronary artery involvement in Takayasu arteritis.

Abstract: Serum homocysteine (HCY) levels have been associated with the occurrence of coronary stenosis and disease activity in large-vessel vasculitis. However, whether increases in serum HCY levels and traditional lipid indicators are associated with coronary artery involvement and disease activity in Chinese Han Takayasu arteritis (TA) patients is unknown. This study aims to investigate the clinical and laboratory features of TA by assessing their association with disease activity in TA patients, and to explore the risk factors associated with coronary artery involvement in these patients. Serum HCY levels and traditional lipid indicators were tested in one hundred ninety TA patients and one hundred fifty-four healthy controls. We analyzed the relationships of serum HCY levels and traditional lipid indicators with disease activity and analyzed the risk factors for coronary artery involvement. Twenty-one TA patients were found to have coronary artery stenosis (≥ 50%). TA patients had significantly higher levels of HCY than did healthy controls (p < 0.0001). Serum levels of HCY and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); the ratios of LDL-C to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) to HDL-C, and triglycerides (TG) to HDL-C; and the values of atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were significantly higher in patients with active TA than in patients with inactive TA and in TA patients with coronary artery involvement than in TA patients without coronary artery involvement. By contrast, the serum levels of HDL-C were significantly lower in patients with active TA than in patients with inactive TA and in TA patients with coronary artery involvement than in TA patients without coronary artery involvement (p < 0.05). In addition, the serum levels of TC and TG were significantly higher in TA patients with coronary artery involvement than those in TA patients without coronary artery involvement. Elevated serum HCY levels increased the risk of coronary artery involvement by 1.3-fold (p = 0.011, odds ratio [OR] = 1.275, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.056-1.539), and the cutoff value for serum HCY was 9.55 μmol/L. Elevated serum TG levels increased the risk of coronary artery involvement by 3.5-fold (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.534, 95% CI: 1.907-6.547), and the cutoff value for serum TG was 1.215 mmol/L. The risk of coronary artery involvement was 2.5-fold higher when an elevated TG/HDL-C ratio was present (p < 0.0001, OR = 2.513, 95% CI: 1.567-4.032). This study showed that serum HCY and TG levels and the TG/HDL-C ratio are independent risk factors for coronary artery involvement in TA patients.
