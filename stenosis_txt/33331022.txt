Title: Pulmonary root translocation in corrected transposition of great arteries with ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis with dextrocardia.

Abstract: We present 13 years old with history of cyanosis and diagnosis of congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries with ventricle septal defect and pulmonary stenosis with dextrocardia. He underwent modified Senning procedure with pulmonary root translocation. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and was extubated on postoperative day 1. Patient remained in sinus rhythm. Postoperative echocardiography showed good biventricular function with no baffle obstruction and mild pulmonary regurgitation with no significant left and right outflow tract obstruction. Patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 and remained asymptomatic on follow up at 3 months.
