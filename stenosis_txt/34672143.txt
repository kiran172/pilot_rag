Title: Aortic valve neocuspidization (the Ozaki procedure).

Abstract: Aortic valve neocuspidization with fixed autologous pericardium according to the Ozaki technique has been proven to be an effective therapy for the treatment of aortic valvulopathies of various entities (aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, aortic valve endocarditis) in both tricuspid and bicuspid aortic valves. Thus, aortic valve neocuspidization with fixed autologous pericardium represents a versatile alternative to complex aortic valve repair, with better hemodynamics compared to biological aortic valve replacement and without the need for lifelong anticoagulation, which characterizes mechanical aortic valve replacement. The authors meticulously describe all the technical steps of this highly reproducible, standardized procedure.
