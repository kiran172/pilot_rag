Title: First-in-human feasibility study of the aXess graft (aXess-FIH): 6-Month results.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is considered the most effective hemodialysis (HD) vascular access. For patients who are not suitable for AVF, arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are the best access option for chronic HD. However, conventional AVGs are prone to intimal hyperplasia, stenosis, thrombosis, and infection. Xeltis has developed an AVG as a potential alternative to currently available AVGs based on the concept of endogenous tissue restoration. The results of the first 6-month follow-up are presented here.
METHODS: The aXess first-in-human (FIH) study [NCT04898153] is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter feasibility study that evaluates the early safety and performance of the aXess Hemodialysis Graft. A total of 20 patients with end-stage renal disease were enrolled across six European investigational sites.
RESULTS: At 6-months follow-up, all grafts were patent with primary and secondary patency rates were 80% and 100%, respectively. Three patients required a re-intervention to maintain graft patency, while one re-intervention was required to restore patency. One graft thrombosis and zero infections were reported.
CONCLUSION: The expected advantages of the novel aXess Hemodialysis Graft over conventional AVGs would be evaluated by the analysis on long-term safety and effectiveness during the 5-year follow-up of the currently ongoing trial.
