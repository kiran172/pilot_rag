Title: Hemolytic Anemia Caused by Graft Kinking Following Ascending Aortic Replacement: Endovascular Treatment With a Palmaz XL Stent.

Abstract: A 66-year-old man presented with hemolytic anemia, which required frequent blood transfusion, 6 months after surgical repair of an ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm. Hemolysis was attributed to luminal stenosis caused by graft kinking by laboratory test, CT and four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. First, an Excluder cuff was placed at the stenotic site under rapid pacing, but it migrated distally. Thereafter a Palmaz XL stent was placed at the stenotic site, which led to resolution of anemia. In this case, a Palmaz XL stent was successfully used to treat hemolytic anemia caused by graft kinking following ascending aortic surgery.
