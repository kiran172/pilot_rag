Title: Pharmacological spasm provocation testing in 2500 patients: provoked spasm incidence, complications and cardiac events.

Abstract: Pharmacological spasm provocation tests such as acetylcholine (ACh) and ergonovine (ER) had been performed in the clinic. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of provoked spasm, complications during testing and the cardiac events after these tests. From January 1991 and October 2018, we performed pharmacological spasm provocation tests in 2500 patients: 1810 ACh tests, 1232 ER tests, 542 both tests, and 310 ACh added after ER tests. ACh was injected in incremental doses of 20/50/100/200 μg into the LCA and 20/50/80 μg into the RCA. ER was administered as a total dose of 64 μg into the LCA and 40 μg into the RCA. When adding ACh after ER, the total dose was 50/80 μg into the RCA and 100/200 μg into the LCA. Positive spasm was defined as ≥ 90% stenosis and usual chest pain or ischemic ECG changes. Mean follow-up duration was 47.5 ± 29.9 months. Overall, provoked positive spasm was found in 1095 patients (43.8%). The incidence of positive provoked spasm during ACh testing was significantly higher than that during other tests (ACh: 48.7% vs. ER: 28.9%, Both: 24%, ACh added after ER: 33.5%, p < 0.001). Multiple spasms were remarkably more frequent during ACh testing compared with the other 3 types of testing (ACh: 28.2% vs. ER: 7.4%, Both: 4.1%, ACh added after ER: 13.2%, p < 0.001). No death or acute myocardial infarction was observed, while major complications during ACh testing were significantly more frequent than during ER testing. Readmission due to recurrent angina pectoris in spasm-positive patients was remarkably more frequent than in spasm-negative patients. The incidence of sudden cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation, and acute coronary syndrome were not different between the spasm-positive and spasm-negative groups during the follow-up periods. We could perform all spasm provocation tests without any irreversible complications. All sequential spasm provocation tests were useful for documenting coronary spasm.
