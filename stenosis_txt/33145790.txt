Title: Prenatal diagnosis of pulmonary artery sling associated with tracheal agenesis: A case report.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery sling (PAS) and tracheal agenesis (TA) are rare diseases, and most cases of PAS are associated with tracheal bronchial malformations. However, PAS associated with TA is yet to be reported. We report a case of PAS with TA diagnosed prenatally. Due to the extremely low incidence, physicians do not have sufficient understanding of these diseases and it is challenging to diagnose these diseases by prenatal ultrasound, with high rates of misdiagnosis. Prenatal examination of the pulmonary artery branches, trachea, and esophagus is useful; therefore, improving the accuracy of prenatal diagnosis will help in perinatal management and counseling.
