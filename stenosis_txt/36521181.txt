Title: The future of angiography: Estimates of FFR pre- and post-PCI.

Abstract: Quantitative flow reserve (QFR) allows for functional assessment of stenosis in a vessel using angiography, allowing estimation of the residual QFR (rQFR) after simulated stenting. Use of rQFR was able to predict post‐PCI FFR ≤ 0.80 and using a rQFR≤0.89 cut‐off was correlated with an increased need for repeat target vessel revascularization. Angiographic FFR tools provide rapid, safe, and complete coronary hemodynamics and will likely supplant wire‐based measurements once fully validated and properly marketed.
