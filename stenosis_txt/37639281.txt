Title: SMARCC1 is a susceptibility gene for congenital hydrocephalus with an autosomal dominant inheritance mode and incomplete penetrance.

Abstract: A Jewish couple of mixed origin was referred for genetic counseling following termination of pregnancy at 18Â weeks of gestation due to severe ventriculomegaly with aqueduct stenosis. Trio exome sequencing revealed a loss-of-function heterozygous variant in the SMARCC1 gene inherited from an unaffected mother. The SMARCC1 gene is associated with embryonic neurodevelopmental processes. Recent studies have linked perturbations of the gene with autosomal dominant congenital hydrocephalus, albeit with reduced penetrance. However, these studies were not referenced in the SMARCC1 OMIM record (*601732) and the gene was not considered, at the time, an OMIM morbid gene. Following our case and appeal, SMARCC1 is now considered a susceptibility gene for hydrocephalus. This allowed us to reclassify the variant as likely pathogenic and empowered the couple to make informed reproductive choices.
