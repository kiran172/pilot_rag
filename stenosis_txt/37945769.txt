Title: Utility of Zero-Echo time sequence as an adjunct for MR evaluation of degenerative disease in the cervical spine.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Determine the utility of ZTE as an adjunct to routine MR for assessing degenerative disease in the cervical spine.
METHODS: Retrospective study on 42 patients with cervical MR performed with ZTE from 1/1/2022 to 4/30/22. Fellowship trained radiologists evaluated each cervical disc level for neural foraminal (NF) narrowing, canal stenosis (CS), facet arthritis (FA), and presence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). When NF narrowing and CS were present, the relative contributions of bone and soft disc were determined and a confidence level for doing so was assigned. Comparisons were made between assessments on routine MR without and with ZTE.
RESULTS: With ZTE added, bone contribution as a cause of NF narrowing increased in 47% (n = 110) of neural foramina and decreased in 12% (n = 29) (p =  < 0.001). Bone contribution as a cause of CS increased in 25% (n = 33) of disc levels and decreased in 10% (n = 13) (p = 0.013). Confidence increased in identifying the cause of NF narrowing (p =  < 0.001)) and CS (p = 0.009) with ZTE. The cause of NF narrowing (p = 0.007) and CS (p = 0.041) changed more frequently after ZTE was added when initial confidence in making the determination was low. There was no change in detection of FA or presence of OPLL with ZTE.
CONCLUSION: Addition of ZTE to a routine cervical spine MR changes the assessment of the degree of bone involvement in degenerative cervical spine pathology.
