Title: [The role of maxillofacial prosthodontics in the prevention of radiation].

Abstract: Tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract (ADT) are the most frequent tumors in the world, and among the tumors of the ENT sphere, the frequency of cancers of the oral cavity occupies the third place after that of the larynx and oropharynx. The treatment of these pathologies is heavy and complex. It is the result of a combination of several interventions, namely surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Among the consequences of radiotherapy, we can mention the embrittlement of dental tissues, osteoradionecrosis, stenosis of muscular tissues or radiomucitis of oral mucosal tissues. All these complications encourage the preparation of the patient before radiotherapy in order to mitigate the consequences and prevent complications. Through this work, we illustrate the place of maxillofacial prosthodontics in the prevention of the irradiated patient, through several prosthetic, medical or medicinal means.
