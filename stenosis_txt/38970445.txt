Title: The Global Experience of Laryngeal Transplantation: Series of Eleven Patients in Three Continents.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The loss of laryngeal function affects breathing, swallowing, and voice, thus severely compromises quality of life. Laryngeal transplantation has long been suggested as a solution for selected highly affected patients with complete laryngeal function loss.
OBJECTIVE: To obtain insights regarding the advantages, weaknesses, and limitations of this procedure and facilitate future advances, we collected uniform data from all known laryngeal transplants reported internationally.
METHODOLOGY: A case series. Patients were enrolled retrospectively by each institutional hospital or clinic. Eleven patients with complete loss of laryngeal function undergoing total laryngeal transplantation between 1998 and 2018 were recruited.
RESULTS: After a minimum of 24 months follow-up, three patients had died (27%), and there were two graft explants in survivors, one total and one partial, due to chronic rejection. In the remaining cases, voice was functional in 62.5% and 50% achieved decannulation. Swallowing was initially restricted, but only one patient was gastrostomy-dependent by 6 months and all had normal or near-normal swallowing by the end of year two after transplantation. Median follow-up was 73 months. Functional (voice, swallowing, airway) recovery peaked between 12 and 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal transplantation is a complex procedure with significant morbidity. Significant improvements in quality of life are possible for highly selected individuals with end-stage laryngeal disorders, including laryngeal neoplasia, but further technical and pharmacological developments are required if the technique is to be more widely applicable. An international registry should be created to provide better quality pooled data for analysis of outcomes of any future laryngeal transplants.
