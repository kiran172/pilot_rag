Title: Effect of modified transanal Soave assisted by laparoscopy in the treatment of Hirschsprung's disease in children and its influencing factors.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of modified transanal Soave assisted by laparoscopy in children with Hirschsprung's disease (HD).
METHODS: The clinical data of 120 children with Hirschsprung's disease admitted to Fujian Children's Hospital from January 2018 to November 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the surgical methods, 58 children treated with modified transanal Soave were regarded as the modified group and 62 children treated with modified transanal Soave assisted by laparoscopy were divided into the laparoscopic group. The operative indexes, anal function, quality of life and perianal pressure 6 months after surgery, complications within 1 month after surgery, and recovery within 6 months after surgery of the two groups were compared. The risk factors influencing the postoperative recovery of hirschsprung's disease in children were analyzed by univariate and logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay and gastrointestinal recovery time in the laparoscopic group were lower than those in modified group (P &lt; 0.05). The excellent and good rate of postoperative anal function in laparoscopic group was 87.10%, which was higher than that in modified group (68.97%) (P &lt; 0.05). The proportion of patients with good quality of life in laparoscopic group (90.32%) was higher than that in modified group (74.14%) (P &lt; 0.05). The anal resting pressure and systolic pressure in laparoscopic group were lower than those in modified group (all P &lt; 0.05). The total complication rate of laparoscopic group (6.45%) was lower than that of modified group (22.41%) (P &lt; 0.05). After 6 months, 64 cases (53.33%) were cured and 56 cases (46.67%) were not. After univariate analysis, there were statistically significant differences in enteritis, abdominal distension, and anastomotic stenosis between cured children and uncured children (all P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference in other factors (P &gt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that enteritis, abdominal distension and anastomotic stenosis were the risk factors affecting the recovery of hirschsprung's disease in children (all P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Modified transanal Soave assisted by laparoscopy can improve anal function and quality of life, relieve anal pressure, and have a low complication rate. Enteritis, abdominal distension, and anastomotic stenosis are the factors affecting the recovery of Hirschsprung's disease in children.
