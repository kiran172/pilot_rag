Title: Balloon coarctation angioplasty with non-compliant balloon in low-birth-weight premature infants.

Abstract: Although surgery is the standard treatment for native coarctation in neonates, it carries a high risk of complications. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty may be considered as an alternative treatment. The materials used in the intervention should be selected carefully to reduce complications. We recommended the use of non-compliant balloons in risky babies. They are more effective in the treatment of strick stenosis than compliant balloons.
