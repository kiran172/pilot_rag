Title: Use of Acellular Dermal Matrix for Urethroplasty Coverage in Proximal Hypospadias Repair: a Pilot Study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The complication rates of proximal hypospadias, especially fistula, are much higher than those of distal hypospadias. Urethral coverage is an effective method for reducing fistulas. Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been shown to exhibit structural compatibility and biocompatibility, both of which promote tissue healing.
METHODS: The present non-randomized study evaluated the efficiency, feasibility, and safety of using ADM for urethroplasty coverage in patients with proximal hypospadias. This prospective study enrolled 35 patients (age range 15-60 months) with proximal hypospadias who underwent operation between September 2018 and March 2019 at Beijing Children's Hospital (Beijing, China). Urethroplasties were performed by the transverse preputial island flap (TPIF) technique. ADM was applied and sutured over the urethroplasty as an additional covering layer. Patient outcomes were compared with those of 80 non-matched control patients with proximal hypospadias who underwent the same procedure, with dartos as a covering layer.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.56 months (range 9-15 months), urethral fistula occurred in six patients (17.1%) in the ADM group and 28 patients (35%) in the dartos group. Superficial wound infection was observed in six patients (17.1%) in the ADM group and 10 patients (12.5%) in the dartos group. One patient in the ADM group had diverticulum, compared with five patients (6.25%) in the dartos group. Meatal stenosis and urethral stricture were observed in four patients (11.4%) in the ADM group and six patients (7.5%) in the dartos group; all of these complications were treated conservatively. No glans dehiscence was observed in either group.
CONCLUSION: Use of ADM may be a safe and efficient covering technique to provide an additional coverage layer for proximal hypospadias repair, thereby reducing the incidence of fistula formation, especially among patients who have poor-quality covering materials.
