Title: Causes of Pulsatile Tinnitus and Treatment Options.

Abstract: Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) requires detailed workup to evaluate for an underlying structural cause. With advances in neuroimaging, structural venous abnormalities that can cause PT have becoming increasingly recognized. A number of anomalies, including dural arteriovenous fistulas, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, transverse sinus stenosis, sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities, jugular venous anomalies, and hypertrophied emissary veins, have been implicated in flow disruption and turbulence in the vicinity of auditory structures, resulting in PT. Endovascular treatment options, including stenting, coiling, and embolization with liquid agents, have demonstrated high efficacy and safety. These treatments can lead to symptomatic relief in carefully selected cases.
