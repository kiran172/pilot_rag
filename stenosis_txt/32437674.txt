Title: Aortic Valve Repair for Aortic Insufficiency or Dilatation: Technical Evolution and Long-term Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve repair (AVR) is an attractive alternative to valve replacement for the treatment of aortic valve insufficiency. Here we report on the midterm outcomes after AVR for aortic valve insufficiency with an emphasis on durability of repair.
METHODS: Between 1996 and 2017, 560 consecutive patients (mean age, 57 ± 16 years) underwent various AVR procedures on tricuspid (n = 415, 74%) and bicuspid (n = 145, 26%) aortic valves. In 313 patients (56%) the David procedure was performed, whereas in 247 patients (44%) cusp repair without aortic root procedure was conducted. Concomitant procedures were coronary artery bypass grafting in 82 patients (15%) and mitral valve repair in 47 patients (8%). Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was complete in 97% of patients. Mean follow-up was 6.3 ± 4.6 years.
RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 1.4% (n = 8). Late mortality was observed in 132 patients with cardiovascular events accounting for mortality in 13 patients: Survival at 10 years was 70%. Reoperation on the aortic valve was performed on 39 patients for recurrent insufficiency, isolated in 25, or combined with valve stenosis in 5 patients; endocarditis accounted for reoperation in 9 patients (0.2% per patient-year). Freedom from reoperation was 88% at 10 years. Cumulative linearized incidence of all valve-related complications was 2% per patient per year.
CONCLUSIONS: AVR for insufficiency is a durable procedure with low valve-related morbidity and mortality in the midterm.
