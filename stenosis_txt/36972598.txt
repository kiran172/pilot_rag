Title: Prevalence of Coronary Artery Disease in Patients Undergoing Valvular Heart Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in different valve dysfunction has been unclear.
METHODS: We reviewed patients, who underwent valve heart surgery and coronary angiography from 2008 to 2021, at our center.
RESULTS: A total of 7,932 patients were included in the present study, and 1,332 (16.8%) had CAD. The mean age of the study cohort was 60.5±7.9 years, and 4,206 (53.0%) were male. CAD was 21.4% in aortic disease, 16.2% in mitral valve disease, 11.8% in isolated tricuspid valve disease, and 13.0% in combined aortic and mitral valve disease. Patients with aortic stenosis were older than those with regurgitation (63.6±7.4 years vs. 59.5±8.2 years, P < 0.001), and the CAD risks also were higher (28.0% vs. 19.2%, P < 0.001). The age difference was minimal (60.6±8.2 years vs. 59.5±6.7 years, P = 0.002) between patients with mitral valve regurgitation and stenosis, but the risks of CAD were twice high in regurgitation (20.2% vs. 10.5%, P < 0.001). When the type of valve impairment was not considered, non-rheumatic etiology, advanced age, male sex, hypertension, and diabetes were independent predictors of CAD.
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing valve surgery, the prevalence of CAD was influenced by conventional risk factors. Importantly, CAD also was associated with the type and etiology of valve diseases.
