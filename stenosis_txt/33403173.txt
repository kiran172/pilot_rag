Title: Symptomatic Cervical Tumoral Calcinosis due to Cosmetic Body Contouring Mineral Oil Injections.

Abstract: Tumoral calcinosis (TC) is an uncommon disease that has been linked to familial genetic mutations but can often be due to secondary causes such as chronic renal failure and hyperparathyroidism. There are rare instances of tumoral calcinosis induced by foreign body injections, often for cosmetic purposes. Here we describe operative management of spinal cord compression due to mineral oil injection induced tumoral calcinosis. A 54-year-old transgender female presented with signs of myelopathy so severe that she had become wheelchair bound. Labs demonstrated hypercalcemia and imaging of the neuroaxis revealed significant calcification resulting in cervicothoracic and lumbar central canal stenosis. Given symptomatic cervical spinal cord compression, she was taken to the OR for urgent laminectomy and decompression. Postoperatively, she recovered well and was ambulating independently by postoperative day (POD) 9. This is the first reported case of localized mineral oil injections causing distant calcification with subsequent symptomatic cord compression requiring operative intervention.
