Title: Elevated high-sensitivity troponin T levels at 1-year follow-up are associated with increased long-term mortality after TAVR.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Elevated pre-procedural high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) levels predict adverse outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). It is unknown whether elevated troponin levels still provide prognostic information during follow-up after successful TAVR. We evaluated the long-term implications of elevated hs-TnT levels found at 1-year post-TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 349 patients who underwent TAVR for severe AS from 2010-2019 and for whom 1-year hs-TnT levels were available. Any required percutaneous coronary interventions were performed &gt; 1 week before TAVR. The primary endpoint was survival time starting at 1-year post-TAVR. Optimal hs-TnT cutoff for stratifying risk, identified by ROC analysis, was 39.4 pg/mL. 292 patients had hs-TnT &lt; 39.4 pg/mL (median 18.3 pg/mL) and 57 had hs-TnT ≥ 39.4 pg/mL (median 51.2 pg/mL). The high hs-TnT group had a higher median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, greater left ventricular (LV) mass, higher prevalence of severe diastolic dysfunction, LV ejection fraction &lt; 35%, severe renal dysfunction, and more men compared with the low hs-TnT group. All-cause mortality during follow-up after TAVR was significantly higher among patients who had hs-TnT ≥ 39.4 pg/mL compared with those who did not (mortality rate at 2 years post-TAVR: 12.3% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.010). Multivariate analysis identified 1-year hs-TnT ≥ 39.4 pg/mL (hazard ratio 2.93, 95% CI 1.91-4.49, p &lt; 0.001), NT-proBNP level &gt; 300 pg/mL, male sex, an eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as independent risk factors for long-term mortality after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated hs-TnT concentrations at 1-year after TAVR were associated with a higher long-term mortality.
