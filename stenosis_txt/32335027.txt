Title: Endovascular Treatment of Critical Hand Ischemia: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To clarify the role of endovascular treatment in patients with Critical Hand Ischemia of the distal upper extremity.
METHODS: From January 2012 to January 2017, 18 dialyzed patients presented chronic critical hand ischemia; 6 patients had a chronic occlusion of the ulnar artery and radial artery stenosis, 5 patients had a chronic occlusion of the radial artery and ulnar artery stenosis, 4 patients presented multiple stenosis of the ulnar, radial and interosseous arteries, 2 patients had only ulnar artery occlusion while one patient presented only radial artery occlusion. All patients underwent duplex ultrasound and a subsequent brachial angiography, in order to evaluate the distal run-off circulation. Revascularization was achieved via antegrade brachial puncture in all patients, with retrograde approach in 4 patients, with distal retrograde puncture in 3 patients and in one patient with loop technique.
RESULTS: No complications were observed during the periprocedural follow-up. One patient was not successfully revascularized (technical success rate: 94.4%). The patient had no direct flow after ulnar artery angioplasty. The procedure was clinical effective in 15 patients (clinical success rate: 83.3%). Clinical evaluation and Duplex-US were performed in the follow up period. TcpO2 evaluated in the perilesional skin surface increased from 20.2 ± 6.5 mmHg to 53.8 ± 13.1 mmHg in the follow up period (P < .01). We observed an improvement of pain, ulcers and infection healing in all treated remaining patients during the postoperative period.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous intervention prevents hand loss and functional impairment in patients with Critical Hand Ischemia and multiple comorbidities.
