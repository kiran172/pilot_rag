Title: Tracheal Reconstruction for Congenital Tracheal Stenosis: A 950-Gram Neonate.

Abstract: Congenital tracheal stenosis is a rare but life-threatening malformation of the trachea. Surgical reconstruction is high risk, and not frequently performed in neonates born of extreme prematurity and low birth weight. We present the case of an extremely premature 950-gram neonate with severe congenital tracheal stenosis who underwent tracheal reconstruction. Complete repair, with no residual stenosis, was achieved with slide tracheoplasty without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass.
