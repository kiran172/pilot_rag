Title: Reversible cerebral vasospasm and cerebral infarction secondary to meningitis following penetrating head trauma with bamboo.

Abstract: A man in the 70s fell on a bamboo and punctured his left upper eyelid. CT of the head showed fractures of the medial and superior walls of the left orbit, intracranial traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, intraventricular haematoma and left frontal cerebral contusion. He was treated conservatively. Despite prophylactic antibiotic therapy, he had prolonged loss of consciousness. A cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed bacterial meningitis. Imaging studies on day 15 showed extensive subacute cerebral infarction in the bilateral parieto-occipital lobes and main trunk artery stenosis. On day 31, MRA showed improvement of the main arteries, and cerebral vasospasm-induced cerebral infarction was diagnosed. He was transferred to rehabilitation with full assistance. The prognosis of bamboo perforation trauma is critical. Thus, preventing and treating central nervous system infection are considered the key to the prognosis. However, given the lack of established treatment for meningitis-associated cerebral vasospasm, case-specific treatment must be considered.
