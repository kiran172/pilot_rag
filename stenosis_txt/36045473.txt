Title: A rare case of Watson syndrome.

Abstract: Watson for the first time reported a case series of children in a family that presented with pulmonary valve stenosis, mental retardation, short stature, and small brown color skin lesions that are known as cafe-au-lait spots. We present a rare new variant of the syndrome in an adult patient with severe pulmonary valve stenosis, main, left, and right pulmonary artery aneurysm, short stature, mental retardation, coronary artery disease, and skin lesions. The patient underwent open cardiac surgery with pulmonary valvotomy and aneurysmorrhaphy of the main pulmonary artery and its right and left branches. The postoperative course was uneventful and the six-month follow-up with transthoracic echocardiography revealed no recurrence of aneurysm of repairing pulmonary arteries and good clinical outcome of the patient. Our patient had a unique characteristic of aneurysm of the main pulmonary artery and its both branches that has rarely been reported previously in the medical literature.
