Title: Endoscopic resolution of intestinal obstruction secondary to colonic gallstone ileus and radicular stenosis of the sigma.

Abstract: A 93-year-old woman with a history of endometrial adenocarcinoma treated with surgery and pelvic radiotherapy that led to radicular stenosis in the sigma and acute biliary pancreatitis, without subsequent cholecystectomy. She attended the emergency department for abdominal pain, vomiting and abdominal distension, with metallic noises. An abdominal CT scan showed a gallbladder with cholelithiasis, in wide contact with the colonic framework and dilation of the colonic loops with hydro-aerial levels with a partially calcified image embedded in the known sigmoid stenosis, compatible with intestinal obstruction. Given the high surgical risk, colonoscopy was performed, which identified an impassable punctate stricture with a fibrous appearance. Pneumatic dilatation and subsequent removal of gallstones with biopsy forceps was performed, with an adequate evolution. While gallstone ileus is a rare condition that accounts for 5% of episodes of intestinal obstruction, its location in the colon is even rarer. It is usually managed surgically, with a significant impact on morbidity. This case is of interest because of the infrequent occurrence of obstruction secondary to these two concomitant causes and the possible usefulness of endoscopic treatment in patients at high surgical risk.
