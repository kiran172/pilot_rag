Title: Junctional kyphosis and junctional failure after multi-segmental posterior cervicothoracic fusion - A retrospective analysis of 64 patients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Junctional kyphosis (JK) and junctional failure (JF) are known complications after thoracolumbar spinal deformity surgery. This study aims to define the incidence and possible risk factors for JK/JF following multi-segmental cervicothoracic fusion.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 64 consecutive patients undergoing cervicothoracic fusion surgery, including at least five segments. Clinical and radiographic outcome measures were analyzed. A univariate analysis was performed to determine the effect of the level of upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) and lower instrumented vertebra (LIV), fusion status, C2 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), C2-C7 lordotic angle and T1 slope angle on the occurrence of JK/JF.
RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were followed up for a median of 1.1 years (range 0.3-4) with a median age of 65.5 years (range 42.2-84.5). Indication for surgery was spinal stenosis in 87%, trauma in 7%, and tumor in 6% of cases. The median number of levels fused was 7; the most frequent UIV was C2, and the most frequent LIV was T2. Solid fusion was achieved in 78% at the last follow-up. Postoperatively, the median C2 SVA was 32 mm (range - 7-75), median T1 slope angle was 33° (range 2°-57°), C2-C7 sagittal cobb angle was 4° (-29°-12°). JK developed in 4% of cases, no case of JF was observed. No statistically significant impact of bone density, level of UIV, level of LIV or postoperative sagittal parameters on the occurrence of JK/JF was observed, even though fusion status and pathologic T1 slope angle showed a trend toward significance.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with mildly pathologic sagittal balance, JK was a rare event after multi-segmental fusion, observed in only 4% of cases. Neither level of UIV nor LIV had an influence on its occurrence; however, nonunion and pathologic sagittal alignment showed a nonsignificant trend.
