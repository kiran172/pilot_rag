Title: Prognostic Value of Non-Invasive Global Myocardial Work in Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the modification of non-invasive myocardial work (MW) indices related to aortic stenosis (AS) stages of cardiac damage and their prognostic value. The echocardiographic and outcome data of 170 patients, with asymptomatic moderate-to-severe AS and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, and 50 age- and sex-comparable healthy controls were analysed. Primary endpoints were the occurrence of all-cause and cardiovascular death. Increased values of the global work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), and global wasted work (GWW) were observed in AS patients compared to controls (GWI: 2528 ± 521 vs. 2005 ± 302 mmHg%, GCW: 2948 ± 598 vs. 2360 ± 353 mmHg%, p < 0.001; GWW: 139 ± 90 vs. 90 ± 49 mmHg%, p = 0.005), with no changes in the global work efficiency. When patients were stratified according to the stages of cardiac damage, the GWI showed lower values in Stage 3−4 as compared to Stage 0 and Stage 2 (p = 0.024). During a mean follow-up of 30 months, 27 patients died. In multivariable Cox-regression analysis, adjusted for confounders, GWI (HR: 0.998, CI: 0.997−1.000; p = 0.034) and GCW (HR:0.998, CI: 0.997−0.999; p = 0.003) were significantly associated with excess mortality. When used as categorical variables, a GWI ≤ 1951 mmHg% and a GCW ≤ 2475 mmHg% accurately predicted all-cause and cardiovascular death at 4-year follow-up. In conclusion, in asymptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe AS, reduced values of GWI and GCW are associated with increased mortality. Therefore, the evaluation of MW indices may allow for a better identification of asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe AS and preserved LVEF whom are at increased risk of worse prognosis during follow-up.
