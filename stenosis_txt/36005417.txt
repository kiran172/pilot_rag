Title: Epicardial Adipose Tissue in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease: A Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the association between epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and coronary artery disease (CAD) via meta−analysis. Methods: Specific searches of online databases from January 2000 to May 2022 were conducted. All observational studies evaluating the association between EAT and CAD in PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases were screened. A meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta−Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). In total, 21 studies encompassing 4975 subjects met the inclusion criteria, including 2377 diagnosed and assigned as the CAD group, while the other 2598 were assigned as the non−CAD group. Subjects in the CAD group were further divided into the severe stenosis group (stenosis ≥ 50%, n = 846) and the mild/moderate stenosis group (stenosis < 50%, n = 577). Results: Both the volume and thickness of EAT in the CAD group were larger compared to the non−CAD group (p < 0.00001). In a subgroup analysis within the CAD group, the severe stenosis group had a larger volume and thickness with respect to EAT when compared to the mild/moderate group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The enlargement of EAT presented in CAD patients with an association with CAD severity. Although limited by different CAD types and measuring methods for EAT, as well as a smaller sample size, our results suggest that EAT is a novel predictor and a potential therapeutic target for CAD.
