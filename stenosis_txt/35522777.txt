Title: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension imaging approaches and the implications in patient management.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) represents a clinical disease entity without a clear etiology, that if left untreated, can result in severe outcomes, including permanent vision loss. For this reason, early diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Historically, the role of cross-sectional imaging has been to rule out secondary or emergent causes of increased intracranial pressure, including tumor, infection, hydrocephalus, or venous thrombosis. MRI and MRV, however, can serve as valuable imaging tools to not only rule out causes for secondary intracranial hypertension but can also detect indirect signs of IIH resultant from increased intracranial pressure, and demonstrate potentially treatable sinus venous stenosis. Digital subtraction venographic imaging also plays a central role in both diagnosis and treatment, providing enhanced anatomic delineation and temporal flow evaluation, quantitative assessment of the pressure gradient across a venous stenosis, treatment guidance, and immediate opportunity for endovascular therapy. In this review, we discuss the multiple modalities for imaging IIH, their limitations, and their contributions to the management of IIH.
