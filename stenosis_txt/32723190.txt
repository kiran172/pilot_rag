Title: Serum exosomal miR-122-5p is a new biomarker for both acute coronary syndrome and underlying coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Acute coronary syndrome presents as unstable angina (UA) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We explored the use of exosomal miR-122-5p as a biomarker for UA and AMI and determined whether its expression level is positively correlated with the severity of coronary stenosis.
METHODS: This study enrolled 34 patients with AMI, 31 patients with UA, and 22 control subjects. qPCR was used to detect the expression levels of serum exosomal miR-122-5p.
RESULTS: The expression of serum exosomal miR-122-5p in UA and AMI patients was significantly higher than that in the control group, and expression levels differed between UA and AMI patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that serum exosomal miR-122-5p might be used as a diagnostic biomarker for AMI and UA. In addition, we also found that serum exosomal miR-122-5p was positively correlated with the severity of coronary artery stenosis for UA patients based on the Gensini score. Serum exosomal miR-122-5p was highly expressed in patients with a coronary artery stenosis severity greater than 80% during acute coronary syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Serum exosomal miR-122-5p might be useful as a diagnostic biomarker for AMI and UA, and increased serum exosomal miR-122-5p levels could be useful to predict the severity of coronary lesions.
