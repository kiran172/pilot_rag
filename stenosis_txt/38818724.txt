Title: Coronary Artery Obstruction After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Past, Present, and Future.

Abstract: Coronary obstruction (CO) is a rare but critical complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review elucidates the evolving landscape of CO risk assessment and management strategies in the contemporary era of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Drawing upon recent advances in computed tomography angiography, we delve into the nuanced evaluation of anatomic parameters crucial for predicting CO risk. Furthermore, this review explores the utility of interventional and surgical techniques, including chimney stenting and leaflet modification systems, in mitigating CO complications. In summary, this review serves as a practical guide for clinicians navigating the complexities of CO prevention and management in the evolving landscape of transcatheter aortic valve implantation, with the goal of optimizing patient outcomes and ensuring procedural success.
