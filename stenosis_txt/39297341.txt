Title: Visualizing the invisible: aortopulmonary window diagnosis enhanced by 3D computer graphics.

Abstract: An aortopulmonary window is a rare disorder that occurs in 0.1â€“0.2% of all congenital disorders. Our patient was a 1-month-old boy weighing 4180 g. The patient had heart failure associated with an aortopulmonary window. We used 3-dimensional computer graphic software (Viewtify, SCIEMENT) for diagnosis based on DICOM data from contrast-enhanced computed tomography. This made it easy to identify anatomical landmarks and findings and select the most suitable approach. We avoided stenosis of the right pulmonary artery and aorta. We encountered a case of an aortopulmonary window in which 3-dimensional computer graphic software was helpful in selecting the surgical technique. We report this case using 3-dimensional computer graphic images and present a review of the literature.
