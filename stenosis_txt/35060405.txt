Title: Correlation Between Retinopathy and Coronary Microcirculation Dysfunction in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between retinopathy and coronary microcirculation dysfunction (CMD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.
METHODS: 198 T2DM patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)>50%, no epicardial coronary artery stenosis diagnosis by coronary angiography (CAG) and successfully completed coronary blood flow reserve (CFR) test and laboratory examination were enrolled, and fundus examination was performed on all participants. Two groups were divided according to CFR value, including 86 patients with CMD (CFR≤2.5) in study group and 112 patients without CMD (CFR>2.5) in control group. The composition of various retinopathy in two groups was observed, and the correlation between retinopathy and CMD was analyzed using ordered logistic regression.
RESULTS: There were 13 cases with arteriovenous (A/V) nicking, 4 cases with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), 14 cases with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), 17 cases with diabetic retinopathy (DR) with A/V nicking, 38 cases without retinopathy in study group, and 18 cases, 7 cases, 20 cases, 4 cases and 63 cases for each in control group. After adjustment for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes duration, dyslipidemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), A/V nicking, PDR and NPDR, the diference of DR with A/V nicking between study and control group remained statistically signifcant (OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.21, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: DR with A/V nicking could be used as an independent predictor of T2DM patients with CMD. CFR testing should be performed on patients with this kind of eye sign, even if they do not have any symptoms of heart disease. Meanwhile, DR with A/V nicking might be served as a reference indicator of CMD in T2DM patients with chest pain who were unable to be tested for CFR.
