Title: Outcomes of Carotid Artery Stenting and Endarterectomy in Patients with Prior Contralateral Carotid Revascularization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) are available treatment options for stroke prevention in individuals with severe carotid stenosis. This study aims to compare the early postoperative outcomes in patients who underwent CEA or CAS after prior contralateral carotid revascularization.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the Society of Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database, identifying patients who had prior carotid artery revascularization followed by a contralateral CEA or CAS between 2017 and 2023. Based on the sequence of the procedures performed, patients were categorized into 4 groups: 1) patients who had a prior unilateral CEA followed by a contralateral CEA; 2) patients who had a prior unilateral CAS followed by a contralateral CEA; 3) patients had a prior unilateral CAS followed by a contralateral CAS; and 4) patients had a prior unilateral CEA followed by a contralateral CAS. Univariate analysis (Pearson χ2, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and multivariate logistic regression were employed to assess length of stay, rates of in-hospital stroke, myocardial infarction, new-onset arrhythmia, and 30-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 20,761 patients with a history of prior unilateral carotid revascularization procedures were identified, of which 12,788 underwent contralateral CEA and another 7,973 underwent contralateral CAS. Compared to the prior unilateral CAS followed by a contralateral CAS group, patients who underwent CEA followed by contralateral CAS (prior unilateral CEA followed by a contralateral CAS group) were associated with higher rates of postoperative in-hospital stroke (1.8% vs. 1%, P = 0.003), new-onset arrhythmia (2% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.006), and 30-day mortality (1.3% vs. 0.8%, P = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, preoperative use of statins and beta-blockers was associated with lower odds of in-hospital stroke (odds ratio [OR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval 0.29-0.69; P = 0.0002) and new-onset arrhythmia (OR 0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.9; P = 0.01), respectively, after CAS. There were no significant differences in outcomes for prior unilateral CEA followed by a contralateral CEA and prior unilateral CEA followed by a contralateral CAS groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with prior CEA undergoing contralateral CAS had higher rates of in-hospital stroke, new-onset arrhythmia, and 30-day mortality. Beta-blockers may reduce postoperative arrhythmia rates in these patients, and established regimens should not be discontinued in the perioperative period; however, further prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding. Optimized medical treatment and appropriate imaging follow-up remain crucial for improvement outcomes.
