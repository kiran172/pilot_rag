Title: Ferumoxytol-enhanced MR Venography of the Central Veins of the Thorax for the Evaluation of Stenosis and Occlusion in Patients with Renal Impairment.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic performance of ferumoxytol-enhanced MR venography for the detection of thoracic central vein stenosis or occlusion with conventional venography as the reference standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, consecutive patients from May 2012 to December 2018 underwent dedicated ferumoxytol-enhanced MR venography of the thoracic central veins and conventional venography within 6 months for detecting central venous stenosis. The central veins were divided into seven segments for evaluation. MR venography images were evaluated by three radiologists for presence of stenosis or occlusion. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Fleiss κ.
RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were included (mean age, 49 years; age range, 12-75 years; 18 females). Of the 122 total venous segments with corresponding conventional venography, 73 were stenotic or occluded. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of stenosis or occlusion was 99% and 98%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting occlusion alone was 96% and 98%, respectively. MR venography readers demonstrated moderate agreement in their ability to grade stenosis or occlusion (κ = 0.59). There were no adverse events related to contrast agent administration.
CONCLUSION: Ferumoxytol-enhanced MR venography demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity for detection of thoracic central vein stenosis or occlusion.© RSNA, 2020See also the commentary by Finn in this issue.
