Title: Longitudinal Control of Lipid Levels in Patients With Premature Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) is a central aspect of the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and the benefits of LLT accrue over time. However, there are limited real-world data on longitudinal lipid control in patients with premature CAD.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess longitudinal attainment of guideline-recommended lipid goals and outcomes in a contemporary cohort of patients with premature CAD.
METHODS: We enrolled males younger than 50 years and females younger than 55 years with coronary stenosis of >50% and examined achievement of lipid goals, LLT characteristics, and cardiovascular outcomes (major adverse cardiovascular event [MACE]).
RESULTS: Of 476 patients who presented with acute coronary syndrome (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, unstable angina) (68%), stable angina (28%), or other symptoms, 73.2% achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <1.8 mmol/L on at least 1 occasion, but only 27.3% consistently stayed in the target range for 3 years after diagnosis. Although 73.9% of patients received high-intensity LLT at the time of diagnosis, only 43.5% had good adherence over the following 3 years. In multivariable analysis, 1 mmol/L increase in time-weighted average exposure to LDL-C, but not the lowest achieved LDL-C, was associated with a higher risk of MACE, hazard ratio 2.02 (95% CI: 1.48-2.76), when adjusted for sex, age, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: We found low rates of longitudinal lipid target achievement in patients with premature CAD. Cumulative LDL-C exposure, but not lowest achieved LDL-C, was associated with risk of MACE. This highlights the critical importance of longitudinal control of lipids levels and identifies opportunities to improve LLT and maximize the time-dependent benefits of lipid-lowering.
