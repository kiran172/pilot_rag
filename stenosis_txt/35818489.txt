Title: Double Chamber Right Ventricle with New-Onset Biventricular Failure in an Octogenarian.

Abstract: • DCRV may be an incidental finding in asymptomatic adults. • DCRV may be unmasked by acquired cardiac conditions. • PS-type murmur with RVH on electrocardiogram should raise suspicion for DCRV. • RV midcavitary obstruction on echo is a classic finding in DCRV. • TTE can diagnose DCRV, but CMR, CTA, or invasive catheter may be needed in adults.
