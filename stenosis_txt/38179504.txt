Title: Carotid plaque score and ischemic stroke risk stratification through a combination of B-mode and contrast-enhanced ultrasound in patients with low and intermediate carotid stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The occurrence of ischemic stroke (IS) is closely related to the characteristics of carotid plaque (CP). Due to the effect of stroke risk stratification based on B-mode ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) that has not been studied in patients with low and intermediate carotid stenosis, we construct and validate a CP score and ischemic stroke risk stratification (ISRS) using a combination of B-mode and CEUS, in order to provide new convenient strategies to stratify these patients to prevent stroke.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 705 patients with low and intermediate carotid stenosis who underwent B-mode and CEUS from November 2021 to April 2023. Qualitative B-mode and CEUS features of carotid plaques were analyzed using a univariable and multivariable logistic regression to construct the CP score. Then, we combined the CP score with Essen stroke risk score (ESRS) to develop ISRS.
RESULTS: This study included a total of 705 patients with low and intermediate carotid stenosis, of which 394 were symptomatic patients (with a mean age of 71.03 ± 10.48 years) and 311 were asymptomatic patients (with a mean age of 65.13 ± 10.31 years). Plaque echogenicity, plaque morphology, carotid intima-media thickness in B-mode US and intraplaque neovascularization grading and perfusion pattern in CEUS were significantly associated with IS. The ISRS incorporating these five predictors and ESRS showed good discrimination and calibration in both primary cohort [area under the curve (AUC), 0.91; Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p = 0.903] and validation cohort (AUC, 0.84; Hosmer-Lemeshow test, p = 0.886).
CONCLUSION: We developed an effective and practical tool to identify and stratify patients with low and intermediate carotid stenosis, based on the CP score and ISRS estimation. Our study may provide new insights into managing patients with no indication of surgery.
