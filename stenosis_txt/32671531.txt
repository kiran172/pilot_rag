Title: Telescoping flow diverters for a pediatric fusiform distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysm: technical case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Pediatric intracranial aneurysms are rare, with fusiform aneurysms of the distal anterior circulation even more so. A limited number of prior reports detail the management of this pathology.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 15-year-old boy presenting with new-onset headache found to have a 3.1 cm × 1.4 cm × 1.4 cm fusiform partially thrombosed aneurysm of the A2 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery. Subsequent treatment with flow diversion resulted in the placement of five telescoping PEDs (2.5 mm × 20 mm, 2.75 mm × 20 mm, 2.75 mm × 20 mm, 3 mm × 25 mm, and 3 mm × 20 mm) from the left pericallosal artery to the left A1 segment. Catheter-based angiography at 6 months post-placement indicated normal vessel caliber, no residual aneurysm, and no in-stent stenosis. The patient's headache resolved after treatment.
CONCLUSION: Telescoping PEDs are a feasible low-risk treatment option for long-segment fusiform distal ACA aneurysms in children that can have optimal clinical and radiographic outcomes.
