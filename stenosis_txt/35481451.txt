Title: Super telescopic catheter system parallel to a contralateral stiff guide wire to cross extremely complex pulmonary arteries.

Abstract: Access to complex stenotic pulmonary arteries can be challenging due to their anatomy or secondary to prior multiple surgeries and interventions. Two techniques have been previously described to address this issue: the telescopic catheter-in-long sheath parallel to a stiff guidewire technique and the use of a microcatheter in a telescopic scope. We integrated and modified these techniques creating a super telescopic system with a SuperCross® microcatheter-in-catheter-in-long sheath, parallel to a contralateral stiff guidewire to access a previously repaired and stented left pulmonary artery. The stiff wire support and the 90° flexiblity of the Supercross® microcatheter assembled coaxial to the diagnostic catheter and the long sheath contributed to the successful ballooning and stenting-in-stent of the pulmonary artery.
