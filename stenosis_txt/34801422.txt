Title: National Trends and Outcomes of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement With Concomitant Mitral Valve Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Incidence of multivalvular heart disease is increasing, with aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation being the most common. Data are limited on outcomes of patients undergoing multivalvular surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate contemporary trends and in-hospital outcomes for combined surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and mitral valve repair (MVr) or replacement (MVR).
METHODS: We identified patient hospitalizations aged ≥18 years who underwent SAVR + MVr or MVR between 2004 and 2018 using the National Inpatient Sample. Data were weighted to estimate national estimates of the entire US hospitalized population. Exclusion criteria included endocarditis, history of heart transplant or left ventricular assist device, and any other concomitant valve surgery.
RESULTS: Between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2018, there were 68,882 weighted admissions for SAVR with concomitant mitral valve surgery. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 8.34% with significantly higher inpatient mortality in SAVR + MVR group compared with SAVR + MVr group (9.91% vs 5.57%, p < 0.001). During the study period, adjusted in-hospital mortality decreased in both SAVR + MVr group (p-trend 0.004) and SAVR + MVR group (p-trend <0.001). Age ≥70 years was associated with higher in-hospital mortality compared to those < 70 years (9.95% vs 6.70%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Combined aortic and mitral valve surgery is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality, especially in patients ≥ 70 years of age. Further research is needed to assess the role of transcatheter approaches in the treatment of multivalvular heart disease.
