Title: Fetal Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome with Intact Atrial Septum: From Successful in utero Stenting to Subtotal Stent Occlusion - A Case Report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and intact atrial septum (IAS) have an overall poor prognosis and a high risk of neonatal death due to severe secondary lung damage. Intrauterine stenting of the atrial septum was introduced in these patients to enable survival.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a HLHS fetus with IAS and signs of incipient nutmeg lung, in whom at 30 weeks gestation an atrial stent was successfully placed but continuously developed subtotal stent-obstruction over the next weeks.
CONCLUSION: Continuous obstruction of placed atrial septum stents until delivery is possible and requires close monitoring of successfully treated fetuses.
