Title: Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury During Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF): A Case Presentation and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a surgical procedure used to manage spine pathology including disc herniation, spondylosis, and myelopathy. During the operation, the vertebral segment of interest is accessed via the anterior neck and the disc space is fully resected along with osteophytes to relieve the compression along the affected nerve. While the procedure is regarded as being highly effective in improving symptoms, there are several complications associated with the surgery that patients should be cautioned about. We present a case of a patient with oropharyngeal and cervical esophageal dysphagia and left vocal cord paralysis following a C5/C6, C6/C7, and C7/T1 ACDF for multilevel cervical stenosis and disc herniation. Otolaryngology evaluation confirmed vocal cord paralysis from recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP) and the patient's symptoms were managed with a vocal cord injection and speech therapy. This report explores the surgical approach for ACDF along with its complications and postoperative care.
