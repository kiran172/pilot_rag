Title: In Support of a Simple Urethrocutaneous Fistula Closure Technique Following Hypospadias Repair.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the success rates of a simple posthypospadias urethrocutaneous fistula repair.
STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated children who underwent urethrocutaneous fistula closure by means of a simple standard technique in which the fistula tract was dissected to its base and resected and the urethral defect closed with a single layer of continuous sutures and covered with local subcutaneous tissue. No urethral stents or catheters were used, and the patients were discharged on the same day. Excluded were children who underwent fistula repair by a different technique, revision hypospadias repair for fistula, or concomitant meatoplasty for meatal stenosis. Study endpoints were fistula recurrence and the need for further penile surgery other than fistula repair.
RESULTS: Seventy-two children underwent 81 repairs. The mean follow-up was 7.9 years. Recurrence occurred in 17 cases (21%). Seven children (9%) underwent penile surgery other than fistula repair, including meatoplasty (n = 5) and re-do hypospadias repair for a diagnosis other than fistula recurrence (n = 2). There was no significant difference in recurrence rate between large and small fistulas, coronal or more proximal fistulas, or children w/wo prior fistula repairs.
CONCLUSION: Standard fistula closure solely by adjacent tissues yielded success rates of 79% after long-term follow-up. This repair can be safely offered with the expectation of similar results for a variety of urethrocutaneous fistulas in children.
