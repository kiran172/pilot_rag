Title: Efficacy and safety of low profile stents in Y-stent assisted coil embolization of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: Low-profile stents may provide significant advantages in Y-stent-assisted coiling due to their miniaturized design and capability to be delivered through a 0.0165-inch microcatheter. We aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of using these newer versions of stents in Y-stent-assisted coiling for the treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. We conducted a systematic review of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases up to September 2023, following the PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies included  ≥ 5 patients with intracranial wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms treated with Y-stent-assisted coiling using low-profile stents, providing angiographic and clinical outcomes. Two authors independently handled the search and selection. Primary outcomes were immediate and follow-up aneurysm occlusion, procedure-related complications, aneurysm recanalization, and retreatment. Secondary outcomes included technical success, procedure-related morbidity, procedure-related mortality, procedure-related stroke, and in-stent stenosis at follow-up. We analyzed the data using random-effects meta-analysis. In total, 19 studies including 507 patients with 509 aneurysms were included. 95% of the treated aneurysms were managed using the crossing Y-configuration. Technical success rate was 99%. Immediate adequate aneurysm occlusion was 90%. Follow-up angiographies were available for 443 aneurysms. The mean angiographic follow-up duration was 15.6 ± 1.9 months. The rates for follow-up adequate aneurysm occlusion and complete occlusion were 98% and 89%, respectively. After a mean clinical follow-up of 15 ± 2.4 months, a good clinical outcome was observed in 98% of patients. Overall, procedure-related morbidity and mortality rates were 1.3%, and 0.4%, respectively. Low-profile stents in Y-stent-assisted coiling outperform previous stent versions in terms of safety, efficacy, and technical success rates.
