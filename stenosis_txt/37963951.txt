Title: Association between arterial tortuosity and early neurological deterioration in lenticulostriate artery infarction.

Abstract: Early neurological deterioration (END) in lenticulostriate artery (LSA) infarction is associated with perforating artery hypoperfusion. As middle cerebral artery (MCA) tortuosity may alter hemodynamics, we investigated the association between MCA tortuosity and END in LSA infarction. We reviewed patients with acute LSA infarction without significant MCA stenosis. END was defined as an increase of ≥ 2 or ≥ 1 in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) total or motor score, respectively, within first 72 h. The MCA tortuosity index (actual /straight length) was measured. Stroke mechanisms were categorized as branch atheromatous disease (BAD; lesions > 10 mm and 4 axial slices) and lipohyalinotic degeneration (LD; lesion smaller than BAD). Factors associated with END in LD and BAD were investigated. END occurred in 104/390 (26.7%) patients. A high MCA tortuosity index (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 10.63, 95% confidence interval [2.57-44.08], p = 0.001) was independently associated with END. In patients with BAD, high initial NIHSS score (aOR 1.40 [1.03-1.89], p = 0.031) and presence of parental artery disease (stenosis < 50%; aOR 10.38 [1.85-58.08], p = 0.008) were associated with END. In patients with LD, high MCA tortuosity (aOR 41.78 [7.37-237.04], p < 0.001) was associated with END. The mechanism causing END in patients with LD and BAD may differ.
