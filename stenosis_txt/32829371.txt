Title: [A Case of Unresectable Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma Resected Curatively Through Effective Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy].

Abstract: A 60's man came to our hospital for jaundice. Contrast-enhanced CT showed irregular thickening of the hilar bile duct, and the lymph nodes(LN)were swollen from the hilar to the abdominal aorta. These LNs showed similar findings in endoscopic ultrasonography(EUS), and fine needle aspiration cytology(FNA)was performed on the enlarged No.13LN to diagnose LN metastasis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Since the peri-aortic LN was also markedly enlarged, it was considered to be metastasis, and was diagnosed as unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma with distant LN metastasis. When gemcitabine/cisplatin therapy(GC therapy)was started, tumor markers normalized and LN decreased in 4 months. We performed GC therapy for a total of 12 cycles and did not re-exacerbate. Cholangioscopy revealed that bile duct stenosis at the hilar portion had improved. We have determined that curative resection is possible and performed surgery. We confirmed that No.16b1LN was negative by pathological diagnosis during surgery and performed left hepatic caudate lobectomy, extrahepatic cholangectomy, and biliary reconstruction. Diagnosis was pT2aN1(n8a)M0, fStage â…¢B, and pR0. After surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 was continued.
