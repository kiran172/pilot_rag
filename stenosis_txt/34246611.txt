Title: Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Use of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the State of Connecticut.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although prior national reports have identified trends in the underutilization of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in Afro-American and Latino populations, racial and ethnic healthcare disparities in TAVR use in the State of Connecticut have not been previously reported.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1461 patients undergoing TAVR at our institute between from 2012 to 2020. Baseline demographics, procedural characteristics, clinical outcomes, median incomes and insurance coverage were compared between 1417 Caucasian and 44 minority patients, including 23 patients designated as Afro-American and 10 designated as Latino. Demographics of TAVR utilization at our institution were further compared to 6 additional Connecticut TAVR centers using Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA) ChimeData detailing hospital discharges for DRG 266 and 267.
RESULTS: In comparison to Caucasian patients, minority cohorts were younger (75.7 ± 9.0 vs 81.5 ± 5.1 years, p < 0.001) and had more co-morbidities including diabetes (64% vs 34%, p < 001), coronary artery disease (95% vs 78%, p = 0.039), end stage renal disease requiring dialysis (9% vs 3%, p = 0.009) and atrial fibrillation (77% vs 62%, p = 0.041). The two groups did not differ with respect to other risk factors or co-morbidities, baseline echocardiographic or CTA findings, STS risk score, or procedural technique. Minority patients had a longer length of hospital stay (9.5 ± 9.0 vs 6.4 ± 6.9 days, p = 0.003), but did not differ with respect to procedural complications. Socioeconomic differences between the two groups included lower median incomes and higher rates of Medicaid or no insurance coverage for minority versus Caucasian patients. CHA ChimeData revealed a similar underutilization of TAVR in minority subgroups in the remaining 6 Connecticut TAVR centers.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite statewide demographics describing 10.7% and 15.7% of the total population as Afro-American and Latino, respectively, only 3.0% of the total TAVR procedures performed at a large Connecticut health care facility were performed in minority subgroups. Despite having a higher burden of co-morbidities, minority patients had similar outcomes compared to Caucasian patients. Similar racial and ethnic disparities in TAVR utilization were confirmed statewide using CHA ChimeData.
