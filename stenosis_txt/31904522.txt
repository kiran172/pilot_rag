Title: Surgery of Renal Artery Aneurysms: A Monocentric Retrospective Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to report the results of conventional surgery for renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) in our center.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the files of all the patients operated for RAAs between 2009 and 2018 in our center. We collected demographic, biological (renal function), morphological (computed tomography [CT] scan), and functional (ultrasound examination and resistance index) preoperative and postoperative data. Clinical and paraclinical operative data were examined. Results were expressed as average ± standard deviation or median and extremes.
RESULTS: A total of 26 aneurysms were operated in 20 kidneys (10 right kidneys) among 19 patients, including 13 (68%) women with an average age of 55 (±12) years. Three (16%) patients presented an aneurysm in a single kidney. The discovery of the aneurysm was fortuitous in 14 (74%) patients. One patient with Marfan syndrome was operated after a postpartum rupture. The median diameter of the operated aneurysms was 22 mm (7-48), and 23 (90%) were hilar aneurysms. Arterial repair was carried out in situ in 16 (80%) kidneys. The surgery consisted of a direct arterial repair in 21 cases (81%), including 4 resections and anastomoses, 12 aneurysmorrhaphies, and 5 complex reconstructions. Four arterial replacements were carried out (one prosthetic graft, 2 femoral grafts, and one internal iliac graft). The average duration of renal clamping was 30.5 (±17.3) min. Postoperative renal function was unchanged in all the patients except for one (5.2%) who required 2 days of postoperative dialysis. The resistance index of all the operated kidneys was normal (0.66 ± 0.08) at discharge. Sixteen (70%) of the 23 aneurysms were examined, and anatomopathology concluded them to be of dysplastic origin. At 3 months, a systematic CT scan objectified the patency of 95% of the arterial reconstructions, with 3 stenoses >50%. One stenosis >80% was treated at 7 months by balloon angioplasty. Only one operated kidney presented a loss of viability of its upper pole. The mean duration of follow-up was 54 ± 35 months. By the end of the follow-up, primary and secondary patency rates evaluated by Doppler ultrasound were 90% and 95%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Conventional surgery generally performed in situ remains a sure and effective treatment for RAAs. This challenging surgery for a rare disease should be performed in experimented centers.
