Title: Superior Cluneal Nerve Stimulator Lead Displacement to the Thigh: A Case Report and Management Recommendations.

Abstract: CASE: An 82-year-old man with a history of lumbar spinal stenosis and prior laminectomy presented with chronic lower back pain and was treated with placement of bilateral superior cluneal nerve stimulators. At the 2-week follow-up, the patient reported loss of efficacy and new-onset paresthesia of the left lower extremity. Fluoroscopic evaluation revealed lead breakage and distal migration of the left-sided stimulator lead to the left anteromedial thigh.
CONCLUSION: Lead breakage and migration remains a challenge in peripheral nerve stimulation. This report illustrates the case of a nerve stimulator lead breakage and migration resulting in treatment failure and new-onset sensory disturbance.
