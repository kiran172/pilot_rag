Title: Long-Term Bowel Vaginoplasty With a Single Yang-Monti Tube.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The bowel remains the favored tissue for neo-vaginoplasty (NeoVP) in pediatric patients with vaginal agenesis. In 2001, the first description of NeoVP using the Yang-Monti technique with a sigmoid double tubular flap was published. We present our experience of NeoVP with a single Yang-Monti tube (SYMT) flap and report on the use of different segments of colon.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent NeoVP using a bowel SYMT between 2009 and 2021. The procedure was performed under open abdominal surgery by isolating 8 to 12 cm from the rectosigmoid, cecum, or ascending colon. Subsequently, this segment was detubularized near the mesenteric border, folded, and retubularized transversally, leaving the mesentery in a cephalic position. A channel was dissected in the pelvis to accommodate the NeoVP.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients were identified. The median age was 16 years old. The principal diagnosis was Mayer-Rokitansky's syndrome (47.1%). The median follow-up was 50 months. The mean harvested bowel length was 9 cm, and the sigmoid was the preferred site (65%). The cecum-ascending colon was used in 3 (17.6%) patients. Complications were recorded in 6 patients (35%). Of these 6 patients, 4 had introital stenosis. There was 1 case of urethrovaginal fistula and another of left hematometrocolpos. Satisfactory sexual function has been reported in sexually active individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: We described our experience in NeoVP using a large bowel SYMT as a safe and effective technique. It allows decreased tension on the vascular pedicle and the use of shorter colon segments.
