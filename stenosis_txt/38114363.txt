Title: A unique mechanism of restenosis after drug-coated balloon in peripheral artery: Insight from optical frequency domain imaging.

Abstract: Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have been widely used in endovascular therapy for femoropopliteal arteries with atherosclerotic lesions. Vascular response after DCBs remains unclear. This mini-review proposes a possible mechanism of restenosis after the DCB strategy. Balloon dilatation including DCBs expands the vascular lumen by producing dissections, which is composed of the original vascular lumen and the cavity surrounded by dissected flaps. The cavity surrounded by dissected flaps is eventually replaced with the thrombus in the healing process after balloon dilatation. However, the thrombus may propagate to the expanded vascular lumen through the entry point of the dissection. Subsequently, the thrombus both in the cavity and the expanded lumen would be organized over time. The vascular lumen in the chronic-phase after DCBs may be influenced by the propagated thrombus from the cavity surrounded by dissected flaps.
