Title: Radiation Dose and Fluoroscopy Time of Extracranial Carotid Artery Stenting : Elective vs. Emergency Treatment Including Combined Mechanical Thrombectomy in Tandem Occlusion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Fluoroscopically guided endovascular carotid artery stenting (CAS) of extracranial carotid stenosis (ECS) is a reasonable alternative to carotid endarterectomy in selected patients. Diagnostic reference levels (DRL) for this common neurointervention have not yet been defined and respective literature data are sparse. We provide detailed dosimetrics for useful expansion of the DRL catalogue.
METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of patients undergoing CAS between 2013 and 2021. We analyzed dose area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy time considering the following parameters: indications for CAS, semielective/elective versus emergency including additional mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in extracranial/intracranial tandem occlusion, etiology of ECS (atherosclerotic vs. radiation-induced), periprocedural features, e.g., number of applied stents, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and MT maneuvers, and dose protocol. Local DRL was defined as 75% percentile of the DAP distribution.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were included (semielective/elective CAS n = 75, emergency CAS n = 8, CAS + MT n = 19). Total median DAP was 78.2 Gy cm2 (DRL 117 Gy cm2). Lowest and highest median dosimetry values were documented for semielective/elective CAS and CAS + MT (DAP 49.1 vs. 146.8 Gy cm2, fluoroscopy time 27.1 vs. 43.8 min; p &lt; 0.005), respectively. Dosimetrics were significantly lower in patients undergoing 0-1 PTA maneuvers compared to ≥ 2 maneuvers (p &lt; 0.05). Etiology of ECS, number of stents and MT maneuvers had no significant impact on dosimetry values (p &gt; 0.05). A low-dose protocol yielded a 33% reduction of DAP.
CONCLUSION: This CAS study suggests novel local DRLs for both elective and emergency cases with or without intracranial MT. A dedicated low-dose protocol was suitable for substantial reduction of radiation dose.
