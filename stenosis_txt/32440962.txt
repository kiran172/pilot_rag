Title: Middle and Distal Common Carotid Artery Stenting: Long-Term Patency Rates and Risk Factors for In-Stent Restenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: In the absence of literature data, we aimed to determine the long-term patency rates of middle/distal common carotid artery (CCA) stenting and to investigate predisposing factors in the development of in-stent restenosis (ISR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients (30 males, median age 63.5 years), who underwent stenting with 51 self-expandable stents for significant (≥ 60%) stenosis of the middle/distal CCA, were analyzed retrospectively. Patient (atherosclerotic risk factors, comorbidities, medications), vessel (elongation), lesion (stenosis grade, length, calcification, location), and stent characteristics (material, diameter, length, fracture) were examined. Duplex ultrasonography was used to monitor stent patency. The Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests, Kaplan-Meier analyses, and a log-rank test were used statistically.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 35 months (interquartile range, 20-102 months). Significant (≥ 70%) ISR developed in 14 patients (27.5%; stenosis, N = 10; entire CCA occlusion, N = 4). Primary patency rates were 98%, 92%, 83%, 73%, and 61% at 6, 12, 24, 60, and 96 months, respectively. Reintervention was performed in six patients (11.8%) with nonocclusive ISR. Secondary patency rates were 100% at 6 and 12 months and 96% at 24, 60, and 96 months. In-stent restenosis developed more frequently (P < .001) in patients with hyperlipidemia; primary patency rates were also significantly worse (Chi-square, 11.08; degrees of freedom, 1; P < .001) in patients with hyperlipidemia compared to those without.
CONCLUSION: Stenting of the middle/distal CCA can be performed with acceptable patency rates. If intervention is unequivocally needed, patients with hyperlipidemia will require closer follow-up care.
