Title: Percutaneous Treatment of Paravalvular Leak in Rapid-Deployment Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve With Balloon Dilation.

Abstract: Rapid deployment aortic valve prostheses have become a common solution for aortic valve replacement. While >mild prognostic paravalvular leaks are not infrequent, their treatment is not yet clear. We report the case of an 82-year-old man that presented with acute heart failure. Previously implanted rapid deployment bioprosthetic aortic valve (Intuity Elite, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) presented a significant paravalvular leak that seemed to be secondary to valve underexpansion. Percutaneous balloon post dilation was performed and resulted in better expansion of the valve and its sealing skirt with a significant reduction of the leak.
