Title: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of post-irradiated stenosis of subclavian artery: A matched case-control study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although radiotherapy is common for head/neck and chest cancers (HNCC), it can result in post-irradiation stenosis of the subclavian artery (PISSA). The efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) to treat severe PISSA is not well-clarified.
AIMS: To compare the technical safety and outcomes of PTAS between patients with severe PISSA (RT group) and radiation-naïve counterparts (non-RT group).
METHODS: During 2000 and 2021, we retrospectively enrolled patients with severe symptomatic stenosis (>60%) of the subclavian artery who underwent PTAS. The rate of new recent vertebrobasilar ischaemic lesions (NRVBIL), diagnosed on diffusion-weight imaging (DWI) within 24 h of postprocedural brain MRI; symptom relief; and long-term stent patency were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all 61 patients in the two groups. Compared with the non-RT group (44 cases, 44 lesions), the RT group (17 cases, 18 lesions) had longer stenoses (22.1 vs 11.1 mm, P = 0.003), more ulcerative plaques (38.9% vs 9.1%, P = 0.010), and more medial- or distal-segment stenoses (44.4% vs 9.1%, P<0.001). The technical safety and outcome between the non-RT group and the RT group were NRVBIL on DWI of periprocedural brain MRI 30.0% vs 23.1%, P = 0.727; symptom recurrence rate (mean follow-up 67.1 ± 50.0 months) 2.3% vs 11.8%, P = 0.185; and significant in-stent restenosis rate (>50%) 2.3% vs 11.1%, P = 0.200.
CONCLUSION: The technical safety and outcome of PTAS for PISSA were not inferior to those of radiation-naïve counterparts. PTAS for PISSA is an effective treatment for medically refractory ischaemic symptoms of HNCC patients with PISSA.
