Title: Role of oxidative stress in calcific aortic valve disease and its therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the end result of active cellular processes that lead to the progressive fibrosis and calcification of aortic valve leaflets. In western populations, CAVD is a significant cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and in the absence of effective drugs, it will likely represent an increasing disease burden as populations age. As there are currently no pharmacological therapies available for preventing, treating, or slowing the development of CAVD, understanding the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of the disease is important for identifying novel therapeutic targets. Recent evidence has emerged of an important causative role for reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of CAVD, inducing the differentiation of valve interstitial cells into myofibroblasts and then osteoblasts. In this review, we focus on the roles and sources of ROS driving CAVD and consider their potential as novel therapeutic targets for this debilitating condition.
