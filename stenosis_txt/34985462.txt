Title: [Role of fractional flow reserve for invasive functional evaluation in surgical myocardial revascularization: available evidence and state of the art].

Abstract: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the ratio of distal to proximal pressure during maximal hyperemia and indirectly estimates the blood flow across a stenotic coronary artery and the related degree of myocardial ischemia. Several studies have investigated the role of FFR in the setting of percutaneous myocardial revascularization and further research is ongoing. However, current evidence on FFR-guided surgical myocardial revascularization is controversial and limited. The main scientific interest is to clarify whether FFR-guided coronary artery bypass surgery is associated with clinical benefits in terms of mortality, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiovascular events, minimally invasive surgical access compared with sternotomy and off-pump surgery. Furthermore some data suggest that conduit selection for coronary artery bypass grafting and surgical technique might be affected by FFR value. The aim of this article is to review the most recent available evidence about FFR-guided coronary artery bypass grafting and to discuss clinical implications and future perspectives.
