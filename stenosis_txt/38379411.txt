Title: Improving image quality consistency and diagnostic accuracy in lower extremity CT angiography using a split-bolus contrast injection protocol.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical value of using a split-bolus contrast injection protocol in improving image quality consistency and diagnostic accuracy in lower extremity CT angiography (CTA).
METHODS: Fifty (mean age, 66 ± 12 years) and 39 (mean age, 66 ± 11 years) patients underwent CTA in the lower extremity arteries using split-bolus and fixed-bolus injection schemes, respectively. The objective and subjective image quality of the 2 groups were compared and the diagnostic efficacy for the degree of vessel stenosis was compared using digital subtraction angiography as the gold standard. A P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: In comparison with the fixed-bolus scheme, the split-bolus scheme greatly improved the consistency of image quality of the low extremities by significantly increasing the arterial enhancement (337.87 ± 64.67HU vs. 254.74 ± 71.58HU, P < .001), signal-to-noise ratio (22.58 ± 11.64 vs. 7.14 ± 1.98, P < .001), and contrast-to-noise ratio (37.21 ± 10.46 vs. 31.10 ± 15.40, P = .041) in the infrapopliteal segment. The subjective image quality was better (P < .001) and the diagnostic accuracy was higher in the split-bolus group than in the fixed-bolus group (96.00% vs. 91.67%, P < .05, for diagnosing >50% stenosis, and 97.00% vs. 89.10%, P < .05, for diagnosing occlusion) for the infrapopliteal segment arteries.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the fixed-bolus injection scheme, the split-bolus injection scheme improves the image quality consistency and diagnostic accuracy especially for the infrapopliteal segment arteries in lower extremity CTA.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: (1) The split-bolus injection scheme of CTA of the lower extremity arteries improves the overall image quality, uniformity of contrast enhancement. (2) Compared with the fixed-bolus injection scheme, the split-bolus injection scheme especially improves the infrapopliteal segment arteries image quality and diagnostic efficacy.
