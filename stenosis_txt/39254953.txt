Title: Acurate neo2 is associated with a reduced inflammatory response in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inflammation following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the inflammatory response between low radial force valves (Acurate neo2, Boston Scientific) and high radial force valves (Evolut R/Pro, Medtronic; SAPIEN Edwards Lifesciences; and Myval, Meril valves).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with TAVI between 2021 and 2022. The primary endpoint was the difference in the inflammatory response between low radial force valves and high radial force valves, measured as the difference between post-procedural and pre-procedural high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (hsCRP delta).
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included, of which 65 patients (57%) received a low radial force valve. The hsCRP delta was lower in the low radial force valve group compared to the high radial force valve group (8.7 [2.1-15.6] mg/L vs. 18.8 mg/dL [6.4-19] mg/L; P=0.003), due to a lower post-implantation hsCRP (8.9 [5.45-19.6] mg/L vs. 15.8 [9.8-27.3] mg/L; P=0.013). The incidence of new left bundle branch block (LBBB) after TAVI was lower in the low radial force valve group compared to the high radial force valve group (11 [17%] vs. 18 [37%]; P=0.020).
CONCLUSIONS: Low radial force TAVI prostheses were associated with a lower inflammatory response, and a lower incidence of new LBBB compared to the radial force valve group, suggesting that inflammation may contribute to the increased risk of conduction disturbances.
