Title: Left Subclavian Artery Test Balloon Occlusion Before Covered Stent for Recoarctation and Aneurysm.

Abstract: A 57-year-old man, with a history of coarctation patch repair at three years of age, presented with left ventricular dilatation and moderate to severe dysfunction. A computed tomographic angiogram of the chest revealed moderate residual stenosis of the distal arch and proximal descending aorta and a large aneurysm adjacent to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Due to high surgical risk, a hybrid approach was undertaken with temporary balloon occlusion of the left subclavian artery, followed by surgical left common carotid to left subclavian artery graft and percutaneous covered stent implantation to relieve the obstruction and exclude the aneurysm.
