Title: Are preservation rhinoplasty techniques safer than structural ones?

Abstract: This narrative review paper evaluates the preservation rhinoplasty (PR) technique in all aspects. The literature survey was performed in PubMed, EBSCO, UpToDate, and Proquest Central databases of Kırıkkale University, Google and Google Scholar databases. The advent of the preservation rhinoplasty (PR) approach has led to a radical shift in the mindset surrounding rhinoplasty procedures. K-area (keystone region) loss, lateral cartilage collapse, and nasal stenosis are all avoidable with preservation measures. The nasal bones, the superior lateral cartilage, the quadrilateral cartilage, and the perpendicular blade of the ethmoid meet at the point known as Zone K. The variety of problems that might develop due to carelessness in this area demonstrates the significance of maintaining the nose's stability and structure. The three components of a preservation rhinoplasty (PR) procedure are (1) preserving the scroll ligament complex by elevating the soft tissue envelope (STE) in a subperichondrial-subperiosteal plane, (2) preserving the nasal dorsum without creating an open roof deformity, and (3) preserving the alar cartilages and achieving the desired shape using sutures rather than excision. Dorsal preservation is one of the three components that make up PR. However, the two concepts are not synonymous. PR involves elevating a skin sleeve from the subperichondrial-subperiosteal plane, preserving the osteocartilaginous dorsum, maintaining the alar cartilages with minor excision and using sutures to achieve the desired form.
