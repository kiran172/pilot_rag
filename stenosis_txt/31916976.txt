Title: Limb shaking transient ischemic attacks: A follow-up of 28 patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Limb shaking transient ischemic attack (LSTIA) is an uncommon picture of carotid-occlusive disease. The symptoms are a seizure like activity and misdiagnosed as partial motor seizures. We here present a series of patients in our registry who had limb-shaking activities and their long-term outcome after treatment of their disease.
METHODS: A total of 28 patients with limb shaking symptoms were recruited among 798 patients with TIA in our stroke registry. Risk factors and etiology of LSTIA were examined within hospitalization. After the initiaition of treatment patients were followed for a median of 6months.
RESULTS: Limb-shaking was observed mainly on the hand-arms (46%), and secondly on the legs (39%). We found five different DWI lesion patterns in patients with LSTIA, including unilateral or bilateral either cortical or borderzone ischemic hyperintensities. Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 9 (32%) patients and carotid angioplasty-stent (CAS) in 10 (36%), and after 6-months of follow-up none of the patients had LSTIA. Limb shaking continued only in a patient with chronic carotid occlusion who received only conservative treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Limb shaking TIA point to carotid artery disease in the majority of patients and vertebrobasilar artery disease in one third. Fast and timely treatment with either surgical or CAS eliminates the attacks and also reduce their risk of stroke.
