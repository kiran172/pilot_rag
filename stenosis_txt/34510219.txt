Title: Technique for Treatment of a Symptomatic Intracranial Stenosis With Balloon Angioplasty and Wingspan Stent Placement: 3-Dimensional Operative Video.

Abstract: Intracranial angioplasty and stenting is an increasingly common modality to treat intracranial atherosclerosis, which accounts for 80â€‰000 strokes annually. Early trials showed there to be a high complication rate1,2 associated with stenting but with improved technique this complication rate has dramatically decreased.3 The following video details the procedure of intracranial balloon angioplasty and stenting for a high-grade stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient and they consented to the procedure.
