Title: Evaluation of vascular graft infection following Bentall surgery using 18F-FDG PET/CT scan: A pediatric case report.

Abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: After a Bentall surgery, there is a small chance of developing a serious complication called vascular graft infection. 18F-FDG PET/CT, a new and accurate diagnostic tool, can help detect it early, especially if the symptoms are unusual.
ABSTRACT: A 14-year-old boy who had undergone Bentall surgery 1â€‰year prior presented with symptoms of fever, chills, loss of appetite, and weight loss over the course of a month. The initial Bentall surgery was performed due to an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, along with severe aortic valve insufficiency and moderate aortic valve stenosis. The patient was referred to the PET/CT department for evaluation of possible endarteritis or infection of Dacron graft, which had been reported in trans-esophageal echocardiography as suspicious findings. Despite normal blood tests, blood cultures, and other imaging modalities, the 18F-FDG PET/CT confirmed the diagnosis of vascular graft infection. This diagnostic tool allowed for timely and appropriate treatment and prevention of possible complications.
