Title: Enhanced airway stenting using a preoperative, three-dimensionally printed airway model simulation.

Abstract: Three-dimensionally printed organ models that facilitate preoperative simulations have the potential to improve outcomes of surgical procedures. Here, we report a case involving a 54-year-old man diagnosed with lung cancer of the right upper bronchus that was invading the right main bronchus. A right upper lobectomy with carinoplasty was performed. Although complete excision of the tumor was achieved, exertional dyspnea redeveloped 4Â months post-surgery. Chest computed tomography revealed that airway stenosis caused by granulation had deformed the airway. Ablation of the granulation and airway stenting was required to improve the patient's symptoms. Prior to performing airway stenting, a three-dimensionally printed airway model was constructed, and the Y-shaped silicone stent used was modified in accordance with the model. After stenting, both the right and left bronchi were preserved, and the patient's symptoms improved. The three-dimensional printed airway model enhanced the accuracy and safety of the airway stenting procedure performed.
