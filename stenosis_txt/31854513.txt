Title: Endothelial S1pr1 regulates pressure overload-induced cardiac remodelling through AKT-eNOS pathway.

Abstract: Cardiac vascular microenvironment is crucial for cardiac remodelling during the process of heart failure. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) tightly regulates vascular homeostasis via its receptor, S1pr1. We therefore hypothesize that endothelial S1pr1 might be involved in pathological cardiac remodelling. In this study, heart failure was induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) operation. S1pr1 expression is significantly increased in microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) of post-TAC hearts. Endothelial-specific deletion of S1pr1 significantly aggravated cardiac dysfunction and deteriorated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in myocardium. In vitro experiments demonstrated that S1P/S1pr1 praxis activated AKT/eNOS signalling pathway, leading to more production of nitric oxide (NO), which is an essential cardiac protective factor. Inhibition of AKT/eNOS pathway reversed the inhibitory effect of EC-S1pr1-overexpression on angiotensin II (AngII)-induced cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy, as well as on TGF-Î²-mediated cardiac fibroblast proliferation and transformation towards myofibroblasts. Finally, pharmacological activation of S1pr1 ameliorated TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, leading to an improvement in cardiac function. Together, our results suggest that EC-S1pr1 might prevent the development of pressure overload-induced heart failure via AKT/eNOS pathway, and thus pharmacological activation of S1pr1 or EC-targeting S1pr1-AKT-eNOS pathway could provide a future novel therapy to improve cardiac function during heart failure development.
