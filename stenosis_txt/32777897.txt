Title: Association between monocyte to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and bicuspid aortic valve degeneration.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: From a pathophysiological point of view, inflammation is thought to be more dominant in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) stenosis than tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) stenosis. Our study aimed to determine the association between monocyte to high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (MHR), a new inflammatory marker, and the speed of progression of stenosis and pathophysiology of BAV stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 210 severe aortic stenosis patients (70 consecutive BAV patients, 140 matched TAV patients) were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Clinical and echocardiographic data and laboratory results related to our research were collected retrospectively from the patients’ records. MHR was measured as the ratio of the absolute monocyte count to the HDL-C value.
RESULTS: Seventy BAV (mean age: 72.0 ± 9.1 years, 42.9% female) and 140 TAV patients (mean age: 77.9 ± 8.3 years, 51.4% female) with severe aortic stenosis were enrolled in this study. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of another baseline demographic or clinic findings except age (P < 0.001). Monocyte count, hemoglobin level, mean platelet volume was significantly higher, and HDL-C level was significantly lower in the BAV group, while other lipid and CBC parameters were found to be similar. In the multivariate analysis, MHR (P = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.90–0.98) and, as expected, age (P = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.02–1.11) were found to be significant as the independent predictor of BAV, after adjusting for other risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed a significant correlation between increased MHR and BAV. MHR was determined as a significant independent predictor for the speed of progression and diagnosis of severe BAV stenosis in multivariate analysis.
