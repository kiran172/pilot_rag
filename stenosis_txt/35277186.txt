Title: Association between triglyceride glucose index and carotid artery plaque in different glucose metabolic states in patients with coronary heart disease: a RCSCD-TCM study in China.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index serves as a surrogate indicator of insulin resistance. However, there is limited evidence on the association between the TyG index and carotid artery plaque (CAP) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).
METHODS: The 10,535 CHD patients were divided according to TyG index quartiles (Q1: TyG index < 8.52; Q2: 8.52 ≤ TyG index < 8.93; Q3: 8.93 ≤ TyG index ≤ 9.40; Q4: TyG index > 9.40). The presence or absence of CAP was determined by carotid ultrasonography. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between the TyG index and CAP in CHD patients. The relationship between the TyG index and CAP in according to sex, age groups, and glucose metabolism states were also assessed.
RESULTS: The baseline analysis showed that there were significant differences in related parameters among CHD patients divided into four groups according to the quartile of the TyG index. In the multi-adjusted modles, compared to Q1 of the TyG index, the odds ratios (OR) for Q4 of the TyG index for CAP were 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.47) in CHD patients. The association between the TyG index and CAP in female (OR: 1.35; 95% CI 1.29-1.43) was higher than that in male (OR: 1.20; 95% CI 1.13-1.27). The OR value of middle-aged (≤ 60 years old) patients (OR: 1.34; 95% CI 1.26-1.42) was higher than that in elderly (> 60 years old) patients (OR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.11-1.22). In different glucose metabolism states, the TyG index of CHD patients was significantly related to the risk of CAP, with the highest OR value observed for diabetes (OR: 1.36; 95% CI 1.26-1.46).
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index and CAP showed a significant association in CHD patients. This association between TyG index and CAP in CHD patients is higher in female than in male, and the association in middle-aged and elderly patients is higher than that in elderly patients. In the condition of DM, the association between TyG index and carotid artery plaque in CHD patients is higher.
