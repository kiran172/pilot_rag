Title: Inpatient Resource Utilization for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome from Birth Through Fontan.

Abstract: Completing 3-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome requires significant resources. An analysis of recent data has not been performed. We aimed to determine total charges necessary to complete all 3 stages of single-ventricle palliation, including interstage encounters. We also aimed to determine overall resource utilization, including hospital days, interstage admissions, and interstage procedures. We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from the Pediatric Health Information System database between 2016 and 2021, including all patients who completed 3-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. We identified 199 patients who underwent 3-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome between 2016 and 2021. Median total adjusted charges (interquartile range, IQR) over the course of 3-stage palliation were $1,475,800 ($1,028,900-2,191,700). Median adjusted charges (IQR) for stage 1, 2, and 3 hospitalizations were $604,300 ($419,000-891,400), $234,000 ($164,300-370,800), and $256,260 ($178,300-345,900), respectively. Median hospital length of stay (IQR) for stages 1, 2, and 3 was 36 (26,53), 9 (6,17), and 10 (7,14) days, respectively. Pulmonary artery stenosis was the most common admitting diagnosis for interstage hospitalizations (3.4% of hospitalizations). Cardiac catheterization (24.1% of procedures) and feeding tube placement (10.0% of procedures) were the most common principal procedures during interstage hospitalizations. Total inpatient charges incurred throughout 3-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome are substantial and have risen since prior studies. Gastrointestinal comorbidities and feeding optimization contribute considerably to this resource utilization.
