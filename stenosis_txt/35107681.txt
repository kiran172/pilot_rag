Title: Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting for Occlusive Diseases.

Abstract: Stenting for carotid artery stenosis (CAS) was once denied 15Â years ago because it failed to prove the non-inferiority to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, it is now reevaluated and is thought better due to higher safety and efficacy thanks to the development of devices, strategies, and various protection methods. To achieve the safe CAS, protection methods and stents should be properly selected based on the vessel course and plaque components on the preoperative plaque images. Particularly multiple protection methods including proximal balloon protection and double-layer micromesh stents are useful for the cases with high-risk and fragile plaque. Perioperative anti-platelet management and the control of blood pressure are also important to avoid the ischemic complications and hyperperfusion. Properly protected and tailored CAS based on the risk management has dramatically improved the clinical results and contributed to extend the indication for more difficult lesions.
