Title: Prevalence of elevated lipoprotein(a) in cardiac rehabilitation patients - results from a large-scale multicentre registry in Germany.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and aortic valve stenosis. European guidelines recommend assessing it at least once in a lifetime, particularly in premature atherosclerotic heart disease.
METHODS: A non-interventional registry was conducted at MEDIAN rehabilitation facilities in Germany to assess the frequency of Lp(a) testing in referring acute care hospitals and the prevalence of elevated Lp(a) levels in aortic valve stenosis or premature myocardial infarction. All consecutive patients referred after coronary intervention or aortic valve surgery were included in four cohorts: aortic valve intervention (cohort 1), current/previous myocardial infarction at < 60 years of age (cohorts 2a/2b), and myocardial infarction at ≥ 60 years of age (control).
RESULTS: The analysis included 3393 patient records (cohort 1, n = 1063; cohort 2a, n = 1351; cohort 2b, n = 381; control, n = 598). Lp(a) had been determined at the referring hospital in 0.19% (cohort 1), 4.96% (cohort 2a), 2.36% (cohort 2b), and 2.01% (control) of patients. Lp(a) levels were > 50 mg/dL or > 125 nmol/L in 28.79% (cohort 1), 29.90% (cohort 2a), and 36.48% (cohort 2b; p < 0.001) compared to 24.25% (control). Family history of premature cardiovascular disease was reported in 13.45% (cohort 1), 38.56% (cohort 2a), and 32.81% (cohort 2b) compared to 17.89% (control; p < 0.05 for each comparison).
CONCLUSIONS: Lp(a) had been rarely assessed in acute management of aortic valve stenosis or premature myocardial infarction despite expanding scientific evidence and guideline recommendation. Given the above-average incidence of elevated Lp(a) levels, awareness for Lp(a) has to increase substantially to better identify and manage high-risk patients.
