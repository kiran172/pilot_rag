Title: Establishing the distribution of cerebrovascular resistance using computational fluid dynamics and 4D flow MRI.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) regulates blood flow in the brain, but little is known about the vascular resistances of the individual cerebral territories. We present a method to calculate these resistances and investigate how CVR varies in the hemodynamically disturbed brain. We included 48 patients with stroke/TIA (29 with symptomatic carotid stenosis). By combining flow rate (4D flow MRI) and structural computed tomography angiography (CTA) data with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) we computed the perfusion pressures out from the circle of Willis, with which CVR of the MCA, ACA, and PCA territories was estimated. 56 controls were included for comparison of total CVR (tCVR). CVR were 33.8 ± 10.5, 59.0 ± 30.6, and 77.8 ± 21.3 mmHg s/ml for the MCA, ACA, and PCA territories. We found no differences in tCVR between patients, 9.3 ± 1.9 mmHg s/ml, and controls, 9.3 ± 2.0 mmHg s/ml (p = 0.88), nor in territorial CVR in the carotid stenosis patients between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Territorial resistance associated inversely to territorial brain volume (p < 0.001). These resistances may work as reference values when modelling blood flow in the circle of Willis, and the method can be used when there is need for subject-specific analysis.
