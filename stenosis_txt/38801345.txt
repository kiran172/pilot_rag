Title: Impact of shaggy aorta on intraoperative cerebral embolism during carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Careful selection of patients for carotid stenting is necessary. We suggest that patients with a shaggy aorta syndrome may be at higher risk for perioperative embolic complications.
METHODS: The study is a retrospective subanalysis of the SIBERIA Trial. We included 72 patients undergoing transfemoral carotid artery stenting. Patients were monitored during the procedures using multifrequency transcranial Doppler with embolus detection and differentiation. Pre- and postprocedural (2 and 30 days) cerebral diffusion-weighted cerebral MRIs were performed.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients had shaggy aorta syndrome. Intraoperative embolisms were recorded in 82.6% and 46.1% of patients with and without shaggy aorta syndrome, respectively (P=0.001). New asymptomatic ischemic brain lesions in the postoperative period occurred in 78.3% and in 26.9% of patients with and without shaggy aorta syndrome, respectively (P<0.001). There were no cases of stroke within 2 days in both groups. 3 (6.5%) cases of stroke within 30 days after the procedure were observed only in patients with shaggy aorta syndrome. There were no cases of contralateral stroke. Shaggy aorta syndrome (OR 5.54 [1.83:16.7], P=0.001) and aortic arch ulceration (OR 6.67 [1.19: 37.3], P=0.02) were independently associated with cerebral embolism. Shaggy aorta syndrome (OR 9.77 [3.14-30.37], P<0.001) and aortic arch ulceration (OR 12.9 [2.3: 72.8], P=0.003) were independently associated with ipsilateral new asymptomatic ischemic brain lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Shaggy aorta syndrome and aortic arch ulceration significantly increase the odds of intraoperative embolism and new asymptomatic ischemic brain lesions. Carotid endarterectomy or transcervical carotid stent should be selected in patients with shaggy aorta syndrome.
