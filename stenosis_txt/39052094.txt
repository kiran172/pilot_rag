Title: Structural reorganization of medullary dorsal horn astrocytes in a rat model of neuropathic pain.

Abstract: Multiple studies have shown that astrocytes in the medullary dorsal horn (MDH) play an important role in the development of pathologic pain. However, little is known about the structural reorganization of the peripheral astrocytic processes (PAP), the main functional part of the astrocyte, in MDH in neuropathic state. For this, we investigated the structural relationship between PAP and their adjacent presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic dendrites in the superficial laminae of the MDH using electron microscopical immunohistochemistry for ezrin, a marker for PAP, and quantitative analysis in a rat model of neuropathic pain following chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION). We found that, compared to controls, in rats with CCI-ION, (1) the number, % area, surface density, and volume fraction of ezrin-positive (+) PAP, as well as the fraction of synaptic edge apposed by ezrin + PAP and the degree of its coverage of presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic dendrites increased significantly, (2) these effects were abolished by administration of the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP). These findings indicate that PAP undergoes structural reorganization around the central synapses of sensory afferents following nerve injury, suggest that it may be mediated by mGluR5, and may represent the structural basis for enhancing astrocyte-neuron interaction in neuropathic pain.
