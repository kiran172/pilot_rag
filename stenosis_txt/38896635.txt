Title: Accuracy of duplex ultrasonography versus angiotomography for the diagnosis of extracranial internal carotid stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis causes about 15% of ischemic strokes. Duplex ultrasonography (DUS) is the first line of investigation of ICA stenosis, but its accuracy varies in the literature and it is usual to complement the study with another more accurate exam when faced with significant stenosis. There is a lack of studies that compare DUS with angiotomography (CTA) in the present literature.
METHODS: we performed an accuracy study, which compared DUS to CTA of patients in a tertiary hospital with a maximum interval of three months between tests. Patients were selected retrospectively, and two independent and certified vascular surgeons evaluated each image in a masked manner. When there was discordance, a third evaluator was summoned. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ICA stenosis of 50-94% and 70-94%.
RESULTS: we included 45 patients and 84 arteries after inclusion and exclusion criteria applied. For the 50-94% stenosis range, DUS accuracy was 69%, sensitivity 89%, and specificity 63%. For the 70-94% stenosis range, DUS accuracy was 84%, sensitivity 61%, and specificity 93%. There was discordance between CTA evaluators with a change from clinical to surgical management in at least 37.5% of the conflicting reports.
CONCLUSION: DUS had an accuracy of 69% for stenoses of 50-94% and 84% for stenoses of 70-94% of the ICA. The CTA analysis depended directly on the evaluator with a change in clinical conduct in more than 37% of cases.
