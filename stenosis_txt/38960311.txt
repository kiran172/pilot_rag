Title: Full-Endoscopic Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion: A Review and Technical Note.

Abstract: Remarkable innovations in spinal endoscopic surgery have broadened its applications over the past 20Â years. Full-endoscopic fusions have been widely reported, and several full-endoscopic approaches for interbody fusion have been published. In general, full-endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion (LIF) is called Endo-LIF, and facet-preserving Endo-LIF through the transforaminal route is called trans-Kambin's triangle LIF, which has a relatively longer history than facet-sacrificing Endo-LIF via the posterolateral route. Both approaches can reduce intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. However, there is a higher risk of subsidence and exit nerve root injury. There is no direct decompression in either of the interbody fusions, and additional decompression is required if there is severe lumbar bony canal stenosis. However, the posterior interlaminar approach, which is a well-known standard in full-endoscopic spine surgery, has rarely been applied in the field of endoscopic lumbar fusion surgery. Full-endoscopic posterior LIF (FE-PLIF) via an interlaminar approach can accomplish direct decompression of bony canal stenosis and safe interbody fusion. FE-PLIF via an interlaminar approach demonstrated a longer operation time, less blood loss, and shorter hospitalization duration than minimally invasive transforaminal LIF. FE-PLIF, which can accomplish direct decompression for bony spinal canal stenosis, is superior to other Endo-LIFs. However, FE-PLIF requires technical dexterity to improve efficiency and reduce technical complexity.
