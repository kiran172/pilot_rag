Title: Successful Retrieval of a Stuck Guidewire by Guiding Catheter Lock Technique in Renal Artery Stenting.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The guiding catheter lock technique is a therapeutic technique to increase backup force of the guiding catheter in coronary artery interventions.
SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: A 71 year old man presented with rapidly declining kidney function resulting from bilateral renal artery stenosis. During the renal artery stenting procedure, the 0.014" guidewire became trapped at the stent's distal edge. Although attempts were made to advance a microcatheter and balloon catheter over the trapped guidewire, these failed because of insufficient pushability of the guiding catheter. Therefore, the guiding catheter lock technique was used with a second guiding catheter, and the guidewire was successfully retrieved.
DISCUSSION: The guiding catheter lock technique facilitated strong pushability to allow for successful retrieval of a stuck guidewire during renal artery stenting.
