Title: Navigated oblique lumbar interbody fusion for adult spinal deformity.

Abstract: Adult spinal deformity (ASD) is an increasing disease entity as the population ages. An emerging minimally invasive surgery (MIS) option for the treatment of ASD is the oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF), which allows indirect foraminal decompression of stenosis as well as segmental deformity correction (DiGiorgio et al., 2017). The authors utilize computer-assisted navigation with OLIF to reduce radiation exposure and improve time efficiency. The authors present a video of navigated oblique lumbar interbody fusion at L3-5 followed by open posterior screw-rod fixation. The video can be found here: https://youtu.be/zKDT7PhMYf8.
