Title: Computed Tomographic Evaluation of Congenital Left Ventricular Outflow Obstruction.

Abstract: Congenital left ventricular outflow obstruction represents a multilevel obstruction with several morphological forms. It can involve the subvalvular, valvar, or supravalvular portion of the aortic valve complex, and may coexist. Computed tomography (CT) plays an important supplementary role in the evaluation of patients with congenital LVOT obstruction. Unlike transthoracic echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, it is not bounded by a small acoustic window, needs for anaesthesia or sedation, and metallic devices. Current generations of CT scanners with excellent spatial and temporal resolution, high pitch scanning, wide detector system, dose reduction algorithms, and advanced 3-dimensional postprocessing techniques provide a high-quality alternative to CMR or diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Radiologists performing CT in young children should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of CT and with the typical morphological imaging features of congenital left ventricular outflow obstruction.
