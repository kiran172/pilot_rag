Title: Pathophysiology of Aortic Stenosis and Future Perspectives for Medical Therapy.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve stenosis is the commonest form of heart valve disease in high-income countries and set to become a major health care burden. Currently, there are no medical therapies that have proved to slow down or halt disease progression. The only available treatment is aortic valve replacement, of which the optimal timing is unknown and to which not all patients are suited. This review discusses the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis, how noninvasive imaging techniques have improved our understanding of the underlying biology, and how these emerging insights might translate into potential novel treatments targeting oxidized lipids, fibrosis, and calcification.
