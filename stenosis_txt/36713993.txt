Title: Artificial intelligence-based detection of aortic stenosis from chest radiographs.

Abstract: AIMS: We aimed to develop models to detect aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs-one of the most basic imaging tests-with artificial intelligence.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used 10 433 retrospectively collected digital chest radiographs from 5638 patients to train, validate, and test three deep learning models. Chest radiographs were collected from patients who had also undergone echocardiography at a single institution between July 2016 and May 2019. These were labelled from the corresponding echocardiography assessments as AS-positive or AS-negative. The radiographs were separated on a patient basis into training [8327 images from 4512 patients, mean age 65 ±  (standard deviation) 15 years], validation (1041 images from 563 patients, mean age 65 ± 14 years), and test (1065 images from 563 patients, mean age 65 ± 14 years) datasets. The soft voting-based ensemble of the three developed models had the best overall performance for predicting AS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.77-0.88), 0.78 (0.67-0.86), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.71 (0.68-0.74), 0.18 (0.14-0.23), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the validation dataset and 0.83 (0.78-0.88), 0.83 (0.74-0.90), 0.69 (0.66-0.72), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.23 (0.19-0.28), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the test dataset.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning models using chest radiographs have the potential to differentiate between radiographs of patients with and without AS.
LAY SUMMARY: We created artificial intelligence (AI) models using deep learning to identify aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs. Three AI models were developed and evaluated with 10 433 retrospectively collected radiographs and labelled from echocardiography reports. The ensemble AI model could detect AS in a test dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.88). Since chest radiography is a cost-effective and widely available imaging test, our model can provide an additive resource for the detection of AS.
