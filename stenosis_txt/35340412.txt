Title: Study on Correlation between Type 2 Diabetes and No-Reflow after PCI.

Abstract: Diabetes, a serious chronic disease globally, is often complicated with cardiovascular diseases for which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the mainstay. The no-reflow rate of diabetic patients after PCI is 2-4 times higher than that of nondiabetic patients, yet the specific mechanism is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the correlation between the duration of diabetes, preoperative blood glucose level, coronary angiographic blood flow, coronary artery stenosis level, and no-reflow after PCI. A total of 131 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent PCI in our hospital from 2019 to 2020 were divided into control group and observation group. The disease duration, preoperative blood glucose level, coronary angiographic blood flow, and coronary artery stenosis level of the two groups were calculated. There were differences in the duration of diabetes between the two groups; the blood glucose level of the control group was about 3.8%, which was lower than 5.8% of the observation group; the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) value of the control group was 18.46 ± 4.6, which was lower than 20.67 ± 3.9 of the observation group; The degree of coronary stenosis in the control was 63% ± 2%, which was lower than 76% + 3% in the observation group. Binary logistic stepwise regression analysis was performed on these indicators and no-reflow after PCI to explore the correlation between these indicators and no-reflow after PCI in diabetic patients. The study found that the diabetes duration, higher preoperative blood glucose level, coronary angiography blood flow, and coronary artery were positively associated with no-reflow after PCI.
