Title: Multiple recurrent aneurysms with angiitis of the central nervous system in a girl: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Primary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis is a rare immune inflammatory disease confined to the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord. The total number reported in the world is about 500[1]. Most are negative in cerebral angiography or vascular stenosis and only 1 case of aortic aneurysms reported.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 12-year-old female experienced sudden headache and vomiting. Previous findings of vascular stenosis. Diagnosed as a ruptured aneurysm bleeding. The aneurysm recurred a short time after treatment.
DIAGNOSIS: Multiple recurrent aneurysms with angiitis of the central nervous system.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent 2 aneurysm clipping operations, both of which completely clipped the aneurysm.
OUTCOMES: The patient recovered well after surgery. Three months after discharge, DSA reexamination in our hospital showed that the aneurysm was completely clipped without recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage after acute cerebral infarction is rare. In addition, the patient had recurrent aneurysms after the first aneurysm clipping, which emphasized the importance of postoperative drug therapy and blood pressure control.
