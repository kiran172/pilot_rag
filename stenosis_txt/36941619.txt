Title: Coronary CT angiography for preoperative evaluation of non-cardiac surgery in patients with thoracic tumors: preliminary exploratory analysis in a retrospective cohort.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Noninvasive coronary CT angiography (CCTA) was used to retrospectively analyze the characteristics of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with thoracic tumors and the impact of the results on clinical surgery decision-making, thus increasing the understanding of perioperative cardiac risk evaluation.
METHOD: A total of 779 patients (age 68.6 ± 6.6 years) with thoracic tumor (lung, esophageal, and mediastinal tumor) scheduled for non-cardiac surgery were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups: accepted or canceled surgery. Clinical data and CCTA results were compared between the two groups, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of the events of cancellations of scheduled surgeries.
RESULTS: 634 patients (81.4%) had non-significant CAD and 145 patients (18.6%) had significant CAD. Single‑, 2‑, and 3‑ vessel disease was found in 173 (22.2%), 93 (11.9%) and 50 (6.4%) patients, respectively. 500 (64.2%), 96 (12.3%), 96 (12.3%), 56 (7.2%) and 31 (4.0%) patients were rated as CACS 0, 1-99, 100-399, 400-999 and > 1000, respectively. Cancellations of scheduled procedures continue to increase based on the severity of the stenosis and the number of major coronary artery stenosis. The degree of stenosis and the number of vascular stenosis were independent predictors of cancelling scheduled surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with thoracic tumors scheduled for non-cardiac surgery, the results suggested by CCTA significantly influenced surgery planning and facilitated to reduce perioperative cardiovascular events.
