Title: Concomitant aortic valve replacement and retrosternal goitre resection via mini-sternotomy: a novel case.

Abstract: Median sternotomy has been used to aide thyroidectomies demonstrating good outcomes; however no cases have been documented to show the use of mini-sternotomy to perform simultaneous thyroidectomy and valve surgery. We present a novel case of an 83-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and retrosternal goitre extending to the aortic arch deemed unsuitable for TAVI. Due to co-morbid status and anatomical position preventing routine thyroidectomy, we elected to perform a combined procedure to excise the goitre and perform an aortic valve replacement through a mini-J sternotomy, utilizing 3D-reconstructed imaging to plan our approach. This case shows that mini-sternotomy is a safe and effective method to perform concomitant thyroidectomy and aortic valve surgery.
