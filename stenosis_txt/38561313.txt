Title: Endovascular treatment of acute arteriosclerotic vertebrobasilar occlusion: A single center experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Few experiences on vertebrobasilar occlusion over underlying intracranial atherosclerotic disease have been reported in literature and the optimal strategy on how to perform a mechanical thrombectomy is unclear. The aim of this paper is to bring our experience based on patients admitted with acute vertebrobasilar occlusion with underlying atheromatous lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several data were collected from August 2009 to October 2022 including clinical history, pre- and post-treatment neurological objectivity, diagnostic images and angiographic procedural images, and clinical outcome at 6 months. We selected 13 patients from August 2009 to October 2022, 12 men and 1 woman, aged 40 to 82 years (mean age, 62.6 years).
RESULTS: Mechanical thrombectomy with a thromboaspiration was performed in all patients as beginning of the procedure. In three patients, the procedures resulted in excellent angiographic result and clinical outcome, while in three patients, we observed a failure of the procedural and clinical outcome. For residual intracranial stenosis in three patients, an angioplasty was performed obtaining an ischemic area related to the posterior circulation. In four patients, a stent was placed, in three patients, we obtained a good clinical outcome with a mRS between 0 and 2, while one treatment resulted in death, probably due to a late endovascular treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment with stent deployment appears to result in an excellent outcome in patients with occlusion of the vertebrobasilar circulation in cases of occlusion on atheromatic plaque. The degree of residual stenosis after thrombospiration can significantly affect subsequent type of treatment.
