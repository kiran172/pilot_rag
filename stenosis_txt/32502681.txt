Title: Mechanical Thrombectomy of Symptomatic Acute Carotid Stent Thrombosis Using Transcarotid Artery Revascularization Neuroprotection Flow Reversal Technique.

Abstract: Carotid artery stent thrombosis is a relatively rare yet devastating complication of endovascular carotid interventions and manifests as ipsilateral neurological aberrancies such as transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident. Prompt evaluation is necessary, and appropriate imaging is warranted to ascertain the urgency for intervention. Traditionally, anticoagulation with stent explantation and associated thrombectomy is performed. With patients presenting with more high-risk criteria and medical comorbidities, we describe the successful use of transcarotid artery revascularization flow reversal technique with the Penumbra mechanical thrombectomy device to extirpate the thrombus.
