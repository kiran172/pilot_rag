Title: Outcomes of Arterial Embolization vs Covered Stents for Delayed Massive Hemorrhage After Pancreatic or Biliary Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Covered stent placement (CSP) is gaining popularity for the management of delayed massive hemorrhage (DMH) after pancreatic or biliary surgery. However, early studies have produced conflicting results regarding the potential advantages of the procedure. We aimed to compare the short- and medium-term outcomes of arterial embolization (AE) and CSP for DMH.
METHODS: We analyzed data for patients who underwent AE or CSP as an endovascular treatment (EVT) for DMH from the common hepatic artery (CHA) and its distal arteries between January 2009 and December 2019. We evaluated the major hepatic complications, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality associated with the procedures, according to age, sex, reintervention, arterial variant, interval between surgery and EVT, and portal vein stenosis.
RESULTS: All hemorrhages were treated using AE (n = 50) or CSP (n = 20). CSP was associated with no in-hospital mortality (32% vs. 0%, p = 0.003), and lower incidences of major hepatic complications (44% vs. 10%, p = 0.011) and 1-year mortality (54% vs. 25%, p = 0.035) compared with AE, respectively. There was no significant difference in technical success and reintervention rates. Compared with AE, the risk-adjusted odds ratios for CSP (95% confidence intervals) for major hepatic complications and 1-year mortality were 0.06 (0.01-0.39) and 0.19 (0.05-0.71), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: CSP is superior to AE regarding major hepatic complications and in-hospital- and 1-year mortality in patients with DMH from hepatic arteries.
