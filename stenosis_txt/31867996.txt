Title: Jet Ventilation in the Pregnant Patient with Airway Stenosis: Surgical Safety and Outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To review pregnancy outcomes and the safety of jet ventilation use in the gravid patient undergoing surgical airway intervention.
METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective review of medical records was performed to identify women who underwent low-frequency jet ventilation during pregnancy for surgical treatment of airway stenosis. Postoperative complications were noted, and patients were interviewed regarding pregnancy outcomes.
RESULTS: Six women were included in this series. No immediate complications relating to anesthesia or surgical intervention were noted in five of the six women. One patient with a well-known history of uncontrolled seizures experienced seizure activity postoperatively. One patient returned to the operating room at a later date for debridement of tracheal crusts. Five mothers delivered via cesarean section and one via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mean gestation age was 37.3â€‰weeks. One of the six infants delivered prematurely and three were delivered at low birth weight. Three of the six infants required elevated care immediately post-delivery but, at present, all are in good health.
CONCLUSION: Low-frequency jet ventilation and surgical management of airway stenosis should be recognized as a safe treatment option in the gravid patient. Surgical intervention should not be delayed in patients with severe symptoms, particularly given the potential risk associated with prolonged corticosteroid use.
