Title: Transesophageal Echocardiography-Guided Elephant Trunk Procedure for Repair of Descending Thoracic Aorta: A Case Report.

Abstract: The elephant trunk procedure, an endovascular strategy for retrograde type A acute aortic dissection, is associated with several complications, hemolytic anemia being a rare one. We performed endovascular stent-graft insertion in a patient who developed hemolytic anemia. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) detected turbulent jet flow and stenosis position, which was not detected by angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). This imaging technique proved effective for malperfusion diagnosis and enabled us to confirm its resolution after the endovascular procedure. Intraoperative TEE is a useful adjunct to angiography and IVUS for diagnosis and therapeutic assessment during endovascular repair of a stenosed elephant trunk.
