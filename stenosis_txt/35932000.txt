Title: The clinical features of late postoperative cholangitis following pancreaticoduodenectomy brought on by conditions other than cancer recurrence: a single-center retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postoperative cholangitis is a late complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). This study aimed to elucidate the pathogenesis of post-PD cholangitis (PPDC) and explore its optimal treatment.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 210 patients who underwent PD at our institute between 2009 and 2018. Patients who underwent follow-up for less than 1 year or had cholangitis caused by cancer recurrence were excluded from the analysis. Diagnostic criteria for cholangitis and its severity were determined based on the classification of acute cholangitis provided by the 2018 Tokyo Guidelines (TG18).
RESULTS: PPDC occurred in 19 (11%) of the 176 included patients. Of these 19 patients, nine experienced more than one episode of cholangitis (total episodes, 36). For 14 patients (74%), the first episode of PPDC occurred within two years after surgery. Based on the TG18, 21 episodes were mild and 15 episodes were moderate; none were severe. Blood culture test results were positive for 16 of 24 episodes. Most patients were hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics (median, seven days). The blood test values improved promptly after treatment was started. Four patients with recurrent cholangitis underwent endoscopic examination, and three of them had anastomotic stenosis of the hepaticojejunostomy. The univariate and multivariate analyses did not indicate any significant predictive factors for PPDC development.
CONCLUSION: Mild and moderate PPDC occurred and improved with short-term antimicrobial treatment. Temporary reflux into the intrahepatic bile ducts may have been the cause of PPDC while anastomotic stenosis may be involved in recurrent cases.
