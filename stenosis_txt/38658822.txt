Title: Tongue patch angioplasty for small-caliber vein segments directly connected to juxta-anastomotic stenosis.

Abstract: This study introduces a surgical method to increase the size of small vessels in patients with juxta-anastomosis stenosis (JAS) requiring full-length dissection. The small-caliber segment that is adjacent to JAS is usually expanded using balloon angioplasty or surgically resected. After resection, if the cannulation site is sufficient, only the arterial anastomosis is moved proximally; otherwise, it is replaced with a prosthetic graft. Herein, we describe the cases of two 60- and 34-year-old men with left brachio-basilar and left radiocephalic fistulas, respectively. The first and second patients needed transposition and superficialization, respectively, both of which required full-length vessel dissection. Both patients developed JAS with a long, small-caliber segment, leaving no space for arterial needle cannulation. A tongue patch with a graft on the bottom and a native vein on the top was used to resolve the JAS and make the native vein the needle cannulation site. In our cases, this method was effective for more than 2â€‰years without adverse events in the particular surgical area. Although this method had a complicated indication, it could help ensure a sufficiently long area of the native vein for cannulation.
