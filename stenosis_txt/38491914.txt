Title: Endovascular Therapy for Vascular Graft Infection After Multiple Bypass Surgeries for Aorto-Iliac Occlusive Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vascular graft infection is a very complex disease. Although complete excision of the infected grafts with extra-anatomic bypass or in situ reconstruction is a general treatment strategy, some concerns including reinfection in the new graft remain.
CASE REPORT: An 88 year-old man presented to the hospital with abdominal swelling and bleeding. The patient had undergone revascularization for aorto-iliac occlusive disease twice in the past. The first procedure had been performed 15 years previously, with right ilio-femoral bypass grafting for right iliac artery occlusion and stent implantation for left iliac artery stenosis. The second procedure had been performed 10 years previously, with aorta-to-left femoral and left-to-right femoro-femoral bypass grafting because the terminal aorta, the first ilio-femoral bypass graft, and the stent of the left iliac artery had been occluded. The patient was diagnosed with vascular graft infection, and endovascular therapy was selected as the revascularization method prior to graft excision. It was successfully performed using various devices and techniques, followed by graft excision without critical limb ischemia.
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that endovascular therapy prior to graft excision can be an alternative revascularization method for vascular graft infection after bypass surgery for aorto-iliac occlusive disease.
