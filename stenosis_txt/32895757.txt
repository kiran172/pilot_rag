Title: Factors associated with patency loss and actuarial patency rate following post-cholecystectomy bile duct injury repair: long-term follow-up.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Several factors may contribute to bile duct injury (BDI) repair failure. The objective of our study was to evaluate factors that contribute to the loss of patency and influence the actuarial patency rate of BDI repairs in an 11-year period.
METHODS: Retrospective review study of patients who underwent a hepaticojejunostomy for a type E Bismuth-Strasberg BDI (2008-2019). The outcomes are the following: primary patency attained, loss of primary patency, and actuarial primary patency rate. Logistic regression for loss of patency and Cox regression for actuarial patency rate were used.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (age 42.3 ± 15.8 years, 81% female) were studied. Most common index operation was open cholecystectomy (60.8%). Most common Bismuth-Strasberg lesion was E4 (38%). Primary patency was 93.4%. Mean follow-up was 36 ± 34 months. Ten-year actuarial patency was 53.9%. Factors associated with loss of patency were vasculobiliary injury, biliary stents, and 90-day biliary complications (univariate); number of surgeries before repair and postoperative cholangitis (univariate and multivariate) (p < 0.05). Factors that impacted actuarial patency rate were (univariate analysis) 90-day biliary complications; postoperative cholangitis and index treatment period stenosis (p < 0.05). No factors impacted actuarial patency rate in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Postoperative cholangitis is associated with loss of patency and had potentially detrimental effect on the actuarial patency rate in BDI repair.
