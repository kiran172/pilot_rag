Title: Physical capability and patient-reported well-being after spinal surgery: a 20-year cohort from the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention study combined with the Finnish Care Register for Health Care.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies investigating the effect of spinal surgery on both physical capability (PC) and subjective well-being (SW) are scarce. We aimed to investigate self-reported PC and SW up to 20 years after lumbar spine surgery.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 6,612 postmenopausal Finnish women (47-56 years at baseline [BL]), from the Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) study, were followed-up (FU) for 20 years. The Finnish Care Register for Healthcare (CRFH) provided data on surgery in the OSTPRE population on lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and lumbar disc herniation (LDH). PC and SW of women with lumbar surgery was compared with that of women without lumbar surgery. A chi-square analysis was conducted to analyze the statistical differences in the distribution of PC and SW. A propensity score-matched control analysis was also performed in addition to analysis of the total populationbased control group.
RESULTS: In women without lumbar surgery 94% reported good PC at BL, which decreased to 79% at the 20-year FU. For those with LSS/LDH surgery, 84%/(37/50) reported good PC at BL and 80%/(33/50) at 20-year FU, respectively. Good SW was reported by 48% of the control group at BL, 50% at 10-year FU, and 42% at 20-year FU. Women with LSS/LDH surgery before the 10-year FU reported good SW as follows: (6/50)/38% at BL, (12/48)/39% at 10-year FU, and (9/50)/37% at 20-year FU.
CONCLUSION: Patients with LSS and LDH report lower PC and SW. Lumbar spinal surgery improves PC and SW in the short term, with early LDH surgery showing the greatest benefits whereas late surgery did not. Overall, PC and SW are lower both initially and during the 20-year FU when compared with the age-matched controls except for early LDH surgery.
