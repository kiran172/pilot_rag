Title: Metal allergy and neurovascular stenting: A systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial stents and flow diverters contain significant amounts of metals, notably nickel, which can cause allergic reactions in a considerable portion of the population. These allergic responses may lead to complications like in-stent stenosis (ISS) and TIA/Stroke in patients receiving stents or flow diverters for intracranial aneurysms.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies from inception until July 2023, which reported outcomes of patients with metal allergy undergoing neurovascular stenting. The skin patch test was used to group patients into those with positive, negative, or absent patch test results but with a known history of metal allergy.
RESULTS: Our review included seven studies with a total of 39 patients. Among them, 87% had a history of metal allergy before treatment. Most aneurysms (89%) were in the anterior circulation and the rest (11%) were in the posterior circulation. Skin patch tests were performed in 59% of patients, with 24% showing positive results and 33% negative. Incidental ISS was observed in 18% of patients, and the rate of TIA/Stroke was reported in 21%. The pooled rates of ISS and TIA/Stroke were higher in the first group (43% and 38%) compared to the second (18% and 9%) and third groups (15% and 15%), but these differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The current neurosurgical literature does not provide a conclusive association between metal allergy and increased complications among patients undergoing neurovascular stenting. Further studies are necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this topic.
