Title: KDOQI 2019 Vascular Access Guidelines: What Is New?

Abstract: The new Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Vascular Access Guidelines now focus on a more comprehensive overall patient strategy. The patient's vascular access needs are part of a dialysis access strategy, which itself is part of an End Stage Kidney Disease Life-Plan strategy that stems from a unique patient's individualized needs. The End Stage Kidney Disease Life-Plan is an individualized and comprehensive map for dialysis modalities and dialysis access for the lifetime of the patient. New targets are introduced that align with this patient-centered approach. The Guidelines made significant changes to the use of surveillance techniques to detect stenosis and found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for routine arteriovenous fistula surveillance by measuring access blood flow, pressure monitoring, or imaging for stenosis that was in addition to routine clinical monitoring. Routine surveillance is not recommended in arteriovenous grafts. Similarly, pre-emptive angioplasty of arteriovenous fistulas or arteriovenous grafts with stenosis, not associated with clinical indicators, is not recommended. The Guidelines represent a rigorous review of the evidence; however, the available evidence to guide vascular access practice remains limited. There is a significant need and opportunity for new and ongoing high-quality research to inform best practice.
