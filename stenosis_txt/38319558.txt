Title: Adult Hypospadias Outcomes for the Pediatric Urologist.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review article will examine the current literature on hypospadias-related complications in adult patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: In this article, we will review the most recent studies evaluating hypospadias-related stricture disease, erectile function, fertility, and psychosexual outcomes in adult men with history of hypospadias repair in childhood. Managing hypospadias-related complications in adult patients is challenging to reconstructive urologists due to the compounded complexity of innate tissue deficiency and history of prior surgical repairs. In this review, we explore overall functional outcomes of adults with history of hypospadias repair as well as repair strategies of hypospadias-related urethral stricture disease. We will review erectile function, fertility and psychosexual outcomes as well as potential complications, which often do not surface until late adolescence and adulthood. Although it is challenging to characterize and quantify hypospadias-related complications, further longitudinal study is needed to better care for this complex patient population.
