Title: Lipoprotein(a) Levels in Severe Aortic Stenosis Referred for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Compared to Controls.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Limited observational reports link elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels to aortic stenosis (AS) or to disease progression. Data on large cohorts of verified severe AS patients are lacking.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to characterize Lp(a) levels of severe AS patients referred to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and compare them to a large cohort of Lp(a) samples derived from the general population.
METHODS: Lp(a) levels obtained from frozen serum samples of TAVI patients between 2012 and 2017 were compared to a control group for whom Lp(a) levels were obtained for any reason and stratified by gender. Multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate associations between younger age at TAVI and an Lp(a) cutoff of 50 mg/dL.
RESULTS: Lp(a) levels of 503 TAVI were compared to 25,343 controls. Patients in the AS group had mildly higher median Lp(a) levels compared to controls (20.5 vs 18.7 mg/dL, P = 0.04). Lp(a) levels in males with severe AS were higher than controls (19.9 vs 16.6 mg/dL, P = 0.04). Females had a nonsignificant difference (22.1 vs 21.3 mg/dL, P = 0.87). In multivariable analysis, an Lp(a) cutoff of above 50 mg/dL was not associated with an earlier age at TAVI (beta: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.42-2.57; P = 0.94).
CONCLUSIONS: Median Lp(a) levels were only mildly higher in severe AS patients undergoing TAVI in comparison to a large control group, mainly driven by higher Lp(a) levels in males. Higher Lp(a) levels were not associated with an earlier age at TAVI, rejecting its association with an accelerated disease progression.
