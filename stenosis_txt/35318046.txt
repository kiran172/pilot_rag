Title: Surgical and Functional Outcomes of Bladder Neck Incision for Primary Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis Stricture after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy are Influenced by the Presence of Pre- or Postoperative Radiotherapy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report the intermediate- to long-term outcomes of bladder neck incision (BNI) for vesico-urethral anastomosis stricture (VUAS) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and the influence of pre- or post-RARP radiotherapy on these outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed with patients who underwent BNI for VUAS after RARP in a high-volume prostatectomy centre between 2006 and July 2021. Data was collected from patient charts. The cohort was divided into 4 groups: VUAS after (1) RARP-only, (2) RARP, but before salvage radiotherapy (SRT) (VUAS pre-SRT), (3) RARP and after SRT (VUAS post-SRT), and (4) primary radiotherapy and salvage RARP (SRARP). The VUAS recurrence rates, the ability to perform functional transurethral micturition and the post-BNI urinary continence rates were reported.
RESULTS: BNI was performed in 90 patients. The median time between first BNI and last follow-up was 32 months (interquartile range 10-58, range 0-171). The majority of VUAS occurred within 6 months after (S)RARP. In those who underwent BNI, recurrent VUAS was reported in 12%, 57%, 29%, and 50% of patients after RARP-only, VUAS pre-SRT, VUAS post-SRT, and SRARP, respectively. Ultimately, transurethral micturition was possible in 94%, 93%, 71%, and 80%, respectively. Severe urinary-incontinence rates (>1 pads/d) were 6%, 16%, 10%, and 29% for RARP-only, VUAS pre-SRT, VUAS post-SRT, and SRARP patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Primary radiotherapy before RARP and SRT after RARP significantly influenced the success rates of BNI. Those who underwent BNI after SRARP had worse outcomes than patients who underwent RARP only.
