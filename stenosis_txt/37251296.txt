Title: Use of Silicon T-Tube for Subglottic Stenosis and Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The management of subglottic and tracheal stenosis is challenging for any ENT surgeon. The treatment choice depends on the site, severity of stenosis, patient symptoms, and surgeon preferences. The various options for the management include endoscopic balloon dilatation, various types of laryngotracheoplasty, resection anastomosis, and insertion of a silicon T-tube. Compared to the above, silicon T-tube stenting is a better alternative, as it is a onetime procedure, easy to perform with fewer chances of complications. Shiann Yann lee technique is a form of laryngotracheoplasty with long-term stenting using silicon T-tube. This article analyzed our silicon T-Tube insertion result in patients with subglottic and tracheal stenosis using this technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included a total of 21 patients with subglottic and tracheal stenosis who underwent silicon T-Tube insertion. Data regarding the site of stenosis, procedure, complications, and outcome were analyzed.
RESULTS: Out of 21 patients, nine patients had subglottic stenosis (42.8%), 8 had cervical tracheal stenosis (38.09%), 3 had thoracic tracheal stenosis (14.28%), and 1 (4.7%) had combined subglottic and cervical tracheal stenosis. Out of 21 patients,7 (33.3%) have undergone successful removal of silicon T-Tube so far, one death due to medical reasons, and 13 patients (61.9%) are still on Silicon tube on regular follow-up. They are comfortable with the tube in situ.
CONCLUSIONS: Silicon T-Tube for benign acquired laryngotracheal stenosis with Shiann Yann Lee's technique is effective, safe with less complication, and good acceptability and tolerance by the patient.
