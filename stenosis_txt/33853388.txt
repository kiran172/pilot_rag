Title: Aorto-left common carotid artery bypass with off-pump coronary artery bypass.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although carotid artery disease can occur in patients who have coronary artery disease (CAD), ostial stenosis of a left common carotid artery (CCA) along with CAD is a rarely reported condition.
CASE REPORT: We describe a rare case of severe stenosis of the left CCA ostium and CAD, which were successfully treated with an off-pump coronary artery bypass and aorto-left CCA bypass. This strategy minimizes the risk of perioperative strokes. Furthermore, an aorto-supra aortic trunk bypass provides a more physiological blood flow pattern than cerebral approaches. This approach would be a safe and effective treatment option.
