Title: Associations between Total Atherosclerosis Burden of Baroreceptor-Resident Arteries and ECG Abnormalities after Acute Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities are the most common cardiac complications after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and predict poor outcomes. The arterial baroreflex is an essential determinant of cardiovascular autonomic regulation, with receptors mainly residing in carotid sinuses and aortic arch. The atherosclerosis of these baroreceptor-resident arteries (BRA) is very common in AIS patients and might impair baroreflex function. However, the associations between the atherosclerosis of BRA and ECG abnormalities after AIS are still unknown. In total, 228 AIS patients within 7 days after onset without a pre-existing heart disease were prospectively recruited. With computed tomography angiography, atherosclerosis conditions in 10 segments of the carotid sinuses and aortic arch were scored and summed as the Total Atherosclerosis Burden of BRA (TAB-BRA), and asymptomatic coronary artery stenosis (ACAS) ≥50% was simultaneously assessed. We performed 12-lead ECG to dynamically detect abnormal repolarization, and 24 h Holter ECG to monitor arrhythmias and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, which are reliable indicators to assess cardiac autonomic function. We found that TAB-BRA was positively associated with abnormal repolarization (OR 1.09; CI% 1.03-1.16; p = 0.003) and serious cardiac arrhythmias (OR 1.08; CI% 1.01-1.15; p = 0.021). In addition, TAB-BRA was an important predictor of abnormal repolarization, persisting over 3 days (OR 1.17; CI% 1.05-1.30; p = 0.003). However, ACAS ≥ 50% did not relate to these ECG abnormalities. TAB-BRA was negatively correlated with parasympathetic-related HRV parameters. Our results indicated that AIS patients with a high TAB-BRA are more likely to have ECG abnormalities and delayed normalization, which may relate to the decreased cardiac parasympathetic activity, but not the accompanied ACAS ≥ 50%.
