Title: Preprocedural transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to identify stenosis associated with increased coronary flow after revascularisation.

Abstract: The benefit of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been reported to be associated with functional stenosis severity defined by fractional flow reserve (FFR). This study aimed to investigate the predictive ability of preprocedural transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TDE) for increased coronary flow. A total of 50 left anterior descending arteries (LAD) that underwent TDE examinations were analysed. Hyperaemic LAD diastolic peak velocity (hDPV) was used as a surrogate of volumetric coronary flow. The increase in coronary flow was evaluated by the metric of % hDPV-increase defined by 100× (post-PCI hDPV-pre-PCI hDPV)/pre-PCI hDPV. The two groups divided by the median value of % hDPV-increase were compared, and the determinants of a significant coronary flow increase defined as more than the median % hDPV-increase were explored. After PCI, FFR values improved in all cases. hDPV significantly increased from 53.0 to 76.0 mm/s (P < 0.01) and the median % hDPV-increase was 45%, while hDPV decreased in 10 patients. On multivariable analysis, pre-PCI FFR and hDPV were independent predictors of a significant coronary flow increase. Preprocedural TDE-derived hDPV provided significant improvement of identification of lesions that benefit from revascularisation with respect to significant coronary flow increase.
