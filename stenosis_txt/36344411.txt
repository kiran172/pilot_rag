Title: Lumbar plexus terminal branch block, a safe alternative for transfemoral aortic valve implantation. Case report.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an alternative treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis, it is conventionally performed under general anaesthesia or local anaesthesia plus sedation. We present the first case of trans-femoral, trans-catheter aortic valve implantation, performed in our hospital in a patient with severe aortic stenosis, who was a high surgical risk. Anaesthesia consisted of a combination of bilateral selective blockade of the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal and genitofemoral nerves with the patient awake without sedation, using an ultrasound-guided approach. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation was successful and passed without incident, the patient remained immobile, calm, did not report pain, and sedation or hypnotics were not necessary during dilation of the vascular accesses with the introducer. Standard monitoring demonstrated haemodynamic stability, without cardiovascular repercussions and did not necessitate vasopressor or inotropic drug support. After the intervention, the patient was sent to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, where he remained asymptomatic and stable. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the cardiology ward from where he was discharged without complications.
