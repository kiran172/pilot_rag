Title: Pulmonary Artery Reconstruction After Failed Pulmonary Artery Stents.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary artery stents are widely deployed in patients with stenoses in the branch pulmonary arteries. However, stents do not address more peripheral sites of stenosis and invariably develop in-stent restenosis. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with pulmonary artery reconstruction after failed pulmonary artery stents.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 56 patients who underwent pulmonary artery reconstruction after failed pulmonary artery stents. These patients had undergone a median of 2 (range, 0-5) previous surgical procedures and 2 (range, 1-4) pulmonary artery stents.
RESULTS: The median age at stent surgery was 5 (range, 0.3-23.6) years. The majority of stents (79%) were completely removed and patch augmented. The minority of stents (21%) were felt to be unremovable and thus were split longitudinally and reconstructed using a pulmonary artery homograft. There was 1 (1.8%) operative mortality. The mean pulmonary artery-to-aortic pressure ratio decreased from a preoperative value of 0.91 ± 0.21 to a postoperative value of 0.31 ± 0.07 (P < .001). The median hospital length of stay was 10 days. The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. There has been no midterm mortality. Six patients have undergone balloon dilation postoperatively for residual pulmonary artery stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary artery reconstruction resulted in a significant decrease in pulmonary artery-to-aortic pressure ratios. The subsequent need for reintervention on the pulmonary arteries has been relatively low (11% to date). These results suggest that patients with pulmonary artery stents can be successfully treated with surgical reconstruction.
