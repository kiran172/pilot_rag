Title: [Vascular diagnostics before microvascular tissue transfer on the lower extremities : An algorithm].

Abstract: Microsurgical free flap transfer plays a key role in soft tissue reconstruction of the lower extremities. Through close cooperation between plastic and orthopedic surgery, great progress and success in limb salvage could be achieved over the last decades. The risk for extremity malperfusion is especially high in older patients and after trauma. To maximize the success rate for free flap transfer there is need for interdisciplinary clinical examination and diagnostics. In addition to clinical methods radiological procedures are necessary to evaluate and optimize lower extremity perfusion before surgery.Vascular ultrasound provides important information about the arterial and venous status; however, DSA, CTA and MRA are well-established and exact methods to evaluate arterial inflow. The use of less invasive methods makes it much more feasible, economic and comfortable to perform preoperative selection of patients requiring interventional procedures.In the case of intraluminal stenosis without any option for PTA, a vascular surgeon can be involved at an early stage to evaluate further surgical options. In some cases, similar surgical revascularization and free flap transfer can be performed in a single surgery. The aim of this study is to implement a standardized algorithm for preoperative examination and radiological diagnostics before reconstructive surgery of the lower extremity.
