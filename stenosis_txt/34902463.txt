Title: Timing to Carotid Endarterectomy Affects Early and Long Term Outcomes of Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate early and long-term outcomes according to the timing to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) of symptomatic carotid stenosis.
METHODS: Consecutive CEAs with selective shunting for symptomatic carotid stenosis ≥50% performed between 2009 and 2020. Patients had acute neurological impairment on presentation, defined as <5 points on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We grouped patients according to time between index event and CEA: the first group was operated between 0 and 2 days, the second group between 3 and 7 days, the third group between 8 and 14 days and the last group after 15 days. Thirty-day neurological status improvement was defined as a decrease (≥1) in the 30-day NIHSS score versus NIHSS score immediately before surgery.
RESULTS: Five hundred CEAs were performed. The perioperative combined stroke and mortality rate was 3.6% (18/500), representing a perioperative mortality rate of 0.2 (n = 1) and stroke rate of 3.4% (n = 17). Overall freedom from stroke was 95% at 1 year, 89 % at 6 years, and 88% at 10 years. Annual stroke rate was 0.6% after the 30-day period. Thirty-day improvement in neurologic status occurred in 103 patients (20.6%), while in 380 (76%) neurologic status was unchanged, and 17 (3.4%) experienced worsening of their neurologic status. Patients treated within 7 days from the index event had significant benefit (OR = 2.6) in the 30-day neurological improvement versus those treated after 7 days from the index event. Timing to CEA <2 days increased significantly the risk of late stroke (OR = 9.7).
CONCLUSIONS: The ideal timing for performing CEA is between 3 and 7 days from the index event if NIHSS <5 as it is associated with the best rates of improvement in neurological status and durability in the long term. Very early CEA (<48 hrs) was associated with increased late stroke occurrence.
