Title: Comparison of 2D-QCA, 3D-QCA and coronary angiography derived FFR in predicting myocardial ischemia assessed by CZT-SPECT MPI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Angiography derived fractional flow reserve (angio-FFR) has been proposed. This study aimed to assess its diagnostic performance with cadmium-zinc-telluride single emission computed tomography (CZT-SPECT) as reference.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients underwent CZT-SPECT within 3 months of coronary angiography were included. Angio-FFR computation was performed using computational fluid dynamics. Percent diameter (%DS) and area stenosis (%AS) were measured by quantitative coronary angiography. Myocardial ischemia was defined as a summed difference score ≥ 2 in a vascular territory. Angio-FFR ≤ 0.80 was considered abnormal. 282 coronary arteries in 131 patients were analyzed. Overall accuracy of angio-FFR to detect ischemia on CZT-SPECT was 90.43%, with a sensitivity of 62.50% and a specificity of 98.62%. The diagnostic performance (= area under ROC = AUC) of angio-FFR [AUC = 0.91, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.86-0.95] was similar as those of %DS (AUC = 0.88, 95% CI 0.84-0.93, p = 0.326) and %AS (AUC = 0.88, 95% CI 0.84-0.93 p = 0.241) by 3D-QCA, but significantly higher than those of %DS (AUC = 0.59, 95% CI 0.51-0.67, p < 0.001) and %AS (AUC = 0.59, 95% CI 0.51-0.67, p < 0.001) by 2D-QCA. However, in vessels with 50-70% stenoses, AUC of angio-FFR was significantly higher than those of %DS (0.80 vs. 0.47, p < 0.001) and %AS (0.80 vs. 0.46, p < 0.001) by 3D-QCA and %DS (0.80 vs. 0.66, p = 0.036) and %AS (0.80 vs. 0.66, p = 0.034) by 2D-QCA.
CONCLUSION: Angio-FFR had a high accuracy in predicting myocardial ischemia assessed by CZT-SPECT, which is similar as 3D-QCA but significantly higher than 2D-QCA. While in intermediate lesions, angio-FFR is better than 3D-QCA and 2D-QCA in assessing myocardial ischemia.
