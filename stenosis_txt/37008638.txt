Title: Rapport de cas Suspected congenital unilateral ureteral atresia and hydronephrosis in a 6-year-old dog.

Abstract: A 6-year-old neutered male giant schnauzer dog was presented to an emergency clinic with stranguria and pollakiuria. On physical examination, the abdomen was generally and non-painfully distended. Diagnostic imaging revealed several large, anechoic, fluid-filled, space-occupying lesions from the cranial to caudal abdomen placing extramural pressure on the bladder and urethra and apparently causing the clinical signs. Unilateral ureteral atresia with secondary ipsilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter were diagnosed on post-mortem examination. Due to a lack of history of abdominal surgery or trauma and the absence of scarring or stenosis of the ureter, the condition was suspected to be congenital. Key clinical message: Although rare, hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to a congenital ureteral defect should be considered when a dog is presented with abdominal distension and several peritoneal and retroperitoneal space-occupying lesions on diagnostic imaging.
