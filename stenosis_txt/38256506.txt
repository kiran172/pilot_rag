Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Current Status and Future Indications.

Abstract: In the past two decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has transformed the management of aortic stenosis and has become the standard of care regardless of surgical risk levels. Advances in transcatheter valve design across newer generations, improved imaging, greater operator expertise, and technical enhancements have collectively contributed to increased safety and a decline in procedural complications over this timeframe. The application of TAVR has progressively expanded to include younger patients with lower risks, who have longer life expectancies. This article offers an up-to-date review of the latest innovations in transcatheter delivery systems, devices, and its possible future indications.
