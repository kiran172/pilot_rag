Title: Affirming Long-Term Outcomes After Contemporary Urethroplasty: The Adverse Impact of Increasing Stricture Length, Lichen Sclerosus, Radiation, and Infectious Strictures.

Abstract: PURPOSE: There is a paucity of reported long-term outcomes after contemporary urethroplasty. Our objective is to determine the long-term success of modern urethroplasty and identify factors associated with stricture recurrence in this context.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing urethroplasty from July 2003 to May 2013 with at least 100 months of follow-up were identified. Long-term outcomes including stricture recurrence and patient satisfaction were evaluated by review of regional/provincial electronic records and telephone interview. Urethroplasty failure was defined as a recurrent stricture (<16F) confirmed on cystoscopy. Cox regression was used to evaluate variables associated with long-term stricture recurrence.
RESULTS: A total of 733 patients were identified with â‰¥ 100 months follow-up. Median patient age was 45 years, stricture length was 4.7 cm, and 85.8% failed prior endoscopic treatment. At a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 89 recurrences were observed. Cumulative incidence of stricture recurrence was 6%, 10%, and 12% after 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. From a patient-reported perspective, 89% of patients reported being satisfied with the outcome of surgery. On multivariable analyses, increasing stricture length (HR 1.1, 95% CI 1.05-1.15; P &lt; .001) and stricture etiology (P &lt; .001), in particular lichen sclerosus (HR 4.46, 95% CI 2.25-9.53), radiation (HR 4.25, 95% CI 1.65-10.9), and infectious strictures (HR 5.27, 95% CI 2.03-13.7), were independently associated with stricture recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: This study affirms the widely held belief that modern urethroplasty provides high long-term patency and patient-reported satisfaction. Patients with longer strictures as well as those with lichen sclerosus, radiation, and infectious etiologies have a higher hazard of stricture recurrence in the long term.
