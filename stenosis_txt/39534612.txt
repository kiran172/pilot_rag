Title: Rheumatic Mitral Restenosis Following Surgical Commissurotomy.

Abstract: Because corrective procedures extended life expectancy of the population with rheumatic heart disease, reintervention has become a contemporary challenge. This paper presents a case of a 54-year-old woman with exertional dyspnea andÂ palpitations 26 years after undergoing surgical commissurotomy due to mitral stenosis, with remarkable clinical-echocardiographic divergence on valvular disease severity.
