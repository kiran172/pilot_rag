Title: Assessment of Left Ventricular Global Myocardial Work in Patients With Different Degrees of Coronary Artery Stenosis by Pressure-Strain Loops Analysis.

Abstract: Global myocardial work (MW) analysis by pressure-strain loops (PSL) allows the non-invasive assessment of left ventricular (LV) function. We aimed to investigate the relationship between LV global MW and the degree of coronary artery stenosis in suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with normal LV ejection fraction and regional wall motion. A total of 164 suspected CAD patients were divided into four groups according to coronary artery angiography. The results showed that global work efficiency (GWE) as the most significant predictor in all MW parameters had the optimal cut-off value of 94.5% for detecting moderate stenosis, and the sensitivity and specificity was 89.7% and 85.8%, respectively. A cut-off value of 94.0% for GWE was the most significant predictor of severe stenosis, and the sensitivity and specificity was 81.4% and 76.1%, respectively. In conclusion, LV global MW is a sensitive tool in detecting the degree of coronary artery stenosis and a potential valuable method to provide early diagnosis for CAD patients.
