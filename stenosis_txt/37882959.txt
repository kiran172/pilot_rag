Title: Diagnostic performance of quantitative flow ratio in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes in comparison to non-hyperemic pressure ratios: a prospective study.

Abstract: Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a new angiography-based coronary physiology tool aimed to evaluate functional relevance of intermediate coronary lesions. Aim of the study is to assess diagnostic performance of QFR in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) in comparison to currently used non-hyperaemic pressure ratios (NHPRs). In this prospective, single-centre study, coronary physiology of intermediate coronary stenoses of non-culprit vessels in patients presenting with NSTE-ACS was evaluated using NHPRs (iFR, DFR or RFR). Subsequently, QFR was computed offline by a QFR analyst blinded to the NHPR results. Diagnostic performance of QFR was assessed in comparison to NHPRs as reference standard. A total of 60 vessels with intermediate coronary stenoses was investigated. The NHPRs were used as follows: RFR 38%, DFR 47% and iFR 15% of the cases. The NHPR result was positive, showing significant lesion, in 19 cases. A significant correlation was found between NHPR and QFR (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Classification agreement of the two methods (95%) and diagnostic performance of QFR in comparison to NHPR (AUC: 0.962 [0.914-1.00]) were both high. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of QFR in comparison to NHPR were 84.2%, 100%, 100% and 93.2% respectively. QFR has high diagnostic performance in detecting functionally significant lesions of non-culprit arteries in patients with NSTE-ACS and multivessel disease. Due to its high negative predictive value, it can be used to safely avoid unnecessary invasive physiological assessment of these lesions.
