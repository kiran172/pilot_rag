Title: Olfactory cleft stenosis and obstruction on paranasal sinus CT scan in pre-septo-rhinoplasty patients: normal variants or pathologic findings?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE(S): To determine the frequency of olfactory cleft (OC) stenosis and obstruction on paranasal sinus CT scans in pre-septorhinoplasty of patients who had septal deviation, septopyramidal deformation or nasal obstruction without other sinonasal conditions.
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients referred to our institution between December 2013 and December 2021 for septorhinoplasty due to nasal obstruction without other sinonasal or neurological conditions. All patients underwent preoperative paranasal sinus CT scan and olfactory testing. OC stenosis was quoted as none, partial, or total (less than 1/3 contact between nasal septum and ethmoid turbinates, 1/3-2/3, more than 2/3, respectively), as well as OC obstruction as none, partial, or complete (obstruction of less than 1/3 of OC, 1/3-2/3, more than 2/3, respectively). Radiologic evaluation was validated by near perfect interobserver agreement.
RESULTS: A total of 75 patients (32 women, 43 men) with a mean age of 44.2 ± 15.64 (23-74) years were included, of which 36 were normosmic and 39 hyposmic. OC stenosis was partial in 58.7% (n = 44) of the patients, absent in 28% (n = 21), and total in 13.3% (n = 10), without difference between normosmic and hyposmic patients (p = .66). OC obstruction was absent in 52% (n = 39) and partial in 46.7% (n = 35), without difference between normosmic and hyposmic patients (p = .51). Only one normosmic patient had complete OC obstruction.
CONCLUSION: OC partial stenosis and partial obstruction were frequent findings in pre-septorhinoplasty patients without respiratory mucosa disease and did not influence their olfactory status. Total stenosis and complete obstruction were rarer and require further investigation.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Isolated partial olfactory cleft stenosis and obstruction should be considered normal variants, whereas the impact of complete olfactory cleft stenosis and obstruction on patient's olfactory status remains to be determined.
KEY POINTS: • The incidence of olfactory cleft stenosis and obstruction in asymptomatic patients remains unknown, even though it is encountered in clinical practice. • Partial and total olfactory cleft stenosis occurred in 58.7% and 13.3% of the patients; partial obstruction occurred in half of the cases, but complete obstruction was extremely rare. • There are frequent findings of partial olfactory cleft obstruction and stenosis, but complete obstruction and total stenosis should be further investigated.
