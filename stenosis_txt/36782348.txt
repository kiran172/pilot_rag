Title: [Cognitive impairment in the elderly patient with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Therapeutic decisions and impact on one-year mortality].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Interventional treatment of severe aortic stenosis includes valve replacement by surgery or transcatheter - transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In order to make an adequate selection and to rule out patients with little/no therapeutic benefit, it is recommended to assess comorbidities, frailty and cognitive impairment.
AIMS: a) To determine the prevalence of cognitive impairment in older patients with severe aortic stenosis; b) to analyse its influence on decision-making (surgery, TAVI or conservative treatment); and c) to analyse its impact on mortality at one year.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective, longitudinal epidemiological study of patients aged 75 years and older with severe aortic stenosis treated by the Heart-Team.
VARIABLES: sociodemographic, clinical, cardiological, functional and mental variables; cognitive impairment assessed by applying the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
RESULTS: We included 300 patients in the study (83.99 Â± 4.02 years old; 61.2%, women). Prevalence of cognitive impairment of 15.3%, which was associated with albumin level - odds ratio (OR): 0.082; p = 0.011 - and Barthel (OR: 0.962; p = 0.02) and Lawton (OR: 0.787; p = 0.025) index scores. Surgery was chosen in 24.7% of cases; TAVI in 63.3%; and conservative treatment in 12%. This decision was associated with the score on the Barthel (OR: 0.93; p = 0.012) and Lawton indices (OR: 0.678; p = 0.014), the Short Physical Performance Battery (OR: 0.75; p = 0.037) and the MMSE (OR: 0.691; p < 0.001). Mortality at one year was 14%, and higher in patients with MMSE scores <24 (23.5% vs. 12.8%; p = 0.094).
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment is a very common geriatric syndrome in older patients with severe aortic stenosis that is associated with functional disability in activities of daily living. Cognitive impairment has a high impact on decision-making and appears to be a variable associated with increased mortality.
