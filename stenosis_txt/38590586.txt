Title: Volume and Practice-Setting Shift of Laryngology Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Reg-ENT Database Analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic changed practice patterns throughout medicine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in the volume and location setting of laryngology procedures after the onset of COVID-19.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database cohort study.
SETTING: Reg-ENT registry.
METHODS: Retrospective review from 2017 to 2022 of patients who underwent a laryngology procedure identified by procedure code categorized by site of service code-"ambulatory surgical" versus "office" setting. Based on March 2020 as the cutoff point, the procedures were designated as pre-COVID versus COVID time period.
RESULTS: A total of 5989 patients underwent laryngology procedures. Forty-two percent more procedures were performed in the COVID period (n = 3780) versus pre-COVID (n = 2209). Pre-COVID, the procedure distribution between office and ambulatory surgical setting was 70% (n = 1546) compared with 30% (663). This shifted to 77% (n = 2920) and 23% (n = 860) during COVID, P = .9. The most common diagnoses associated with laryngology procedures during the study period were vocal fold paralysis 47% (n = 2831), dysphonia 33% (n = 1392), and laryngotracheal stenosis 14% (n = 838). These trends remained in both pre-COVID and COVID time periods. After the start of the pandemic, among patients undergoing laryngology procedures, there was a 93% increase (n = 284-549) in the diagnosis of laryngotracheal stenosis, 70% increase (n = 520-882 patients) in dysphonia and 69% increase (n = 1054-1777) in vocal fold paralysis.
CONCLUSION: An increase in laryngology procedures performed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was identified with an overall procedural shift to the office-setting.
