Title: Severe Aortic Regurgitation and Left Main Coronary Artery Ostial Stenosis in a 21-Year-Old Woman: What's Going On?

Abstract: • TA is a progressive, relapsing large-vessel vasculitis. • TA usually affects the aorta and its major branches. • TA can cause LMCA or ostial lesions in young adults. • Involvement of the aorta in TA can cause AR of varying degrees. • Surgical rather than percutaneous revascularization produces better results in TA.
