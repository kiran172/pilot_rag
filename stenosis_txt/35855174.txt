Title: Laminectomy triggers symptomatic growth of spinal schwannoma in a patient with schwannomatosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Schwannomatosis (SWN) is genetically similar to neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and represents a NF2 gene mutation. Previous studies have shown that these mutations in both neurons and Schwann cells can lead to the development of schwannomas after nerve crush injuries. Here, we reviewed the potential pathoanatomical mechanisms for the development of a trauma-induced spinal schwannomas in a 55-year-old male with SWN.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old male had originally undergone a L3-L5 lumbar laminectomy for stenosis; the schwannomas seen on the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were not resected. Now at age 55, he newly presented with low back pain and numbness in the left L5 dermatome, and he was diagnosed with an L4 vertebral level cauda equina tumor on MRI. Following gross-total resection, the histopathological assessment revealed a Ki-67 labeling index 5-10% in hotspots (i.e., slightly higher than the normal range of schwannomas) and a 20% mosaic loss of SMARCB1. Based on these criteria, he was diagnosed as having SWN.
CONCLUSION: In this patient with SWN, compression/physical trauma to nerves of the cauda equina during the L3-L5 laminectomy 6 years ago likely caused the progression of schwannoma.
