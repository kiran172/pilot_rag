Title: One-year clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of direct implantation of a self-expanding valve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present 1 year clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of the randomized DIRECT (Pre-dilatation in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Trial) trial.
BACKGROUND: Intermediate-term data from randomized studies investigating the safety and efficacy of direct implantation are lacking.
METHODS: DIRECT trial randomized 171 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis at four tertiary centers to undergo TAVI with the use of self-expanding prostheses with (pre-BAV) or without pre-dilatation (no-BAV). The primary endpoint was device success according to the VARC-2 criteria. All patients underwent a clinical and echocardiographic follow-up at 1 year. All-cause and cardiac mortality, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and new pacemaker implantation were recorded.
RESULTS: At 1 year, four deaths were recorded in pre-BAV group (4.7%) and three deaths in no-BAV group (3.5%). There was no difference in Kaplan-Meier plots between the two groups in all-cause mortality at 1 year (log-rank p = .72). Similarly, there was no difference in the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation between the two groups at 1 year (27/67-40.3% in no-BAV group versus 20/69-29% in pre-BAV group, log-rank p = .24). There was no significant difference between pre-BAV and no BAV group in aortic valve area (1.84 ± 0.39 cm2 vs. 1.85 ± 0.44 cm2 , p = .90), mean aortic valve gradient (8.36 ± 5.04 vs. 8.00 ± 4.04 mmHg, p = .65) and moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation (5-6.6 vs. 4-5.7%, respectively) at 1 year. The same applied independently from the performance of post-dilatation at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct, without pre-dilatation, implantation of a self-expanding valve has no impact on one-year clinical and echocardiographic outcomes, independently also from the baseline performance of post-dilatation.
