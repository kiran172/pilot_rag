Title: Multidisciplinary approach in resection of stage IIIA lung cancer with severe aortic stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Thoracic surgery in the context of complex multimorbidity and clinical deterioration presents a unique set of challenges when balancing risk and benefit. Advances in anaesthesia, surgical technique, and imaging, have allowed for operative options for patients that were once deemed too high-risk. An effective proactive multi-disciplinary approach is essential for successful outcomes. We report the case of a 65-year-old patient with a background of severe aortic stenosis who underwent lung resection for stage IIIA lung cancer, where pivotal multi-disciplinary team input from the anaesthetic, surgery, critical care and radiology teams, clarified the cause of his clinical deterioration, contributed to decisions over his management and ensured a good clinical outcome.
