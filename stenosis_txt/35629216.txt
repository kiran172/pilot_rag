Title: Application of Machine Learning Methods to Analyze Occurrence and Clinical Features of Ascending Aortic Dilatation in Patients with and without Bicuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: Aortic aneurysm (AA) rapture is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of AA is often verified after the onset of complications, in most cases after aortic rupture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of ascending aortic aneurysm (AscAA) and aortic dilatation (AD) in patients with cardiovascular diseases undergoing echocardiography, and to identify the main risk factors depending on the morphology of the aortic valve. We processed 84,851 echocardiographic (ECHO) records of 13,050 patients with aortic dilatation (AD) in the Almazov National Medical Research Centre from 2010 to 2018, using machine learning methodologies. Despite a high prevalence of AD, the main reason for the performed ECHO was coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension (HP) in 33.5% and 14.2% of the patient groups, respectively. The prevalence of ascending AD (>40 mm) was 15.4% (13,050 patients; 78.3% (10,212 patients) in men and 21.7% (2838 patients) in women). Only 1.6% (n = 212) of the 13,050 patients with AD knew about AD before undergoing ECHO in our center. Among all the patients who underwent ECHO, we identified 1544 (1.8%) with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and 635 with BAV had AD (only 4.8% of all AD patients). According to the results of the random forest feature importance analysis, we identified the eight main factors of AD: age, male sex, vmax aortic valve (AV), aortic stenosis (AS), blood pressure, aortic regurgitation (AR), diabetes mellitus, and heart failure (HF). The known factors of AD-like HP, CAD, hyperlipidemia, BAV, and obesity, were also AD risk factors, but were not as important. Our study showed a high frequency of AscAA and dilation. Standard risk factors of AscAA such as HP, hyperlipidemia, or obesity are significantly more common in patients with AD, but the main factors in the formation of AD are age, male sex, vmax AV, blood pressure, AS, AR, HF, and diabetes mellitus. In males with BAV, AD incidence did not differ significantly, but the presence of congenital heart disease was one of the 12 main risk factors for the formation of AD and association with more significant aortic dilatation in AscAA groups.
