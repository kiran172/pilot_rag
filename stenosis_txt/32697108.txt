Title: Congenital Nasal Pyriform Aperture Stenosis: Successful Management of Restenosis After Primary Surgery by Stent Placement.

Abstract: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) is a rare anomaly causing respiratory distress in newborns. While the primary surgical technique is well established, the timing of the removal of the stents and the management of restenosis remain a matter of debate. We report a case of a female newborn affected by CNPAS with the recurrence of respiratory distress after primary surgery due to the early removal of nasal stents, causing an overgrowth of granulation tissue. This report notes that restenosis was successfully managed by repeating the procedure over a 14-day period, with soft polyvinyl chloride uncuffed tracheal tubes acting as nasal stents.
