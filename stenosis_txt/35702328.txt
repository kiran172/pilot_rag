Title: Normalization of Flow in the Common Hepatic Artery after Decompression of Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome with Diminution of a Pancreatoduodenal Arcade Aneurysm.

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is caused by constriction of the celiac artery (CA) by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm. Ligament release improves perfusion of the CA, resulting in resolution of abdominal symptoms. A 51-year-old female had postprandial abdominal pain for 10 years and underwent computed tomography (CT) scan showing severe stenosis of the CA with pancreatoduodenal arcade aneurysm formation. MALS was diagnosed, and open median arcuate ligament incision was performed to decompress the CA. Intraoperative ultrasonography showed bidirectional turbulent flow in the common hepatic artery (CHA). The median arcuate ligament was uneventfully incised, and compression of the CA released. The perfusion in the CHA was changed to an antegrade direction, and the flow increased. Seven days after the laparotomy, the patient was discharged uneventfully. Follow-up CT scan 20 days after operation showed a diminished pancreatoduodenal arcade aneurysm and inferior pancreatoduodenal artery. Epigastric pain and postprandial distress symptoms were improved. In conclusion, perfusion of the CHA became normalized after median arcuate ligament release. Surgical intervention for MALS not only improved blood flow in the tributaries but also diminished the pancreatoduodenal arcade aneurysm.
