Title: Explant of a transcatheter valve-in-transcatheter valve with pericardial patch repair of the aortic root.

Abstract: Surgically explanting a failed transcatheter aortic valve can be challenging due to substantial neoendothelialization and may require concomitant and often unanticipated repairs of the aortic root and ascending aorta. We describe the explant of a failed transcatheter aortic valve-in-transcatheter aortic valve with surgical aortic valve replacement and pericardial patch repair of the aortic root. This case report illustrates that appropriate patient selection is essential for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, especially as transcatheter technology expands to lower-risk and younger patients.
