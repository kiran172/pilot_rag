Title: Preoperative blood circulation modification prior to pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with celiac trunk occlusion: Two case reports.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Celiac trunk stenosis or occlusion is a common condition observed in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). The risk of upper abdominal organ ischemia or failure increases if the blood circulation in the celiac arterial system is not maintained after the surgery.
CASE SUMMARY: We present two cases of elderly patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma and celiac trunk occlusion who underwent PD. We performed blood circulation modification preoperatively with transcatheter coil embolization of the arterial arcades of the pancreatic head via the superior mesenteric artery to develop collateral communication between the superior mesenteric artery and the common hepatic or splenic arteries to ensure arterial blood flow to the upper abdominal organs. The postoperative course was marked by delayed gastric emptying, but no major surgical complications, such as biliary or pancreatic fistula, or clinical, biochemical, or radiological evidence of ischemic disease, was observed.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative blood circulation modification may be a valid alternative procedure for elderly patients with celiac trunk occlusion who are ineligible for interventional or surgical revascularization.
