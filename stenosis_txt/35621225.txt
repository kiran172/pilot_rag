Title: Marital Status and Subclinical Coronary Atherosclerosis in Asymptomatic Individuals.

Abstract: Background Data are limited on the association between marital status and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. This study investigated the influence of marital status on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis detected by coronary computed tomographic angiography in an asymptomatic population. Methods and Results This retrospective study analyzed 9288 asymptomatic individuals (mean age, 53.7±8.0 years; 6041 [65%] men) with no history of coronary artery disease who voluntarily underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography during a general health examination. Marital categories were married (n=8481) versus unmarried (n=807), comprising never married (n=195), divorced (n=183), separated (n=119), and widowed (n=310) individuals. The degree and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis were evaluated by coronary computed tomographic angiography; ≥50% diameter stenosis was defined as significant. Logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses were used to determine the association between marital status and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, no significant differences were observed in the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of unmarried status for any coronary plaque (OR, 1.077; 95% CI, 0.899-1.291), calcified plaque (OR, 1.058; 95% CI, 0.881-1.271), noncalcified plaque (OR, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.691-1.351), mixed plaque (OR, 1.301; 95% CI, 0.884-1.917), and significant coronary artery stenosis (OR, 1.066; 95% CI, 0.771-1.474). Similarly, in the 2:1 propensity-score matched population (n=2398), no statistically significant differences were observed for the OR of marital status for any subclinical coronary atherosclerosis (P&gt;0.05 for all). Conclusions In this large cross-sectional study, marital status was not associated with an increased risk of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.
