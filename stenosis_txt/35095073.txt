Title: Short-Term Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Predominant Aortic Regurgitation with Left Ventricular Dysfunction.

Abstract: Patients with aortic stenosis and low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) would benefit from transcatheter aortic valve replacement. However, the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction remains unknown.We defined LVEF < 50% as left ventricular dysfunction. A total of 27 symptomatic patients with aortic regurgitation and ejection fraction < 50% underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the J-Valve™ system (JieCheng Medical Technology Co, Ltd, Suzhou, China) in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, from May 2014 to June 2019. Procedural and postoperative clinical outcomes were analyzed according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) criteria.All patients (eight females; 70.6 ± 7.1 years) were considered to be at least intermediate surgical risk and/or severe comorbidity precluding for surgical aortic valve replacement (logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation, 16.8 ± 9.5%, range 4.6% to 37.9%) by a multidisciplinary heart team. Transapical implantations were successful in 26 (96.3%) patients. All-cause mortality was 3.7% in the latest follow-up (25-590 days, median 369 days). Significant improvements in LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic, and systolic dimensions were observed after procedure (from 40.3 ± 6.7% to 50.8 ± 10.5%, P < 0.001; from 65.1 ± 8.9 mm to 56.0 ± 9.6 mm, P = 0.002; from 52.2 ± 9.8 mm to 35.9 ± 13.4 mm, P < 0.001, respectively). No patient had aortic stenosis and paravalvular leak more than moderate and heart function improvement was obtained in the majority of patients at 1-year follow-up.Transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the J-Valve™ system is a reasonable alternative for patients with aortic regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction regarding promising short-term outcomes.
