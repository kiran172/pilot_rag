Title: MRI Detection of Carotid Intraplaque Hemorrhage and Postintervention Cognition.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive improvement has been reported after carotid revascularization and attributed to treating stenosis and correcting hypoperfusion. This study investigated the effect of carotid intraplaque hemorrhage on postintervention cognition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, consecutive patients scheduled for carotid surgery were recruited for preoperative carotid MR imaging (MPRAGE) and pre- and postintervention cognitive testing using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Pre- and postintervention scores were compared using t tests and multivariable linear regression.
RESULTS: Twenty-three participants were included, with endarterectomy performed in 20 (87%) and angioplasty/stent placement, in 3 (13%). Overall, statistically significant improvements occurred in the pre- versus postintervention mean Total Scale score (92.1 [SD, 15.5] versus 96.1 [SD, 15.8], P = .04), immediate memory index (89.4 [SD, 18.2] versus 97.7 [SD, 14.9], P &lt; .001), and verbal index (96.1 [SD, 14.1] versus 103.0 [SD, 12.0], P = .002). Intraplaque hemorrhage (+) participants (n = 11) had no significant improvement in any category, and the attention index significantly decreased (99.4 [SD, 18.0] versus 93.5 [SD, 19.4], P = .045). Intraplaque hemorrhage (-) participants (n = 12) significantly improved in the Total Scale score (86.4 [SD, 11.8] versus 95.5 [SD, 12.4], P = .004), immediate memory index (82.3 [SD, 14.6] versus 96.2 [SD, 14.1], P = .002), delayed memory index (94.3 [SD, 14.9] versus 102.4 [SD, 8.0], P = .03), and verbal index (94.3 [SD, 13.2] versus 101.5 [SD, 107.4], P = .009). Postintervention minus preintervention scores for intraplaque hemorrhage (+) versus (-) groups showed statistically significant differences in the Total Scale score (-0.4 [SD, 6.8] versus 8.0 [SD, 8.5], P = .02), attention index (-5.9 [SD, 8.5] versus 4.3 [SD, 11.9], P = .03), and immediate memory index (4.2 [SD, 6.7] versus 12.2 [SD, 10.2], P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive improvement was observed after carotid intervention, and this was attributable to intraplaque hemorrhage (-) plaque. MR imaging detection of intraplaque hemorrhage status may be an important determinant of cognitive change after intervention.
