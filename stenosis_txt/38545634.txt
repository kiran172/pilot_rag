Title: Safety of Nebulized Ciprodex for Postoperative Management of Tracheal Resection.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Anastomotic complications after tracheal resection/cricotracheal resection (TR/CTR), such as granulation tissue formation, can lead to severe morbidity. The off-label use of nebulized ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone (Ciprodex) for granulation tissue prophylaxis has anecdotally been used after TR/CTR, especially in pediatric patients. However, its use in the adult population, and its safety and side effect profile post-TR/CTR has not been reported. This study aims to characterize the incidence of adverse side effects associated with nebulized Ciprodex in post-TR/CTR patients.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent TR/CTR from June 2015 to July 2023 was performed. The use of nebulized Ciprodex (1 mL ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone 0.3%-0.1% otic suspension in 4 mL normal saline) while inpatient was evaluated. Potential side effects were defined as oral thrush, ageusia, arthralgia, and allergic reaction, and were recorded for all patients.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients underwent TR/CTR from June 2015 to July 2023. Of these, 53 (72.6%) had documented Ciprodex administration during their postoperative course. One (1.9%) patient reported at least one side effect, including one instance of skin rash (1.9%) and one instance of allergic reaction (1.9%). There were no other side effects attributed to Ciprodex use.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of side effects related to the use of nebulized Ciprodex is felt to be minimal in post-TR/CTR. Although Ciprodex may have the potential to treat granulation tissue in the airway, further studies are needed to verify its efficacy and safety.
