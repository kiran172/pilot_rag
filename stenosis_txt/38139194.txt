Title: Osteobiologies for Spinal Fusion from Biological Mechanisms to Clinical Applications: A Narrative Review.

Abstract: Degenerative lumbar spinal disease (DLSD), including spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis, is increasing due to the aging population. Along with the disease severity, lumbar interbody fusion (LIF) is a mainstay of surgical treatment through decompression, the restoration of intervertebral heights, and the stabilization of motion segments. Currently, pseudoarthrosis after LIF is an important and unsolved issue, which is closely related to osteobiologies. Of the many signaling pathways, the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway contributes to osteoblast differentiation, which is generally regulated by SMAD proteins as common in the TGF-β superfamily. BMP-2 and -4 are also inter-connected with Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and FGF signaling pathways. With the potent potential for osteoinduction in BMP-2 and -4, the combination of allogenous bone and recombinant human BMPs (rhBMPs) is currently an ideal fusion material, which has equalized or improved fusion rates compared to traditional materials. However, safety issues in the dosage of BMP remain, so overcoming current limitations will provide significant advancement in spine surgery. In the future, translational research and the application of clinical study will be important to overcome the current limitations of spinal surgery.
