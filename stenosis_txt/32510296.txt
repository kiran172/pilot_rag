Title: Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament in Cervical Spine Cases Trends in Surgical Treatments and Outcomes in the US from 2005 to 2013.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is characterized by ectopic bone formation within the ligament and can elicit cervical spinal canal stenosis. Surgical treatment for OPLL is debated in the literature. This study examined nationwide data to estimate the prevalence of cervical OPLL (C-OPLL) and investigated trends in surgical treatment and outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted of the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for patients with a diagnosis code for C-OPLL (ICD-9-CM 723.7) from 2005 to 2013. NIS supplied hospital- and yearadjusted weights allowed for accurate assessment of prevalence. Descriptive statistics assessed patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical factors, and complications. Trends were analyzed using chi-squared, ANOVA, and independent sample t-tests.
RESULTS: A total of 4,601 C-OPLL discharges were identified (56.7 years, 43% female). The prevalence of C-OPLL has increased from 0.7/100,000 in 2005 to 2.1/100,000 in 2013. Among hospitalized C-OPLL patients, 89.1% underwent surgery, with 62.1% undergoing an anterior-only (A) approach, 21.5% posterior-only (P), and 16.4% combined (AP). Rates of anterior- and decompression-only surgeries have declined since 2005, from 67.5% to 44.4% and 21.6% to 14.8%, respectively (p < 0.001 for both). Corpectomy rates have dramatically increased, from 3.6% to 27.2% (p < 0.001). Overall complication rates have increased 2.5% since 2005 (p < 0.001) with higher rates of dysphagia (0.7%) and dural tears (5.6%) associated with A-only surgeries (p < 0.001 for both). The overall mortality rate was 0.8%, with P surgery associated with the highest rate, 1.6% (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of hospitalization for C-OPLL has increased over the last decade as have morbidity rates for C-OPLL discharges. Anterior-only surgeries were associated with higher complication rates. Surgical rates have remained constantsince 2005, butrates of anterior-only and decompression-only procedures have decreased in favor of posterior-only and combined-approach surgeries.
