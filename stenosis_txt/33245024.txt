Title: Effect of calculated plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma on carotid artery blood flow velocities.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity is a measure of the severity of the carotid artery stenosis caused by atherosclerosis. Carotid artery stenosis is progressive and is of great importance due to the risk of stroke it creates. As an alternative to radiological examinations in these patients, patient follow-up can be facilitated by associating novel laboratory parameters with the severity of stenosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the calculated plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma on carotid artery blood flow velocities in patients with carotid artery stenosis.
METHODS: A total of 161 patients diagnosed with carotid artery stenosis who admitted to our clinic between May 2018 and May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the carotid artery blood flow velocities measured with the Doppler ultrasonography, the patients were divided into two groups as "Normal flow velocity group" (n = 62) and "Increased flow velocity group" (n = 99).
RESULTS: The calculated plasma osmolality, atherogenic index of plasma, and mean platelet volume were significantly associated with increased carotid artery blood flow velocity (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.006; respectively). Calculated plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma were identified as independent predictors of increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001; respectively). In the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, the plasma osmolality cut-off value, which predicts the increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity was found to be 291.45 mOsm/kg (Area Under the Curve: 0.746, p &lt; 0.001, 65.7% sensitivity, and 67.7% specificity), and atherogenic index of plasma cut-off value was 0.20 (Area Under the Curve: 0.735, p &lt; 0.001, 65.7% sensitivity, and 66.1% specificity).
CONCLUSION: There was a significant relationship between the increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity and the increase in plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma values. As a result, we can predict the increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity, that is, the increase in the severity of the carotid artery stenosis, with plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma values that can be calculated simply from routine biochemical tests.
