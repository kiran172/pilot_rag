Title: Highly compressed SENSE accelerated relaxation-enhanced angiography without contrast and triggering (REACT) for fast non-contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography of the neck: Clinical evaluation in patients with acute ischemic stroke at 3 tesla.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Long acquisition times limit the feasibility of established non-contrast-enhanced MRA (non-CE-MRA) techniques. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a highly accelerated flow-independent sequence (Relaxation-Enhanced Angiography without Contrast and Triggering [REACT]) for imaging of the extracranial arteries in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compressed SENSE (CS) accelerated (factor 7) 3D isotropic REACT (fixed scan time: 01:22 min, reconstructed voxel size 0.625 × 0.625 × 0.75 mm3) and CE-MRA (CS factor 6, scan time: 1:08 min, reconstructed voxel size 0.5 mm3) were acquired in 76 AIS patients (69.4 ± 14.3 years, 33 females) at 3 Tesla. Two radiologists assessed scans for the presence of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and stated their diagnostic confidence using a 5-point scale (5 = excellent). Vessel quality of cervical arteries as well as the impact of artifacts and image noise were scored on 5-point scales (5 = excellent/none). Apparent signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios (aSNR/aCNR) were measured for the common carotid artery (CCA) and ICA (C1-segment).
RESULTS: REACT provided a sensitivity of 88.5% and specificity of 100% for clinically relevant (≥50%) ICA stenosis with substantial concordance to CE-MRA regarding stenosis grading (Cohen's kappa 0.778) and similar diagnostic confidence (REACT: mean 4.5 ± 0.4 vs. CE-MRA: 4.5 ± 0.6; P = 0.674). Presence of artifacts (3.6 ± 0.5 vs. 3.5 ± 0.7; P = 0.985) and vessel quality (all segments: 3.6 ± 0.7 vs. 3.8 ± 0.7; P = 0.004) were comparable between both techniques with REACT showing higher scores at the CCA (4.3 ± 0.6 vs. 3.8 ± 0.9; P < 0.001) and CE-MRA at V2- (3.3 ± 0.5 vs. 3.9 ± 0.8; P < 0.001) and V3-segments (3.3 ± 0.5 vs. 4.0 ± 0.8; P < 0.001). For all vessels, REACT showed a lower impact of image noise (3.8 ± 0.6 vs. 3.6 ± 0.7; P = 0.024) while yielding higher aSNR (52.5 ± 15.1 vs. 37.9 ± 12.5; P < 0.001) and aCNR (49.4 ± 15.0 vs. 34.7 ± 12.3; P < 0.001) for all vessels combined.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, highly accelerated REACT provides an accurate detection of ICA stenosis with vessel quality and scan time comparable to CE-MRA.
