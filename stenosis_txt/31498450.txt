Title: Perioperative outcomes after tracheoplasty: A NSQIP analysis 2014-2016.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Tracheoplasty or tracheal resection and are essential components of the care of patients with severe tracheal stenosis. We aimed to study the perioperative outcomes of patients after tracheoplasty or resection using a national surgical registry.
METHODS: We analyzed the 2014 to 2016 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) participant use file for patients who underwent tracheal resection or tracheoplasty (CPT codes 31750, 31760, 31780, and 31781). We analyzed the perioperative outcomes including length of stay (LOS), dehiscence, unplanned reintubations, unplanned surgeries, and 30-day readmission rates. A random 4:1 sample of non-tracheoplasty patients served as the control group.
RESULTS: From 2014 to 2016, 126 patients underwent tracheoplasty. The median age was 56 years (IQR = 45-63). There were 93 (74%) females, 88 (70%) white, and 3.2% (4/126) Hispanic. The median LOS was 7 days (IQR = 5-10 days). Of these, 4.8% (6/126) developed wound infections and 3/126 (2.4%) developed wound dehiscence. Five out of 126 required unplanned reintubation (4.0%) and 16/126 (13%) had an unplanned reoperation. The 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 16% (20/126). The wound infection, unplanned intubations, and readmission rates were significantly higher (P < .005) than the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day perioperative outcomes of adult patients undergoing tracheoplasty showed that adverse events are common, but severe adverse events such as death are rare. Continued research into risk mitigation among these patients is warranted.
