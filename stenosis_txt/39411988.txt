Title: Pretibial hematoma as a cause of significant health issue in an elderly traveler.

Abstract: This paper presents a case of a 77-year-old patient diagnosed with type 2 cardio-renal syndrome, who has undergone a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation surgery due to aortic stenosis associated with permanent atrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes. This patient, despite their multi-morbidity, undertook family travels to Egypt. Despite disease symptoms and plethora of medication, the patient did not seek medical advice on preventative measures or potential health risks prior to the departure. During the stay in Egypt, the patient sustained a lower limb injury, which resulted in pretibial hematoma requiring a 2-week stay in a local hospital. The patient's condition was systematically deteriorating and after returning to Poland a continued multi-specialist treatment in the field of surgery, nephrology and cardiology was required. The medical history of the described patient and the severity of heart failure and chronic kidney disease were clear contraindications to long-distance travels. Despite those risks, the patient did not seek pre-travel medical advice from specialists and did not undertake any preventative measures. As a result of an accident during travel, an elderly patient with multiple diseases suffered serious health complications that significantly and permanently worsened his general health condition. Due to the aging population and the increasing amounts of elderly patients traveling internationally, proper preparation of seniors before departure is one of the key aspects of modern travel medicine.
