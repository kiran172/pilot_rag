Title: Endovascular intervention with a low-profile visualized intraluminal support stent for ruptured, very small, wide-necked, intracranial aneurysms.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patients treated for ruptured, very small, wide-necked aneurysms using low-profile visualised intraluminal support alone or with stent-assisted coiling.
METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery，First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, China, and comprised data of patients who presented with ruptured, very small, intracranial aneurysms between March 2015 and May 2019 who were treated using low-profile visualised intraluminal support alone or with stent-assisted coiling. Outcomes from radiology and clinical assessments were obtained related to the time the patients were discharged and their subsequent mid-term examination.
RESULTS: Of the 10 patients, 6(60%) were males and 4(40%) were females. The overall mean age was 47.70±10.22 years (range: 23-62 years). In the sample, 7(70%) patients experienced total occlusion and 3(30%) had nearly complete occlusion. All the 10(100%) patients had uneventful recoveries. Progressive thrombosis to complete occlusion occurred in 3(30%) aneurysms that had initially presented with Raymond grade II. There was no case of stenosis or occlusion.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of ruptured, very small, wide-necked intracranial aneurysms with stent-assisted coiling and lowprofile visualised intraluminal support provided superior technical outcomes.
