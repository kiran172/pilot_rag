Title: En Block Rotation of the Outflow Tracts: Intermediate Follow-up After 15 Years of Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The en bloc rotation of the outflow tracts is a surgical option for anatomic repair of transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with preserved growth potential in all tubular structures and the option for keeping the native pulmonary valve. The aim of this study was to analyze our 15-year experience with this operation.
METHODS: A retrospective single-center study including 27 consecutive patients, who underwent the en bloc rotation between 2003 and 2019, was performed. Median age at operation was 103 days (interquartile range [IQR], 17-117 days), and median body weight was 5.2 kg (IQR, 3.66-8.4 kg). Six patients had undergone 1 to 4 previous operations. In 18 patients (66.7%), the pulmonary valve could be preserved, and in 9 patients (33.3%) a transannular patch was performed. Median follow-up was 5.7 years (IQR, 1.6-9.0 years).
RESULTS: One patient died of chronic left ventricular failure during the hospital stay. Two more died after discharge: 1 of aspiration after a cerebral hemorrhage and 1 of sudden death. Five other patients required reoperations or had reinterventions: 1 ventricular septal defect closure, 1 aortic valve repair, 1 patch plasty, 2 dilatations of supravalvular pulmonary stenosis, and 1 stent into a left pulmonary artery. During the follow-up period, no gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract was found, and postoperative growth of the pulmonary valve was shown.
CONCLUSIONS: The en bloc rotation allows an anatomic correction of the complex transposition with growth potential in all tubular structures. Reoperations or reinterventions on the pulmonary valve or on the left ventricular outflow tract have not been necessary to date.
