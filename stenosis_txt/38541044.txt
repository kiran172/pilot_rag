Title: Personalized Approach in Transcatheter Palliation of Congenital Heart Disease with Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Circulation: Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Stenting vs. Arterial Duct Stenting.

Abstract: Despite significant improvements in techniques, the treatment of neonates and infants with congenital heart disease resulting in duct-dependent pulmonary circulation is still significantly challenging. Despite current trends toward early primary surgical repair, temporary palliation is still necessary in those patients who are at high surgical risk for complete correction due to unfavorable clinical or anatomic characteristics. Recent advances in interventional cardiology have led to the emergence of right ventricular outflow tract and arterial duct stenting as cost-effective alternatives to surgical palliation in high-risk surgical candidates or whenever short-term pulmonary blood flow support is anticipated. This review aims to explore the evolving landscape of these transcatheter approaches, highlighting their role, efficacy and potential complications in the context of duct-dependent pulmonary circulation anatomies.
