Title: Chronic tophaceous gout causing lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: Gout is a common cause of inflammatory arthritis, typically affecting the joints of the appendicular skeleton. In this report, we present the relatively less common scenario of chronic tophaceous gout affecting the lumbar spine and pelvis, complicated by compressive neuropathy, and notable for its advanced initial presentation in a young patient. We review the pathophysiology underlying gout and discuss its clinical and laboratory presentation. We also use our case as an example to present the radiographic, CT, and MR imaging features of gout affecting the lumbar spine, which can often present a diagnostic dilemma. Finally, we discuss therapeutic options for gout resulting in spinal canal compromise, which include interventions not commonly performed for gout elsewhere in the body.
