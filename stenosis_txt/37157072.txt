Title: [Clinical Effect of Surgical Reconstruction of Extracranial Vertebral Artery].

Abstract: Objective To evaluate the effect of surgical reconstruction of extracranial vertebral artery and to summarize the experience. Methods The clinical data of 15 patients undergoing surgical reconstruction of extracranial vertebral artery from September 2018 to June 2022 were collected.The operation methods,operation duration,intraoperative blood loss,operation complications,and relief of symptoms were retrospectively analyzed. Results Eleven patients underwent vertebral artery (V1 segment) to common carotid artery transposition,two patients underwent endarterectomy of V1 segment,two patients underwent V3 segment to external carotid artery bypass or transposition.The operation duration,intraoperative blood loss,and blocking time of common carotid artery varied within 120-340 min,50-300 ml,and 12-25 min,with the medians of 240 min,100 ml,and 16 min,respectively.There was no cardiac accident,cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome,cerebral hemorrhage or lymphatic leakage during the perioperative period.One patient suffered from cerebral infarction and three patients suffered from incomplete Horner's syndrome after the operation.During the follow-up (4-45 months,median of 26 months),there was no anastomotic stenosis,new cerebral infarction or cerebral ischemia. Conclusion Surgical reconstruction of extracranial vertebral artery is safe and effective,and individualized reconstruction strategy should be adopted according to different conditions.
