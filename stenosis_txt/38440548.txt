Title: Management of Paediatric Airway in Post-intubation Subglottic Stenosis Associated with Japanese Encephalitis.

Abstract: Subglottic stenosis is narrowing of the area in between the vocal cords and the cricoid cartilage. It can cause respiratory problems which can be mild to severe. Study the management of paediatric airway in post-intubation subglottic stenosis associated with Japanese encephalitis. Case Setting and Design: Retrospective study of 18 patients presenting with encephalitis out of which 6 cases were of post-intubation subglottic stenosis associated with Japanese encephalitis between the study period of one year (September 2017-September 2018) in the, Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute Of Health And Medical Sciences, Shillong, Meghalaya, India. Fifteen patients were treated in the study period. Different approaches were used. Post-intubation subglottic stenosis depends on the duration of intubation and the quality of life post-tracheostomy depends on the type of tube used. Bronchoscopic assisted procedures during the tracheostomy or after an interval helps to decrease the morbidity. Management of paediatric airway in post-intubation subglottic stenosis associated with Japanese encephalitis needs proper strategy and dedicated and intensive post-operative care. BivonaÂ® silicone tracheostomy tube is a better option.
