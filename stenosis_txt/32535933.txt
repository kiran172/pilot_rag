Title: Stenotic double-orifice mitral valve after surgical repaired partial atrioventricular septal defect.

Abstract: Double-orifice mitral valve (DOMV) is an uncommon congenital anomaly account for 1% of congenital heart disease. However, accurate diagnosis and evaluation of valve stenosis or regurgitation and other concomitant congenital anomalies due to DOMV are required to obtain suitable treatment. Two- and three-dimensional echocardiography can contribute valuable functional and anatomic information that can support to reach this goal. Here, we present a case of complete bridge-type DOMV that causes mitral stenosis after surgical repair of the partial atrioventricular septal defect in childhood.
