Title: Comparison Between the Superior Pedicle Retro Auricular Flap and the Masson's Revolving Door Flap for Coverage of Conchal Defects.

Abstract: Post operative defect of the external ear result mainly from the resection of skin cancers of this region, hence the need for an adequate plasty to avoid any stenosis or deformation, this article compares 2 retroauricular flap covering techniques through 2 cases of patients with conchal basal cell carcinoma the first one was a 65 years old male patient who had for 2 years a basal cell carcinoma of the postero-superior part of the concha of the right ear, a total removal of the tumor was made with a successful covering of the substance loss by a retroauricular flap with superior pedicle. The second patient was a 66 years old female who has for 3 years a basal cell carcinoma of the inferior part of the concha of the right ear, a successful removal of the tumor was and the covering of the substance loss by a Masson's retroauricular revolving door flap. We discuss the different operating times as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, to finally conclude that the retro auricular flap is an excellent technique to cover the postoperative loss of substance of the superior part whereas the Masson's revolving door flap is more adapted for the posterior lesions of the concha.
