Title: Successful Retrieval of a Fractured and Detached Crown From a Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System.

Abstract: We report a rare case of crown fracture and detachment from a coronary orbital atherectomy system. During orbital atherectomy in an angulated and calcified coronary vessel, the crown was completely detached and left distal to the stenosis. It was successfully retrieved using a gooseneck snare and a guide-extension catheter. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
