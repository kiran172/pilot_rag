Title: Postoperative myocardial fibrosis assessment in aortic valvular heart diseases-a cardiovascular magnetic resonance study.

Abstract: AIMS: Left ventricular remodelling occurs during the chronic course of aortic regurgitation (AR) and aortic stenosis (AS), leading to myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis. Several studies have shown that extracellular volume fraction (ECV) and indexed extracellular volume (iECV) are important surrogate markers of diffuse myocardial fibrosis (MF). Postoperative data on these cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) extracellular expansion parameters for either AS or AR are scarce. This study aimed to demonstrate the postoperative changes that occur in diffuse MF, and the influence of preoperative MF on the reversal of LV remodelling, in patients with AR or AS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe AR or AS and indications for surgery were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent pre- and postoperative CMR, and ECV and iECV were quantified. Data from 99 patients were analysed (32 with AR and 67 with AS). After surgery, the left ventricle mass index decreased in both groups (AR: 110 vs. 91 g/m2; AS: 86 vs. 68 g/m2, both P < 0.001). The late gadolinium enhancement fraction (AR: preoperative 1.9% vs. postoperative 1.7%, P = 0.575; AS: preoperative 2.4% vs. postoperative 2.4%, P = 0.615) and late gadolinium enhancement mass (AR: preoperative 3.8 g vs. postoperative 2.5 g, P = 0.635; AS: preoperative 3.4 g vs. postoperative 3.5 g, P = 0.575) remained stable in both groups. Preoperative iECV and ECV were greater in the AR group (iECV: 30 mL/m2 vs. 22 mL/m2, P = 0.001; ECV: 28.4% vs. 27.2%, P = 0.048). Indexed extracellular volume decreased after surgery in both groups (AR: 30-26.5 mL/m2, AS: 22-18.2 mL/m2, both P < 0.001); it was still greater in the AR group (AR: 26.5 mL/m2 vs. AS: 18.2 mL/m2, P < 0.001). Postoperative ECV remained stable in the AR group (preoperative 28.4% vs. postoperative 29.9%; P = 0.617) and increased in the AS group (preoperative 27.2% vs. postoperative 28.6%; P = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Patients with both AR or AS presented reduction in iECV after surgery, unfolding the reversible nature of diffuse MF. In contrast to patients with AS, those with AR developed postoperative iECV regression with stable ECV, suggesting a balanced reduction in both intracellular and extracellular myocardial components.
