Title: [Treatment of tandem occlusions of the common and internal carotid arteries].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Proximal carotid tandem lesions are defined as multilevel lesions with significant (> 50%) atherosclerotic disease involving the internal carotid artery (ICA) in combination with the proximal ipsilateral common carotid artery (CCA) or innominate artery (IA). It is a relatively rare disease with an incidence of less than 5% in all patients with carotid stenosis at the level of the bifurcation.
METHODS: These patients are at high surgical risk and were, therefore, excluded from current randomized controlled trials. Although the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS) in stroke prevention for patients is established, the optimal treatment approach for the subgroup of patients with a proximal tandem lesion is still controversial. Treatment of this condition is not well understood because it is difficult to determine the risk of each individual lesion becoming symptomatic. Therefore, concurrent treatment of severe (> 70% stenosis) proximal lesions is recommended when treating severe stenosis at the carotid bifurcation.
CONCLUSION: This disease can lead to embolic ischemic strokes or hemodynamic compromise. It is not possible to determine diagnostically which lesion led to the clinical symptoms, which is why both lesions should be corrected.
