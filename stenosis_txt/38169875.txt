Title: Calciphylaxis, beware the ophthalmic mimic: A case series.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We present two atypical cases of calciphylaxis presenting with ocular ischemic pathology - both without the hallmark cutaneous manifestations - to raise awareness of this rare yet highly disabling condition.
OBSERVATIONS: We report two cases of ophthalmic calciphylaxis presenting as (1) anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) and cilioretinal artery occlusion in a 76-year-old woman with pre-dialysis kidney failure, and (2) AION with contralateral central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) in a 44-year-old man on hemodialysis.
CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE: These cases highlight the need for judicious clinical suspicion of calciphylaxis in patients with kidney failure, presenting with microvascular ischemic ophthalmic pathology such as AION or CRAO. Confirmation with temporal artery biopsy is essential to direct targeted individualized multi-disciplinary treatment of calciphylaxis and avoid unnecessary steroid exposure in cases masquerading as giant cell arteritis (GCA).
