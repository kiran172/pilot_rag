Title: Ultrasound-guided nitinol stent implantation in treatment of early recurrent stenosis of arteriovenous fistula.

Abstract: To investigate the feasibility, methods and efficacy of ultrasound-guided nitinol stent implantation for the treatment of early recurrent stenosis of arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Thirty patients with early recurrent stenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) who received ultrasound-guided nitinol stent implantation in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University from April 2018 to July 2020 were followed up. The imaging features of the procedure and the interventional devices were observed under ultrasonography. The technical success rate and the clinical success rate as well as the incidence of complication were assessed. The post-interventional primary patency rates of access circuit, primary patency rates of target lesion and secondary patency rates were estimated. Ultrasonography was able to demonstrate the operation process and the interventional devices clearly. The technical and clinical success rates were both 100.0%. Eight patients had in-stent restenosis, which were treated by PTA. The post-interventional primary patency rates of the access circuit after 3, 6, 9 and were 91.3%, 86.2%, 86.2% and 64.2%, respectively; the post-interventional primary patency rates of target lesion were 100.0%, 100.0%, 86.4% and 69.3%, respectively; the post-interventional secondary patency rates were 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 94.4%, respectively. Compared with previous PTA in these cases, stent implantation had a higher post-interventional primary patency rates of target lesion and a lower cost-effectiveness (both <0.05). No other complications such as vascular rupture, pseudohemangioma, stent infection, stent displacement and stent exposure were observed during the follow-up. Ultrasonography can accurately guide the nitinol stent implantation in AVF, and the technique is feasible in treatment for the early recurrent stenosis after PTA with good short- and medium-term efficacy.
