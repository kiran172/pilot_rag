Title: Interventional therapies for chronic heart failure: An overview of recent developments.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF), the final manifestation of most cardiovascular diseases, has become a major global health concern, affecting millions of individuals. Despite basic drug treatments, patients present with high morbidity and mortality rates. However, recent advancements in interventional therapy have shown promising results in improving the prognosis of patients with HF. These advancements include transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis, transcatheter mitral valve repair for chronic mitral regurgitation, neuromodulation therapy for multiple targets and measures in the treatment of chronic HF and left ventricular assist device implantation for advanced HF (Figure 1). In this review, we aimed to provide an overview of the current progress in interventional therapies for chronic HF.
