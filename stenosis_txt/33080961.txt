Title: Effect of Evolocumab on Vulnerable Coronary Plaques: A Serial Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography Study.

Abstract: This study investigated the effects of evolocumab on vulnerable coronary plaques and factors associated with the change in stability and size of plaques in patients taking statins. Vulnerable coronary plaques were defined using coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography as having a density of &lt;50 HU within the region of interest and a remodeling index ≥1.1. The changes in minimum CT density, remodeling index, and percent stenosis of vulnerable coronary plaques after six months of evolocumab administration were retrospectively analyzed in 136 vulnerable coronary plaques from 98 patients (68 men and 30 women; mean age: 72.9 ± 8.7 years) treated with a statin. The administration of evolocumab significantly increased the minimum CT density (39.1 ± 8.1 HU to 84.9 ± 31.4 HU, p &lt; 0.001), reduced the remodeling index (1.29 ± 0.11 to 1.19 ± 0.10, p &lt; 0.001), and decreased the percent stenosis (27.0 ± 10.4% to 21.2 ± 9.8%, p &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that baseline percent stenosis (standard coefficient (β) = -0.391, p = 0.002) independently correlated with the change in minimum CT density, whereas the baseline remodeling index (β = -0.368, p &lt; 0.001) independently correlated with a change in the remodeling index. Evolocumab stabilized vulnerable coronary plaques and reduced their size. These results suggest that evolocumab protects against coronary artery disease progression in patients taking statins.
