Title: The pivotal role of neutrophil extracellular traps in cardiovascular diseases: Mechanisms and therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) continue to pose a significant burden on global health, prominently contributing to morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Recent years have witnessed an increasing recognition of the intricate involvement of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the pathology of diverse cardiovascular conditions. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted functions of NETs in cardiovascular diseases, shedding light on the impact on atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, myocarditis, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and the potential therapeutic avenues targeting NETs.
