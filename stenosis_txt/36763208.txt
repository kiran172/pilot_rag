Title: Non-invasive evaluation of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure using the left atrial expansion index in mitral valve stenosis, prosthesis and repair.

Abstract: Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) non-invasive evaluation is limited in patients with mitral valve (MV) stenosis, prosthesis, and surgical repair. This study aimed to assess the left atrial expansion index (LAEI) measured through transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as a novel parameter for estimating PCWP in these challenging cardiac conditions. We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study, including chronic cardiac patients receiving within 24 h a clinically indicated right heart catheterization (RHC) and transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) exam. PCWP measured during RHC was used as the reference. TTE measurements were performed offline, blinded to RHC results. LAEI was calculated as LAEI = [(LAmaxVolume-LAminVolume)/LAminVolume] × 100. We included 167 patients (age = 73 ± 11.5 years; PCWP = 18 ± 7.7 mmHg) with rheumatic mitral valve (MV) stenosis (16.2%), degenerative MV stenosis (51.2%), MV prosthesis (18.0%), and MV surgical repair (13.8%). LAEI correlated logarithmically with PCWP, and the log-transformed LAEI (lnLAEI) showed a good linear association with PCWP (r = - 0.616; p < 0.001). lnLAEI was an independent PCWP determinant, providing added predictive value over conventional clinical (age, atrial fibrillation, heart rate, MV subgroups) and echocardiographic variables (LVEF, MV effective orifice area, MV mean gradient, net atrioventricular compliance, and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure). lnLAEI identified PCWP > 12 mmHg with AUC = 0.870, p < 0.001; and PCWP > 15 mmHg with AUC = 0.797, p < 0.001, with an optimal cut-off of lnLAEI < 3.69. The derived equation PCWP = 36.8-5.5xlnLAEI estimated the invasively measured PCWP ± 6.1 mmHg. In this cohort of patients with MV stenosis, prosthesis, and surgical repair, lnLAEI resulted in a helpful echocardiographic parameter for PCWP estimation.
