Title: Gastric pneumatosis and concurrent aeroportia due to gastric outlet obstruction: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Gastric pneumatosis with concurrent hepatic portal vein gas is an extremely rare condition in the adult population. It can be idiopathic or associated with well-known etiologies. Gastric outlet obstruction can progressively inflate the stomach and cause pneumatosis. Regarding abdominal signs and the presence of acute abdomen, management varies from just conservative to emergent surgical interventions.
CASE PRESENTATION: We introduce an adult patient who presented to our hospital with weakness and dyspnea. After initial measures, unexpectedly we found intraabdominal free gas, concurrent gastric pneumatosis, and aeroportia. Due to the absence of positive abdominal signs, the patient was treated successfully without any surgical or endoscopic interventions.
DISCUSSION: Gastric outlet obstruction is a well-known cause of gastric pneumatosis. Progressive dilation of the stomach due to pyloric stenosis is well-described both in infants and adult populations.
CONCLUSION: In stable patients, gastric drainage and correction of electrolyte disturbance are the only required treatment. However endoscopic and surgical interventions should be considered in unstable patients or those developing acute abdomen.
