Title: Chronic kidney disease and transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Patients with aortic stenosis have a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is generally associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and readmission for heart failure; this supports the concept of a cardio-renal syndrome (CRS). CRS encompasses a spectrum of disorders of the heart and kidneys, wherein dysfunction in one organ may cause dysfunction in the other. TAVI treatment is expected to break this malignant cycle of CRS and improve cardio-renal function after the procedure. However, several reports demonstrate that patients with CKD have been associated with poor outcomes after the procedure. In addition, TAVI treatments for patients with advanced CKD and those with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis are considered more challenging. Adequate management to preserve cardio-renal function in patients undergoing TAVI may reduce the risk of cardio-renal adverse events and improve the long-term prognosis. The current comprehensive review article aims to assess the prognostic impact of CKD after TAVI and seek optimal care in patients with CKD even after successful TAVI.
