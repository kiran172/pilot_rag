Title: Does chest shape influence exercise stress echocardiographic results in patients with suspected coronary artery disease?

Abstract: Despite the good specificity of exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD), false positive (FP) results may occur. We have previously reported that chest abnormalities may affect parameters of cardiac contractility. The influence of chest shape on ESE results has never been previously investigated. We retrospectively analyzed 160 consecutive patients (64.4 ± 13.0-year old, 91 women) who had undergone coronary angiography at our Institution because of positive ESE, between June 2014 and May 2020. Modified Haller index (MHI; chest transverse diameter over the distance between sternum and spine) was assessed in all patients. Obstructive CAD was diagnosed by ≥ 70% stenosis in any epicardial coronary artery. Outcome was false-positivity at ESE. 80.6% of patients were diagnosed with obstructive CAD, while 19.4% had no CAD (FP). We separately analyzed patients with normal chest shape (MHI ≤ 2.5) and those with concave-shaped chest wall (MHI > 2.5). These latter were mostly women with small cardiac chambers, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and exercise-induced ST-segment changes. Likelihood of false-positivity was significantly higher in subjects with MHI > 2.5 than those with MHI ≤ 2.5 (30.7% vs 9.4%, p = 0.001). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, MHI > 2.5 (OR 4.04, 95%CI 1.45-11.2, p = 0.007), MVP (OR 3.47, 95%CI 1.32-9-12, p = 0.01) and dyssynergy in the left circumflex territory (OR = 3.35, 95%CI 1.26-8.93, p = 0.01) were independently associated with false-positivity. Concave-shaped chest wall (MHI > 2.5) may be associated with false-positive stress echocardiographic result. Mechanisms underpinning this finding need to be further explored.
