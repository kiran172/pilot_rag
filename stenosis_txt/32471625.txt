Title: Imaging diagnosis of aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the commonest primary valve disorder with increasing prevalence with age. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram is the main imaging technique used to diagnose AS, but discrepancy in diagnosis has been described in almost one third of cases. Other imaging methods, particularly electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography, have now emerged to further clarify the diagnosis of AS by both demonstrating the degree of calcification in the valve as well as aortic valve area. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging allows accurate quantification of ventricular function and evaluation of the myocardium. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the diagnosis of AS for the radiologist.
