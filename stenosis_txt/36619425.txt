Title: Predictive factors of difficult biliary cannulation: An experience of a tunisian tertiary center.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Selective biliary cannulation is a prerequisite for a successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). However, conventional biliary access can be difficult. The aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of difficult biliary cannulation (DBC) and its associated factors and to describe the efficiency and safety of used standard and advanced cannulation techniques.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study including all patients with na√Øve papilla who had an ERCP procedure in Gastroenterology department of Mohamed Taher Maamouri Hospital from June 2019 to December 2021. Efficiency was defined as successful selective deep biliary cannulation. DBC was defined based on the presence of one or more of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) criteria (5-5-1): more than five cannulation attempts, more than 5 min before cannulation and more than one accidental passage in the wirsung. Prevalence was measured using ESGE 5-5-1 cutoffs and chinese set cutoffs 15-10-2. Predictors of DBC were sought by univariate and multivariate analysis (SPSS software, p significant if < 0.05).
RESULTS: We included 664 patients (mean age 62 years and sex ratio M/W = 0.8). Main indication for ERCP was choledocholithiasis (67%, n = 442) followed by malignant biliary stenosis (21%, n = 138). Based on ESGE criteria, prevalence of DBC was 42.62% (n = 283). Prevalence was 21.15% when 15-10-2 cutoffs are applied in trainee-involved procedure. Cumulative biliary success rate was 96.46%. Standard cannulation method achieved access in 98.2% while advanced methods permitted success in 92.2% in fistulotomy, 94.1% in papillotomy and 77.3% in transpancreatic sphincterotomy. Independent predictive factors of DBC in multivariate analysis were: Trainee presence OR 1.80 [1.24-2.65], SOD OR 4.71 [1.11-19.88], biliary stenosis found on imaging examinations (OR 2.53 [1.63-3.92], small papilla OR 4.09 [1.82-9.17] and difficult orientation of the papilla OR 14.90 [3.28-67.62].
CONCLUSION: DBC is a frequent endoscopic situation. Predictors of DBC can be related to trainee involvement in the procedure, anatomical and clinical factors. A thorough understanding of these factors can actively contribute to ERCP management plans.
