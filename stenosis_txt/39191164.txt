Title: Integrated deep learning model for automatic detection and classification of stenosis in coronary angiography.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease poses a significant threat to human health. In clinical settings, coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing coronary heart disease. A crucial aspect of this diagnosis involves detecting arterial narrowings. Categorizing these narrowings can provide insight into whether patients should receive vascular revascularization treatment. The majority of current deep learning methods for analyzing coronary angiography are mostly confined to the theoretical research domain, with limited studies offering direct practical support to clinical practitioners. This paper proposes an integrated deep-learning model for the localization and classification of narrowings in coronary angiography images. The experimentation employed 1606 coronary angiography images obtained from 132 patients, resulting in an accuracy of 88.9 %, a recall rate of 85.4 %, an F1 score of 0.871, and a MAP value of 0.875 for vascular stenosis detection. Furthermore, we developed the "Hemadostenosis" web platform (http://bioinfor.imu.edu.cn/hemadostenosis) using Django, a highly mature HTTP framework. Users are able to submit coronary angiography image data for assessment via a visual interface. Subsequently, the system sends the images to a trained convolutional neural network model to localize and categorize the narrowings. Finally, the visualized outcomes are displayed to users and are downloadable. Our proposed approach pioneers the recognition and categorization of arterial narrowings in vascular angiography, offering practical support to clinical practitioners in their learning and diagnostic processes.
