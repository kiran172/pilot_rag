Title: Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome with a Solitary Duplex Kidney and Anal Stenosis: Report of a Rare Case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To date, only 23 cases of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome with duplex kidney have been reported. We present the first reported case of MRKH syndrome with solitary duplex kidney and anal stenosis.
CASE: A 17-year-old Chinese girl presented with primary amenorrhea and fully developed secondary sex characteristics. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the absence of the right kidney, a left duplex kidney, and a primordial uterus. Surgery for anal stenosis was performed when she was 1 year of age. The patient had a normal 46, XX karyotype.
