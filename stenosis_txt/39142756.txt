Title: Incidence, Predictors, and Prognostic Impact of Neurologic Events After TAVR According to VARC-3 Criteria.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3 definition for neurologic events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) lacks clinical validation.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the incidence, predictors, and clinical impact of neurologic events following TAVR as defined by VARC-3 criteria.
METHODS: This was a multicenter study including 2,924 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR. Based on Neurologic Academic Research Consortium (NeuroARC) classification, neurologic events were classified as NeuroARC type 1 (stroke), NeuroARC type 2 (covert central nervous system injury), and NeuroARC type 3 (transient ischemic attack and delirium). Baseline, procedural, and follow-up data were prospectively collected in a dedicated database.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 13 (7-37) months, neurologic events occurred in 471 patients (16.1%), NeuroARC type 1, 2, and 3 in 37.4%, 4.7%, and 58.0% of cases, respectively, and the majority (58.6%) were periprocedural. Advanced age, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, major vascular complications, and in-hospital bleeding determined an increased risk of periprocedural events (P < 0.03 for all). Neurologic events occurring during the periprocedural time frame were independently associated with a substantial increase in mortality at 1 year after the intervention (HR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.23-2.97; P = 0.004). However, although NeuroARC type 1 was associated with an increased mortality risk (IRR: 3.38; 95% CI: 2.30-5.56; P < 0.001 and IRR: 21.7; 95% CI: 9.63-49.1; P < 0.001 for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively), the occurrence of NeuroARC type 3 events had no impact on mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic events after TAVR were associated with poorer short- and long-term survival. This correlation was related to the type of NeuroARC event defined by the VARC-3 criteria. Given the negative impact on clinical outcomes, every attempt should be made to reduce the risk of neurologic complications after TAVR.
