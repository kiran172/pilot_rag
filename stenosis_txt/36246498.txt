Title: Simultaneous Dual Distal Radial Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty for Larger Aortic Annuli.

Abstract: Dual distal mini-balloon aortic valvuloplasty stabilized an 85-year-old patient with severe aortic stenosis. Puncturing both radial arteries solves the issue of large diameters at the aortic ring, introducing a feasible strategy in selected cases of fragile octogenarian patients with a high hemorrhagic risk. Moving at the anatomical snuffbox offers better postprocedural occlusion rates and better workspace ergonomics during the procedure.
