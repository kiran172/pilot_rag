Title: Obstructive jaundice caused by ulcerative duodenal stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: A peptic ulcer is a rare cause of distal common bile duct stricture, Obstructive jaundice as a complication of ulcerative duodenal stenosis is quite difficult to differentiate from malignant disease, especially in those in which esophagogastroduodenoscopy examination does not reveal an ulcer. In this case report, a 61-year-old male suffered from right upper quadrant pain, chills and fever caused by duodenal and distal common bile duct stenosis originating from ulcer and was treated surgically.
