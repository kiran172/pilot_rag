Title: Rotational Vertebral Artery Syndrome (Bow Hunter's Syndrome): A Rare Differential Diagnosis in Patients With Syncope.

Abstract: Syncope is a common symptom in clinical practice. Rotational vertebral artery occlusion syndrome, also referred to as Bow Hunter's syndrome (BHS), is a rare condition associated with syncope and is caused by mechanical occlusion or stenosis secondary to mechanical compression of the vertebral artery during head rotation. BHS is associated with a multifactorial etiology; however, in most cases, this condition is attributed to degenerative changes. A 53-year-old man visited our hospital for the evaluation of fainting and dizziness episodes that occurred when he turned his head. Evaluation as an outpatient in the Department of Neurology showed a positive result on the Frenzel goggle test. Transfemoral cerebral angiography performed at the Department of Neurosurgery revealed stenosis of the proximal right vertebral artery. Complete occlusion of the vertebral artery was observed, and the head was turned to the right. Decompression and fusion were performed, and the contributory lesion was completely removed. Postoperative imaging confirmed complete removal of the spur and sufficient vertebral artery decompression; the patient's symptoms resolved postoperatively.
