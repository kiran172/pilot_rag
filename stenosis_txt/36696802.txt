Title: Stiff substrates inhibit collagen accumulation via integrin α2β1, FAK and Src kinases in human atrial fibroblast and myofibroblast cultures derived from patients with aortal stenosis.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to confirm whether cell substrate stiffness may participate in the regulation of fibrosis. The involvement of integrin α2β1, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src kinase in signal transmission was investigated. Human atrial fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were cultured in both soft (2.23 ± 0.8 kPa) and stiff (8.28 ± 1.06 kPa) polyacrylamide gels. The cells were derived from the right atrium of patients with aortal stenosis undergoing surgery. The isolated cells, identified as fibroblasts or myofibroblasts, were stained positively with α smooth muscle actin, vimentin and desmin. The cultures settled on stiff gel demonstrated lower intracellular collagen and collagen type I telopeptide (PICP) levels; however, no changes in α1 chain of procollagen type I and III expression were noted. Inhibition of α2β1 integrin by TC-I 15 (10-7 and 10-8 M) or α2 integrin subunit silencing augmented intracellular collagen level. Moreover, FAK or Src kinase inhibitors increased collagen content within the culture. Lower TIMP4 secretion was reported within the stiff gel cultures but neither MMP 2 nor TIMP-1, 2 or 3 release was altered. The stiff substrate cultures also demonstrated lower interleukin-6 release. Substrate stiffness modified collagen deposition within the atrial fibroblast and myofibroblast cultures. The elasticity of the cellular environment exerts a regulatory influence on both synthesis and breakdown of collagen. Integrin α2β1, FAK and Src kinase activity participates in signal transmission, which may influence fibrosis in the atria of the human heart.
