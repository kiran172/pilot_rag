Title: Replacement of the main bile duct by bioprosthesis in an experimental porcine model (24-month results).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cholecystectomy for conditions like iatrogenic injury during cholecystectomy can lead to complications such as bile duct injuries, necessitating alternative options like bioprosthesis.
METHODS: This study evaluated a bioprosthesis's efficacy in maintaining bile duct continuity over 24 months in 16 male pigs.
RESULTS: The bioprosthesis was implanted in the common bile duct of three-month-old animals, with follow-ups at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Liver function remained stable, and biliary permeability was assessed through various imaging techniques. Despite mild stenosis, biliary flow was unimpeded. Histological analysis confirmed biliary epithelium presence in the regenerated area.
CONCLUSION: The bioprosthesis acted as a scaffold for tissue regeneration without compromising biliary function. Remnants of the bioprosthesis were observed but did not affect biliary excretion in the 24-month porcine model. This study highlights the bioprosthesis's potential in bile duct reconstruction, offering a safe and effective option for maintaining biliary continuity.
