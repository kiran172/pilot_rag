Title: Outcomes of transecting versus non-transecting urethroplasty for bulbar urethral stricture: a meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess outcomes of transecting vs non-transecting urethroplasty for bulbar urethral stricture in terms of stricture recurrence rate, sexual dysfunction, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) related to lower urinary tract (LUT) function.
METHODS: Electronic literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase databases. The studied population was limited to men with bulbar urethral stricture included in studies that compared outcomes after transecting and non-transecting urethroplasty. The main outcome appraised was the stricture recurrence rate. Additionally, the incidence of sexual dysfunction appraised in three domains (erectile function, penile complications, and ejaculatory function) and PROMs related to LUT function after transecting vs non-transecting urethroplasty were assessed. The pooled risk ratio (RR) respectively for stricture recurrence, erectile dysfunction and penile complications was calculated using a fixed-effect model with inverse variance method.
RESULTS: In all, 694 studies were screened with 72 identified as relevant. Finally, 19 studies were suitable for analysis. The pooled difference between the transecting and non-transecting groups relating to stricture recurrence was not significant. Overall, the RR was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.36) and the 95% CI crossed the line of no effect (line RR = 1). Overall, the RR for erectile dysfunction was 0.73 (95% CI 0.49-1.08) and the 95% CI crossed the line of no effect (line RR = 1). Overall, the RR for penile complications was 0.47 (95% CI 0.28-0.76) and the 95% CI did not cross the line of no effect (line RR = 1). Hence, the risk of penile complications was significantly lower in the non-transecting group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of available evidence indicates that both transecting and non-transecting urethroplasties, are equal in terms of the recurrence rate. On the other hand, non-transecting techniques are better in terms of sexual function, causing less penile complications.
