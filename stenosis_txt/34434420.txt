Title: Labor Complicated by Cervical Stenosis Following a Laser Cone Biopsy.

Abstract: A 34-year-old lady, with three previous spontaneous vaginal deliveries, presented in labor at 37 + 0 weeks' gestation. Following the birth of her third child, she underwent a laser cone biopsy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3. Despite sustained regular contractions and augmentation with Syntocinon, progressive cervical dilatation beyond 1 cm failed to occur in this multiparous lady. A delayed diagnosis of cervical stenosis was made. She eventually underwent a cesarean section where her internal cervical os was found to be thin and fibrotic. This case describes an uncommon occurrence of cervical stenosis presenting in labor and seeks to increase awareness of this condition so as to allow preemptive counselling of similar patients, early recognition in a labor with poor progress and a swift, better-informed decision to deliver via an emergency cesarean section. We review the existing literature on cervical stenosis following cervical conization and analyze the various definitions available.
