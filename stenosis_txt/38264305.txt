Title: A Mobile Thrombus Adhering to an Intra-Annular Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve.

Abstract: An 81-year-old woman who had undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation 3Â months earlier underwent routine follow-up transthoracic echocardiography, which revealed a mobile thrombus adhering to the bioprosthetic valve. This thrombus differed in morphology from transcatheter aortic valve implantation valve thrombi commonly seen in daily practice.
