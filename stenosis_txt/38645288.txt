Title: Dynamic Pulmonary Vein Stenosis After Left Pneumonectomy.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis might be caused by mediastinal migration into the vacated pleural space after pneumonectomy. In a patient complaining of worsening dyspnea in the left lateral decubitus position after left pneumonectomy, transthoracic echocardiography during different postures revealed pulmonary vein stenosis that worsened in the left lateral position.
