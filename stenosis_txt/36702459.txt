Title: Bicuspid aortic valve durability with valve-sparing aortic root replacement: comparison to tricuspid valve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Outcomes beyond 10 years for David V valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients have yet to be explored. We investigated long-term outcomes after BAV VSARR compared to VSARR for tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients.
METHODS: A total of 677 patients with BAV (n = 171) and TAV (n = 506) underwent VSARR between 2005 and 2020 from 2 aortic centres, excluding those with dissection, endocarditis, stenosis or prior aortic valve (AV) surgery. Multivariable Cox regression compared adjusted survival over a 12-year period. Fine and Gray competing risk regression compared risk and cumulative incidence of reoperation/reintervention. Propensity score matching created balanced groups, and landmark analysis isolated outcomes beginning 4 years postoperatively. Finally, longitudinal mixed modelling assessed AV deterioration on echocardiogram.
RESULTS: No difference was observed in 12-year survival of BAV versus TAV (propensity score matching 92.0% vs 89.9%, P = 0.97; multivariable hazard ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.34-1.69, P = 0.51). Adjusted 12-year cumulative incidence and risk of AV and/or proximal aorta reoperation/reintervention were not observed to be different (15.7% BAV vs 5.7% TAV, P = 0.37; subdistribution hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 0.60-3.94, P = 0.36); however, landmark analysis showed increased incidence of late reoperation/reintervention in BAV versus TAV (11.7% vs 0.0%, P = 0.04). BAV was not associated with AV deterioration over time (BAV coefficient ± standard error: 0 ± 0.30, P = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: VSARR for BAV patients has excellent 12-year survival and low reoperation/reintervention rates, which were not observed to be different from TAV patients. However, higher incidence of reoperation/reintervention was observed in the late years after BAV VSARR. Our study provides key information for surgical consultation of patients with bicuspid aortopathy.
