Title: Impact of New-Onset Right Bundle-Branch Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement on Permanent Pacemaker Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A delayed and recurrent complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) is a life-threatening complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Post-TAVR evaluation may be important in predicting delayed and recurrent CAVB requiring permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). The impact of new-onset right bundle-branch block (RBBB) after TAVR on PPI remains unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 407 patients with aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR were included in this analysis. Intraprocedural CAVB was defined as CAVB that occurred during TAVR. A 12-lead ECG was evaluated at baseline, immediately after TAVR, on postoperative days 1 and 5, and according to the need to identify new-onset bundle-branch block (BBB) and CAVB after TAVR. Forty patients (9.8%) required PPI, 17 patients (4.2%) had persistent intraprocedural CAVB, and 23 (5.7%) had delayed or recurrent CAVB after TAVR. The rates of no new-onset BBB, new-onset left BBB, and new-onset RBBB were 65.1%, 26.8%, and 4.7%, respectively. Compared with patients without new-onset BBB and those with new-onset left BBB, the rate of PPI was higher in patients with new-onset RBBB (3.4% versus 5.6% versus 44.4%, P&lt;0.0001). On post-TAVR evaluation in patients without persistent intraprocedural CAVB, the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that new-onset RBBB was a statistically significant predictor of PPI compared with no new-onset BBB (odds ratio [OR], 18.0 [95% CI, 5.94-54.4]) in addition to the use of a self-expanding valve (OR, 2.97 [95% CI, 1.09-8.10]).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with new-onset RBBB after TAVR are at high risk for PPI.
