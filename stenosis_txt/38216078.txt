Title: Midterm Outcomes After Aortic Valve Neocuspidization (Ozaki Procedure) in Adults.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Trileaflet aortic valve neocuspidization (AVN) using autologous pericardium (Ozaki procedure) is an emerging surgical treatment option for aortic valve diseases. Although excellent results have been reported from Japan, data pertaining to its use in the United States are sparse.
METHODS: All adult patients who underwent AVN (AVN group) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with a bioprosthetic valve (SAVR group) between 2015 and 2022 were identified. Propensity score matching was used to adjust the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients underwent AVN, and 1816 patients underwent SAVR with a bioprosthetic valve. None in the AVN group required conversion to SAVR. Before matching, mean age in the AVN group was 68.5 ± 8.8 years, and 56 patients (55.4%) underwent concomitant procedures. Preoperatively, 3 (3%) had endocarditis. Bicuspid valve was observed in 38 (38.4%). None died at 30 days in the AVN group. The median follow-up duration was 3.2 years. After propensity score matching, the expected survival and freedom from at least moderate aortic regurgitation at 5 years was 91.7% ± 3.1% and 97.6% ± 1.7%, respectively. Propensity score matching yielded 77 patients in each group. The Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated equivalent survival at 5 years between the 2 groups (P = .95). Additionally, freedom from at least moderate aortic regurgitation was comparable at 5 years (P = .23).
CONCLUSIONS: AVN can be safely performed for a variety of aortic valve diseases, with or without concomitant operations. AVN demonstrated similar midterm outcomes compared with SAVR with a bioprosthetic valve in the United States adult population.
