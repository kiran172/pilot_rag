Title: Clinical Presentation and Therapy of Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome.

Abstract: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a complex congenital heart defect characterized by several abnormalities that result in a significantly underdeveloped left ventricle and severe hypoplasia of the ascending aorta, often leading to retrograde perfusion. These abnormalities include aortic valve atresia or severe stenosis, accompanied by a severely hypoplastic aortic valve annulus (Fig. 59.1). Mitral valve atresia, hypoplasia, and/or stenosis with a hypoplastic valve annulus with or without a ventricular septal defect can also contribute to the development of HLHS. Endocardial fibroelastosis and sinusoids may be present as well. The interatrial septum can either be closed or the foramen ovale severely stenotic. Other malformations, such as anomalous pulmonary venous drainage or variations of the systemic veins, may coexist. It is also common to observe a coarctation of the aorta in these cases.
