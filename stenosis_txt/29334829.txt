Title: Rare Combination of Pathologies Causing Mitral Stenosis and Mitral Regurgitation: A Case Report.

Abstract: A supramitral ring is a rare cause of mitral stenosis, while an isolated mitral valve cleft is a rare cause of congenital mitral regurgitation. Fortunately, both the lesions are known to have good outcomes after surgical correction. Although each is known to be associated with a variety of other structural heart defects, their coexistence has not been reported previously. We report a case of a three- and half-year-old boy detected to have a rare combination of supramitral ring producing severe mitral stenosis with a coexisting cleft in the anterior leaflet of mitral valve causing severe mitral regurgitation. The patient underwent successful surgical repair with resolution of both mitral stenosis and regurgitation.
