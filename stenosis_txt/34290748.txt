Title: Best practices in diagnosis and treatment of chronic iliac vein obstruction.

Abstract: Iliac vein obstruction occurs in 20-30% of the general population. In patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency, this prevalence can be even higher, reaching 50-90% when the obstruction is investigated using intravascular ultrasound. Less invasive methods, such as venous Duplex Scanning, and even invasive ones such as venography may fail to diagnose the condition. Endovascular treatment of these obstructions is effective, safe, and associated with excellent clinical outcomes and stent patency rates, provided that fundamental anatomical and technical principles are considered and applied.
