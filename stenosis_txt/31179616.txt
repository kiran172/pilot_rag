Title: Coronary-subclavian steal syndrome, an easily overlooked entity in interventional cardiology.

Abstract: Coronary-subclavian steal syndrome (CSSS) is a severe complication of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with internal mammary artery grafting. It is caused by functional graft failure due to a hemodynamically significant proximal subclavian artery stenosis. In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive review of literature and we report a series of five consecutive CSSS cases. This case series illustrates the variable clinical presentation, thereby emphasizing the importance of raised awareness concerning this pathology in CABG patients.
