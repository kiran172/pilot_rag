Title: Associations between coronary artery stenosis detected by coronary computed tomography angiography and the characteristics of health checkup examinees in the Republic of Korea.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted on healthy adults without a diagnosis related to cardiovascular disease to investigate the associations between asymptomatic coronary artery stenosis and the characteristics of health checkup examinees.
METHODS: This study was performed on 601 people (320 males and 281 females), who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), among health checkup examinees from January 2, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Those with any prior history of cardiovascular diseases, underwent coronary artery bypass grafting or coronary artery stenting in the past, those with atrial fibrillation, those suspected of contrast agent side effects, and those whose creatinine levels deviated from the normal range were excluded.
RESULTS: The mean age was 58.7 ± 8.0 years. Coronary artery stenosis was detected in 173 people (28.8%), and the mean coronary artery stenosis rate was 25.8 ± 12.8%. Regression analysis showed that coronary artery stenosis was influenced significantly by age, gender, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), past smoking duration, current smoking duration, and number of glasses of alcohol consumed (p < 0.05). In terms of the relationship between the presence of coronary artery stenosis and lifestyle habits, amount of alcohol consumed per day (p = 0.03), and patients with a longer period of past (p < 0.001) and current smoking duration (p = 0.01) had a significant effect on coronary artery stenosis.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that men aged 60 years or older, who have consumed large amounts of alcohol and cigarettes for a long time, require continuous management through tests such as a health checkup, because of the high probability of coronary artery stenosis, even in those without specific symptoms.
