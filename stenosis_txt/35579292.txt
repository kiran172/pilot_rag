Title: Immunomodulatory effects of icariin in a myocardial infarction mouse model.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a prevalent cardiovascular disease defined by myocardial ischemia and hypoxic damage caused by plaque rupture, thrombosis, lumen stenosis, or blockage in the coronary artery. However, the development of emergency percutaneous coronary interventional therapy has enabled the rapid restoration of blood perfusion to ischemic myocardium and the rescue of dying myocardium cells. Some dying myocardium cells have caused irreversible damage and impaired cardiac function recovery in recent years. Icariin has been utilized to treat various ailments as a natural chemical extract. In this study, we employed a variety of approaches to observe MI, including western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometric analysis using icariin. As demonstrated by the research findings, icariin may prevent MI-induced cell apoptosis. This is accomplished by inhibiting proinflammatory factors via the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. These data imply that icariin may be an effective treatment for MI.
