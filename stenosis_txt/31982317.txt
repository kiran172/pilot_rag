Title: Evaluation of Technical Success, Efficacy, and Safety of Portomesenteric Venous Intervention following Nontransplant Hepatobiliary or Pancreatic Surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate technical success, efficacy and safety of portomesenteric venous (PMV) intervention for PMV stenosis or occlusion following nontransplant hepatobiliary or pancreatic (HPB) surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review identified 42 patients (mean age 60 y) with PMV stenosis (n = 33; 79%) or occlusion (n = 9; 21%) who underwent attempted PMV intervention following HPB surgery between June 1, 2011, and April 1, 2018. Main outcomes were technical success, primary patency rates, and complications. Technical success was compared by venous pathology and primary PMV patency based on anticoagulation status after the procedure using Fisher exact test. Rates of primary patency by stent group were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Technical success was 91% (n = 38/42) and significantly higher in patients with stenosis (n = 33/33; 100%) vs occlusion (n = 5/9; 56%) (P = .001). Primary presenting symptom resolved in 28 (87%) patients, including 6 (100%) patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. At mean imaging follow-up of 8.6 months ± 8.8, primary stent patency was 76%. There was no significant difference in primary stent patency based on anticoagulation status after the procedure (P = .48). There were 2 (4.8%) periprocedural complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Portomesenteric venoplasty and stent placement following nontransplant HPB surgery is safe with a high rate of technical success if performed before chronic occlusion.
