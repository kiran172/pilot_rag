Title: The most influential papers in mitral valve surgery; a bibliometric analysis.

Abstract: This study is an analysis of the 100 most cited articles in mitral valve surgery. A bibliometric analysis is a tool to evaluate research performance in a given field. It uses the number of times a publication is cited by others as a proxy marker of its impact. The most cited paper Carpentier et al. discusses mitral valve repair in terms of restoring the geometry of the entire valve rather than simply narrowing the annulus (Carpentier, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 86:23-37, 1983). The first successful mitral valve repair was performed by Elliot Cutler at Brigham and Women's Hospital in 1923 (Cohn et al., Ann Cardiothorac Surg 4:315, 2015). More recently percutaneous and minimally invasive techniques that were originally designed as an option for high risk patients are being trialled in other patient groups (Hajar, Heart Views 19:160-3, 2018). Comparison of percutaneous method with open repair represents an expanding area of research (Hajar, Heart Views 19:160-3, 2018). This study will analyse the top 100 cited papers relevant to mitral valve surgery, identifying the most influential papers that guide current management, the institutions that produce them and the authors involved.
