Title: Feasibility and Success of Muscular Ventricular Septal Defect Occluders and Mushroom-Shaped Occluders in Transcatheter Patent Ductus Arteriosus Closure in Low-Weight Children: A Propensity Score-Matched Retrospective Analysis from a Chinese National Regional Health Center.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Muscular ventricular septal defect occluders (MVSDOs) have been attempted as an option in low-weight patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). However, few studies have assessed the safety of transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus closure (TCPC) using MVSDO. Therefore, we compared the outcomes in low-weight patients who used MVSDO and mushroom-shaped occluder (MSO).
METHODS: Medical records of children under 10 kg (n = 417) who underwent TCPC from 2015 to 2021 at a Chinese health center were reviewed. They were divided into MSO (n = 372) and MVSDO (n = 45) groups. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was done considering gender, height, weight, body surface area (BSA), PDA diameter, and BSA-corrected PDA diameter.
RESULTS: All 45 children in the MVSDO group (mean weight: 5.92 ± 1.32 kg) achieved successful immediate occlusion. One case in the MVSDO group experienced device migration within 24 h requiring unplanned surgery. MVSDO significantly ameliorated pulmonary artery hypertension. After PSM, each group comprised 41 children. The MVSDO group had a smaller effect on platelet counts (MVSDO vs. MSO = 259.85 ± 114.82 vs. 356.12 ± 134.37, p &lt; 0.001), a reduced incidence of thrombocytopenia (MVSDO vs. MSO = 2/41 vs. 7/41, p = 0.001), and a higher rate of residual shunting (MVSDO vs. MSO = 16/41 vs. 5/41, p = 0.005), compared with the MSO group. Thrombocytopenia resolved during hospitalization and micro-shunts disappeared by 6 months. No pulmonary artery or descending aortic secondary stenosis was observed in 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: MVSDO used in low-weight children is feasible, with high success and satisfactory postoperative and short-term follow-up outcomes, including lower thrombocytopenia incidence, compared to MSO. Further long-term studies with larger samples are recommended.
