Title: Hemodynamic and Anatomical Factors in Arteriovenous Malformation Clinical Presentation: 45 Case Studies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic factors have been implicated in hemorrhage from cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The goal of this endovascular study is to analyze the hemodynamic variability in AVM feeders in a balanced group of ruptured and unruptured AVMs of various sizes and at both superficial and deep locations.
METHODS: We monitored feeder artery pressure (FP) using microcatheters in 45 patients with AVMs (16 with hemorrhage, 29 without) during superselective angiography and AVM embolization.
RESULTS: Mean FP was 49 mm Hg. Significant determinants of FP were the systemic pressure (p &lt; 0.001), AVM size (p = 0.03), and the distance of the microcatheter tip from the Circle of Willis (p = 0.06), but not the presence of hemorrhage, patient age, or feeder artery diameter. The FP in ruptured AVMs was 7 mm Hg higher than in unruptured ones (53.8 mm Hg vs. 47.1 mm Hg, p = 0.032). The presence or absence of venous outflow stenosis and the position of the AVM nidus (superficial or deep to the cortical surface) were important anatomical predictors of AVM presentation.
CONCLUSION: The pressure in the feeding artery supplying an AVM is the result of factors which include the systemic arterial pressure, the size of the AVM nidus, and the distance of the AVM from the Circle of Willis. The correlation between these variables makes it difficult to study the risk of hemorrhage as a function of a single factor, which may account for the variation in the conclusions of previous studies.
