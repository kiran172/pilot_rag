Title: Abnormalities of External Jugular Veins in Bulldogs with Pulmonary Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Two French bulldogs and one English bulldog affected by pulmonary valve stenosis and referred for pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty were diagnosed with different abnormalities of the external jugular veins. The diagnosis included unilateral absence of the right external jugular vein and bilateral hypoplasia of the external jugular veins, associated with persistent left cranial vena cava. Vascular ultrasound and computed tomography were used for the diagnosis. Jugular vein anomalies can affect decision-making regarding the central venous catheterization needed to perform procedures such as pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty or central catheter placement. Based on the results of the present case series, anomalies of external jugular veins should be considered in French and English bulldogs when the external jugular veins cannot be palpated or when echocardiography shows coronary sinus dilation. Vascular ultrasound or computed tomography may help identify jugular venous anomalies and should be considered in the preoperative evaluation of bulldogs that need to undergo interventional procedures requiring transjugular catheterization.
