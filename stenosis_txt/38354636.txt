Abstract: CASE SUMMARY: A 71-year-old presented at the outpatient clinic with palpitations and NYHA II functional class. 12-lead ECG exhibited Upper septal idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia (US-ILVT). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) was interrupted with Verapamil administration, no further recurrences were documented after beta-blockers therapy was started. No coronary artery stenosis were detected. The US-ILVT was successfully treated by ablating the proximal site of the left anterior fascicle (LAF), where diastolic potential (P1) and pre-systolic potential (P2) with inverted sequence were detected during the electrophysiology study (EP) study. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) was performed with demonstration of intramyocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at the level of middle-basal portions of interventricular septum and basal portion of infero-lateral wall and no edema detection. A single catheter implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted as secondary prevention. VT has never recurred during 3 months of follow-up with remote control of ICD.
DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in which US-ILVT was associated with ventricular septal LGE, suggestive of previous myocarditis, as substrate of re-entrant circuit. Scar-related ventricular tachycardia circuit is also suggested by the evidence of a premature ventricular complex (PVC) as trigger of recurrent VT in our case.
