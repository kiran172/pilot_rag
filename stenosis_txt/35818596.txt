Title: Balloon Nudge Technique: A Touch to Nonsteerable Valves.

Abstract: Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an effective treatment for severe aortic stenosis with a high rate of procedural success with the current devices. However, anatomic factors and device limitations may increase technical difficulty. We describe the balloon nudge technique, a novel technique that improves coaxial alignment while crossing the aortic valve. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
