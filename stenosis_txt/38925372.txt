Title: Current Trends in the Use of Buccal Grafts During Urethroplasty Among Society of Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze current standards in urethroplasty by urologists employing buccal mucosal grafts (BMG) for treating urethral stricture disease (USD).
METHODS: An IRB-approved online survey was distributed to members of the Society of Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons (GURS) between July and October 2022 to assess BMG utilization in urethroplasty. Questions covered surgeon experience, graft harvest site, graft length, surgical technique, and perceived success rates.
RESULTS: Of 350 invited GURS members, 134 responded (38%). Sixty-nine percentage were GURS fellowship-trained, performing 10-30 urethroplasties annually. Ninety-five percentage harvested their own grafts, with 99% preferring buccal mucosa as the primary site. Buccal mucosa was favored over fasciocutaneous flap for penile urethroplasty, regardless of circumcision status (95% with, 84% without). For bulbar urethroplasty with BMG, dorsal graft placement was favored (66%) over ventral (34%). Most surgeons (90%) preferred multiple BMGs over combined graft/flap for panurethral strictures. When harvesting long grafts, 56% preferred using both cheeks. Anastomotic urethroplasty was preferred over buccal graft urethroplasty for short bulbomembranous stenosis post-radiotherapy (63% vs 37%). Surgeons reported a success rate of 80%-90% (53%).
CONCLUSION: The expanded scope of reconstructive urology has led to increased use of BMG in diverse urethral reconstructions. Buccal grafts are now preferred for penile, bulbar, and panurethral strictures, demonstrating high perceived success rates in the reconstructive community.
