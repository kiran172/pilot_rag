Title: Economic Considerations in Access to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized the treatment of aortic stenosis, with the number of procedures and sites offering the procedure steadily rising over the past decade in the United States. Despite this, growth into certain markets has been limited as hospitals have to balance high TAVR costs with the ability to offer a complete array of state-of-the-art therapies for aortic stenosis. This trade-off often results in decreased access to TAVR services by patients cared for in hospitals that cannot afford these services or have difficulty meeting procedural requirements, recruiting skilled physicians, and initiating and then maintaining a functioning TAVR program. The lack of access is more common among patients of color or those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. The purpose of this review is to describe the hospital-level economic considerations of TAVR in the United States and the resulting effects on geographic, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic access for Americans.
