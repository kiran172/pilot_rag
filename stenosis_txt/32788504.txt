Title: Portal Vein Stenosis Following Liver Transplantation Hemodynamically Assessed with 4D-flow MRI before and after Portal Vein Stenting.

Abstract: We present a case of a patient who underwent portal vein (PV) stenting for PV stenosis after a living-donor liver transplantation. A pretreatment 3D cine phase-contrast (4D-flow) MRI showed decreased, though hepatopetal, blood flow in the PV. After stenting, 4D-flow MRI confirmed an improvement in PV flow, with a more homogeneous flow distribution to each hepatic segment. 4D-flow MRI are valuable for understanding the hemodynamics of this area, planning for treatments, and evaluating the outcome of the interventions.
