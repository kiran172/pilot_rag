Title: Retrograde chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention using single catheter: A single centre registry.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To analyse the feasibility, safety and procedural outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusions (CTO) through retrograde approach using single catheter.
METHODS: Our study was a retrospective observational study that enrolled patients who underwent retrograde CTO PCI using a single catheter between June 2016 and February 2020. Clinical success was defined as successful completion of CTO PCI without associated in-hospital major clinical complications like death, myocardial infarction, stroke or urgent revascularisation. Technical success was defined as successful completion of CTO PCI using single catheter and minimum diameter stenosis of <30% with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3, without significant side branch occlusion, flow-limiting dissection, distal embolization, or angiographic thrombus.
RESULTS: Totally 102 patients underwent retrograde CTO PCI during the study period. Out of which, 15 cases were attempted using single catheter. Mean age of the population was 59.1 ± 8.9 years (males: 86.7%) and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was (61% ± 9.1%). Mean number of diseased arteries was 2.1 ± 0.7, length of the CTO was 25.5 ± 7.4 mm and J-CTO score was 2.3 ± 0.7. We achieved a technical success rate of 73.3% using single catheter, and the overall clinical success (Including single catheter and ping pong) was obtained in 86.7% cases. One patient (6.7%) developed cardiac tamponade and none of study population required dialysis for contrast induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde CTO PCI using single catheter is a technically challenging procedure when compared with other CTO PCI. Our study demonstrated acceptable outcomes which is comparable to other antegrade and retrograde CTO PCI registries.
