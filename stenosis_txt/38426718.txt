Title: The Association Between Ascending Aortic and Left Ventricular Dimensions in Patients After Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is often recommended for patients with severe aortic stenosis or chronic aortic regurgitation. These conditions result in remodeling of the left ventricle, including increased interstitial fibrosis that may persist even after AVR. These structural changes impact left ventricular (LV) mechanics, causing compromised LV diameter to occur earlier than reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF). The aim of this study was to examine the effect of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and its role in aortic expansion one year after AVR.
METHODS: Sixty-three patients who underwent AVR were evaluated. All patients underwent standard transthoracic echocardiography, which included measurements of the ascending aorta, aortic root, LVEF, and LVEDD before the surgery and one year postoperatively. Correlations between these variables were calculated.
RESULTS: All patients underwent AVR with either a mechanical or biological prosthetic aortic valve. Following AVR, there was a significant decrease in the dimensions of the ascending aorta and aortic root (both P=0.001). However, no significant changes were observed in LVEDD and LVEF. Correlations were found between the preoperative ascending aortic size and the preoperative and one-year postoperative LVEDD (r=0.419, P=0.001 and r=0.320, P=0.314, respectively). Additionally, there was a correlation between the postoperative ascending aortic size and the preoperative and one-year postoperative LVEDD (r=0.320, P=0.003 and r=0.136, P=0.335, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The study findings demonstrate a significant correlation between the size of the aortic root and ascending aorta, before and after AVR. Additionally, a notable correlation was observed between postoperative LVEDD and the size of the aortic root.
