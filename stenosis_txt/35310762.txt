Title: Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy to manage gastric outlet obstruction associated with endoscopic submucosal dissection of large gastric epithelial neoplasms: A two-case report.

Abstract: We report on two patients with stasis symptoms, including vomiting and nausea that were caused by deformity, stenosis, and decreased gastric peristalsis associated with artificial ulcers after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). In both cases, the symptoms remained unresolved despite repetitive endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD). Therefore, laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy was performed. Soon after the procedure, their food intake was improved. Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy can be an option for the treatment of gastric outlet obstruction induced by a large field of gastric ESD that is refractory to EBD.
