Title: Acute limb ischemia after minimally invasive cardiac surgery using the ProGlide: A case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We report two cases of acute femoral artery occlusion following the use of ProGlide in minimally invasive cardiac surgery and insertion of large-bore catheters through the common femoral artery. This will add to the existing body of literature by highlighting the possible complications associated with the use of ProGlide and reiterate that the use of the sono-guided ProGlide skill will reduce the incidence of these complications.
CASE SUMMARY: A 78-year-old man underwent minimally invasive cardiac surgery for severe aortic valve stenosis. After the operation, the puncture site of the common femoral artery was closed using ProGlide. The next morning, after regaining consciousness, he complained of pain, motor weakness (grade 2), and coldness in the right lower extremity. A 65-year-old man underwent minimally invasive cardiac surgery for a large secundum atrial septal defect (5 cm Ã— 5 cm). After the operation, the puncture site of the common femoral artery was closed using ProGlide. After extubation, the patient complained of paresthesia of the right thigh. Both the patients underwent emergency surgery for acute occlusion of the common femoral artery.
CONCLUSION: If the sono-guided ProGlide skill is used, complications can be prevented, and ProGlide can be safely used.
