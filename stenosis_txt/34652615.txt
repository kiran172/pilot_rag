Title: Correlations between vitronectin, miR-520, and miR-34 in patients with stenosis of coronary arteries.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In-stent restenosis usually occurs by platelet activation, neointima formation, VSMC migration, and proliferation in the position of the vessel stent. The monocytes have a magnificent role in neointimal hyperplasia since these cells recruit to the site of vessel injury through chemokines and other secretion proteins. This study is focused on the investigation of vitronectin, miR-193, miR-34, and miR-520 expression levels in PBMCs isolated from stenosed patients.
METHODS: A total of sixty subjects undergoing coronary artery angiography containing patients with stent no restenosis (n = 20), in-stent restenosis (n = 20), and healthy participants (n = 20) participated in the study. The vitronectin, miR-193, miR-34, and miR-520 expression levels were measured by the RT-qPCR technique. Data were analyzed by SPSS software.
RESULTS: The vitronectin, miR-34, and miR-520 expression levels changed significantly in patients with vessel in-stent restenosis (p = 0.02, p = 0.02, and p = 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, there were inverse correlations between the expression levels of vitronectin gene and miR-34 (r =  - 0.44, p = 0.04) as well as miR-520 (r =  - 0.5, p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The molecular events in the vessel stenosis may be affected by targeting vitronectin with miR-520 and miR-34.
