Title: Use of Machine Learning to Develop Prediction Models for Mortality and Stroke in Patients Undergoing Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To develop an artificial intelligence, machine learning prediction model for estimating in-hospital mortality and stroke in patients undergoing balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV).
METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify patients who underwent BAV from 2005 to 2017. Outcomes analyzed were in-hospital all-cause mortality and stroke after BAV. Predictors of mortality and stroke were selected using LASSO regularization. A conventional logistic regression and a random forest machine learning algorithm were used to train the models for predicting outcomes. The performance of all the modeling algorithms for predicting in-hospital mortality and stroke was compared between models using c-statistic, F1 score, brier score loss, diagnostic accuracy, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov plots.
RESULTS: A total of 6962 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent BAV were identified. The performance of random forest classifier was comparable with logistic regression for predicting in-hospital mortality for all measures of performance (F1 score 0.422 vs 0.409, ROC-AUC 0.822 [95 % CI 0.787-0.855] vs 0.815 [95 % CI 0.779-0.849], diagnostic accuracy 70.42 % vs 70.93 %, KS-statistic 0.513 vs 0.494 and brier score loss 0.295 vs 0.291). The random forest algorithm significantly outperformed logistic regression in predicting in-hospital stroke with respect to all performance metrics: F1 score 0.225 vs 0.095, AUC 0.767 [0.662-0.858] vs 0.637 [0.499-0.754], brier score loss [0.399 vs 0.407], and KS-statistic [0.465 vs 0.254].
CONCLUSIONS: The good discrimination of machine learning models reveal the potential of artificial intelligence to improve patient risk stratification for BAV.
