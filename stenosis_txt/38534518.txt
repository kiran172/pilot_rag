Title: Regeneration Process of an Autologous Tissue-Engineered Trachea (aTET) in a Rat Patch Tracheoplasty Model.

Abstract: The treatment of long-tracheal lesion is difficult because there are currently no viable grafts for tracheal replacement. To solve this problem, we have developed an autologous Tissue-Engineered Trachea (aTET), which is made up of collagenous tissues and cartilage-like structures derived from rat chondrocytes. This graft induced successful long-term survival in a small-animal experiment in our previous study. In this study, we investigated the regeneration process of an aTET to attain reproducible success. We prepared an aTET by using a specially designed mold and performed patch tracheoplasty with an aTET. We assigned twenty-seven rats to three groups according to the three types of patch grafts used: aTET patches (the aTET group), fresh tracheal autograft patches (the Ag group), or polylactic acid and polycaprolactone copolymer sheets (the PPc group). In each group, gross and histological evaluations were performed at 1 month (n = 3), 3 months (n = 3), and 6 months (n = 3) after implantation. We obtained high survival rates in all groups, but only the PPc group attained thick tracheal walls with granular tissues and no tracheal regeneration. On the other hand, the aTET and Ag groups reproducibly achieved complete tracheal regeneration in 6 months. So, an aTET could be a promising candidate for tracheal regeneration grafts.
