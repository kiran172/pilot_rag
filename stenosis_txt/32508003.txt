Title: Sutureless aortic valve replacement with concomitant aortic arch reconstruction.

Abstract: Sutureless aortic valve replacement (AVR) offers an alternative approach to the standard AVR in aortic valve disease. We herein report a case of an 82-year-old woman with severe aortic insufficiency and a persistent type 1 endoleak following a thoracic endovascular aortic repair, who underwent successful combined aortic arch reconstruction and sutureless AVR. The bioprosthesis, Perceval (LivaNova PLC, London, UK), a self-anchoring, self-expanding, sutureless valve, which can be implanted in selected patients with aortic insufficiency was used. Although the patient was frail and at a high risk of open-heart surgery, she had an uneventful postoperative course. Hence, Perceval may be a useful option for combined aortic arch reconstruction and aortic valve surgery in high-risk elderly patients.
