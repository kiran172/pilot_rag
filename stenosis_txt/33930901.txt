Title: Safety and Efficacy of Different Antithrombotic Strategies after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Network Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal pharmacological therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains uncertain. We compared efficacy and safety of various antiplatelet and anticoagulant approaches after TAVI by a network meta-analysis.
METHODS: A total of 14 studies (both observational and randomized) were considered, with 24,119 patients included. Primary safety endpoint was the incidence of any bleeding complications during follow-up. Secondary safety endpoint was major bleeding. Efficacy endpoints were stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. A frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted with a random-effects model. The following strategies were compared: dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), oral anticoagulation (OAC), and OAC + SAPT. The mean follow-up was 15 months.
RESULTS: In comparison to DAPT, SAPT was associated with a 44% risk reduction of any bleeding (odds ratio [OR]: 0.56 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.39-0.80]). SAPT was ranked as the safest strategy for the prevention of any bleeding (p-score: 0.704), followed by OAC alone (p-score: 0.476) and DAPT (p-score: 0.437). Consistent results were observed for major bleeding. The incidence of cardiovascular death and secondary ischemic endpoints did not differ among the tested antithrombotic approaches. In patients with indication for long-term anticoagulation, OAC alone showed similar rates of stroke (OR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.41-2.05], p = 0.83) and reduced occurrence of any bleeding (OR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.37-0.66], p &lt; 0.01) versus OAC + SAPT.
CONCLUSION: The present network meta-analysis supports after TAVI the use of SAPT in patients without indication for OAC and OAC alone in those needing long-term anticoagulation.
