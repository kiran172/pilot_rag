Title: Improved stenosis outcome in stroke-free sickle cell anemia children after transplantation compared to chronic transfusion.

Abstract: We report here the 3-year stenosis outcome in 60 stroke-free children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and an abnormal transcranial Doppler history, enrolled in the DREPAGREFFE trial, which compared stem cell transplantation (SCT) with standard-care (chronic transfusion for 1-year minimum). Twenty-eight patients with matched sibling donors were transplanted, while 32 remained on standard-care. Stenosis scores were calculated after performing cerebral/cervical 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. Fourteen patients had stenosis at enrollment, but only five SCT versus 10 standard-care patients still had stenosis at 3 years. Stenosis scores remained stable on standard-care, but significantly improved after SCT (P = 0·006). No patient developed stenosis after SCT, while two on standard-care did, indicating better stenosis prevention and improved outcome after SCT.
