Title: Endoscopic ampullectomy for non-invasive ampullary lesions: a single-center 10-year retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lesions involving the ampulla of Vater have traditionally been managed by surgical resection, albeit with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic ampullectomy is increasingly recognized as an efficacious and safer treatment option. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of endoscopic ampullectomy for non-invasive ampullary lesions in a single tertiary referral center.
METHODS: Patients with non-invasive ampullary lesions, with or without familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), were identified using pathology and endoscopy databases. The study included all patients who underwent the index ampullectomy between January 2007 and January 2017. Outcome parameters included accuracy of forceps biopsies, adverse events, success of endoscopic resection, and rate of recurrence.
RESULTS: A total of 53 patients underwent endoscopic ampullectomy over the 10-year period. Histological upstaging was seen in 37.8% of cases at ampullectomy compared to biopsy, including 5 cases (9.4%) of invasive adenocarcinoma. Adverse events occurred in 10 patients (18.9%) consisting of bleeding (11.3%), benign papillary stenosis (3.8%), acute pancreatitis (1.9%), and duodenal perforation (1.9%). Recurrence occurred in 32.7% over a median follow-up of 30 months (range 6-104 months), with the majority (18.4%) occurring at the first surveillance endoscopy. Nonetheless, 75% of recurrences were able to be cleared endoscopically. Endoscopic resection was successful in 91.1% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic ampullectomy is an effective and safer therapeutic modality for non-invasive ampullary lesions, in addition to being a valuable diagnostic and staging tool. Nevertheless, careful patient selection and a commitment to endoscopic follow-up are of primary importance to achieve an optimal therapeutic outcome.
