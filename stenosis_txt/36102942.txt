Title: Total introital obliteration as a consequence of lichen sclerosus: a rare cause of urinary retention.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory dermatitis, with a predilection for the anogenital area. In later stages, lichen sclerosus may develop into widespread scarring, and occasionally leading to severe introital stenosis and urinary retention. Our video is aimed at presenting a case of surgical management of lichen sclerosus-related introital stenosis determining urinary retention.
METHODS: An 82-year-old woman was evaluated for almost complete urinary retention, with concomitant continuous enuretic urinary leakage all day and night and recurrent urinary tract infection symptoms. The gynecological evaluation demonstrated a complete introital obliteration, without obvious communications for urine passing. After proper informed consent, the patient was admitted for vulvo-perineoplasty.
RESULTS: The featured procedure was completed in 25 min and blood loss was negligible. No surgical complications were observed. On postoperative day 1, the patient was successfully discharged home with topical steroid treatment. Histological examination confirmed typical features of lichen sclerosus pathology. At follow-up visits the patient was asymptomatic and examination confirmed persistence of introital patency.
CONCLUSIONS: The featured video shows a vulvo-perineoplasty performed in a patient with lichen sclerosus-related complete introital obliteration and urinary retention. The procedure was successful in obtaining anatomical repair and relieving urinary symptoms.
