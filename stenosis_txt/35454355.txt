Title: Decompression and Interlaminar Stabilization for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: A Cohort Study and Two-Dimensional Operative Video.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Lumbar spinal stenosis is one of the most common causes of disability in the elderly and often necessitates surgical intervention in patients over the age of 65. Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of interlaminar stabilization following decompressive laminectomy in patients with lumbar stenosis without instability. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with lumbar stenosis underwent decompressive laminectomy and interlaminar stabilization at our academic institution. Clinical outcomes were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) at the 2-month, 6-month, and 1-year postoperative visits, and these outcomes were compared to the preoperative scores. Results: The average VAS scores for low back pain significantly improved from 8.8 preoperatively to 4.0, 3.7, and 3.9 at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.001). The average VAS scores for lower extremity pain significantly improved from 9.0 preoperatively to 2.7, 2.5, and 2.5 at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.001). The average ODI scores significantly improved from 66.6 preoperatively to 23.8, 23.3, and 24.5 at 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.001). There was no statistical significance for difference in VAS or ODI scores between 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year. One patient had an intraoperative durotomy that was successfully treated with local repair and lumbar drainage. Another patient had progression of stenosis and had to undergo bilateral facetectomy and fusion. Conclusions: Decompressive laminectomy and interlaminar stabilization in patients with spinal claudication and low back pain is a good surgical option in the absence of instability and may provide significant clinical improvement of pain and functional disability.
