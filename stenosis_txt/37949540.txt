Title: Physiologic Assessment After Percutaneous Coronary Interventions and Functionally Optimized Revascularization.

Abstract: Coronary physiologic assessment has become a standard of care for patients with coronary atherosclerotic disease. While most attention has focused on pre-interventional physiologic assessment to aid in revascularization decision-making, post-interventional physiologic assessment has not been as widely used, despite evidence supporting its role in assessment and optimization of the revascularization procedure. A thorough understanding of such evidence and ongoing studies would be crucial to incorporate post-interventional physiologic assessment into daily practice. Thus, this review provides a comprehensive overview of current evidence regarding the evolving role of physiologic assessment as a functional optimization tool for the entire revascularization process.
