Title: Patient-specific commissural alignment for ACURATE neo2 implantation in degenerated surgical bioprostheses.

Abstract: Valve-in-valve TAVI to treat failing surgical aortic valves (SAVs) is increasingly performed, and commissural alignment is a key technical aspect in such procedures. Surgeons optimize valve alignment, accounting for potential coronary eccentricity and achieving a patient-specific optimized commissural orientation, representing the ideal target for TAVI alignment. Therefore, here we present a dedicated stepwise valve-in-valve implantation technique using the ACURATE neo2. In a specific SAV postoverlap view, isolating one surgical post to the right of the screen representing the target for alignment, rotational orientation of the TAVI commissures, matching the SAV orientation, is achieved and verified before implantation. This technique has been tested in a patient-specific three-dimensionally-printed aortic root anatomy, attached to a pulsatile flow simulator, allowing for native-like simulation of coronary cannulations under fluoroscopy, and enabling detailed assessment with fluoroscopic as well as direct videographic visualization. Furthermore, the technique is exemplified by providing an educational clinical case example.
