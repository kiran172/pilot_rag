Title: An elevated platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with a higher risk of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that inflammation plays an important role in intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has recently emerged as a potential inflammatory biomarker. This study aimed to explore the association of the PLR with ICAS in a Chinese Han population.
METHODS: A total of 2134 participants (518 with ICAS, 1616 without ICAS) were enrolled in this study. ICAS was defined as atherosclerotic stenosis >50% or the occlusion of several main intracranial arteries. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association of the PLR with ICAS. Additional subgroup analyses were performed according to age (<60 vs. ≥60 years) and acute ischemic stroke.
RESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis showed that a high PLR was associated with a higher risk of ICAS in all participants ( P  < 0.001). Compared with the lowest quartile, the fourth PLR quartile was significantly associated with ICAS (OR 1.705, 95% confidence interval 1.278-2.275, P  < 0.001). In the subgroups stratified by age, an association between the PLR and ICAS was found in the late-life group ( P  < 0.001), but not in the mid-life group ( P  = 0.650). In the subgroups stratified by acute ischemic stroke, the relationship between an elevated PLR and a higher risk of ICAS remained unchanged (stroke group, P  < 0.001; non-stroke group, P  = 0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated PLR was associated with a higher risk of ICAS in a Chinese Han population. The PLR might serve as a potential biomarker for ICAS in the elderly population.
