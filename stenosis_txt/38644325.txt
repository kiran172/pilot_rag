Title: [A Case of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma Arising during Long-Term Follow-Up of Hepatolithiasis].

Abstract: A 91-year-old man had a history of cholecystectomy and choledochostomy for cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis. Eleven years earlier, intrahepatic stones were found in the posterior bile duct, and he did not wish to undergo treatment. Over time, worsening of the intrahepatic stones and dilation of the intrahepatic bile duct were observed. At 91 years old, enhanced abdominal CT revealed wall thickening of the hilar bile duct, and MRCP showed stenosis of the hilar bile duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed no contrast in the right intrahepatic bile duct and marked dilation of the left intrahepatic bile duct. Brush cytology confirmed adenocarcinoma, leading to a diagnosis of hilar cholangiocarcinoma. He underwent open right and caudal lobectomy with biliary reconstruction. Histopathological examination revealed a hilar cholangiocarcinoma, T3N1M0, Stage â…¢c, mainly located at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. This case suggests a potential association between hepatolithiasis and hilar cholangiocarcinoma, emphasizing the importance of regular imaging examinations for timely surgical resection. Early intervention, including liver resection, is recommended for the management of hepatolithiasis.
