Title: Significance of atherosclerotic plaque location in recanalizing non-acute long-segment occlusion of the internal carotid artery.

Abstract: To investigate the significance of atherosclerotic plaque location in hybrid surgery comprising both endovascular recanalization approaches and carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic atherosclerotic non-acute long-segment occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), 162 patients were enrolled, including 120 (74.1%) patients in the proximal plaque group and 42 (25.9%) in the distal plaque group. Surgical recanalization was performed in all patients, with successful recanalization in 119 (99.2%) patients in the proximal and 39 (92.9%) in the distal plaque group. The total successful recanalization rate was 97.5% (158/162) with a failure rate of 2.5% (4/162). Periprocedural complications occurred in 5 (4.2% or 5/120) patients in the proximal plaque group, including neck infection in two (1.7%), recurrent nerve injury in 1 (0.8%), and laryngeal edema in 2 (1.7%), and 2 (4.8%) in the distal plaque group, including femoral puncture infection in 2 (4.8%). No severe complications occurred in either group. Univariate analysis showed plaque location was a significant (P = 0.018) risk factor for successful recanalization, and multivariate analysis indicated that the plaque location remained a significant independent risk factor for recanalization success (P = 0.017). In follow-up 6-48 months after the recanalization surgery, reocclusion occurred in two (2.8%) patients in the proximal plaque group and 4 (13.3%) in the distal plaque group. In conclusion, although hybrid surgery achieves similar outcomes in patients with ICA occlusion caused by either proximal or distal atherosclerotic plaques, plaque location may be a significant risk factor for successful recanalization of symptomatic non-acute long-segment ICA occlusion.
