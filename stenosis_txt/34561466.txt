Title: Physiological significance of pericoronary inflammation in epicardial functional stenosis and global coronary flow reserve.

Abstract: Both fractional flow reserve (FFR) and global coronary flow reserve (g-CFR) provide prognostic information in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Inflammation plays a vital role in impaired endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic progression, potentially predicting cardiovascular mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the physiological significance of pericoronary adipose tissue inflammation assessed by CT attenuation (PCATA) in epicardial functional stenosis severity and g-CFR in patients with CAD. A total of 131 CAD patients with a single de novo epicardial coronary stenosis who underwent coronary CT-angiography (CCTA), phase-contrast cine-magnetic resonance imaging (PC-CMR) and FFR measurement were studied. PCATA was assessed using the mean CT attenuation value. G-CFR was obtained by quantifying absolute coronary sinus flow (ml/min/g) by PC-CMR at rest and during maximum hyperemia. Median FFR, g-CFR, and PCATA values were 0.75, 2.59, and - 71.3, respectively. Serum creatinine, NT-proBNP, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and PCATA were independently associated with g-CFR. PCATA showed a significant incremental predictive efficacy for impaired g-CFR (<â€‰2.0) when added to the clinical risk model. PCATA was significantly associated with g-CFR, independent of FFR. Our results suggest the pathophysiological mechanisms linking perivascular inflammation with g-CFR in CAD patients.
