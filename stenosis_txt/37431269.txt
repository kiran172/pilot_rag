Title: Decreased expression of RPL15 and RPL18 exacerbated the calcification of valve interstitial cells during aortic valve calcification.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common valvular heart disease, with an increasing prevalence due to an aging population. The pathobiology of CAVD is a multifaceted and actively regulated process, but the detailed mechanisms have not been elucidated. The present study aims to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in calcified aortic valve tissues, and to analyze the correlation between DEGs and clinical features in CAVD patients. The DEGs were screened by microarray in normal and CAVD groups (n = 2 for each group), and confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in normal (n = 12) and calcified aortic valve tissues (n = 34). A total of 1048 DEGs were identified in calcified aortic valve tissues, including 227 upregulated mRNAs and 821 downregulated mRNAs. Based on multiple bioinformatic analyses, three 60S ribosomal subunit components (RPL15, RPL18, and RPL18A), and two 40S ribosomal subunit components (RPS15 and RPS21) were identified as the top 5 hub genes in the protein-protein interaction network of DEGs. The expression of RPL15 and RPL18 was also found significantly decreased in calcified aortic valve tissues (both p < .01), and negatively correlated with the osteogenic differentiation marker OPN in CAVD patients (both p < .01). Moreover, inhibition of RPL15 or RPL18 exacerbated the calcification of valve interstitial cells under osteogenic induction conditions. The present study proved that decreased expression of RPL15 and RPL18 was closely associated with aortic valve calcification, which provided valuable clues to find therapeutic targets for CAVD.
