Title: Malament stitch and increased risk of bladder neck stenosis: any association following open prostatectomy in Enugu Southeast Nigeria.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Malament stitch is one of the effective techniques employed to minimize bleeding in simple open prostatectomy but concerns about possibility of increased risk of bladder neck stenosis has limited its routine use.
AIM: We studied patients who had open prostatectomy with Malament stitch to determine the incidence of bladder neck stenosis amongst them.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 72patients who had simple open prostatectomy in which malament stitch was applied from 2010 to 2020. A proforma was designed to collect data. Pretreatment variables were transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) volume of prostate, pretreatment IPSS value, postvoidal residual urine volume before surgery, weight of enucleated prostate adenoma, time to removal of Malament stitch. Outcome measures were done with post treatment IPSS and PVR at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. Cystoscopy was done at 3 months or 6 months for patients with rising outcome measures to determine presence of bladder neck stenosis.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients in this study was 68.3 years (SD = 7.1, range 52-82). The mean of the pretreatment score for IPSS was 30.7 (SD = 3.9, range 18-34) and 5.9 (SD = 0.2) for QOLS. The mean weight of prostate estimated with ultrasound was 169.5 g and mean weight of enucleated adenoma of the prostate was 132.5 g. The mean time of removal of Malament stitch was 23.1 h. Only 3 (4.2%) patients required cystoscopy because of increasing IPSS and PVR at 3 months postprostatectomy. 2 (2.8%) patients out of 72patients were confirmed to have bladder neck stenosis at cystoscopy.
CONCLUSION: Malament stitch did not lead to significant incidence of bladder neck stenosis in this study.
