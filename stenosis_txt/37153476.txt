Title: Left Ventricular Outflow Obstruction From Mechanical Circulatory Support in Critical Aortic Stenosis: A Cautionary Tale.

Abstract: We submit a cautionary tale of a patient with critical aortic stenosis presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty, insertion of a transvalvular left percutaneous ventricular assist device and high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, with a post-operative course complicated by outflow obstruction from the device itself. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
