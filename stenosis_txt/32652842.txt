Title: Women with chronic kidney disease undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Caveat emptor.

Abstract: Over 60% of women presenting for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have coexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD). In women undergoing TAVR, CKD was associated with significantly higher rates of adverse events, including a twofold higher rate of risk-adjusted mortality at 1â€‰year. This study is an important step forward in our understanding of risk stratification in women with CKD undergoing TAVR and suggests that measures to optimize outcomes warrant further investigation in this high-risk group of patients.
