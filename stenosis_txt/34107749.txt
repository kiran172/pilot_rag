Title: Endovascular interventions in main renal artery pathologies: an overview and update.

Abstract: Renal arteries are involved in a wide spectrum of pathologies including atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, Takayasu arteritis, aneurysms, and aortic type B dissections extending into main renal arteries. They manifest as renovascular hypertension, renal ischemia, and cardiovascular dysfunction. The location of the renal arteries in relation to the abdominal aortic aneurysm is a critical determinant of interventional options and long-term prognosis. This article provides a comprehensive review of the role of interventional radiologists in transcatheter interventions in various pathologies involving the main renal arteries with analysis of epidemiology, pathophysiology, newer interventional techniques, and management options.
