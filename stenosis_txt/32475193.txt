Title: Transcranial duplex ultrasound monitoring of intracranial arterial stenosis treated with ELUTAX "3" drug-eluting balloon.

Abstract: We report the results of transcranial ultrasound monitoring in three patients with intracranial arterial stenosis of the middle cerebral artery treated with the only drug-eluting balloon certificated for intracranial use in highly symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, ELUTAX "3" (AR Baltic Medical). We performed transcranial Doppler ultrasounds 24 h, 72 h, 10 days, 15 days and 30 days after the angioplasty, thereby measuring mean flow velocity (MFV) in the maximum stenosis area in patients with symptomatic steno-occlusive disease of the middle cerebral artery treated with ELUTAX "3". Two patients were treated during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) due to acute ischemic stroke and one patient was treated on elective basis due to symptomatic pre-occlusive stenosis, with recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) refractory to medical therapy. In Case 1, the first transcranial Doppler ultrasounds evidenced MFV of 348 cm/s, with progressive MFV reduction until 15 days post-treatment, with MFV of 177 cm/s. In Case 2, 24 h after angioplasty had an MFV of 258 cm/s, decreasing to 103 cm/s at 30 days. Case 3 had an MFV of 436 cm/s before angioplasty that immediately decreased after the procedure to 364 cm/s, with a final MFV of 260 cm/s at 30 days. We have recorded a progressive MFV reduction in intracranial arterial stenosis, with better outcomes in patients treated during MT. In our experience, the use of ELUTAX "3" for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis achieves a progressive improvement of stenosis, evident in the first weeks, to a higher extent in cases of occlusive thrombosis. More studies are needed to provide more information about this device.
