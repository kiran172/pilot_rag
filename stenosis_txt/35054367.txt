Title: Significant Stenosis of the Brachiocephalic Trunk and Moderate Stenosis of the Left Circumflex Artery in Computed Tomography Angiography Images.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis, as a civilization disease, is a serious epidemiological problem. Significant carotid disease and significant coronary artery disease result in acute consequences, such as ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction, which are the major causes of cardiovascular mortality. Typically, atherosclerosis of the aortic arch branches involves the bulbs of the common carotid arteries and the proximal segments of the internal carotid arteries, and can be effectively assessed by ultrasonography. Computed tomography angiography enables the identification of patients with less typical clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, e.g., brachiocephalic trunk stenosis with symptoms of the steal syndrome and moderate stenosis in the coronary arteries. We present examples of computed tomography angiography images of this type of changes.
