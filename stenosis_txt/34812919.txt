Title: Relationship between cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome and the immediate change of cerebral blood flow after carotid artery stenting evaluated by single-photon emission computed tomography.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is a critical complication after carotid artery stenting (CAS). However, few CAS studies have evaluated immediate and temporary changes in ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantitatively. The study was performed to evaluate immediate changes in CBF after CAS and subsequent CBF changes in patients with cerebral hyperperfusion (HP) using 123I-IMP SPECT.
METHODS: The subjects were 223 patients with chronic extracranial carotid artery stenosis who underwent CAS in our department between March 2010 and March 2020. Quantitative CBF and cerebrovascular reactivity to acetazolamide in the middle cerebral artery were assessed before CAS by 123I-IMP SPECT. CBF was also measured immediately after CAS by 123I-IMP SPECT. When HP was detected, CBF was measured again 3 and 7 days after CAS.
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) ipsilateral quantitative CBF change after CAS was - 0.1% (- 9.5-8.2%), and the upper value of the 95% CI of the quantitative CBF change was 48.2%. Thus, we defined HP after CAS as an increase in quantitative CBF of > 48.2% compared with the preoperative value. Of 223 patients, 5 (2.2%) had HP, and 4 of these patients (80%) developed CHS. In the CHS patients, HP was maintained for about 3 days and improved after about 7 days.
CONCLUSION: An immediate CBF increase of > 48.2% after CAS may lead to development of CHS. In CHS after CAS, HP persisted for about 1 week and postoperative management may be required for at least 1 week.
