Title: Differences in coronary vasodilatory capacity and atherosclerosis in endurance athletes using coronary CTA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD): Comparison with a sedentary lifestyle.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim was to assess the effect of endurance exercise on coronary vasodilatory capacity and atherosclerosis by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling.
METHODS: 100 subjects (age 56.2y±11, 29 females) who underwent coronary CTA were included into this retrospectively matched cohort study. Endurance athletes (≥1 h per unit and ≥3 times per week training) were compared to controls with a sedentary lifestyle, and within subgroups with and without sublingual nitroglycerin preparation. CTA image analysis included coronary stenosis severity (CADRADS), total (segment involvement score = SIS) and mixed plaque burden (G-score), high-risk plaque criteria, the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and CFD analysis including Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>), myocardial mass (M), total vessel lumen volume (V) and volume-to-mass (V/M) ratio.
RESULTS: The prevalence of atherosclerosis by CTA was 65.4 % and &gt;50 % coronary stenosis was found in 17.3 % of athletes. Coronary stenosis severity (CADRADS), total and mixed non-calcified plaque burden (SIS and G-score) were lower in athletes (p = 0.003 and p &lt; 0.001) but not CACS (p = 0.055) and less high-risk plaques were found (p &lt; 0.001). The G-score was correlated with distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> (p = 0.025). V/M-ratio was different between athletes who received nitroglycerin compared with those who did not (V/M: 21.1 vs. 14.8; p &lt; 0.001), but these differences were not observed in the control subjects.
CONCLUSION: Endurance training improves coronary vasodilatory capacity and reduces high-risk plaque and mixed non-calcifed plaque burden as assessed by coronary CTA angiography. Our study may advocate coronary CTA with FFR<sub>CT</sub> for evaluation of coronary artery disease in endurance athletes.
