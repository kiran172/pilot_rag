Title: Novel markers of ventricular repolarization are associated with mortality in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common degenerative valvular heart disease that can affect left ventricular functions. Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio is a novel repolarization marker which is associated with adverse cardiovascular events in several cardiovascular diseases. In our study, our aim is to investigate the prognostic effect of Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios on mortality in patients who underwent successful surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
METHODS: A total of three hundred seventy-five patients undergoing successful surgical AVR were included in this study. Then, patients were divided into two groups according to mortality as group 1 without mortality (342 patients) and group 2 with mortality (33 patients). Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc ratios were calculated for both groups.
RESULTS: Tp-e interval (71 (63.7-77); 86 (84-88), p < .001), Tp-e/QT ratio (0.19 (0.17-0.20); 0.23 (0.22-0.23), p < .001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (0.17 ± 0.02; 0.21 ± 0.01, p < .001) were higher in group 2 compared to group 1. In multivariate logistic regression analyses Tp-e interval (odds ratio [OR]: 1.315, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.203-1.437, p < .001), Tp-e/QT ratio (OR: 7.334, 95% CI: 3.274-1.643, p < .001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (OR: 2.567, 95% CI: 4.106-1.605, p < .001) were found to be independent predictors of mortality. Additionally, a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also revealed that long term survival was found to be significantly decreased in patients with higher Tp-e/QT ratio (Log-Rank p < .001) and Tp-e/QTc ratio (Log-Rank p < .001).
CONCLUSION: Tp-e interval, Tp-e dispersion, Tp-e/QT, and Tp-e/QTc ratios are associated with worse prognosis after surgical AVR in patients with severe AS. All of them are also independent predictors of mortality.
