Title: Natural history of initially asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a one-stage meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Current guidelines on the management strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) remain unclear. This uncertainty stems from the lack of data regarding the natural history of these patients. To address this gap, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the natural history of asymptomatic severe AS patients receiving conservative treatment.
METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched from inception to 24 January 2024 using the keywords "asymptomatic" AND "aortic" AND "stenosis". We included studies examining patients with asymptomatic severe AS. In interventional trials, only data from conservatively managed arms were collected. A one-stage meta-analysis was conducted using individual patient data reconstructed from published Kaplan-Meier curves. Sensitivity analysis was performed for major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients who remained asymptomatic throughout follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 46 studies were included (n = 9545). The median time to the development of symptoms was 1.11 years (95% CI 0.90-1.53). 49.36% (40.85-58.59) of patients who were asymptomatic had suffered a major adverse cardiovascular event by 5 years. The median event-free time for heart failure hospitalization (HFH) was 5.50 years (95% CI 5.14-5.91) with 36.34% (95% CI 33.34-39.41) of patients experiencing an HFH by year 5. By 5 years, 79.81% (95% CI 69.26-88.58) of patients developed symptoms (angina, dyspnoea, syncope and others) and 12.36% (95% CI 10.01-15.22) of patients died of cardiovascular causes. For all-cause mortality, the median survival time was 9.15 years (95% CI 8.50-9.96) with 39.43% (CI 33.41-36.40) of patients dying by 5 years. The median time to AVR was 4.77 years (95% CI 4.39-5.17), with 52.64% (95% CI 49.85-55.48) of patients requiring an AVR by 5 years.
CONCLUSION: Our results reveal poor cardiovascular outcomes for patients with asymptomatic severe AS on conservative treatment. A significant proportion eventually requires an AVR. Further research is needed to determine if early intervention with AVR is more effective than conservative treatment.
