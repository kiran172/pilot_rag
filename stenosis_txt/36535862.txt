Title: Functional outcomes after prostate cancer treatment: A comparison between single and multiple modalities.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is a widely common and treatable disease, and functional outcomes can greatly affect survivor quality of life. A retrospective review of the SEER-Medicare database was performed to identify patients who underwent prostate cancer treatment between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2013 and review the rates of diagnosis and treatment of common functional side effects of surgery, radiation, or a combination of the 2 and perform a comparison of the outcomes. A total of 67,527 patients were included in the analysis. Radiation therapy (RT)-only compared to radical prostatectomy (RP)-only had lower rates of diagnosis of erectile dysfunction (30.4%, 95% CI 29.9%-30.9% vs. 56.1%, 95% CI 55.1%-57.04%, P < 0.0001), UI (29.7%, 95% CI 29.0%-30.3% vs. 44.5%, 95% CI 43.3%-45.6%, P < 0.0001), but higher rates of urethral stricture disease (8.44%, 95% CI 8.1%-8.8% vs. 5.35%, 95% CI 4.9%-5.9%, P < 0.0001), cystitis (33.1% 95% CI 32.4%-33.7% vs. 20.3%, 95% CI 19.2%-21.4%, P < 0.0001), and proctitis (14.7%, 95% CI 14.3%-15.1& vs. 2.75%, 95% CI 2.3%-3.3%, P < 0.0001). Compared to either single modality, the RP-then-RT group had higher incontinence medication use (12.0% 95% CI 10.8%-13.2% vs. 9.8%, 95% CI 9.5%-10.1% for RT-only and 8.3%, 95% CI 7.8%-8.8% for RP-only, P < 0.0001), overall incontinence therapy (18.5%, 95%CI 17.1%-20.0% vs. 10.2%, 95%CI 9.9%-10.5% for RT-only and 14.9%, 95% CI 14.3%-15.5% for RP-only, P < 0.0001), and stricture therapy (12.7%, 95% CI 11.5%-13.9% vs. 8.2%, 95% CI 8.0%-8.5% for RT-only and 9.1% 95% CI 8.6%-9.6% for RP-only, P < 0.0001). The RT-then-RP group had higher rates of stricture (25.4% compared to 8.2% for RT-only, 9.1% for RP-only, and 12.7% for RP-then-RT) and fistula (1.0% compared to 0.07% for RT-only, 0.18% for RP-only, and 0.092% for RP-then-RT) treatment than all the other groups. Multimodality therapy is generally associated with higher treatments rates for conditions such as erectile dysfunction , incontinence, urethral stricture disease , irritative cystitis and proctitis in patients older than 65. Radiation therapy followed by prostatectomy is associated with significantly worse functional outcomes. Patients undergoing or anticipating undergoing multimodality therapy for prostate cancer should be counseled regarding the possibility of increased risk of declining functional outcomes.
