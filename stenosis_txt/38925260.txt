Title: Impact of Persistent Versus Paroxysmal Preoperative Atrial Fibrillation on In-Hospital, One-Year, and Late Clinical Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Previous reports on the impact of preexisting atrial fibrillation (AF) on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have presented limited data on the relative impact of paroxysmal versus persistent AF subtypes. We compared in-hospital, 1-year, and late clinical outcomes in 1,098 patients who underwent TAVI with preoperative AF (556 paroxysmal, 542 persistent) versus 1,787 patients without AF. The propensity-matched cohorts with AF (n = 643) and without AF (n = 686) did not differ with respect to baseline clinical characteristics, operative technique, or in-hospital TAVI complications. At 1-year, patients with AF had higher all-cause mortality (9.0% vs 6.1%, p = 0.046) and readmission rates (13.1 vs 8.8%, p = 0.014), with lower Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire scores (77.8 ± 21.8 vs 84.3 ± 17.1, p &lt;0.001). Echocardiographic follow-up (mean time 455 ± 285 days) demonstrated no significant intergroup differences in hemodynamic findings other than a progressive increase in left atrial volume index in patient subgroups (without AF: 37.4 ± 14.7 ml/m2 vs paroxysmal AF: 46.4 ± 21.4 ml/m2 vs persistent AF: 60.5 ± 26.3 ml/m2, p &lt;0.001). On late follow-up (mean time 49.0 [45.1 to 52.9] months), patients with persistent AF had worse all-cause mortality than patients without AF (hazard ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 2.06, p = 0.003), with no significant survival differences between the paroxysmal AF and without AF subgroups. In conclusion, patients with preexisting AF and patients without AF who underwent TAVI had similar in-hospital outcomes but worse 1-year mortality, hospital readmission, and quality of life outcomes. Compared with patients without AF, patients with persistent but not paroxysmal preexisting AF have higher late all-cause mortality at a mean follow-up of 49 months. Patients with persistent AF have higher levels of left atrial volume index than patients with paroxysmal AF and patients without AF on intermediate echocardiographic follow-up.
