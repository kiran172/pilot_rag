Title: Changes of retinal structure and function in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the structural and functional changes of the retina in patients with different degrees of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included patients with varying degrees ICA stenosis. Clinical characteristics of 41 patients were collected after being divided into four groups according to the ICA stenosis indicated by computed tomographic angiography (Group 0: without ICA stenosis, Group 1: ipsilateral slight ICA stenosis, Group 2: ipsilateral moderate ICA stenosis, Group 3: ipsilateral severe ICA stenosis). Retinal vessel caliber (RVC) was measured quantitatively with the Integrative Vessel Analysis software. The retinal sensitivity was examined with the MP-3 microperimeter. The relationships among central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), central retinal vein equivalent, arteriole to venule ratio (AVR), mean retinal sensitivity (MS) and ICA stenosis degree were analysed.
RESULTS: The CRAE in Group 3 were significantly smaller compared with Group 0, Group 1 and Group 2 (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.002). Significant decrease was found between Group 3 with other groups in MS at fovea (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.002). Moreover, there was a positive correlation found between MS and CRAE (Beta = 0.60, P < 0.001 at fovea; Beta = 0.64, P < 0.001 at 2 degree; Beta = 0.60, P < 0.001 at 4 degree; Beta = 0.55, P < 0.001 at 8 degree; Beta = 0.53, P < 0.001 at 12 degree).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed smaller CRAE and AVR in ipsilateral severe ICA stenosis patients. And the MS decreased in patients with severe ICA stenosis. In addition, MS had a positive correlation with CRAE.
