Title: Long Survival after Gastrointestinal Bleeding in a New-Onset Heyde's Syndrome Patient Treated with Multiple Endoscopic Hemostatic Procedures and Repeated Transfusions after Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Heyde's syndrome, which is caused by aortic stenosis and subsequent acquired von Willebrand factor deficiency, is a gastrointestinal bleeding disease. Gastrointestinal bleeding develops in patients with Heyde's syndrome, which may have a different prognosis from general gastrointestinal bleeding; thus, it is important to understand the clinical course. We report a 76-year-old Japanese female who underwent aortic mechanical valve replacement 1 year ago and presented with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in angiodysplasia of the sigmoid colon. Endoscopic interventions achieved hemostasis. However, 6 rebleeding events occurred due to a sigmoid colon ulcer and gastric and jejunal angiodysplasia 7 years after first hemostasis. The patient underwent multiple endoscopic hemostatic procedures (upper, lower, and balloon-assisted endoscopy) and repeated transfusions (total of 394 units of red blood cells). The intensive treatment contributed to the survival time of 10 years. In addition, we performed a literature review of the prognosis of patients with Heyde's syndrome.
