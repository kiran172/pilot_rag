Title: Prognostic value of left atrial volume index in degenerative mitral stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Degenerative mitral stenosis (DMS) is associated with a poor prognosis. Although mean transmitral gradient (TMG) has shown a good correlation with outcome, little is known about the association between other echocardiographic parameters and prognosis in patients with DMS. The current study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of left atrial volume index (LAVI) in patients with DMS.
METHODS: A total of 155 patients with DMS (72[63-80] years, 67% female) were included. The population was divided according to LAVI: normal-sized LAVI (LAVI â‰¤ 34 ml/m2); and enlarged LAVI (> 34 ml/m2).
RESULTS: Patients with enlarged LAVI had a higher left ventricular mass index (120[96-146] vs. 91[70-112] g/m2 p < 0.001), as well as a higher prevalence of significant mitral regurgitation and severe aortic stenosis (23% vs. 10% p = 0.046 and 38% vs. 15% p=0.001, respectively) compared to patients with normal-sized LAVI. During a median follow-up of 25 months, 56 (36%) patients died. Patients with enlarged LAVI had worse prognosis compared to patients with normal-sized LAVI (p = 0.026). In multivariable Cox regression model, an enlarged LAVI was independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR 2.009, 95% CI 1.040 to 3.880, P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: An enlarged LAVI (> 34 ml/m2) is significantly associated with excess mortality in patients with DMS. After adjusting for potential confounders, an enlarged LAVI was the only parameter that remained independently associated with prognosis.
