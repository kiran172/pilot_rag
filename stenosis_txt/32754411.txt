Title: Aortic Stenosis Complicated by Gastrointestinal Arteriovenous Malformations: It is not Always Heyde Syndrome.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) and arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are a common coexisting pathology in the elderly. When both pathologies are combined, Heyde syndrome is a differential that is widely explored among clinicians. Unfortunately, this may not always be the case. We present a case of an 82-year-old female admitted for acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with a history of AVMs and AS, as well as, an algorithm in diagnosing elderly patients with both pathologies.
