Title: Serum Level of Cadherin-P (CDH3) Is a Novel Predictor of Cardiovascular Events Related to Atherosclerosis in a 3-Year Follow-Up Study.

Abstract: Background: Placental cadherin (CDH3) is an adhesion molecule expressed in many malignant tumors. The role of serum CDH3 in atherosclerosis is unclear. Methods: This 3-year follow-up study measured atherosclerosis and serum CDH3 in 218 angiography inpatients. Coronary stenosis was assessed as the Gensini score. The brachiocephalic and femoral plaques were quantified by ultrasound. Microarray serum profiling was conducted in selected samples. CDH3 in the serum was measured using an indirect ELISA. The odds ratio (OR), ROC analysis, and logistic regressions were used to evaluate the associations between CDH3 content, atherosclerotic lesions, and various serum biomarkers. Results: Serum CDH3 was associated with the severity of atherosclerosis and diastolic blood pressure. The levels of CDH3 were able to discriminate patients with total subclinical and hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic lesions in all circulation pools (coronary, brachiocephalic, and femoral). Elevated serum CDH3 appeared to be a risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes after 3-year follow up with OR = 1.81 (95% CI: 1.07-3.72; p = 0.022). Endothelin-1 and NOx were associated with the content of CDH3 in the serum, suggesting the involvement of certain signal transduction pathways that may participate in plaque formation. Conclusions: CDH3 was associated with cardiovascular outcomes adjusted for coronary plaque presence, indicating a role of CDH3 in plaque biology.
