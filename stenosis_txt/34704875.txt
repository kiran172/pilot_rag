Title: Radioactive Seed Strand Efficacy in Superior Vena Cava Stenting Due to Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Obstruction.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aims to determine the clinical effectiveness of a stent with radioactive seed strand (RSS) inserted in patients with superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction (SVCO) secondary to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Between January 2013 and December 2019, 63 patients with SVCO related to NSCLC received stent implantation with (n = 30) or without (n = 33) RSS insertion at our center. The clinical efficacy, stent patency duration, and overall survival (OS) were compared between these two groups.
RESULTS: Both groups achieved 100% clinical and technical success rates. There were no obstacles associated with the procedure performed for the patients. Two patients in the RSS group and 7 patients in the stent-alone group experienced stent re-stenosis. The rate of re-stenosis between the two groups was not significantly different (P = .099). Patients in the RSS group had significantly longer median patency than those in the stent-alone group (381 vs 309 days, P = .045). All patients died because of the development of tumors during the follow-up. Patients in the RSS group had a significantly longer median OS than those in the stent-alone group (229 vs 178 days, P = .026). During the follow-up, no patient in the RSS group suffered RSS migration or brachytherapy-related complications.
CONCLUSION: For patients with SVCO secondary to NSCLC, a stent with RSS insertion is efficacious and safe, and it may improve stent patency and OS.
