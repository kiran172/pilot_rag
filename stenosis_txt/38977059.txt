Title: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 24 Month Patency After Endovenous Stenting of Superior Vena Cava, Subclavian, and Brachiocephalic Vein Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to appraise recent evidence assessing patency outcomes at various time points in patients with superior vena cava, subclavian, and brachiocephalic vein stenosis who had undergone stenting.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies up to December 2022.
REVIEW METHODS: Measured outcomes included technical success rate, primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency at various time points. A subgroup analysis was also conducted to compare malignant and benign obstruction. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: Thirty nine studies reporting outcomes in 1 539 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Primary patency up to one year after the procedure was 81.5% (95% CI 74.5 - 86.9%). Primary patency declined after one year to 63.2% (95% CI 51.9 - 73.1%) at 12 - 24 months. Primary assisted patency and secondary patency at ≥ 24 months were 72.7% (95% CI 49.1 - 88.0%) and 76.6% (95% CI 51.1 - 91.1%). In the subgroup analysis, primary patency was significantly higher in patients with a malignant stenosis compared with a benign stenosis at 1 - 3 and 12 - 24 months. No significant difference was seen for pooled secondary patency rates when comparing the malignant and benign subgroups. GRADE analysis determined the certainty of evidence for all outcomes to be very low.
CONCLUSION: Stenting is an effective intervention for benign and malignant stenosis of the superior vena cava, subclavian, and brachiocephalic veins. Primary patency rates were good up to one year after the procedure, with 81.5% of stents retaining patency at 6 - 12 months. Patency rates declined after one year, to 63.2% primary and 89.3% secondary patency at 12 - 24 months, showing improved outcomes following re-intervention. High quality evidence is lacking. More research is needed to investigate patency outcomes and the need for surveillance or re-intervention programs.
