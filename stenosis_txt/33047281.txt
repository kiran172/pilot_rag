Title: Normal myocardial perfusion despite a very high coronary calcium score.

Abstract: An exceptionally high coronary calcium score, greater than 10,000 UA, superior to any other found in the literature reviewed, was reported in an asymptomatic, adult man with hypertension, obesity and dyslipidemia, without myocardial ischemia and no significative coronary stenosis, associated to Glagov's phenomenon in the left coronary artery and an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
