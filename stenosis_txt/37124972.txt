Title: Vasospastic angina in women: Clinical backgrounds and prognoses of patients younger than and older than 60 years.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We frequently encounter cases of women with vasospastic angina (VSA). Additionally, some women with VSA are younger than 60 years old. However, it is unknown whether the characteristics of VSA in women aged < 60 years are different from those in women aged ≥ 60 years.
AIM: To investigate and compare the clinical characteristics and prognosis of VSA in women aged < 60 years from those in women aged ≥ 60 years.
METHODS: We enrolled 94 women with VSA who were diagnosed using the spasm provocation test. According to the age at diagnosis, the patients were divided into two groups: Group Y (age &lt; 60 years, n = 17) and Group O (age ≥ 60 years, n = 77). Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced dilation (NID) of the brachial artery were performed and assessed using brachial ultrasonography. Moreover, conventional coronary risk factors, such as atherosclerotic lesions (stenosis &gt; 20%) detected using coronary angiography and focal spasms (coronary spasm within one segment of one coronary artery), and major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE) were assessed in both groups.
RESULTS: Smoking was more prevalent in Group Y than in Group O (P = 0.04). FMD was similar in both groups (Group O: 4.3% ± 3.2%, Group Y: 4.5% ± 3.3%; P = 0.75), whereas NID was higher in Group Y (20.5% ± 8.6%) than in Group O (13.6% ± 5.3%, P &lt; 0.01). Atherosclerosis was not detected in Group Y but was detected in Group O (61%, P &lt; 0.01). Focal spasms were less frequent in Group Y (12%) than in Group O (38%, P = 0.04). The incidence of major adverse cardiac events did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.40).
CONCLUSION: Women aged < 60 years with VSA have less atherosclerotic lesions and focal spasms. These characteristics may be affected by smoking habits and vascular smooth muscle dysfunction.
