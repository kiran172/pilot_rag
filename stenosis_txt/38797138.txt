Title: Sex differences in outcomes of carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Existing evidence is inconclusive on whether women after carotid artery stenting (CAS) experience worse outcomes than men.
METHODS: The outcomes of women and men were compared using the data from nationwide retrospective registry between 2015 and 2019. The primary outcome was the incidence of ischemic stroke and all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of ischemic stroke, all-cause death, acute occlusion, and acute myocardial infarction. Functional outcomes were the achieving an mRS score of 0-1 and 0-2. Outcomes were assessed at 30 days after CAS.
RESULTS: In total, 9792 patients (1330 women, 8862 men; mean age, 73.8 vs 73.5 years, p = 0.17) were analyzed. Symptomatic stenosis was common in men (52.0% vs. 55.1%; p = 0.03), while ≥50% stenosis after CAS was common in women (3.2% vs. 2.0%; p = 0.005). The primary outcome was no significantly difference in women and men (2.0% vs. 1.9%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.19; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 0.75-1.88).The incidence of all-cause death was higher in women (0.9% vs. 0.5%; aOR, 2.45; 95%CI, 1.11-5.39). Functional outcomes were significantly less common in women than in men (mRS0-1, 72.6% vs. 74.8%; aOR, 0.77; 95%CI, 0.63-0.95; mRS0-2, 82.1% vs. 85.6%; aOR, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.60-0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there was no significant sex differences in the incidence of ischemic stroke and all-cause death at 30 days. However, women have higher rate of all-cause death and poorer functional outcomes at 30 days than men.
