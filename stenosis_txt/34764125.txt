Title: Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in a pregnant woman with severe pulmonary valve restenosis.

Abstract: A 34-year-old woman, a known case of valvular heart disease, post balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty done 8 years ago during her first pregnancy, presented with progressive exertional breathlessness with New York Heart Association class III symptoms in her third trimester of pregnancy. On examination, she had features of right heart failure. ECG showed right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe pulmonary valve stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular and atrial dilatation with reduced right ventricular function. As the patient was symptomatic, she underwent percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. The procedure was successful with a significant reduction in the pulmonary valve gradient and the patient was discharged in stable condition with reduced symptoms. The timely intervention of the valvular stenotic lesion in pregnancy reduces the mortality risk to both the mother and the fetus.
