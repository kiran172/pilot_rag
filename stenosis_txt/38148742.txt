Title: Chest pain due to coronary artery compression in an adult with CHD.

Abstract: A 47-year-old with repaired ventricular septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis as a child presents with chronic intermittent chest pain. CT evaluation for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement revealed right coronary artery compression between a sternal wire and dilated right ventricle. Removal of the sternal wire resulted in improved symptoms.
