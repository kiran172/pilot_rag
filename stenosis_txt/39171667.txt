Title: Snodgrass (tubularized incised plate) versus Mathieu repair of distal hypospadias: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Distal hypospadias accounts for the majority of hypospadias. Mathieu and Snodgrass techniques are widely used for repair of distal hypospadias but their comparative efficacy and reported outcomes are still debated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the outcomes of these two techniques.
METHODS: Electronic databases and trial registries were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Mathieu and Snodgrass techniques for primary distal hypospadias repair. Outcome measures included complication rates and cosmetic outcomes. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the ROB2. Data was analyzed using Review Manager 5.4; Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) also was conducted for important outcomes.
RESULTS: Twelve RCTs were eligible for inclusion. The Snodgrass technique showed a significantly lower incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula (UCF) (RR 0.48, 95% CI [0.30-0.77]). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of meatal stenosis (MS) between the two (RR 1.64, 95% CI [0.85-3.15]). TSA supports the findings for outcome UCF but not for MS. Operative time was shorter with the Snodgrass technique.
CONCLUSION: This SRMA indicates a lower incidence of UCF with Snodgrass technique compared to the Mathieu technique in distal hypospadias repair. However, there was no significant difference in the risk of MS.
