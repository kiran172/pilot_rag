Title: Intracranial arterial stenosis and recurrence in stroke patients with different risk stratifications by Essen stroke risk score.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate whether the prognostic value of intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS) is consistent across different risk stratifications using the Essen Stroke Risk score (ESRS).
METHODS: We derived data from the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events trial. Patients without complete baseline brain imaging data were excluded. Participants were categorized into different risk groups based on ESRS (low risk, 0-2, and high risk ≥ 3). The main outcome was stroke recurrence within 3 and 12 months. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) of ICAS, and other factors associated with stroke recurrence within 3 and 12 months were estimated using the Cox regression method.
RESULTS: During the 3-month follow-up, 54 patients (7.9%) had recurrent stroke in the low-risk group, and 39 patients (9.6%) had recurrent stroke in the high-risk group. ICAS was associated with a higher risk of stroke within 3 months (HR = 2.761; 95%CI = 1.538-4.957; P &lt; 0.001) in the low-risk group, but not in the high-risk group (HR = 1.501; 95%CI = 0.701-3.213; P = 0.296). ICAS was independently associated with higher recurrent risk in the low-risk group (HR = 2.540; 95%CI = 1.472-4.381; P &lt; 0.001), but not in the high-risk group (HR = 1.951; 95%CI = 0.977-3.893; P = 0.058) within 12 months.
CONCLUSION: ICAS was an independent predictor of both 3- and 12-month stroke recurrence in low-risk but not high-risk patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack according to ESRS stratification.
