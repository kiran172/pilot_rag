Title: Functional cardiac CT-Going beyond Anatomical Evaluation of Coronary Artery Disease with Cine CT, CT-FFR, CT Perfusion and Machine Learning.

Abstract: The aim of this review is to provide an overview of different functional cardiac CT techniques which can be used to supplement assessment of the coronary arteries to establish the significance of coronary artery stenoses. We focus on cine-CT, CT-FFR, CT-myocardial perfusion and how developments in machine learning can supplement these techniques.
