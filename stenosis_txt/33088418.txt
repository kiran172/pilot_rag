Title: Intervertebral Disc Calcification and Klippel-Feil Syndrome.

Abstract: Intervertebral disc calcification is rare in the pediatric population and is associated with sudden neurological manifestations. Although commonly symptomatic, conservative management yields excellent prognosis in the vast majority of cases. The following case illustrates the finding of intervertebral disc calcification in a patient with vertebral body segmentation anomaly consistent with Klippel-Feil Syndrome. As both entities are associated with potential neurological sequelae, this case of coexistent pathologies highlights the importance of recognizing the potential presence of intervertebral disc calcifications in pediatric Klippel-Feil Syndrome patients.
