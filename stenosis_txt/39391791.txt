Title: Route of Delivery in a Patient with Vaginal Stenosis from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Review of the Management of Genital Complications.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe dermatological conditions, predominantly affecting women with mortality rates of 4.8-48%. Antibiotics are common triggers. They cause painful mucous membrane erosions in various body parts. Treatment involves steroids, creams, and therapy. Pregnant women with SJS-related vaginal stenosis face challenges of delivery route.
CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old primigravida woman presented at term with vaginal stenosis consequent to a 10-year-history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome triggered by cephalosporin. On pediatric Pederson speculum examination, vaginal stenosis, adhesion, scarred cervix, telangiectasis of the vaginal mucosa, and moderate bleeding after examination were noted. The risks of severe genital tract laceration and excessive bleeding from vaginal birth was discussed with the couple. Shared clinical decision making was reached to undergo a cesarean delivery.
CONCLUSION: SJS and TEN can result in severe genital complications in women, sometimes requiring cesarean sections due to genital scarring.
