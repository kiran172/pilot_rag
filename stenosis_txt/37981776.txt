Title: [Safety and effectiveness of emergency stenting for acute anterior circulation large artery disease].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the safety and effectiveness of early stent implantation in patients with acute anterior circulation large artery disease. Methods: Patients were recruited from the RESCUE-RE study (a registration study for Critical Care of Acute Ischemic Stroke After Recanalization). Patients who were diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke within 24 hours of onset and given endovascular treatment after consultation from July 2018 to May 2019 from 18 sub-centers nationwide were retrospectively enrolled. According to whether the stents were placed during the operation, the patients were divided into two groups: stenting group and non-stenting group. The baseline between the two groups was matched by propensity score. The matching variables included age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, baseline Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, history of stroke, smoking and onset to hospital time. The primary clinical outcome was 90-day good neurological outcome [defined as modified Rankin score (mRS) 0-2]. Secondary outcomes include 90-day mortality, 24-hour re-occlusion of the responsible artery, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The differences in clinical endpoints between the two groups were compared. Result: A total of 899 patients with acute anterior circulation artery stenosis or occlusion were included in the study, with a mean age of(66Â±12)years,and 532(59.18%) were male. There were 193 patients in the stenting group and 706 patients in the non-stenting group. After the baseline data between the two groups were matched by propensity score, 169 patients were enrolled in each of two groups respectively. After matching, the proportion of patients in the stenting group with etiological diagnosis of large atherosclerosis [82.53% (137/166) vs 55.69% (93/167)] and the proportion of patients with previous history of hypertension [63.31% (107/169) vs 47.93% (81/169)] in the stenting group were higher than those in the non-stenting group (both P&lt;0.05). While the proportion of patients in the non-stenting group with cardiogenic embolism [37.73%(63/167) vs 11.45%(19/166)]and the proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation [18.93% (32/169) vs 10.65%(18/169)]was higher(all P&lt;0.05). In the stenting group, the time from onset to recanalization was longer[519 (408, 620)min vs 469 (365, 690)min], and the proportion of general anesthesia [50.89% (86/169) vs 35.50% (60/169)] was higher in the stenting group(both P&lt;0.05). In addition, in the stenting group, the proportion of patients receiving mechanical thrombectomy[67.46% (114/169) vs 88.76% (150/169)] and arterial thrombolysis [2.37% (4/169) vs 18.93% (32/169)] was lower than non-stenting group during the operation, while the proportion of patients receiving balloon dilation [53.85% (91/169) vs 13.61% (23/169)]was higher(both P&lt;0.05). The proportion of patients in stent group receiving antiplatelet drugs before operation was higher [13.46% (21/169) vs 8.70% (14/169)](both P&lt;0.05). In terms of clinical outcome, compared with the non-stenting group, the proportion of patients in the stenting group with good neurological function in 90 days was lower [44.79% (73/169) vs 56.36% (93/169)], and the proportion of death at 90 days was higher[15.98% (27/169) vs 8.88% (15/169)] (both P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in 24-hour re-occlusion[8.88% (15/169) vs 9.47% (16/169)] and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage[5.92% (10/169) vs 4.76% (8/169)](both P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: For patients with acute anterior circulation artery disease, early stent therapy may increase the proportion of patients with adverse neurological outcomes.
