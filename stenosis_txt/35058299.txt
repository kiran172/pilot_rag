Title: Large Culprit Plaque and More Intracranial Plaques Are Associated with Recurrent Stroke: A Case-Control Study Using Vessel Wall Imaging.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial atherosclerotic plaque features are potential factors associated with recurrent stroke, but previous studies only focused on a single lesion, and few studies investigated them with perfusion impairment. This study aimed to investigate the association among whole-brain plaque features, perfusion deficit, and stroke recurrence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with ischemic stroke due to intracranial atherosclerosis were retrospectively collected and categorized into first-time and recurrent-stroke groups. Patients underwent high-resolution vessel wall imaging and DSC-PWI. Intracranial plaque number, culprit plaque features (such as plaque volume/burden, degree of stenosis, enhancement ratio), and perfusion deficit variables were recorded. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent factors associated with recurrent stroke.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five patients (mean age, 59 [SD, 12] years; 115 men) were included. Compared with the first-time stroke group (n = 100), the recurrent-stroke group (n = 75) had a larger culprit volume (P = .006) and showed more intracranial plaques (P &lt; .001) and more enhanced plaques (P = .003). After we adjusted for other factors, culprit plaque volume (OR, 1.16 per 10-mm3 increase; 95% CI, 1.03-1.30; P = .015) and total plaque number (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.13-1.52; P &lt; .001) were independently associated with recurrent stroke. Combining these factors increased the area under the curve to 0.71.
CONCLUSIONS: Large culprit plaque and more intracranial plaques were independently associated with recurrent stroke. Performing whole-brain vessel wall imaging may help identify patients with a higher risk of recurrent stroke.
