Title: The association between chronic stress, hair cortisol, and angiographically documented coronary atherosclerosis, a case-control study.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the principal contributor to global mortality and morbidity. Chronic stress has emerged as a strong prognostic factor for cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to measure hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in patients with angiographically confirmed coronary atherosclerosis and find the association between HCC and classic cardiovascular risk factors in a case-control study. The study included 500 angiographically confirmed coronary atherosclerosis patients and 500 age and sex-matched controls having no coronary stenosis. Hair cortisol concentration was assessed from a single sample of scalp hair by ELISA. Perceived stress scale 10 was used to evaluate the stress level of the participants. Spearman rank correlation was applied to find the association between hair cortisol level and classic cardiovascular risk factors. Multivariate regression was executed to assess the independent contribution of hair cortisol concentration as a coronary atherosclerosis risk factor. Median hair cortisol concentration was significantly high in patients with angiographically documented coronary atherosclerosis compared to controls (158(17.6-1331.3) pg/mg versus 73 (13.4-889) pg/mg. Hair cortisol concentration showed a significant positive correlation with BMI r = 525 and Hb1Ac r = 665 (both, p = ≤0.0001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjusting for all the confounding variables, HCC, matched odds ratio (MOR), 10.73;95%CI (1.60,42.09) p-value = 0.001 remained the most significant predictor of coronary atherosclerosis.LAY SUMMARYHair cortisol concentrations (HCC) were significantly high in patients with angiographically confirmed coronary atherosclerosis compared to controls. HCC showed a significant positive correlation with diabetes and obesity and remained a major predictor of coronary atherosclerosis in the final analysis.
