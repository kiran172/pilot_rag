Title: Intimal Hyperplasia of Arteriovenous Fistula.

Abstract: Intimal hyperplasia (IH), a crucial histopathological injury, forms the basis of vascular stenosis and thrombogenesis. In addition, it is common in maladies such as stenosis at the anastomosis of arteriovenous fistula and restenosis after angioplasty. Various cellular and noncellular components play critical parts in the advancement of IH. This article reviews the distinctive components of IH, such as endothelial dysfunction, multiplication, and movement of vascular smooth muscle cells. Finally, in addition to synthesis of large amounts of extracellular matrix and inflammatory responses, which have frequently been studied in recent years, we offer a premise for clinical treatment with vascular smooth muscle cells.
