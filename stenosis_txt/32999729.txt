Title: Synchronous reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome following thyrotoxicosis in a postpartum woman.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) typically manifests with acute-onset, recursive, severe headache that continues for a month; it rarely manifests as seizures. Development of RCVS following thyrotoxicosis has not been previously reported in detail.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old postpartum woman with thyrotoxicosis developed a generalized seizure refractory to anticonvulsants. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated cerebral artery stenosis in the right anterior cerebral artery and the right middle cerebral artery. These findings were compatible with RCVS. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome was treated successfully with i.v. nicardipine and conventional management was undertaken for thyrotoxicosis.
CONCLUSION: This is the first well-documented case of a postpartum woman with synchronous RCVS following thyrotoxicosis. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and thyrotoxicosis can coincidentally occur in postpartum women and manifest with postpartum seizures.
