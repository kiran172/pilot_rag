Title: Effect of eliminating pre-discharge transthoracic echocardiogram on outcomes after TAVR.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the safety of eliminating the pre-discharge transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on 30-day outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUND: TTE is utilized before, during, and after TAVR. Post-procedural, pre-discharge TTE assists in assessment of prosthesis function and detection of clinically significant paravalvular leak (PVL) after TAVR.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR at Mayo Clinic from July 2018 to July 2019 were included in a prospective institutional registry. Patients undergoing TAVR prior to February 2019 received a pre-discharge TTE, while those undergoing TAVR after February 2019 did not. Both cohorts were evaluated with TTE at 30 days post-TAVR.
RESULTS: A total of 330 consecutive patients were included. Of these, 160 patients (age 81.1 ± 7.6) had routine pre-discharge TTE, while 170 patients (age 78.9 ± 7.5) were dismissed without routine pre-discharge TTE. Mortality at 30 days was similar between the two groups (0% and 1.2%, respectively). One episode of PVL requiring intervention (0.6%) occurred in the pre-discharge TTE group and none in the group without pre-discharge TTE at 30-day follow-up. There was a similar incidence of total composite primary and secondary adverse events between the cohort receiving a pre-discharge TTE and those without (28.1% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.56) at 30 days. The most common event was need for permanent pacemaker or ICD implantation in both groups (13.1% vs. 11.8%, P = 0.71).
CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of the pre-discharge TTE is safe and associated with comparable 30-day outcomes to routine pre-discharge TTE. These findings have implication for TAVR practice cost-efficiency and health care utilization.
