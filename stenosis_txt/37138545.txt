Title: Percutaneous approach to residual pulmonary bifurcation stenosis in conotruncal diseases.

Abstract: Residual stenosis after right ventricle outflow tract surgery represents a major issue to manage in the children and adult patient with conotruncal defects. Despite a detailed multimodality imaging, the anatomy of distal pulmonary trunk and pulmonary artery bifurcation may be challenging in these patients.The aim of this study was to analyse retrospectively the outcome of the percutaneous transcatheter treatment in children with post-surgical stenosis of pulmonary artery bifurcation.We enrolled 39 patients with a median age of 6.0 years. Standard high-pressure balloon dilation was attempted in 33 patients, effective in 5 of them. Pulmonary branch stenting was performed in 10 patients, effective in 6. A kissing balloon approach was chosen in 17 patients (6 after angioplasty or stenting failure), and this technique was effective in 16 cases. Finally, a bifurcation stenting was performed in 10 patients (second step in 9 cases), effective in all the cases. None of the patients approached by kissing balloon needed a bifurcation stenting.In conclusion, standard balloon angioplasty and standard stenting might be ineffective in post-surgical stenosis involving pulmonary artery bifurcation. In this population, kissing balloon or bifurcation stenting, followed by side branch de-jailing, may be more effective in relieving the gradient.
