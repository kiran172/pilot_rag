Title: Safety and efficacy results of the Flow Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED) stent system in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms: US pivotal trial.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Flow Redirection Endoluminal Device (FRED) flow diverter in support of an application for Food and Drug Administration approval in the USA.
METHODS: 145 patients were enrolled in a prospective, single-arm multicenter trial. Patients with aneurysms of unfavorable morphology for traditional endovascular therapies (large, wide-necked, fusiform, etc) were included. The trial was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority in both safety and effectiveness, comparing trial results with performance goals (PGs) established from peer-reviewed published literature. The primary safety endpoint was death or major stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥4 points) within 30 days of the procedure, or any major ipsilateral stroke or neurological death within the first year. The primary effectiveness endpoint was complete occlusion of the target aneurysm with ≤50% stenosis of the parent artery at 12 months after treatment, and in which an alternative treatment of the target intracranial aneurysm had not been performed.
RESULTS: 145 patients underwent attempted placement of a FRED device, and one or more devices were placed in all 145 patients. 135/145 (93%) had a single device placed. Core laboratory adjudication deemed 106 (73.1%) of the aneurysms large or giant. A safety endpoint was experienced by 9/145 (6.2%) patients, successfully achieving the safety PG of <15%. The effectiveness PG of >46% aneurysm occlusion was also achieved, with the effectiveness endpoint being met in 80/139 (57.6%) CONCLUSION: As compared with historically derived performance benchmarks, the FRED flow diverter is both safe and effective for the treatment of appropriately selected intracranial aneurysms.
