Title: Anatomical Basis and Clinical Significance of Atlas Stenosis: a Systematic Review.

Abstract: Aim: In this intriguing review, the authors dive into the complex world of atlas stenosis and its clinical impact on cervical myelopathy. The authors shed light on the origins of atlas stenosis, highlighting how congenital abnormalities of the atlas are a result of failures in embryological development. Furthermore, diagnosis and treatment methods are described. Materials and methods:Utilizing a detailed search of the literature in the PubMed database, the authors have compiled a comprehensive analysis of the anatomical and biological basis of this condition. After applying the exclusion criteria, 25 papers were deemed appropriate for the present review. Results:With the help of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, diagnosis becomes possible, but the authors emphasize the importance of using special tests for a more accurate assessment. When it comes to treatment, surgical decompression with laminectomy or laminoplasty is the suggested approach. This highlights the severity of atlas stenosis and the need for intervention to alleviate the symptoms and prevent further neurological damage. What sets this review apart is its focus on the clinical profile of atlas stenosis. The authors discuss how the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow can lead to neurological disorders and headaches. This sheds light on the broader impact this condition can have on patients' lives beyond simply the anatomical implications. Conclusion:In the conclusion, the authors emphasize the susceptibility of the spinal cord to injuries even with mild mechanical pressure or instability due to aging in patients with atlas stenosis. Additionally, the instabilities caused by anatomical abnormalities of the atlas further highlight the importance of considering atlas stenosis in cases of cervical trauma. Overall, this review provides a fascinating insight into the connection between atlas stenosis and cervical myelopathy. By exploring the anatomical, biological, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of this condition, the authors have contributed to the understanding of this complex and often overlooked topic.
