Title: Is oral anticoagulation effective in preventing transcatheter aortic valve implantation failure? A propensity matched analysis of the Italian Transcatheter balloon-Expandable valve Registry study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been recently described presumably reflecting thrombus apposition. Although its clinical relevance is still unknown, oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) led to almost complete resolution.
METHODS: The retrospecitve Italian Transcatheter balloon-Expandable valve registry that included all patients undergoing balloon-expandable TAVI in 33 Italian centers. Patients discharged after TAVI with aspirin alone were compared with those assuming aspirin and OAT before and after propensity score with matching. Prosthetic heart valve dysfunction at follow-up was the primary end point. All-cause death, cardiovascular death, bleeding, vascular complications and cerebrovascular accidents at 30 days and at follow-up were the secondary ones.
RESULTS: Among the 1904 patients enrolled in the Italian Transcatheter balloon-Expandable valve registry, 716 patients on OAT and aspirin or aspirin alone were identified and analyzed: 555 were on aspirin alone and 161 on OAT and aspirin. The median follow-up was 44.0 ± 12 months. After matching, risk of prosthetic valve dysfunction at follow-up did not differ between the two groups: 3.1% in patients treated with aspirin alone vs. 1.9% in those treated with OAT and aspirin, (P = 0.72). Nevertheless patients treated with aspirin alone at follow-up had a significantly lower risk of death (21 vs. 33%, P = 0.03) and major bleeding (4 vs. 14%, P = 0.04) with a similar rate of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.2 vs. 3.1%, P = 0.45). At 30 days rates of Valve Academic Research Consortium death were similar in both groups (0.6 vs. 3.7%, P = 0.12) with higher risk of life threatening bleeding and minor vascular complications in patients on OAT and aspirin.
CONCLUSION: After TAVI with Edwards Sapien valve OAT did not reduce the incidence of valve dysfunction and stroke but was responsible for mortality and bleeding increases.
