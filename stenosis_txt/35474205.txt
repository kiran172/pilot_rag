Title: [Localized Stenosis in a Non-anastomotic Site of the Ascending Aorta to Bifemoral Bypass Graft:Report of a Case].

Abstract: An 85-year-old man received simultaneous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and the ascending aorta to bifemoral bypass with a Dacron graft 11 years ago. He suffered from intermittent claudication. Angiography demonstrated a localized stenosis in a non-anastomotic site, straight portion of the graft. He received percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The right ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) improved from 0.58 to 0.74 and left ABI improved from 0.52 to 0.71. One year later, intermittent claudication appeared again, right ABI decreased to 0.53 and left ABI decreased to 0.52. Computed tomography( CT) demonstrated restenosis at the same portion of the graft. A re-do operation was performed, stenotic portion was removed and replaced by a new ePTFE graft. No restenosis was seen three years after the second operation. We thought that repeated temporary compression of the graft might have led to a clot formation in the non-anastomotic site.
