Title: CatLet score and clinical CatLet score as predictors of long-term outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction presenting later than 12 hours from symptom onset.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Our recently developed <u>C</u>oronary <u>A</u>rtery <u>T</u>ree description and <u>L</u>esion <u>E</u>valua<u>T</u>ion (CatLet) angiographic scoring system is unique in its description of the variability in the coronary anatomy, the degree of stenosis of a diseased coronary artery, and its subtended myocardial territory, and can be utilized to predict clinical outcomes for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) presenting ≤12 h after symptom onset. The current study aimed to assess whether the Clinical CatLet score (CCS), as compared with CatLet score (CS), better predicted clinical outcomes for AMI patients presenting &gt;12 h after symptom onset.
METHODS: CS was calculated in 1018 consecutive AMI patients enrolled in a retrospective registry. CCS was calculated by multiplying CS by the ACEF I score (age, creatinine, and left ventricular ejection fraction). Primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) at 4-year-follow-up, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven revascularization.
RESULTS: Over a 4-year follow-up period, both scores were independent predictors of clinical outcomes after adjustment for a broad spectrum of risk factors. Areas-under-the-curve (AUCs) for CS and CCS were 0.72(0.68-0.75) and 0.75(0.71-0.78) for MACEs; 0.68(0.63-0.73) and 0.78(0.74-0.83) for all-cause death; 0.73(0.68-0.79) and 0.83(0.79-0.88) for cardiac death; and 0.69(0.64-0.73) and 0.75(0.7-0.79) for myocardial infarction; and 0.66(0.61-0.7) and 0.63(0.58-0.68) for revascularization, respectively. CCS performed better than CS in terms of the above-mentioned outcome predictions, as confirmed by the net reclassification and integrated discrimination indices.
CONCLUSIONS: CCS was better than CS to be able to risk-stratify long-term outcomes in AMI patients presenting >12 h after symptom onset. These findings have indicated that both anatomic and clinical variables should be considered in decision-making on management of patients with AMI presenting later.
