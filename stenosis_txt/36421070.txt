Title: Procedural complications associated with percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy: A systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: As Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) remains the keystone in treating mitral stenosis, we conducted this review to elucidate the cumulative frequency and predictors of complications following PMBV and their occurrence in various patient populations.
AREAS COVERED: We searched digital databases for relevant studies covering complications of PMBV and retrieved articles using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords.
EXPERT OPINION: A total of 37 articles (8 RCTs, 7 nonrandomized clinical trials, 22 observational studies) were selected for qualitative analysis. A total of 11,803 patients undergoing PMBV among 37 studies were included, with a mean success rate of 84.54%. The most common complication was mitral regurgitation (8.2%) followed by an atrial septal defect (2.4%). Other relevant complications like stroke, pericardial tamponade, rupture of mitral leaflets, and conduction abnormalities were present in <1% of the patients.
