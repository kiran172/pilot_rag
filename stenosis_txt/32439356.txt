Title: Classification of Intracranial Stenoses: Discrepancies between Transcranial Duplex Sonography and Computed Tomography Angiography.

Abstract: Transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCS) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are widely used to identify intracranial stenoses (ISs). We assessed concordance of IS grading between TCCS and CTA and proposed new TCCS criteria for severe IS ≥70%. One hundred two stroke patients (70 ± 13 y) with TCCS-identified IS were included. TCCS and CTA were performed within 24 h after admission. TCCS peak systolic velocity cutoffs for <50%/50%-69% stenoses were ≥155/≥220 cm/s (middle cerebral artery [MCA]-M1), ≥100/≥140 cm/s (MCA-M2), ≥120/≥155 cm/s (anterior cerebral artery [ACA]-A1), ≥100/≥145 cm/s (posterior cerebral artery [PCA]-P1 and PCA-P2), ≥90/≥120 cm/s (vertebral artery [VA]-V4) and ≥100/≥140 cm/s (basilar artery [BA]). Criteria for ≥70% stenoses were, despite variable flow velocities, post-stenotic flow alterations and/or leptomeningeal collateral flow. One hundred seventy-seven ISs were detected by TCCS. The number and grade (<50%/50%-69%/≥70%) of ISs were MCA 70 (39/19/12), BA 24 (9/11/4), ACA 21 (14/7/0), PCA 49 (29/15/5) and VA 13 (2/6/5). IS localization was confirmed by CTA in 84 of 177 cases (48%): MCA, 41/70 (59%); BA, 16/24 (67%); ACA 2/21, (10%); PCA, 17/49 (35%); VA, 8/13 (62%). Concordance between TCCS and CTA grading was (<50%/50%-69%/≥70%) 17%/19%/77%. TCCS and CTA exhibited substantial differences in the detection and grading of IS. Higher concordance rates for severe stenosis support our proposed TCCS criteria.
