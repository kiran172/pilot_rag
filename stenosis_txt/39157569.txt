Title: Usefulness of Mavacamten in the Challenging Association of Aortic Stenosis and Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: The association of aortic stenosis (AS) and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy raises questions about AS quantification, the management of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and AS treatment. Recently, mavacamten demonstrated its efficacy in reducing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction gradient. This case reports on mavacamten use in this challenging association.
