Title: Outcomes and feasibility of redo-TAVR after Sapien 3 Ultra TAVR in extremely-undersized versus nominally-sized annuli.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes in Sapien 3 Ultra (S3U) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with extreme annular undersizing (EAU) versus nominal annular sizing (NAS).
BACKGROUND: The Edwards S3U valve has reduced paravalvular leak (PVL) in TAVR but outcomes remain unknown in extremely undersized anatomy. Implanting a smaller S3U valve may facilitate future redo-TAVR but risk compromising hemodynamics.
METHODS: From December 2019 to July 2021, 366 patients with native aortic stenosis underwent S3U TAVR. Patients with EAU (annular areas &gt;430 mm2 for 23 mm or &gt;546 mm2 for 26 mm) were compared to NAS (338-430 mm2 for 23 mm or 430-546 mm2 for 26 mm). In-hospital and 30-day outcomes, and redo-TAVR feasibility were determined.
RESULTS: There were 79 (21.6%) EAU patients, with more bicuspid (p = 0.0014) and ≥moderate annular/left ventricular outflow tract calcification (p < 0.001). The EAU group had less annular oversizing than NAS group (23 mm: -8.2 ± 2.6% vs. 4.0 ± 7.0%, p < 0.001; 26 mm: -8.9 ± 2.2% vs. 6.7 ± 6.9%, p < 0.001), more balloon overfilling (71.3% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.001), and postdilatation (15.0% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.016). No differences were found in in-hospital or 30-day mortality and stroke (p > 0.05). Mild PVL (13.4% EAU vs. 11.5% NAS, p = 0.56) and mean gradients (23 mm: 13.0 ± 4.5 vs. 14.1 ± 5.4 mmHg, p = 0.40; 26 mm: 11.4 ± 4.1 vs. 11.5 ± 3.9 mmHg, p = 1.0) were similar at 30 days. Had the EAU group undergone NAS with the larger Sapien 3/S3U, by computed tomography analysis simulating 80:20 or 90:10 target implant depth, 33.3%-60.9% (vs. 4.3%-23.2%) would not be feasible for redo-TAVR due to high risk of coronary obstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: In this first report of EAU with S3U TAVR, similar excellent short-term outcomes can be achieved compared to NAS, and may preserve future redo-TAVR option.
