Title: Office-Based Steroid Injections for Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis: Patient-Reported Outcomes, Effect on Stenosis, and Side Effects.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Office-based steroid injection has shown promise for idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS). It is important to understand safety and patient-lived experience. We report patient experience related to airway restriction, voice, and side effects.
METHODS: Sixteen patients (51 ± 14 years) with mild-moderate (20-50%) stenosis undergoing office-based transnasal steroid injections were included; fourteen had prior operations. Patients typically underwent three injections, 1 month apart, followed by transnasal tracheoscopy 1 month later to evaluate outcome; number of injections can vary based on disease severity and response. Outcomes were Dyspnea Index (DI), Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale, voice handicap index-10 (VHI-10), and degree of stenosis (estimated from procedural video). At each visit, patients were queried about post-injection airway restriction and side effects. Paired t-tests compared values at baseline versus follow-up tracheoscopy.
RESULTS: DI decreased (t = 3.938, P = 0.0013), as did MMRC (t = 2.179, P = 0.0457). There was no change in VHI-10 (t = 1.354; P = 0.1957) scores. Airway stenosis decreased (t = 4.331; P = 0.0006); this was not correlated with change in DI (r = 0.267, P = 0.318). Side effects included airway restriction lasting &lt;48 hours (n = 5), cough (n = 3), and nasal pain (n = 2).
CONCLUSION: Steroid injections improved upper airway symptoms. Side effects were mild and transient. Improvement in DI did not correlate with percent stenosis.
