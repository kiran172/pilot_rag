Title: Advances in Noninvasive Carotid Wall Imaging with Ultrasound: A Narrative Review.

Abstract: Carotid atherosclerosis is a major cause for stroke, with significant associated disease burden morbidity and mortality in Western societies. Diagnosis, grading and follow-up of carotid atherosclerotic disease relies on imaging, specifically ultrasound (US) as the initial modality of choice. Traditionally, the degree of carotid lumen stenosis was considered the sole risk factor to predict brain ischemia. However, modern research has shown that a variety of other imaging biomarkers, such as plaque echogenicity, surface morphology, intraplaque neovascularization and vasa vasorum contribute to the risk for rupture of carotid atheromas with subsequent cerebrovascular events. Furthermore, the majority of embolic strokes of undetermined origin are probably arteriogenic and are associated with nonstenosing atheromas. Therefore, a state-of-the-art US scan of the carotid arteries should take advantage of recent technical developments and should provide detailed information about potential thrombogenic (/) and emboligenic arterial wall features. This manuscript reviews recent advances in ultrasonographic assessment of vulnerable carotid atherosclerotic plaques and highlights the fields of future development in multiparametric arterial wall imaging, in an attempt to convey the most important take-home messages for clinicians performing carotid ultrasound.
