Title: Trends in Medicare Payments for Beneficiaries With Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Background Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common form of valvular heart disease with an increasing prevalence. Management of AS has changed dramatically with the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR). The shift in management of AS, combined with an aging population, may increase the cost of patients with AS in the US health care system. Methods and Results We performed a retrospective cohort study, using inpatient, carrier, and outpatient data from a 20% Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries' sample from 2008 to 2019 and included beneficiaries, aged ≥65 years. We identified beneficiaries with a diagnosis of AS and stratified the sample into 3 age groups: 66 to 74, 75 to 84, and ≥85 years. We evaluated the crude and adjusted changes in annual Medicare payments (total and component) per beneficiary. We identified 1 887 340 (1.6%) Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with AS. The average annual spending for Medicare beneficiaries with AS was $19 241 in 2010 and increased annually by $301 to $23 174 in 2019 (P&lt;0.0001). Annual Medicare payments on patients with AS increased from $2 894 995 131 in 2010 to $4 619 077 182 in 2019, a difference of &gt;1.7 billion dollars. Inpatient spending increased 1.1% per year, with the highest increase in patients aged ≥85 years (1.9%). The percentage of beneficiaries undergoing surgical AVR decreased from 3.7% to 1.6%, and annual spending on surgical AVR decreased an average of 7.2% per year. The percentage of beneficiaries undergoing transcatheter AVR increased from 0% in 2010 to 3.8% in 2019, and annual spending for transcatheter AVR increased by 458.7% per year. Conclusions Although average annual Medicare spending per beneficiary modestly increased over the study period, the increase in the prevalence of AS and the proportion of beneficiaries undergoing (transcatheter) interventions for AS led to a substantial increase in overall Medicare spending among patients with AS.
