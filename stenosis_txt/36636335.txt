Title: Conversion of Sleeve Gastrectomy to Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass to Enhance Weight Loss: Single Enterprise Mid-Term Outcomes and Literature Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Suboptimal weight loss (SWL) occurs up to 30% after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (cRYGB) has shown heterogeneous results in terms of additional weight loss and resolution of weight-related comorbidities. We aim to evaluate mid-term outcomes of cRYGB specifically for SWL after SG.
METHODS: All patients who underwent cRYGB for SWL from April 2010 to June 2019 from prospective registries at three affiliated tertiary care centers were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent revision or conversion for complications were excluded. Mixed-effects and polynomial regression models were used to evaluate weight loss results after conversion.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients underwent cRYGB from SG. About 68.7% were women with mean age of 46.6 years. Mean body mass index (BMI) before SG was 55.3 kg/m2. Before conversion, mean BMI was 44.5 kg/m2 with 17.3% total weight loss (TWL). All procedures were completed laparoscopically in a median surgical time of 183 min. Three major complications occurred (9.3%), one gastrojejunal (GJ) leak and two reoperations. Four cases (12.5%) of GJ stenosis were diagnosed. No mortality was registered. Mean follow-up time was 24 months and patients had 36 kg/m2 mean BMI, 17.4% TWL, 27.2% had BMI &gt;35 kg/m2.
CONCLUSIONS: cRYGB after SG for SWL showed good mid-term results, better than those reported in literature.
