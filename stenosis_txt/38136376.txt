Title: Relation between Coronary Artery Calcium Score and Cardiovascular Events in Hodgkin Lymphoma Survivors: A Cross-Sectional Matched Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Thoracic radiotherapy is one of the corner stones of HL treatment, but it is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. As HL is often diagnosed at a young age, long-term follow-up including screening for coronary artery disease (CAD) is recommended.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the presence of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) in relation to cardiovascular events in HL patients treated with thoracic radiotherapy compared to a non-cancer control group.
METHODS: Consecutive HL patients who underwent evaluation for asymptomatic CAD with coronary computed tomography angiography > 10 years after thoracic irradiation were included. The study population consisted of 97 HL patients matched to 97 non-cancer patients on gender, age, cardiovascular risk factors, and statin use.
RESULTS: Mean age during CT scan in the HL population was 45.5 ± 9.9 and in the non-cancer population 45.5 ± 10.3 years. CACS was elevated (defined as &gt;0) in 49 (50.5%) HL patients and 30 (30.9%) control patients. HL survivors had an odds ratio of 2.28 [95% CI: 1.22-4.28] for having a CACS &gt; 0 compared to the matched population (p = 0.006). Prevalence of CACS &gt; 90th percentile differed significantly: 17.1% in HL survivors vs. 4.6% in the matched population (p = 0.009). Non-obstructive coronary artery stenosis was more prevalent in the HL population than in the control population (45.7% vs. 28.4%, respectively, p = 0.01). During follow-up of 8.5 [5.3; 9.9] years, nine HL patients experienced an event including two patients with a CACS of zero. No events occurred in the control population.
CONCLUSION: In a matched study population, HL survivors have a higher prevalence of a CACS > 0 and an increased risk of cardiovascular events after thoracic irradiation compared to a matched non-cancer control group.
