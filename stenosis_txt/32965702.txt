Title: Comparison of postoperative outcomes following multidetector computed tomography based vs transesophageal echocardiography based annulus sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the difference in postoperative outcomes following multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-based annulus sizing for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: Electronic search of PubMed, Biomed Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases was conducted until August 15, 2019. We included all types of studies comparing MDCT-based annulus sizing with TEE-based annulus sizing and assessing paravalvular regurgitation (PVR). Data were summarized using the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: A total of six studies were included. Pooled analysis of 431 participants in the MDCT group and 509 participants in the TEE group demonstrated that MDCT-based annulus sizing is associated with a significantly lower incidence of more than moderate PVR as compared to 2DTEE-based sizing (OR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18-0.54, P &lt; .0001; I2  = 0%). There was no statistical difference in annulus rupture (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.12-2.66, P = .91; I2  = 0%), procedural mortality (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.19-4.86, P = .97; I2  = 0%), and 30-day mortality (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.26-1.50, P = .29; I2  = 0%) with MDCT or 2DTEE-based annulus sizing. Compared with 3DTEE, the incidence of PVR in the MDCT group was lower, but there was no statistical difference in 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: Use of MDCT in comparison with 2DTEE is associated with significantly lower incidence of more than moderate PVR after TAVR. There seems to be no difference in annulus rupture and 30-day mortality with either imaging modality.
