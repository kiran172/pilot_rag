Title: Novel Duck Bill-Shaped Laryngotracheal Stent for Management of Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: Subglottic stenosis developed in a 23-year-old man 6 months after tracheal resection for postintubation stenosis. A standard Dumon stent (Novatech SA, La Ciotat, France) was placed; however, 2 months later, the stenosis extended superiorly, near the vocal folds. A modified Dumon stent with a longitudinal cut was then placed through the vocal folds and over the proximal end of the previous stent to cover all of the stenosis. This was replaced 30 days later with an industry custom stent featuring a thin duck bill shape proximally that fit the vocal folds without impairing their movement. The 2-month follow-up demonstrated normal airway patency and vocal fold movement.
