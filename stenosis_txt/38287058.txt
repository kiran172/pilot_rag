Title: Comparative evaluation of mechanical injury methods for establishing stable tracheal stenosis animal models.

Abstract: The study aimed to assess the stability of various mechanical injury techniques in creating tracheal stenosis animal models using endoscopic assistance and investigate the viability of tracheal stoma in this process. Twenty-six healthy adult New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to an experimental and control group. The experimental group underwent tracheal incision followed by steel brush scraping with endoscopic assistance, while the control group received nylon brush scraping. Within the control group, two subgroups were formed: Group A underwent scraping without tracheal stoma, and Group B underwent scraping followed by tracheal stoma. Additionally, a sham operation was performed on a separate group without subsequent scratching, resulting in no stenosis formation. Endoscopic observations were conducted at 7, 14, and 21Â days post-scraping, followed by histological examinations of euthanized rabbits on the 21st day. Notably, all rabbits in the non-stoma group survived without complications, whereas Group B rabbits faced mortality post-operation. Histological assessments revealed inflammatory cell infiltration, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen fiber deposition in narrowed tracheal specimens. Steel brush scraping with endoscopic assistance proved more effective in inducing stable tracheal stenosis compared to nylon brush scraping. However, the survival challenges of rabbits with tracheal fistula require further investigation.
