Title: Evaluation of Coronary Circulation by 13N-Ammonia Myocardial Perfusion Positron Emission Tomography in Patients with Right Coronary Artery Occlusion Due to Kawasaki Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) is common in the remote stages of Kawasaki disease, revascularization of the RCA is challenging in children and is usually managed by observation without intervention.
METHODS: Using adenosine-stress 13N-ammonia myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography, we evaluated coronary circulation in 14 patients (12 males) with RCA occlusion to identify ischemia (myocardial flow ratio &lt; 2.0) in the RCA region and examined hemodynamics, cardiac function, and coronary aneurysm diameter. These variables were also compared in patients with/without RCA segmental stenosis (SS).
RESULTS: There were five cases of ischemia in the RCA region. RCA myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest was higher in patients with ischemia than in those without ischemia, but the difference was not significant (1.27 ± 0.21 vs. 0.82 ± 0.16 mL/min/g, p = 0.2053). Nine patients presented with RCA SS, and age at onset of Kawasaki disease tended to be lower in those with SS. The maximum aneurysm diameter of RCA was significantly smaller in patients with SS (10.0 ± 2.8 vs. 14.7 ± 1.6, p = 0.0239). No significant differences in other variables were observed between patients with/without ischemia and SS.
CONCLUSIONS: At rest, MBF in the RCA region was relatively well preserved, even in patients with RCA occlusion, and there was no progressive deterioration in cardiac function. Adenosine stress showed microcirculatory disturbances in only half of the patients, indicating that it is reversible in children with Kawasaki disease.
