Title: High-Degree Atrioventricular Block and Torsades De Pointes in Severe Aortic Stenosis Treated With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) significantly elevates cardiovascular risk, predisposing patients to high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, including torsades de pointes (TdP). This case report presents a patient with severe AS who developed high-degree AV block and, subsequently, TdP, highlighting the interplay between bradycardia and mechanisms that trigger ventricular tachycardias. The case underscores the importance of identifying and managing these risk factors to improve patient outcomes.
