Title: A Modified Suture Technique in Hepaticojejunostomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Hepaticojejunostomy is a common biliary reconstruction procedure in hepatobiliary surgery. The suture technique plays a key role in the procedure. The conventional suture technique is complex and time-consuming. To facilitate the procedure, we performed it with a modified suture technique. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the technique in hepaticojejunostomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 120 adult patients who underwent hepaticojejunostomy. The patients were divided into a conventional group and a modified suture group according to the suture technique used. Clinical data were collected for analysis. RESULTS No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of demographic data. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups in terms of serum bilirubin, albumin, AST, ALT, or hemoglobin (p>0.05). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of bile hemorrhage, fever, or cholangitis (p>0.05). The incidences of stenosis and cholelithiasis were similar in the 2 groups (p>0.05). The incidence of bile leakage was lower in the modified suture group than in the conventional group (p=0.04). The average bile duct diameter was 25±6 mm in the modified continuous suture group and 29±7mm in the conventional group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.5). The duration of the anastomosis procedure was 15.4±4.4 min in the modified continuous suture group, which was shorter than in the conventional group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The modified continuous suture technique is efficient and safe for use in hepaticojejunostomy. It can facilitate the procedure and reduce the incidence of bile leakage after hepaticojejunostomy.
