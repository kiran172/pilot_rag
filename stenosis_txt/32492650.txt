Title: Airway stent current practices evaluation: Survey among French bronchoscopy practitioners.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Airway stenting (AS) is performed for the treatment of benign or malignant central airway stenosis. In France, more than 30 centers practice AS. The aim of this survey was to evaluate the current practice around airway stenting among French bronchoscopy practitioners.
METHOD: We performed an online survey sent to the GELF group (Groupe d'Endoscopie de Langue Française) mailing list. The first part comprised 10 questions about the different attitudes before AS and the second part included 10 questions about the management after AS.
RESULTS: Thirty-six participants answered to the first part of the questionnaire and thirty-three to the second. There were some similarities, for example the absence of prophylactic antibiotic treatment before procedure (86%), use of saline nebulization, and removing or replacing the airway stent in case of persistent chest congestion or infection (73%). We also noted an important heterogeneity of the practices with several differences concerning systematic endoscopic control, bacteriological sampling before procedure (44%) and systematically AS replacement.
CONCLUSION: This survey shows that AS management in France varies between practitioners. Respondents agreed on a few points, but disagreed on several important aspects of the management. These results emphasize the need of expert recommendations to improve AS management.
