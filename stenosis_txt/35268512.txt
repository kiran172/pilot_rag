Title: Prognosis of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Preschool-Aged Patients with Myocardial Ischemia Due to Giant Aneurysm of Kawasaki Disease.

Abstract: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe cardiac sequelae of Kawasaki disease (KD) complicated by myocardial ischemia is feasible even in childhood. However, no report has summarized the prognosis of CABG in preschool-aged children. Therefore, we evaluated the outcomes of seven preschool-aged children who underwent CABG for the cardiac sequelae of KD in our hospital. The median age at KD onset and CABG was 36 and 59 months, respectively. The median period from KD onset to CABG was 12 months. The median post-operative observation period was 108 months. CABG between the left internal thoracic artery and left anterior descending artery was performed in all patients. In all patients, postoperative cardiac catheter examination revealed good graft patency and no anastomotic stenosis. Further, pre-operative abnormality of coronary flow reserve returned to normal after CABG. Currently, only one patient is taking warfarin. Regarding school-life management, no patient has exercise limitations, except for one patient who had acute myocardial infarction before CABG. Further, the risk of graft stenosis or occlusion was evaluated in the included patients. However, no accidents have been reported to date, and myocardial ischemia and school-life management have improved. Thus, CABG is an effective treatment in preschool-aged children.
