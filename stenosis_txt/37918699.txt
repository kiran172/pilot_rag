Title: Biological Therapeutic Modalities for Intervertebral Disc Diseases: An Orthoregeneration Network (ON) Foundation Review.

Abstract: Orthoregeneration is defined as a solution for orthopaedic conditions that harnesses the benefits of biology to improve healing, reduce pain, improve function, and, optimally, provide an environment for tissue regeneration. Options include drugs, surgical intervention, scaffolds, biologics as a product of cells, and physical and electromagnetic stimuli. The goal of regenerative medicine is to enhance the healing of tissue after musculoskeletal injuries as both isolated treatment and adjunct to surgical management, using novel therapies to improve recovery and outcomes. Various orthopaedic biologics (orthobiologics) have been investigated for the treatment of pathology involving the spine, including lower back pain, with or without numbness and/or dysfunction in the lower extremities, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis. Promising and established treatment modalities include repair of the annulus fibrosis, injection of expanded or nonexpanded autologous or allogenic cells that are chondrogenic or from a stem cell lineage used to promote matrix tissue regeneration of the intervertebral disc, including nucleus pulpous cells and mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, or adipose tissue; and injection of platelet-rich plasma, platelet-rich fibrin, or fibrin sealant. Early clinical studies show promise for pain reduction and functional recovery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, expert opinion.
