Title: Management of pediatric laryngeal webs secondary to severe croup and traumatic intubation.

Abstract: Laryngotracheobronchitis is a common, typically self-limiting viral infection. However, severe laryngotracheobronchitis can require urgent intubation to prevent imminent airway obstruction. The concurrent inflammation and urgency make laryngeal trauma more likely. We report two cases of children who underwent emergent intubation for acute respiratory distress due to viral laryngotracheobronchitis and subsequently developed anterior laryngeal webs. Both underwent laryngoplasty with keel placement, with resolution of their laryngeal webs. These cases describe pediatric laryngeal web formation as a rare complication of traumatic intubation and a novel technique for endoscopic keel placement.
