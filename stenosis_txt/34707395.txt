Title: Endoscopic Retrograde Appendicography: An Alternative Diagnostic Method for Acute Appendicitis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of endoscopic retrograde appendicography for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 33 patients (20 men and 13 women, average age 44±18 years) with suspected acute appendicitis between December 2016 and November 2018. Endoscopic direct-vision imaging or fluoroscopic endoscopic retrograde appendicography was performed to separate suspected acute appendicitis from actual acute appendicitis. The success rate, complications, and recurrence rate were recorded.
RESULTS: Acute appendicitis was ruled out by normal endoscopic retrograde appendicography in 8 (24%) and confirmed in 23 patients (70%). In 2 patients (6%), appendiceal orifice cannulation failed. Colonoscopic findings in acute appendicitis were mucosal hyperemia and edema of appendiceal orifice (83%), outpouring of pus from the appendiceal orifice (74%), and swollen cecal mucosa (61%). Appendicograpic findings were either normal or in acute disease showed diffuse luminal dilation (diameter: 0.8±0.4 mm), partial stenosis (43%), stiffness or inflexibility (87%) and filling defects (22%). There were no complications during or after follow-up for a median of 13 months (IQR: 9-24 months).
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic retrograde appendicography appears to be a reliable and safe method to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and prevent unnecessary appendectomy.
