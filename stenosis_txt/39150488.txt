Title: Coronary computed tomography angiography improves assessment of patients with acute chest pain and inconclusively elevated high-sensitivity troponins.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine whether coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) can improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with acute chest pain and inconclusively high-sensitivity troponins (hs-troponin).
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, blinded, observational, multicentre study. Patients aged 30-80 years presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain and inconclusively elevated hs-troponins were included and underwent CCTA. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of ≥ 50% stenosis on CCTA to identify patients with type-1 non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).
RESULTS: A total of 106 patients (mean age 65 ± 10, 29% women) were enrolled of whom 20 patients (19%) had an adjudicated diagnosis of type-1 NSTE-ACS. In 45 patients, CCTA revealed non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) or no CAD. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value and area-under-the-curve (AUC) of ≥ 50% stenosis on CCTA to identify patients with type 1 NSTE-ACS, was 95% (95% confidence interval: 74-100), 56% (45-68), 98% (87-100), 35% (29-41) and 0.83 (0.73-0.94), respectively. When only coronary segments with a diameter ≥ 2 mm were considered for the adjudication of type 1 NSTE-ACS, the sensitivity and NPV increased to 100%. In 8 patients, CCTA enabled the detection of clinically relevant non-coronary findings.
CONCLUSION: The absence of ≥ 50% coronary artery stenosis on CCTA can be used to rule out type 1 NSTE-ACS in acute chest pain patients with inconclusively elevated hs-troponins. Additionally, CCTA can help improve the diagnostic work-up by detecting other relevant conditions that cause acute chest pain and inconclusively elevated hs-troponins.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Coronary CTA (CCTA) can safely rule out type 1 non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) in patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain and inconclusively elevated hs-troponins, while also detecting other relevant non-coronary conditions.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03129659). Registered on 26 April 2017 KEY POINTS: Acute chest discomfort is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department. CCTA achieved very high negative predictive values for type 1 NSTE-ACS in this population. CCTA can serve as an adjunct for evaluating equivocal ACS and evaluates for other pathology.
