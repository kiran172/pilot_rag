Title: Endovascular revascularization of isolated internal iliac artery for symptomatic occlusive atherosclerotic disease is a viable and underused option for patients with gluteal muscle claudication.

Abstract: Often confused with pseudoclaudication, gluteal muscle claudication is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat. We present the case of a 67-year-old man with a history of back and buttock claudication. He had undergone lumbosacral decompression with no relief of buttock claudication. Computed tomography angiography of the abdomen and pelvis showed occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries. Exercise transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurements obtained on referral to our institution revealed a significant decrease. He underwent successful recanalization and stenting of the bilateral hypogastric arteries with complete resolution of his symptoms. We also reviewed the reported data to highlight the trend in the management of patients with this condition.
