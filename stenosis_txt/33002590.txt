Title: When the lead extractor becomes the assistant for new lead implant.

Abstract: With the increasing number of cardiovascular implantable electronic device upgrade and vein obstruction caused by previous leads, it is important to have alternative techniques to upgrade the device with the maintenance of functioning leads. We report an 83-year old male with 13-year old one-lead dual-chamber pacemaker, ischemic cardiac disease and pre-dialytic chronic kidney disease submitted to an upgrade to cardiac resynchronization therapy. A sub-occlusion in the transition of left brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava was documented. Re-permeabilization was only achieved with a TightRailâ„¢ rotating dilator sheath over a guidewire with successful left ventricle lead implant.
