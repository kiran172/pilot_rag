Title: [The role of CT coronary angiography in improving the positive rate of coronary angiography in patients with low-or moderate-risk non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate whether CT coronary angiography (CTA) can safely and effectively reduce the number of invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) whose Grace score is low-or moderate-risk, and increase ICA positive rate. Methods: One hundred and two NSTEMI patients, including 61 males and 41 females, aged 38-80 (58±12) years, were prospectively included and treated in Henan Provincial People's Hospital from February 2017 to February 2018. By using random number method, the patients were divided into control group (51 cases) and experimental group (51 cases). Patients in the control group were arranged for elective ICA examination according to the risk stratification. If further intervention or surgical treatment was required, the ICA examination was positive; in the experimental group, the CTA examination was completed through the green channel first. If the CTA showed that the main coronary artery and its main branches were severe or extreme stenosis, further ICA examination was arranged; otherwise, a secondary prophylactic drug treatment was developed and the patients were then discharged and followed up for 1 year. ICA number, ICA positive rate, length of hospital stay, hospital cost, hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS), major cardiovascular events (MACE) within 1 year, and other serious adverse events related to examination or surgery were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 37 patients in the experimental group underwent ICA, and the positive rate of ICA was 94.59% (35/37), which was significantly higher than that of the control group [62.75% (32/51)] (P&lt;0.05). The average length of hospital stay and the HADS score before ICA in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group [(3.8±2.2) d vs (4.8±2.4) d; 8.8±4.5 vs 11.4±6.8] (all P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of MACE (3 cases vs 5 cases, P=0.423) and other serious adverse events (8 cases vs 10 cases, P=0.548) within 1 year between the two groups. Conclusion: CTA significantly reduces the number of ICA and the average length of hospital stay, and increases the positive rate of ICA in NSTEMI patients whose Grace score is low-or moderate-risk. There is no increase in cardiovascular risks within 1 year.
