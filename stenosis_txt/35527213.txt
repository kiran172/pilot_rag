Title: How to use the aortic valve calcium score to improve the results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a self-expanding prosthesis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) without predilation (direct TAVI) has become the preferred method for implanting TAVI prostheses. Appropriate patient selection is important to avoid suboptimal outcomes and associated complications.
AIM: To evaluate whether aortic valve calcification measured with computed tomography predicts suboptimal results from direct TAVI with a self-expanding prosthesis.
METHODS: Single-centre retrospective analysis of patients who received a CoreValveâ„¢ prosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in a direct TAVI procedure between January 2018 and March 2019. Aortic valve calcification assessment (aortic valve calcium score, calcium volume and calcium mass) was calculated from the computed tomography scan before TAVI. Procedural characteristics, need for postdilation and complications were analysed.
RESULTS: Of 168 included patients, 18 were postdilated. Aortic valve calcium score (4259 vs. 2578; P&lt;0.001), calcium volume (1184 vs. 647mm3; P&lt;0.001) and calcium mass (642 vs. 368mg; P&lt;0.001) were higher in patients needing postdilation. Aortic valve calcium score (odds ratio 9.73; P=0.004), calcium volume (odds ratio 8.48; P=0.006) and calcium mass (odds ratio 6.21; P=0.006) were independent predictors of suboptimal direct TAVI outcomes.
CONCLUSION: A high aortic valvular calcium score, assessed by computed tomography scan, is an independent predictor of suboptimal prosthesis implantation outcomes in direct TAVI.
