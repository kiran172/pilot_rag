Title: [BCG-therapy as a rare reason for postrenal failure].

Abstract: HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS:  In the following case report, we describe a patient with acute renal failure due to an urinary congestion level II-III under BCG-(Bacillus Calmette-Guérin)-therapy because of bladder cancer. Cystoscopy revealed the diagnosis of BCG-induced intramural narrowing of distal ureters bilaterally.
THERAPY AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT:  After receiving a double-J-catheter the renal function returned to normal.
CONCLUSIONS:  Although postrenal failure is relatively rare (5 %), also seldom causes such as medication-induced (e. g. BCG) ureter stenosis has to be included into the differential diagnosis.
