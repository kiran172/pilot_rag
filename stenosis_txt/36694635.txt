Title: Interatrial septum dissection, severe aortic stenosis, and paravalvular mitral regurgitation: A rare combination and their hemodynamic interrelationship.

Abstract: Left atrial wall dissection is a rare entity with controversial management approaches. We report the case of an 85-year-old woman with a mitral bioprosthetic admitted for heart failure. Diagnosis of atrial septum dissection, severe aortic stenosis, and paravalvular mitral regurgitation was established. A percutaneous approach provided clinical improvements.
