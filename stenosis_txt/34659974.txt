Title: A Reminder That Stress Echocardiography Is Useful in Diagnosing Myocardial Ischemia in Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease: Case Series.

Abstract: Identification of ischemia remains critical when assessing individuals presenting with atypical symptoms or in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD). Several imaging modalities are currently available to attain this diagnostic goal. Unfortunately, not all case presentations are straightforward, particularly when microvascular dysfunction (MVD) is the cause of symptoms in the absence of identifiable epicardial luminal stenosis. Specifically, in such cases, current imaging guidelines do not include stress echocardiography (SE) as a recommended tool when assessing these patients. We present three cases that highlight the utility of SE for identifying MVD and provide mechanistic explanations. We believe that SE should not be completely discarded as an inadequate testing modality; we highlight the potential utility of this imaging modality not only in diagnosing CAD and pre-surgical evaluation of patients but alsoÂ in identifying patients with MVD.
