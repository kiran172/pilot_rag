Title: Carotid-carotid artery crossover bypass using the Saphenous Vein Graft for symptomatic common carotid artery occlusion: how I do it.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) is rare, where a revascularization procedure might be needed in symptomatic or recurrent ischemic events. In this study, we describe the carotid-carotid artery crossover bypass technique for Riles type 1Â A CCAO.
METHODS: The procedure was conducted via bilateral neck incisions utilizing the saphenous vein graft. The graft was patent after surgery, along with substantial improvement in cerebral perfusion, resulting in a stroke-free postoperative period.
CONCLUSION: The carotid-carotid crossover bypass is effective for CCAO patients requiring revascularization. However, individual bypass options and vascular grafts should be carefully considered.
