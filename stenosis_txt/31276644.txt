Title: Combined Management of a Bronchial Artery Fistula After Lung Transplantation.

Abstract: A 46-year-old female patient exhibited massive endobronchial bleeding after dilation of a left bronchial anastomotic stenosis after lung transplantation, consistent with a bronchopulmonary artery fistula (BPAF). TheÂ BPAF was treated with a bronchial covered self-expandable metallic stent and percutaneous transcatheter pulmonary artery stent placement. BPAF is rare and leads to death in most cases because of massive hemoptysis. We describe a case of successful combined management of BPAF using both bronchial and pulmonary stent placement.
