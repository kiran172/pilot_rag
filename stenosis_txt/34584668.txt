Title: Application of the Konno procedure for infective endocarditis in native bicuspid aortic valve with annular abscess extending into the interventricular septum.

Abstract: Annular abscess is a serious complication of infective endocarditis, which often requires complex surgery and has a very high post-operative mortality rate. The Konno procedure involves valve annuloplasty for a narrow aortic annulus or left ventricular outflow tract stenosis in children; it is also performed for various cardiac conditions in adults. Here, we report a case of the Konno procedure performed in a patient with aortic valve infective endocarditis, with an annular abscess extending into the interventricular septum (IVS). A 58-year-old man who presented to our hospital with fever was diagnosed with aortic valve infective endocarditis caused by Streptococcus saccharolyticus. On echocardiography, an annular abscess in the direction of the IVS was detected, and surgery was planned. The Konno procedure was performed to secure an adequate surgical field and to debride and reconstruct the cavity created by the interventricular septal abscess. The patient was discharged uneventfully 29Â days after surgery.
