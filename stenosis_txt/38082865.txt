Title: A parametric study assessing Implicit Solver limits for a generic FEM Simulation of PTA without stent deployment.

Abstract: This study focuses on the robustness of a generic Finite Element Model (FEM) of Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) procedure with permanent set. The influence of three different parameters on simulation robustness were investigated: the stenosis percent, the stenosis offset and the arterial caliber. Five arterial calibers are modeled by adapting the ratio between the inner diameter and the wall thickness. Overall, forty configurations were tested with the same simulation settings and boundary conditions. Results shows convergence issues caused by excessive deformations of elements for stenosis above 65% blockage. Moreover, an increasing stenosis offset tends to decrease convergence. Simulation of PTA on small calibers and large calibers are less robust than intermediate e.g., iliac calibers.Clinical Relevance- PTA can benefit from numerical tools to improve the procedure outcomes. A FEM simulation of PTA without stent deployment can predict the permanent strain induced by this surgery for various configurations. However, robustness of the simulation is required to consider its transfer to clinics. This work aims to determine the robustness boundaries of an implicit solver for PTA simulation. It shows that an implicit solver is robust for all artery calibers with a stenosis below 50% blockage. Moreover medium-caliber arteries exhibit better robustness with converging solutions for stenosis reaching 60% blockage.
