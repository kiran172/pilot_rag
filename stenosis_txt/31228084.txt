Title: Comparison Between Endoscopic Biliary Stenting Combined with Balloon Dilation and Balloon Dilation Alone for the Treatment of Benign Hepaticojejunostomy Anastomotic Stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepaticojejunostomy anastomotic stricture (HJAS) is an important complication of biliary reconstructive surgery but has no standard treatment. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of endoscopic treatment for benign HJAS and identify the risk factors for its recurrence.
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 176 patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for HJAS between April 2008 and March 2016. The outcome of endoscopic biliary stenting combined with balloon dilation (EBS group) and balloon dilation alone (balloon group) was evaluated.
RESULTS: The scope was successfully inserted into the HJ site in 93.8% patients (165/176), and 139 patients underwent endoscopic treatment after HJAS was confirmed. Successful biliary drainage was achieved in 137 patients by using ERCP and rendezvous procedures. Among these, 103 patients were included in balloon group and 34 patients were in EBS group. HJAS was resolved in 132 patients; five died from recurrence of primary disease. The 1 (3)-year bile duct patency rates in the balloon and EBS groups were 62.5% (46.6%) and 89.4% (84.7%), respectively (p = 0.015). Univariate analysis showed that balloon dilation (p = 0.009) and early HJAS formation (time from surgery to ERCP < 1 year) (p = 0.02) were risk factors for HJAS recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, balloon dilatation was identified as independent risk factors for HJAS recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Balloon dilation without stent deployment and early HJAS formation are risk factors for HJAS recurrence after endoscopic treatment. Stent deployment might be recommended for definite resolution of HJAS.
