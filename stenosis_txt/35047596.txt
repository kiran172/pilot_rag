Title: Adjacent segment disease following Dynesys stabilization for lumbar disorders: A case series of mid- and long-term follow-ups.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radiologic adjacent segment degeneration (ASDeg) can occur after spinal surgery. Adjacent segment disease (ASDis) is defined as the development of new clinical symptoms corresponding to radiographic changes adjacent to the level of previous spinal surgery. Greater pre-existing ASDeg is generally considered to result in more severe ASDis; nonetheless, whether the ASDeg status before index surgery influences the postoperative risk of revision surgery due to ASDis warrants investigation.
AIM: To identify possible risk factors for ASDis and verify the concept that greater preexisting ASDeg leads to more severe ASDis.
METHODS: Data from 212 patients who underwent posterior decompression with Dynesys stabilization from January 2006 to June 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who underwent surgery for ASDis were categorized as group A (n = 13), whereas those who did not were classified as group B (n = 199). Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the modified Pfirrmann grade, University of California-Los Angeles grade, body mass index, number of Dynesys-instrumented levels, and age.
RESULTS: The mean time of reoperation was 7.22 (1.65-11.84) years in group A, and the mean follow-up period was 6.09 (0.10-12.76) years in group B. No significant difference in reoperation risk was observed: Modified Pfirrmann grade 3 vs 4 (P = 0.53) or 4 vs 5 (P = 0.46) for the upper adjacent disc, University of California-Los Angeles grade 2 vs 3 for the upper adjacent segment (P = 0.66), age of &lt; 60 vs &gt; 60 years (P = 0.9), body mass index &lt; 25 vs &gt; 25 kg/m2 (P = 0.3), and sex (P = 0.8).
CONCLUSION: Greater preexisting upper ASDeg was not associated with a higher rate of reoperation for ASDis after Dynesys surgery. Being overweight tended to increase reoperation risk after Dynesys surgery for ASDis.
