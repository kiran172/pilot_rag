Title: [A Case of Stage Ⅳ Gastric Cancer Treated with Conversion Surgery after Chemotherapy].

Abstract: A case is a female of 61-year-old. She visited her local doctor with a chief complaint of frequent burping. She was hospitalized for gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis. Although open gastrectomy was planned the gastric cancer was unresectable due to pancreatic invasion and peritoneal dissemination. Cytology with abdominal lavage was CY0. She underwent gastrojejunostomy. She was treated by 19 courses of chemotherapy with SOX therapy for 2 years. The tumor reduced, and she underwent distal gastrectomy as conversion surgery. Pathological findings were por2>muc>tub2>tub1, ypT2(ypMP), INF c, int, Ly1a, V0, pPM0, pDM0, pN0(0/43), ypStage ⅠB, R0, Grade 2b. Adjuvant chemotherapy(S-1 and docetaxel)was administered after conversion surgery. She is alive without recurrence for 1 year and 6 months after gastrectomy. We report a case of Stage Ⅳ gastric cancer treated with conversion surgery after chemotherapy.
