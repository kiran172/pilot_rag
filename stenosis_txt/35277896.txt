Title: Postoperative intermittent dysfunction of mitral valve prosthesis of unclear etiology identified by three-dimensional echocardiography.

Abstract: A 56-year-old patient with rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation underwent mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. The 3D perioperative echocardiogram showed an intermittent immobile medial disk without hemodynamic repercussion in the intensive care unit. The patient was taken back to the operating room and surgeons could not identify the cause. An enlarged left atrium and the size of the prosthetic valve was thought to have precipitated this condition. The heart team decided a biological prosthetic valve replacement would be performed. This case emphasizes the important role of the perioperative 3D echocardiogram in the detection of immediate surgical complications.
