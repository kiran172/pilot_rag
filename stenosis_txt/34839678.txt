Title: Aorta unfolding index as an indicator for coronary artery disease severity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic unfolding index (AUI) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, yet there is scarcity in the literature on its association with the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD).
PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between aortic unfolding and coronary artery disease severity score.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 115 patients with various degrees of CAD who underwent invasive coronary angiography and were retrospectively studied. AUI derived from non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the chest was correlated to the Gensini score describing the CAD severity. Its sensitivity and specificity in the detection of severe stenosis were examined at various cutoff points.
RESULTS: CAD severity was significantly correlated with the patient age and AUI. On multivariate regression analysis, AUI was an independent predictor of severe CAD. The best cutoff value was ≥66, with 94.9% sensitivity and 81.6% specificity.
CONCLUSION: AUI ≥66 was a predictor of severe CAD independent of the patient age.
