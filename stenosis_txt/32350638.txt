Title: Diagnostic performance of coronary angiography utilizing intraprocedural 320-row computed tomography with minimal contrast medium.

Abstract: Recently developed coronary angiography with intraprocedural 320-row computed tomography can be performed in a catheterization laboratory (XACT) by injecting contrast medium from a place close to the coronary arteries, thereby requiring a minimal amount of contrast medium. However, its clinical application has not yet been established. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of XACT angiography with a minimal volume of contrast medium in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). A total of 167 coronary segments were analyzed in 14 patients (9 males, median age 70 years) with suspected CAD by XACT angiography with 7.5 ml of contrast medium and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with standard techniques. The segmental-based diagnostic accuracy of XACT angiography in detecting stenosis of ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% and visualized by ICA was good (sensitivity: 74% and 62%, specificity: 99% and 99%, positive predictive value: 93% and 80%, and negative predictive value: 97% and 97%, respectively). These results suggest that XACT angiography with a very low amount of contrast medium may have strong clinical utility for screening coronary arteries in patients with renal dysfunction or undergoing clinical procedures such as pacemaker implantation.
