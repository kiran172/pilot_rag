Title: Selection of Vascular Closure Devices in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Various vascular closure devices (VCDs) are commonly used for percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, superiority and safety profile among them remain unclear. We compared periprocedural complications among various VCDs in patients undergoing TAVR. PubMed and EMBASE were searched through January 2022 to identify clinical studies comparing any 2 VCDs of Prostar, Proglide and MANTA in patients who underwent TAVR. Studies using surgical cut-down or alternative access other than transfemoral approach were excluded. We analyzed the odds ratios (ORs) of vascular complications (VC), bleeding, acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality using a network meta-analysis. All outcomes were defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 criteria. Two randomized controlled trials and 15 observational studies were identified, yielding a total of 11,344 patients including Prostar (n = 4499), Proglide (n = 5705), or MANTA group (n = 1140). The rates of major VC and life-threatening and major bleeding were significantly lower in Proglide compared to Prostar (OR [95 % CI] = 0.54 [0.32-0.89], 0.68 [0.52-0.90], and 0.49 [0.26-0.95], respectively). There was no significant difference in major VC and bleeding between Proglide and MANTA groups. Proglide was associated with a lower rate of acute kidney injury (0.56 [0.34-0.92]) and red blood cell transfusion (0.39 [0.16-0.98]) compared to Prostar. There was no significant difference in additional interventions and 30-day overall mortality among three groups. In this network meta-analysis of VCD in patients undergoing TAVR, MANTA and Proglide had comparable outcomes while Proglide appears superior to Prostar in terms of major VC and bleeding.
