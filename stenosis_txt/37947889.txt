Title: Chronic cauda equina syndrome decompression surgery recovery is very "bad"? Based on patient self-assessment.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES) secondary to degenerative lumbar spine diseases are sometimes mild and tend to be ignored by patients, resulting in delayed treatment. In addition, the long-term efficacy of surgery is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive factors of CES and post-operative recovery in patients with symptoms lasting > 3 months.
METHODS: From January 2011 to December 2020, data of 45 patients with CES secondary to lumbar disk herniation/lumbar spinal stenosis were collected from a single center. The patients had bladder, bowel or sexual dysfunction and decreased perineal sensation that lasted for > 3 months. A 2-year post-operative follow-up was conducted to evaluate recovery outcomes, which were measured by validated self-assessment questionnaires conducted by telephone and online.
RESULTS: Overall, 45 CES patients (57.8% female; mean age, 56 years) were included. The duration of pre-operative CES symptoms was 79.6 weeks (range, 13-730 weeks). The incidence of saddle anesthesia before decompression was 71.1% (n = 32), bladder dysfunction 84.4% (n = 38), bowel dysfunction 62.2% (n = 28) and sexual dysfunction 64.4% (n = 29). The overall recovery rate of CES after a 2-year follow-up was 64.4%. The rates of the residual symptoms at the last follow-up were as follows: saddle anesthesia 22.2%, bladder dysfunction 33.3%, bowel dysfunction 24.4% and sexual dysfunction 48.9%. Pre-operative saddle anesthesia, overactive bladder and sexual dysfunction were risk factors for poor prognosis after decompression.
CONCLUSION: CES patients with symptoms lasting > 3 months may recover after surgery. Sexual dysfunction has a high residual rate and should not be ignored during diagnosis and treatment.
