Title: Association Between Serum Uric Acid Levels and Neoatherosclerosis.

Abstract: Neoatherosclerosis is a major cause of stent failure after percutaneous coronary intervention. Metabolism such as hyperuricemia is associated with in-stent restenosis (ISR). However, the association between serum uric acid (sUA) levels and in-stent neoatherosclerosis (ISNA) has never been validated.A total of 216 patients with 220 ISR lesions who had undergone optical coherence tomography (OCT) of culprit stents were included in this study. According to their sUA levels, eligible patients were divided into two groups [normal-sUA group: sUA < 7 mg/dL, n = 126, and high-sUA group: sUA â‰¥ 7 mg/dL, n = 90]. OCT findings were analyzed and compared between the normal- and high-sUA groups.The incidence of ISNA (63.0% versus 43.0%, P = 0.004) was significantly higher in the high-sUA group than in the normal-sUA group. Lipid plaques (66.3% versus 43.0%, P < 0.001) and thin-cap fibroatheroma (38.0% versus 18.0%, P = 0.001) were observed more frequently in the restenotic tissue structure in patients in the high-sUA group than in those in the normal-sUA group. Meanwhile, univariate (OR: 1.208, 95% CI: 1.037-1.407; P = 0.015) and multivariate (OR: 1.254, 95% CI: 1.048-1.501; P = 0.013) logistic regression analyses indicated that sUA levels were an independent risk factor for ISNA after adjusting for relevant risk factors.The high-sUA levels were an independent risk factor for the occurrence of neoatherosclerosis in patients with ISR via OCT.
