Title: A case of aqueductal obstruction by web with no sign except a headache.

Abstract: Aqueductal stenosis can be a silent disease that can present in a patient for years without any signs and symptoms. This silence can occur due to CSF flow dynamics compensation, and it can continue until the increase in CSF production so that the symptoms may appear during adolescence or even later. In this study, we report an aqueduct obstruction by web, who had no symptoms except a headache and was referred for MRI in his early thirty. The patient was referred to find the cause of his episodes of headaches. If he did not follow up on his headache, he might never know about his disorder.
