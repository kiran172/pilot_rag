Title: A Case of Cardiac Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma With Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction.

Abstract: Malignant tumors originating from the heart are extremely rare. Here, we report a case of severe right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenosis in a 67 year-old woman caused by a massive intimal sarcoma that required venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to support systemic circulation. Surgical resection and RVOT reconstruction with tricuspid and pulmonary valve replacement were performed. The pathological diagnosis was cardiac undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Although the patient was discharged 65 days after surgery in good condition, she subsequently died from multiple metastases detected in the early phase after surgery.
