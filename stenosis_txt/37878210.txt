Title: Anesthetic management with remimazolam in very elderly patients undergoing hybrid surgery of transcatheter aortic valve implantation plus off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: report of two cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Remimazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine with small circulatory depression. We used remimazolam for general anesthesia management in two very elderly patients undergoing hybrid surgery of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) plus off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 96-year-old man (case 1) and a 92-year-old woman (case 2) had complex coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe aortic stenosis (AS) and were scheduled for TAVI plus OPCAB. Anesthesia in both patients was induced with 6 mg/kg/h remimazolam and fentanyl and maintained with 0.3 mg/kg/h and 0.5 mg/kg/h remimazolam and fentanyl, respectively. Although catecholamines were required, we successfully maintained circulation during the induction of anesthesia and the procedures of OPCAB and TAVI. Both patients were discharged without complications.
CONCLUSION: Remimazolam can be a useful option for safe general anesthesia in very elderly patients when performing hybrid surgery.
