Title: Treatment of Meatal Strictures by Dorsal Inlay Oral Mucosa Graft Urethroplasty: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To report on the use of oral mucosa graft urethroplasty for meatal strictures using the dorsal inlay technique.
METHODS: Patients who underwent a single-stage dorsal inlay oral mucosal graft urethroplasty between January 2000 and May 2021 were included in this study. A follow-up of a minimum of 12 months was necessary for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were stricture extension into the penile urethra, concomitant stricture at another location, flap urethroplasty for a meatal stricture, dorsal inlay urethroplasty with another type of graft, ventral onlay graft urethroplasty or staged urethroplasty. Recurrence was defined by the inability to pass a 14F metal sound through the reconstructed meatus irrespective of patients' complaints.
RESULTS: Our study cohort included 40 patients. Buccal mucosal graft (BMG) urethroplasty was used in 25 patients and 15 patients were treated with the aid of lingual mucosal graft (LMG). The median follow-up was 85 (IQR: 69-110) months. Seven (17.5%) patients suffered a stricture recurrence of which four (10%) needed re-intervention. The median 5-y recurrent free survival (RFS) for the entire cohort was 85 (±6)%. The median 5-y RFS was 96 (±4)% versus 65 (±13)% for respectively BMG and LMG (p = 0.03). Post-operative complications were identified in 11 (27.5%) patients with only one (2.5%) patient who had a grade 3a complication.
CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal inlay oral mucosa graft urethroplasty is a safe and feasible technique for selected patients with meatal stenosis.
