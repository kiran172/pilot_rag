Title: Pediatric Tracheal Surgery: A 25-Year Review of Slide Tracheoplasty and Tracheal Resection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of slide tracheoplasty and tracheal resection in pediatric patients and analyze the data for predictors of outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective review of tracheal surgery from January 1, 1993 to May 1, 2018 was performed. Demographic data, operative details, perioperative data, and clinical outcomes were collected. The study investigators' management strategy has evolved over time, with less rigid bronchoscopy, more reliance on postoperative computed tomographic imaging, and the use of inhaled Ciprodex (combination of ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone) since 2007.
RESULTS: The study included 41 patients, with a median age of 4.1 months and a median weight of 4.2 kg. There were 6 neonates and 24 infants. Slide tracheoplasty was performed in 27 patients (66%), and resection with end-to-end anastomosis was performed in 14 (34%). Eleven patients (27%) had a pulmonary artery sling. Simultaneous intracardiac repairs requiring cross-clamp and cardioplegia were performed in 9 patients (22%). Lung agenesis (n = 6) or severe hypoplasia (n = 2) was present in 8 patients (20%). Complications included tracheostomy in 5 patients (12%) and in-hospital death in 3 patients (7%). There were no cases of mediastinitis. Inhaled Ciprodex was used to decrease granulation tissue at suture lines. Median intubation time was 7 days, and median length of stay was 25.0 days. There was no difference in outcomes when comparing intracardiac repairs with the remaining patients, lung agenesis or hypoplasia vs the remaining cohort, or neonates vs infants.
CONCLUSIONS: Slide tracheoplasty and tracheal resection are effective operative strategies for infants and children with tracheal stenosis, including patients with lung agenesis/hypoplasia. Simultaneous repair of intracardiac anomalies and pulmonary artery sling is recommended.
