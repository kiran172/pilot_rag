Title: Laparoscopic Hepatic Ductoplasty in Pediatric Choledochal Cyst: What Is the Role, Feasibility, and Outcome?-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Introduction: The pediatric choledochal cyst with hepatic duct stenosis occurs postoperative hepatolithiasis, recurrent cholangitis, or pancreatitis. The laparoscopic hepatic ductoplasty can prevent these incidences. Objectives: To determine the characteristic of hepatic duct stenosis, laparoscopic treatment, and outcomes in systematic review and meta-analysis. Methodology: We searched the published studies on PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases from January 1985 to April 2022 in English language. This protocol was registered to PROSPERO (CRD42022332145). Results: Nine published studies and 412 patients were included. The meta-analysis revealed that the locations were the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts 43.1%, the left or/and the right hepatic duct 8.3%, and the unclassified location 60.4%. These characteristics included a membranous/septum appearance (44.7%) and a circumferential/relative stenosis (22.7%). The laparoscopic techniques were the wide hilar Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (28.5%), the excision of membranes/septum (26.5%), and the mixed hepatic ductoplasty (45.0%). The outcomes revealed a minor bile leakage of 3.8% and minimal bleeding. The meta-analysis showed no statistical difference between laparoscopic and open techniques in hepatolithiasis (0% versus 2.00%), anastomosis stricture (4.83% versus 10.00%), and no recurrent cholangitis. There was no conversion rate but showed a trend the prolonged operating time in laparoscopy. Conclusion: Laparoscopic hepatic ductoplasty is safe and effective. The characteristics and location can be feasible laparoscopic procedures. So, hepatic ductoplasty decreases hepatolithiasis, anastomosis stricture, or recurrent cholangitis and may increase minor bile leakage. The systematic review registration was PROSPERO system with CRD42022332145.
