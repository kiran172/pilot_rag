Title: Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis Protocol: A Single Center Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Initial treatment of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is correction of electrolyte disturbances with fluid resuscitation. In 2015, our institution implemented a fluid resuscitation protocol based on previous data that focused on minimizing blood draws and allowing immediate ad libitum feeds postoperatively. Our aim was to describe the protocol and subsequent outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective review of patients diagnosed with HPS from 2016 to 2023. All patients were given ad libitum feeds postoperatively and discharged home after tolerating three consecutive feeds. The primary outcome was the postoperative hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes included the number of preoperative labs drawn, time from arrival to surgery, time from surgery to initiation of feeds, time from surgery to full feeds, and re-admission rate.
RESULTS: The study included 333 patients. A total of 142 patients (42.6%) had electrolytic disturbances that required fluid boluses in addition to 1.5x maintenance fluids. The median number of lab draws was 1 (IQR 1,2), with a median time from arrival to surgery of 19.5 hours (IQR 15.3,24.9). The median time from surgery to first and full feed was 1.9 hours (IQR 1.2,2.7) and 11.2 hours (IQR 6.4,18.3), respectively. Patients had a median postoperative LOS of 21.8 hours (IQR 9.7,28.9). Re-admission rate within the first 30 postoperative days was 3.6% (n = 12) with 2.7% of re-admissions occurring within 72 hours of discharge. One patient required re-operation due to an incomplete pyloromyotomy.
DISCUSSION: This protocol is a valuable tool for perioperative and postoperative management of patients with HPS while minimizing uncomfortable intervention.
