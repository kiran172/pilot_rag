Title: Flank pain, hypertension, and hematuria: CT and 3D cinematic rendering in the evaluation of renal artery emergencies-a pictorial essay.

Abstract: Non-traumatic acute renal artery emergencies encompass a spectrum of etiologies, including renal artery stenosis, arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, dissections, thrombosis, and vasculitis. Prompt and accurate diagnosis in the emergency setting is crucial due to the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography (CTA) are the mainstay imaging modalities, offering rapid acquisition and high diagnostic accuracy. The integration of 3D postprocessing techniques, such as 3D cinematic rendering (CR), improves the diagnostic workflow by providing photorealistic and anatomically accurate visualizations. This pictorial essay illustrates the diagnostic utility of CT and CTA, supplemented by 3D CR, through a series of 10 cases of non-traumatic renal artery emergencies. The added value of 3D CR in improving diagnostic confidence, surgical planning, and understanding of complex vascular anatomy is emphasized.
