Title: Does anastomotic leakage after intersphincteric resection for ultralow rectal cancer influence long-term outcomes? A retrospective observational study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine whether anastomotic leakage (AL) following intersphincteric resection (ISR) for ultralow rectal cancer (uLRC) is associated with long-term negative outcomes.
METHODS: Between June 2011 and January 2022, 236 consecutive patients who underwent ISR with diverting ileostomy for uLRC were included. The primary outcome was long-term clinical consequences of AL, including chronic stricture, stoma reversal, and oncological and functional results.
RESULTS: Forty-one (17.4%) patients developed symptomatic AL, whereas only two (0.8%) required re-laparotomy due to severe leakage. Patients with leaks had a significantly increased incidence of chronic stricture (29.3% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.001) and stoma non-reversal (34.1% vs. 4.6%, P < 0.0001) than controls. The severe consequences were particularly common in patients with anastomotic separation, resulting in 60% of those presenting with chronic stricture and 50% ending up with stoma non-reversal. After a median follow-up of 59 (range, 7-139) months, AL did not compromise long-term oncological outcomes, including tumor recurrence (9.8% vs. 5.6%, P = 0.3), 5-year disease-free, and overall survival (73.4% vs. 74.8% and 85.1% vs. 85.4%, P = 0.56 and P = 0.55). A total of 149 patients with bowel continuity who completed self-assessment questionnaires were enrolled for functional evaluation. The median follow-up was 24 (range, 12-94) months after ileostomy reversal, and functional results were comparable between patients with and without leaks.
CONCLUSION: AL is an unfortunate reality for patients who underwent ISR for uLRC, but the rate of severe leakage is limited. Leaks contribute to possible adverse impacts on chronic stricture and stoma non-reversal, especially for patients with anastomotic separation. However, long-term oncological and functional results may not be compromised.
