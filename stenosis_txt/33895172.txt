Title: Massive non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage after cervical carotid angioplasty and stenting: A case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) of the cervical segment is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of carotid artery disease. In rare cases, this procedure causes intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which is described most often as an ipsilateral intra-parenchymal hematoma. This ICH is the result of a cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS). Isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur exceptionally, with only 9 cases that have been reported in the literature.
OBSERVATION: We reported a case of a 71-year-old man who presented a massive non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage one hour after angioplasty and stenting of the cervical segment of the left internal carotid artery. Medical and surgical management included external ventricular drain placement. Rebleeding occurred two days later, worsening the patient's clinical condition. Finally, the patient died 2 weeks later.
COMMENTS: This rare presentation of ICH following CAS allows us to discuss the risk factors, complications and management of CHS.
