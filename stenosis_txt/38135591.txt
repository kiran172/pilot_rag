Title: Use of Sutureless Valve in Aortic Root Enlargement.

Abstract: AIM: The small aortic annulus is a surgical challenge in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement which may lead to patient prosthesis mismatch. Management options include aortic root enlargement, aortic root replacement, and the use of sutureless valves. In this case series, we report our results with aortic root enlargement, sutureless valve implantation, and benchtop modelling of the radial forces exerted.
METHODS: Five patients underwent aortic root enlargement and insertion of the Perceval valve as part of the management strategy to enlarge their effective orifice area. We further investigate this strategy with a benchtop model to quantify the radial forces exerted by the Perceval valve on the aortic annulus. Radial and hoop forces on the aortic annulus and inner ring of the Perceval valve were recorded using a Mylar force tester.
RESULTS: Five female patients with native annulus between 18mm-20mm underwent root enlargement and insertion of a Perceval S valve. The postoperative course was uncomplicated for all patients except for one who required a permanent pacemaker insertion. Transvalvular pressure gradients remained low at up to 4 years of follow-up (12 mmHg-21 mmHg), with no evidence of paravalvular leak. Benchtop testing demonstrated radial forces exerted at the annulus in all-size Perceval S valves to be within physiological variables, whereas compressive forces required to deform the valves were supraphysiological.
CONCLUSIONS: The deployment of a sutureless valve within a surgical enlarged aortic root is a feasible solution in patients with a small aortic root.
