Title: Consensus statements on endoscopic radiofrequency ablation for malignant biliary strictures.

Abstract: Endoscopy-guided endobiliary radiofrequency ablation has emerged as a novel treatment for malignant biliary strictures in recent years. When combined with biliary stenting and systemic chemotherapy, it can effectively postpone local tumor progression, improve patient's quality of life, and prolong their survival, which is mainly indicated for patients with inoperable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and ampullary cancer. Based on the existing clinical evidence, the Digestive Endoscopology Branch of Chinese Medical Association, the Digestive Endoscopy Professional Committee, Endoscopic Physicians Branch of Chinese Medical Doctor Association, and the National Clinical Research Center for Digestive Diseases (Shanghai) organized relevant experts to discuss the indications, contraindications, technical operation specifications, and prevention and treatment of the complications during endoscopy-guided endobiliary radiofrequency ablation. Consensus statements were established, trying to provide references for standard treatment of malignant biliary tumors in clinical practice.
