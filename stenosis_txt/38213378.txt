Title: Severe Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease in an Adult Cystic Fibrosis Patient.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital heart disease. Bicuspid aortic valves are prone to accelerated degenerative changes and aortopathies. These changes often manifest in adulthood as severe aortic stenosis or mixed aortic valve disease. Cystic fibrosis patients are at high risk of adverse surgical outcomes. As survival in cystic fibrosis continues to increase, managing comorbidities including severe aortic stenosis requires consideration. The relatively non-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been posed as an intervention for high-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, traditional randomized trials have excluded patients with bicuspid aortic valves. Herein we present an extremely rare association of severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis in an adult cystic fibrosis patient.Â Furthermore, we discuss the clinical course and a multi-disciplinary approach for the management of this rare scenario.
