Title: A cross-sectional assessment of long-term effects in adolescent and young adult head and neck cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) head and neck (H&N) cancer survivors are at risk of long-term complications. A cross-sectional study of survivors recalled for clinical evaluation was performed to evaluate late effects in this population.
METHODS: Surviving patients who had been diagnosed with H&N cancer between the ages of 15 and 39 years and treated with radiation therapy (RT) in British Columbia between 1970 and 2010 were invited to participate in this study. Survivors were assessed in consultation by a radiation oncologist for a complete history and physical exam. Comprehensive data collection of subjective and objective late effects of RT and screening investigations were completed.
RESULTS: Of 36 AYA H&N participants, the majority were female (61%), and the most common tumour sites were thyroid (28%), oropharynx (17%), salivary gland (14%) and larynx (14%). Dental extractions post treatment was performed for 33% and dental implants for 17%. The majority (72%) reported xerostomia, 50% had dysphagia to solids and 25% hearing loss. Of the non-thyroid cancer patients who underwent RT to their neck, 45% developed hypothyroidism. There were 28% of participants with asymptomatic carotid stenosis and 27% with thyroid nodules; all were diagnosed after recall screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of AYA H&N cancer treated with RT reported numerous long-term complications. Comprehensive follow-up and screening guidelines should be established for this at-risk population.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: AYA H&N cancer survivors and their primary care practitioners should be educated on screening recommendations and the risk of late effects.
