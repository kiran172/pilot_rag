Title: Midterm outcomes after surgical aortic valve replacement with the INSPIRIS RESILIA from a multicenter AVR registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There have been few reports on the mid- to long-term safety and efficacy validation of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic bioprosthesis (Edwards Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, CA, USA) in Japan. Herein, we report the mid-term results of surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis using INSPIRIS and evaluate the hemodynamics compared to the CEP Magna series from the multicenter AVR registry (the ACTIVIST registry).
METHODS: Of the 1967 patients who underwent surgical or transcatheter AVR from the ACTIVIST registry, 66 patients who underwent isolated surgical AVR with INSPIRIS by December 2020 were included in this study, and the early and mid-term results were evaluated. Hemodynamics were evaluated by comparing 272 patients undergoing isolated surgical AVR with the Magna group using propensity score matching.
RESULTS: The mean age was 74.0 ± 7.8 years, and 48.5 % were women. In-hospital mortality was 1.5 %, and the survival rates at 1- and 2-years were 95.2 % and 95.2 %, respectively. After propensity score matching, echocardiographic findings at discharge demonstrated that peak velocity and mean pressure gradient in the INSPIRIS group were comparable, while the effective orifice area in the INSPIRIS group was significantly larger than those in the Magna group (p = 0.048). A patient-prosthesis mismatch at discharge was significantly lower in the INSPIRIS group (11.8 %) than in the Magna group (36.4 %) (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical AVR with INSPIRIS was performed safely and the mid-term results were satisfactory. The hemodynamics of INSPIRIS were comparable to those of Magna.
