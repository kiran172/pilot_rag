Title: Ring Finger Protein 213 in Moyamoya Disease With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: A Mini-Review.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD), most often diagnosed in children and adolescents, is a chronic cerebrovascular disease characterized by progressive stenosis at the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and an abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain. Recently, many investigators show a great interest in MMD with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) is a major susceptibility gene for MMD and also has strong correlations with PAH. Therefore, this review encapsulates current cases of MMD with PAH and discusses MMD with PAH in the aspects of epidemiology, pathology, possible pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment.
