Title: Surgical management of long-segment congenital tracheal stenosis with tracheobronchial malacia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Slide tracheoplasty has become the mainstream treatment for long-segment congenital tracheal stenosis (LSCTS). However, technical improvements are still needed to improve the clinical outcomes of patients exhibiting LSCTS with tracheobronchial malacia.
METHODS: LSCTS patients who underwent tracheoplasty from January 2010 to December 2020 were reviewed. According to the time of surgical technique modifications for reconstructing a supportive carina, the patients were divided into 2 groups: group A (2010-2018) and group B (2019-2020). We identified a well-balanced cohort matched by propensity score to evaluate the differences in surgical outcomes between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between group A and group B in any of the 8 characteristics before and after propensity score matching. In the propensity score-matched cohort, the number of patients who accepted anterior carina tracheopexy (75/77 vs 4/77, P < 0.001) and in situ pericardium insertion (75/77 vs 14/77, P < 0.001) in group B was significantly greater than that in group A. The mechanical ventilation time [48.3 (interquartile range: 29.6, 116.3) h vs 73.3 (interquartile range: 47.9, 111.6) h, P = 0.009] and cumulative mortality (P = 0.023) were significantly lower in Group B than Group A.
CONCLUSIONS: Reconstructing a supportive, stable carina of the neotrachea and tracheobronchopexy are helpful to improve the outcomes of slide tracheoplasty.
