Title: Multicenter Case Series and Literature Review on Durability of Stents in the Thoracic Outlet.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this paper was to report our experience with arterial and venous endovascular stent placement in the thoracic outlet (TO) and review available literature.
METHODS: All patients that underwent arterial or venous stent placement in the TO between 2013 and 2020 in 5 Dutch vascular teaching-hospitals were retrospectively identified. Primary endpoint was symptomatic stent failure due to stenosis, chronic or posture dependent compression, fracture, or occlusion of the stent. Secondary endpoints were symptoms at last follow-up and re-interventions. For the literature review, we searched studies reporting on stenting in the TO.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included with 11 arterial and 15 venous stents implanted to treat angioplasty resistant stenosis in arterial or venous TO syndrome, iatrogenic or traumatic vascular injury, radiotherapy fibrosis, or arterial dissection. Median follow-up was 19 and 14 months in the arterial and venous-group, respectively. Eight (73%) patients in the arterial, and 9 (60%) in the venous-group suffered symptomatic stent failure. Seven (64%) patients in the arterial, and 9 (60%) in the venous-group required at least 1 re-intervention. When comparing all patients with stent placement after TO decompression (TOD) to patients without, there were substantially more symptomatic stent failures and re-interventions required in the patients without TOD. Six patients (54%) in the arterial-group and 11 (73%) in the venous-group were symptom-free at last follow-up. Five articles describing 51 patients with arterial and 6 articles describing 81 patients with venous stents were included in the literature review. In the arterial-group, no TOD prior to stent placement was performed, while in the venous-group all but 1 article performed TOD prior to stent placement. Results showed comparable rates of symptomatic stent failure (24% vs 30%), and patients requiring re-interventions (29% vs 21%) between groups.
CONCLUSION: Based on our multicenter series and review, stents in the TO have a considerable risk of failure, both in the venous and the arterial territory. Especially in patients without TOD: the need for re-interventions is high and half the patients eventually undergo TOD. Based on the currently available data, stenting in the TO should be applied cautiously while TOD should be considered.
