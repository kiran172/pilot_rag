Title: Correlation between Degenerative Thoracolumbar Kyphosis and Lumbar Posterior Muscle.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The relationship between spinal alignment, particularly degenerative thoracolumbar kyphosis (DTLK) combined with lumbar spine stenosis (LSS), and paraspinal muscle content remains underexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics of paraspinal muscle distribution in DTLK patients and its association with lumbar lordosis (LL) and body mass index (BMI).
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted comparing 126 patients with DTLK and LSS against 87 control patients. The lumbar crossing indentation value (LCIV) was introduced as a novel measurement for paraspinal muscle content, and its relationship with thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), BMI, and LL was assessed.
RESULTS: LCIV in DTLK patients was found to be lower than in the control group, with a progressive increase from the upper to lower lumbar spine. In the control group, paraspinal muscle content was observed to increase with age and BMI, and LCIV was higher in males. However, the DTLK group showed no gender difference. LCIV in the DTLK group was more pronounced in patients with increased LL. The degree of TLK was not influenced by BMI but was associated with the content of the paravertebral muscle.
CONCLUSIONS: Paraspinal muscle content, as measured by LCIV, is significantly associated with DTLK and LSS. The study emphasizes the importance of considering paraspinal muscle health in DTLK patients and offers valuable insights for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.
