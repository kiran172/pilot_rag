Title: Eligibility for minithoracotomy aortic valve replacement: from Van Praet classification to complex scanner measurements.

Abstract: Van Praet proposed a classification to predict the ease of minithoracotomy aortic valve replacement (MT-AVR) based on the position of the aorta in the thorax. We have evaluated the relevance of complex computed tomography (CT) scan measurements to predict the ease of performing a MT-AVR. The first 57 patients who underwent MT-AVR from February 2018 to June 2020 were selected prior to surgery using Van Praet's IA and IB classes. We made additional measurements on aorta position related to the chest and the incision on the preoperative CT scan. The main objective was to correlate complex CT measurements with different operating durations. Van Praet criteria were significantly related to the distance from the center of the aorta to the midline (p value < 0.001), the distance from the center of the aortic ring to the midline (p value = 0.013) and aorto-sternal angle (p < 0.001). We did not find a correlation between CT criteria and the different surgical steps durations in patients belonging to Van Praet classes IA and IB. Our cohort of Van Praet class Ia and Ib patients were able to benefit from a MT-AVR without the need for conversion. Complex CT measurements do not provide additional information to predict surgical difficulties. This classification appears to be sufficient to determine a patient's eligibility for MT-AVR, even for a surgeon experienced in sternotomy in his first MT-AVR.
