Title: Cervical posterior foraminotomy: how i do it.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cervical pathologies are addressed through a variety of anterior and posterior approaches and minimally invasive procedures have been successfully applied during the last decades. Posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) should be proposed with isolated foraminal stenosis.
METHOD: We provide a step-by-step description of PCF through the use of tubular retractors. Its advantages and limitations were detailed.
CONCLUSION: PCF performed with tubular retractors represent a safe and efficient alternative to address an isolated level disease with unilateral radiculopathy. The risk of mechanical instability is limited when only the medial third of the facet is drilled. Patients present rapid functional recovery.
