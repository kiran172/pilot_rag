Title: Esophageal stricture as an initial manifestation of Crohn's disease.

Abstract: Crohn's disease located in the esophagus is rare, being exceptional as the initial manifestation of the disease. Erosive ulcerative esophagitis, stricture and fistula are forms of presentation, as in other esophageal pathologies, so the differential diagnosis is broad. The histologic features of esophageal Crohn's disease can be nonspecific and increase the diagnostic challenge. Esophageal Crohn's disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of esophageal strictures and may require esophagectomy if medical-endoscopic treatment is not effective.
