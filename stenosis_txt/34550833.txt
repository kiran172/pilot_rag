Title: Effect of renal impairment on the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial treatment: A post-hoc analysis of DIRECT-MT study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of renal impairment on clinical outcomes in patients presenting emergent anterior circulation occlusion treated with mechanical thrombectomy.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with anterior circulation stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy at 41 academic tertiary care centers were included. renal impairment was defined as glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the time of admission. The primary outcome was the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale, and safety outcomes were mortality within 90 days and hemorrhagic complications. Binary and ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between renal impairment and categorical outcomes. Linear regression was used to assess continuous outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 607 patients (47 renal impairment and 600 non-renal impairment) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy were included in this study. Multivariate regression analysis showed that renal impairment was independently associated with the increase of the modified Rankin scale at 90 days. The proportion of patients with successful reperfusion was 71.7% in the renal impairment group and 83.3% in the non-renal impairment group. Renal impairment was an independent predictor of 90-day mortality. No significant treatment for the ordinal modified Rankin scale or 90-day mortality was observed by renal impairment interaction. The risk of asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher in the mechanical thrombectomy plus IVT group (53.6%) than in the mechanical thrombectomy alone group (15.8%) for renal impairment, but was similar between the mechanical thrombectomy plus IVT group (34.6%) and the mechanical thrombectomy alone group (36.4%) for non-renal impairment (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that the outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy alone and mechanical thrombectomy plus IVT group did not differ significantly in acute stroke patients with and without renal impairment. Also, renal impairment was an independent predictor of worse functional independence and higher mortality at 90 days.
