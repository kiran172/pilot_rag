Title: Patient Risk Assessment for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement at Veterans Health Administration Hospitals.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare patient-level risk assessment at Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with patients included in the Society for Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy (STS/ACC TVT) registry.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of veterans with severe aortic stenosis (AS) receiving TAVR from 2012-2016 at eight VA hospitals and compared them with TVT registry outcomes from 2012-2015. Patients were identified via administrative data. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality, 30-day and 1-year transient ischemic attack/stroke rates, and permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation rates.
RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 726 veterans underwent TAVR including valve-in-valve procedures (n = 50). Patients were predominantly male (98.2%), with mean age of 78.5 Â± 9.3 years; 49.1% were at prohibitive risk and 12.1% were at high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement; 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality rates were 2.5% and 14.7%, respectively; 30-day and 1-year combined TIA/stroke rates were 6.5% and 13.5%, respectively. In the TVT registry, 15.8% and 37.8% of patients were at prohibitive and high risk, respectively; 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were 5.7% and 22.7%, respectively, and stroke rates were 2.1% and 4.0%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This report on TAVR risk assessment within the VA system demonstrates that despite a large proportion of patients classified as prohibitive risk, TAVR was associated with favorable 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality rates when compared with published outcomes from the STS/ACC TVT registry.
