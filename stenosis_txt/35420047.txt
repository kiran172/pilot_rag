Title: Aortic valve intervention for aortic stenosis and cardiac amyloidosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis with cardiac amyloidosis (CA-AS) is common in the elderly. We provide an overview and a meta-analysis of outcomes after aortic valve (AV) intervention. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. Weighted pooled analysis showed a non-significant higher risk of death in CA-AS patients following surgical or transcatheter AV replacement. After transcatheter AV replacement, the risk of death in CA-AS patients was comparable to that associated with aortic stenosis alone (risk ratio: 1.23; 95% CI: 0.77-1.96; p = 0.39; I2 = 0%). An AV intervention is possibly not futile in CA-AS and should not be denied to patients with this condition.
