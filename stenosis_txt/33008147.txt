Abstract: Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis is the most prevalent surgical pathology in cardiac surgery, and its isolated replacement has historically been performed by means of complete middle sternotomy. However, a great revolution has recently taken place, especially after the arrival of sutureless aortic prostheses that, together with a new impulse by cardiac surgery towards a less invasive course, has caused the replacement of said valve to be carried out more and more frequently due to these prostheses and minor access incisions. For this reason, we carried out a review of the cases operated on in our service from the beginning of the minimum access surgery program, comparing them with the results of the cases operated at the same time using conventional surgery.
