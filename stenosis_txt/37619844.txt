Title: Complications of Endoscopic Thoracic Spine Surgery: Overview and Complication Avoidance.

Abstract: In endoscopic thoracic spine surgery, adaptations of thoracic surgical techniques such as full endoscopic uniportal and biportal surgical techniques have been developed. Full endoscopic uniportal surgery for thoracic disc herniation or thoracic ossified ligamentum flavum (OLF) has been performed via transforaminal and interlaminar approaches. In the case of thoracic OLF or thoracic spinal stenosis, the uniportal interlaminar approach is appropriate. The uniportal interlaminar approach has been used to treat thoracic OLF and has shown good surgical results. Thoracic OLF removal via a biportal endoscopic technique has been developed recently and is described in a few studies. Although endoscopic thoracic spine surgery has significant advantages, complications often occur with this approach. We reviewed the literature to date on the complications associated with endoscopic spine surgery in thoracic pathology. This review emphasizes how to avoid and manage complications. Based on the results of several previous studies, endoscopic thoracic spine surgery could be associated with fewer potential complications than conventional surgery. Endoscopic spine surgery has remarkable advantages; however, endoscopic thoracic surgery is technically challenging and is potentially associated with serious complications. To minimize the risk of avoidable complications, surgeons should be familiar with prevention methods and pitfalls.
