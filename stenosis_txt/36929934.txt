Title: Impact of early changes in cardiac damage following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The staging classification of aortic stenosis (AS) which characterises the extent of cardiac damage has been validated in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Short-term changes in cardiac damage after TAVI and their association with long-term prognosis remain unknown.
AIMS: This study aims to investigate the early evolution of cardiac damage after TAVI and the association of residual cardiac damage with clinical outcomes in TAVI recipients.
METHODS: AS patients undergoing TAVI were consecutively enrolled and classified into five stages of cardiac damage (0-4). Early change in cardiac damage was defined as any change of stage at 30 days (Î”cardiac damage between baseline pre-TAVI and 30 days post-TAVI).
RESULTS: Within 30 days post-TAVI, the baseline cardiac damage stage had changed in 22.2% of 644 TAVI recipients, accompanied by improvements in the degree of dyspnoea and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Two-year mortality was associated with residual cardiac damage within 30 days post-TAVI (hazard ratio [HR] 2.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07-4.25; p<0.001). Compared to unchanged cardiac damage post-TAVI, further cardiac damage within 30 days was associated with a higher crude risk of 2-year mortality (HR 22.04, 95% CI: 9.87-49.20; p<0.001). Cardiac deterioration within 30 days post-TAVI was an independent risk factor for 2-year mortality (HR 19.564, 95% CI: 8.047-47.565; p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provided insight into the early evolution of cardiac damage in TAVI recipients and confirmed the predictive value of both residual and early changes in cardiac damage post-TAVI. Cardiac deterioration within 30 days is associated with poor clinical prognosis.
