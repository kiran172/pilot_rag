Title: En Bloc Simultaneous Liver-Kidney Transplantation Compared to the Traditional Technique: Results From a Single Center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation is indicated for patients with concomitant end-stage liver disease and end-stage renal disease. The traditional technique involves separate implantations of the liver and the kidney. In the en bloc approach, the liver is recovered en bloc with the right kidney and the donor renal artery is anastomosed to the donor splenic artery. We aimed to compare the outcomes of the traditional and en bloc techniques for simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation in a single center.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study involved all adult patients who underwent simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation from brain-dead donors from January 2017 to December 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were included: 10 transplanted with the traditional technique and 5 with the en bloc approach. Patients in the en bloc group presented higher body mass index, shorter kidney cold and total ischemia times, shorter overall surgical time and longer kidney warm ischemia time (29.07 kg/m2vs 23.20 kg/m2 [P = .048]; 560 minutes vs 880 minutes [P = .026]; 615 minutes vs 908 minutes [P = 0.025]; 405 minutes vs 485 minutes [P = .046]; 46 minutes vs 33.5 minutes [P = 0.027], respectively). Ureteroneocystostomy was performed in 2 patients of the en bloc group and ureteroureterostomy in the remaining 3 patients. One patient in the en bloc group presented stenosis of renal artery anastomosis and underwent percutaneous angioplasty. This same patient eventually developed late urinary fistula. In the traditional technique group, there were 2 cases of renal vein thrombosis and 1 of ureteral stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the traditional technique, the en bloc approach is feasible and safe, reducing kidney total ischemia time and overall surgical time.
