Title: Long-term outcomes of endovascular therapy for right subclavian artery occlusive lesions: A multi-center experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To review our multi-institutional experience with endovascular therapy for right subclavian artery occlusive disease and to evaluate the long-term outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all patients with right subclavian artery stenosis and occlusive disease who underwent endovascular therapy between March 2014 and September 2022 at two institutions. Patient baseline demographics, lesion characteristics, treatment strategies, and in-hospital and follow-up outcomes were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Between March 2014 and September 2022, 73 patients underwent endovascular treatment at the two institutions. The dominant cause of lesions in this cohort was atherosclerosis. Three different types of lesions were summarized, and the corresponding endovascular strategies were performed. 66 patients (90.4%) underwent successful endovascular treatment, and 62 patients (84.9%) underwent balloon-expandable stent deployment. The mean perioperative in-hospital stay was 4.0 days (range, 3-6 days). Two patients died due to myocardial infarction, and one died of cerebral hemorrhage resulting from a traffic accident within 30 days of the intervention. The median follow-up time was 31.6 months (range, 12-96 months). No complications, including death, stroke, stent fractures, or migration, were noted in any patient during the follow-up period. The overall complication rate was 7/73 (9.6%), and 5/7 (6.9%) of the complications required reintervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of right subclavian artery lesions is safe, effective, and technically achievable. The reasonable use of balloon-expandable stents can achieve satisfactory outcomes with accurate orientation and promising patency.
