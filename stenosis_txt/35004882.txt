Title: Pathogenesis and Molecular Immune Mechanism of Calcified Aortic Valve Disease.

Abstract: Calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) was previously regarded as a passive process associated with valve degeneration and calcium deposition. However, recent studies have shown that the occurrence of CAVD is an active process involving complex changes such as endothelial injury, chronic inflammation, matrix remodeling, and neovascularization. CAVD is the ectopic accumulation of calcium nodules on the surface of the aortic valve, which leads to aortic valve thickening, functional stenosis, and ultimately hemodynamic disorders. CAVD has become an important cause of death from cardiovascular disease. The discovery of therapeutic targets to delay or block the progression of CAVD and the clinical application of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of CAVD. This article summarizes the pathogenesis of CAVD and provides insight into the future directions of CAVD diagnosis and treatment.
