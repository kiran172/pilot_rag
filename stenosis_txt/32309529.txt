Title: Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty of global kidney ischemia improves renal function and blood pressure.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) can lead to hypertension and renal failure. Nevertheless, its treatment by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) remains controversial. It is unknown, whether patients with global kidney ischemia (GKI), that means patients with bilateral RAS or RAS with a single functioning kidney, may benefit from PTRA or not.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 93 patients with RAS (25 bilateral or single functioning kidney) undergoing PTRA. Patients had refractory hypertension (≥3 medications). Blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs and serum-creatinine were compared pre-/post-intervention and at 1 year's follow-up.
RESULTS: At 1 year after PTRA of patients with GKI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced compared to patients with unilateral PTRA (systolic: -19.1 ± 10.5 [bilateral] vs. -11.4 ± 12.1 mmHg [unilateral], P < 0.01; diastolic: -10.1 ± 6.8 mmHg vs. -6.3 ± 6.6 mmHg, P < 0.05). The number of antihypertensive drugs was reduced by -0.8 ± 3.0 at 1 year in patients with GKI, while it increased by +0.1 ± 3.5 in the unilateral RAS group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, post-interventional serum-creatinine decreased by -34.6 ± 31.4 μmol/I after of patients with GKI (P < 0.001 vs. baseline). In patients with unilateral PTRA, a non-significant increase in serum-creatinine was observed (+8.3 ± 2 μmol/l).
CONCLUSION: PTRA in patients with GKI led to improved blood pressure and renal function. A large, well-designed, randomized clinical trial targeting this population is still needed. The benefit of PTRA should be measured with the risks in each patient individually.
