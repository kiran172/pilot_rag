Title: Comorbidity of Mitral Valve Stenosis with Influenza in Pregnancy, A Case Report.

Abstract: In this case, a 44-year-old pregnant woman at a gestational age of 28 weeks and 6 days with symptoms of cold, shortness of breath, and cough since a week ago. She had received remdesivir ampoule, Tamiflu tablet, meropenem and linezolid, and dexamethasone. She received oxygen through a 14-liter reservoir bag mask and hydrocortisone, heparin, and ceftriaxone. Nine hours after hospitalization, the patient suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest, resuscitation was performed, and the patient was intubated. Emergency cesarean section was done in the intensive care unit. Finally, the patient suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest, prop was placed for the patient, and evidence of severe Mitral stenosis and right ventricle dilation were observed. The cardiopulmonary resuscitation operation continued for an hour, but unfortunately the patient died. So, it is important to be careful about influenza during pregnancy and in the case of heart failure symptoms, it is necessary to consider the presence of underlying mitral stenosis.
