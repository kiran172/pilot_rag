Title: Diagnosis and Treatment of Renal Artery Stenosis in China in the Era of Donation After Cardiac Death.

Abstract: BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and treatment strategies of transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) with kidneys from donation after cardiac death (DCD). MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected the clinical data of donors and recipients of single-center DCD-induced TRAS from January 2015 to June 2017. RESULTS All the 8 cases of TRAS were from hypertensive cerebrovascular accident DCD-originated kidneys. The mean donor age was 53.5 (45~57) years, with mean BMI 27.8 (26.4~32.3) kg/mÂ², atherosclerosis index 5.8 (4.9~7.0), and renal atherosclerotic plaque. Clinical features of TRAS were: refractory hypertension with elevated serum creatinine >50%, and negative urine protein and occult blood. Ultrasound of transplanted kidneys showed renal blood flow index 0.49 (0.43~0.55). Angiography confirmed the diagnosis of renal artery trunk or secondary branch stenosis. There were 2 cases of moderate stenosis and 6 cases of severe stenosis. Six patients underwent stent implantation and 2 patients underwent balloon dilatation. Seven patients had serum creatinine recovery after interventional therapy during follow-up. The transplanted kidney of 1 patient ruptured 6 h after interventional therapy and was then resected. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of TRAS with hypertensive cerebrovascular accident DCD-originated kidneys is relatively high, which is a warning to kidney transplant physicians. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the most reliable diagnostic means of TRAS and can be performed concurrently with intervention therapy. If the donor has severe atherosclerosis, plaques that are visible to the unaided eye in the renal artery trunk should be removed as completely as possible.
