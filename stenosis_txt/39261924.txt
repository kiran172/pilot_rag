Title: "One-stop" interventional therapy for quadricuspid aortic valve combined with severe coronary artery disease: a case report.

Abstract: Congenital Quadricuspid Aortic Valve (QAV) malformation is a relatively rare cardiac valve malformation, especially with abnormal coronary opening and severe stenosis of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The patient underwent "one-stop" interventional treatment with transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous coronary stent implantation. Follow up for 12-month with good outcomes.
