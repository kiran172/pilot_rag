Title: Development and validation of machine learning algorithms based on electrocardiograms for cardiovascular diagnoses at the population level.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithms are gaining prominence for the early detection of cardiovascular (CV) conditions, including those not traditionally associated with conventional ECG measures or expert interpretation. This study develops and validates such models for simultaneous prediction of 15 different common CV diagnoses at the population level. We conducted a retrospective study that included 1,605,268 ECGs of 244,077 adult patients presenting to 84 emergency departments or hospitals, who underwent at least one 12-lead ECG from February 2007 to April 2020 in Alberta, Canada, and considered 15 CV diagnoses, as identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes: atrial fibrillation (AF), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT), cardiac arrest (CA), atrioventricular block (AVB), unstable angina (UA), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI (NSTEMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), aortic stenosis (AS), mitral valve prolapse (MVP), mitral valve stenosis (MS), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and heart failure (HF). We employed ResNet-based deep learning (DL) using ECG tracings and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) using ECG measurements. When evaluated on the first ECGs per episode of 97,631 holdout patients, the DL models had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of <80% for 3 CV conditions (PTE, SVT, UA), 80-90% for 8 CV conditions (CA, NSTEMI, VT, MVP, PHTN, AS, AF, HF) and an AUROC > 90% for 4 diagnoses (AVB, HCM, MS, STEMI). DL models outperformed XGB models with about 5% higher AUROC on average. Overall, ECG-based prediction models demonstrated good-to-excellent prediction performance in diagnosing common CV conditions.
