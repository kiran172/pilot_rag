Title: Tomographic 3D ultrasound for grading stenosis of superficial femoral artery.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Treatment decision of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is governed by the severity of stenosis. Tomographic 3D ultrasound (t3DUS) is a reliable imaging technique for measuring vessel stenosis. In this study we attempted to provide a precise measurement of superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenosis using t3DUS in patients with PAD.
METHODS: t3DUS was used to measure maximum stenosis percentage in SFA from 50 patients with lower extremity PAD. The maximum stenosed segment in SFA was defined using Duplex 2DUS aliasing was noted. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) was measured at the maximum stenotic site and proximal to aliasing for calculating the velocity ratio. The association between blood flow velocity ratio and the degree of stenosis measured using Duplex 2DUS and t3DUS, respectively, was assessed using Spearman rank correlation.
RESULTS: There was a strong positive correlation between velocity ratio and degree of stenosis in SFA measured using t3DUS (correlation value (r) = 0.99, p &lt; 0.001). The correlation between Stenosis percentage and velocity ratio in SFA are as followed: &lt;50:&lt;2; 50-54:2-2.4; 55-59:2.5-2.9; 60-64:3-3.4; 65-69:3.5-3.9; 70-74:4-4.4; 75-79:4.5-4.9; &gt;80:&gt;5.
UNLABELLED: t3DUS can be used to provide precise measurement of the severity of SFA stenosis in patients with lower extremities arterial disease. The established criteria for grading SFA stenosis in this study can be applied to the current practice alongside Duplex 2DUS as it showed a strong positive correlation with velocity ratio. Further studies investigating the sensitivity and specificity of t3DUS in the assessment of stenosis in lower limbs arteries are required.
