Title: A case of variant parachute mitral valve associated with mitral annular disjunction arrhythmic syndrome.

Abstract: Parachute mitral valve (PMV) is a rare congenital cardiac valvular anomaly often associated with other congenital cardiac defects, particularly Shone's complex, but may infrequently occur in isolation. PMV and its variants are predominantly associated with mitral stenosis (MS) or rarely mitral regurgitation (MR). We present the case of a middle-aged female who was evaluated for a syncopal episode and found to have an atypical variant PMV with disproportionately long anterior mitral leaflet, bileaflet mitral valve prolapse, and mitral annular disjunction, without associated MS or MR. This is the first case report to highlight this particular constellation of findings.
