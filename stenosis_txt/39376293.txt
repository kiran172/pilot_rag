Title: Post-operative Clinical Evaluation of Endoscopic Dacryocystorhinostomy: Insights from a Three-Month Follow-Up Study.

Abstract: A bibliometric analysis concluded that the evaluation of post-operative outcomes of endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy in Indonesia had yet to be done. Hence, this study aims to assess the postoperative outcomes of endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy, focusing on ostium granulation, intranasal synechiae, membranous obstruction, and ostium stenosis after a three-month follow-up in our Indonesian center. A longitudinal study (2017-2023) at our Indonesian center included cases with a minimum of three-month follow-up. Nasal endoscopy assessed ostium granulation, intranasal synechiae, membranous obstruction, and ostium stenosis. 28 cases were successfully followed up for three months. At three months, ostium granulation was present in 42.9% of cases, membranous obstruction in 14.3% of cases, with no intranasal synechiae or ostium stenosis observed. Out of 28 cases, 13 were successfully followed for six months, revealing ostium granulation in 7.7%, membranous obstruction in 38.5%, and ostium stenosis in 23.1%. Ostium granulation predominates, followed by membranous obstruction at three-month follow-up. Ostium stenosis, a minimal occurrence, manifests after six months.
