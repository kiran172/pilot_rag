Title: Invasive Tracheobronchial Aspergillosis: A Fatal Complication in a Patient With Treated Mediastinal Lung Adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: Invasive tracheobronchial aspergillosis (ITBA) is a rare but severe form of invasive aspergillosis. This report presents a fatal case of ITBA in a 75-year-old man with a complex medical history including mediastinal lung adenocarcinoma, radiation pneumonitis, and pulmonary nocardiosis. The patient was admitted with worsening dyspnea and chest imaging revealed severe airway stenosis. Initially suspected to be cancer recurrence, post-mortem examination confirmed ITBA caused by Aspergillus penicillioides. Histopathological findings showed fungal invasion of the tracheobronchial tree with destruction, obstruction, and perforation of the airways. Multiple risk factors likely contributed to the development of ITBA in this patient, including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), long-term steroid use, prior COVID-19 infection, and a history of radiation therapy. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of ITBA, particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities and a history of malignancy. It emphasizes the importance of considering fungal infections in the differential diagnosis of airway obstruction in high-risk patients.
