Title: Heyde's syndrome: a challenging case of severe aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Abstract: We present the case of an elderly man with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation, who presented with fatigue, weakness, coffee ground emesis and black tarry stool. Haemoglobin was 68â€‰g/L. Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 1038. Evaluation by cardiology and gastroenterology specialists revealed reflux oesophagitis and a mild hiatal hernia on oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, normal colonoscopy and small bowel series without obstruction. Capsule endoscopy identified angiodysplasia in the small intestine.The patient was diagnosed with Heyde's syndrome based on the triad of severe aortic stenosis, gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia and acquired von Willebrand syndrome. The patient underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement, resulting in the resolution of symptoms.Heyde's syndrome represents a challenging clinical entity requiring a multidisciplinary approach for accurate diagnosis and management. Early recognition, prompt intervention and interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial in optimising patient outcomes.
