Title: Non-aneurysmal ascending aorta diameter changes after aortic valve replacement in patients with stenotic bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The appropriate timing of aortic repair in patients with bicuspid aortic valve-related aortopathy remains controversial. We describe the changes in diameter of the non-aneurysmal ascending aorta after aortic valve replacement for bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valve stenosis.
METHODS: This retrospective review included 189 patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement for severe stenotic aortic valve with a non-aneurysmal ascending aorta diameter of 45 mm or less between January 2008 and December 2018. A linear mixed-effect model was used to analyze and compare the enlargement rates of the non-aneurysmal ascending aorta at the tubular portion after aortic valve replacement in bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve patients.
RESULTS: The enlargement rate of the non-aneurysmal ascending aorta after aortic valve replacement was significantly greater in the bicuspid aortic valve group than in the tricuspid aortic valve group (0.36 mm/year vs. 0.09 mm/year, p < 0.001). The specific form of bicuspid aortic valve also affected aorta diameter enlargement: the enlargement rate of 0.85 mm/year in the Type 0 (according to Sievers' classification) group was approximately five times that in the Non-Type 0 group (p < 0.001). No aortic events were observed, and no patients needed reoperations for the ascending aorta, in either the bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valve groups.
CONCLUSION: The persistent possibility of progressive ascending aortic dilatation after aortic valve replacement for bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, especially in Type 0 bicuspid aortic valve patients, demands careful post-procedural evaluation of the ascending aorta.
