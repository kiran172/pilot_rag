Title: Percutaneous Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute Symptomatic Iliofemoral Deep Venous Thrombosis Patients With Recent Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and mid-term outcomes of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) for acute symptomatic iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) patients with recent (within 4 weeks) aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2016 to February 2020, 11 acute symptomatic iliofemoral DVT patients with a recent history of aSAH were enrolled in this study. All patients had a history of aneurysm ligation or clipping previously, computed tomography (CT) scans revealed ventricular hemorrhage had been absorbed obviously and no residual aneurysm. The mean time of DVT onset after aSAH ictus was 19.2±4.5 days, and the mean Glasgow score was 6.8 ± 0.7 (range, 6-8). These patients underwent PMT with an 8 French Aspirex®S device (Straub Medical AG, Wangs, Switzerland), subsequent stenting was performed to relieve the underlying stenosis, followed by anticoagulation alone. The procedure-related complications were assessed after intervention. The follow-ups were conducted up to 1 year, the patency was evaluated via duplex ultrasonography, and the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) was evaluated using the Villalta scale.
RESULTS: Grade III (>90%) clearance was achieved in all 11 patients. Stenting was performed in 7 patients (63.6%). There were no cerebral rebleeding events or other severe complications except 1 puncture site bleeding during treatment. A total of 90.9% (10 of 11) of patients were alive at the 12 month follow-up, and 7 patients achieved a good functional outcome. At the 1 year follow-up, there was 1 patient (10%) with mild PTS. The ultrasound showed that the patency of the iliofemoral veins was 100%, and femoral valvular incompetence was observed in 1 patient.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy seems to be a feasible and safe treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT in selected patients with recent aSAH, and it shows promising results in restoring patency and reducing the risk of PTS.
