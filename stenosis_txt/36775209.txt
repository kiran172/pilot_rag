Title: Innovative method for the diagnosis of bile duct lesions using a novel tapered-tip sheath system to facilitate biliary biopsies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pathologic evaluation of bile duct lesions is crucial for a definitive diagnosis and determination of an appropriate therapeutic strategy; however, current methods are limited by several challenges. This study evaluated the impact of a novel tapered-tip sheath system on biliary stricture diagnosis.
METHODS: This observational study evaluated 47 consecutive patients who underwent transpapillary biliary stricture biopsy using the novel tapered-tip sheath system from July 2020 to March 2022 compared with 51 historical control subjects undergoing conventional biopsies. Technical success rate, total biopsy time, number of biopsy specimens, adequate tissue sampling rate, adverse events, and diagnostic performance for biliary strictures were assessed.
RESULTS: The technical success rate was favorable in both groups, showing no significant difference (97.9% [46 of 47] vs 88.2% [45 of 51], P = .114). However, the total biopsy time was significantly shorter in the novel system group (3.7 vs 7.7 minutes, P < .001). The number of biopsy specimens did not differ between the groups; however, the novel system group had significantly more cases in which ≥3 tissue samples could be obtained (71.7% [33 of 46] vs 51.1% [23 of 45], P = .043), a higher adequate tissue sampling rate (88.2% vs 66.4%, P < .001), and fewer adverse events (6.4% vs 21.6%, P = .043). Although the diagnostic specificity of both groups was 100%, the novel system group had significantly higher diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy (82.1% vs 50% [P = .004] and 84.8% vs 55.5% [P = .005], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The novel tapered-tip sheath system is a promising tool for biliary stricture diagnosis.
