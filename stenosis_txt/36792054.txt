Title: Delayed postrenal failure due to progression of asymptomatic hydronephrosis following hysterectomy.

Abstract: Asymptomatic hydronephrosis following hysterectomy is generally transient. Here, we present the case of a 52-year-old woman who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for benign indications. Computed tomography (CT) to examine bleeding on the second postoperative day incidentally revealed bilateral grade II hydronephrosis. Asymptomatic hydronephrosis was not reevaluated, and gynecological outpatient follow-up was terminated with a normal creatinine level on postoperative day 43. On postoperative day 107, the patient noticed weight gain of 10 kg, decreased urine output, and generalized edema. The serum creatinine level was elevated to 5.4 mg/dL, and CT revealed bilateral grade III hydronephrosis. Urgent bilateral ureteral stenting was performed to treat stenosis of the distal ureters that caused postrenal failure. Ureteroneocystostomy was performed for strict stenosis of the right ureter at 10 months postoperatively. Histological examination of the resected distal ureter showed inflammation and fibrosis. Asymptomatic hydronephrosis developing after hysterectomy progress to delayed postrenal failure.
