Title: Histologic evaluation of a catheter coated with paclitaxel PLGA nanoparticles in the internal jugular veins of rats.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of catheterization on intimal hyperplasia and explore the efficacy of Paclitaxel loaded PLGA nanoparticles (PTX-NPs) in preventing stenosis at the site of venous injury. Under general anesthesia, Central Venous Catheters were inserted into the rat's right internal jugular veins (IJV) using the cut-down technique. Twenty bare catheters (C) and twenty PTX-NPs coated catheters (P) were assigned to one of four groups (C2, C4, P2, or P4) based on catheter type and expected survival time. 2 or 4 weeks after surgery, IJVs were completely harvested by formalin fixation and gelatin infusion and slides were stained with H&E (Haematoxylin and Eosin) and Masson's technique. The P2 (Paclitaxel coating, 2 weeks) group showed the most proliferation among the four groups and the P4 (Paclitaxel coating, 4 weeks) showed a tendency to decrease proliferation. Additionally, the lumen size in the P4 group was about 6% smaller than in the P2 group, and there was a lower prevalence of stenotic grade in the P4 group. Our study suggests that PTX-NPs coated catheters may be effective in preventing venous stenosis if the intended usage is prolonged, rather than for a short-term period.
