Title: Long-Term Results of Transcatheter Closure of Large Patent Ductus Arteriosus with Severe Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in Pediatric Patients.

Abstract: AIMS: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is one of the most commonly seen congenital heart diseases prevalent today. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter closure of hypertensive ductus at long-term follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transcatheter closure was attempted in 52 patients with hypertensive ductus arteriosus. A lateral or right anterior oblique view aortogram was done to locate and delineate PDA. All the patients underwent clinical examination, electrocardiography, chest X-rays, and echocardiography before discharge and at 1, 6, and 12 months after the procedure and yearly thereafter.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients at procedure was 7.98 ± 4.79 (11 months-17 years), and the mean weight was 17.72 ± 10.81 (4-47) kg. Transcatheter closure of hypertensive ductus was successful in 50 (96.15%) patients. The mean preprocedural pulmonary artery pressure was 81.38 ± 17.31 (range: 55-113) mmHg which decreased to 29.65±8.63 (19-38) mmHg at follow up. The most commonly used device was Amplatzer duct occluder in 63% of the patients followed by Amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder in 37% of the patients. There were two procedural failures, namely aortic obstruction and left pulmonary artery stenosis, which were managed uneventfully. There were no procedural deaths or device embolization. At median follow-up of 86 months, all the patients are well with no complications.
CONCLUSION: The long-term results suggested that transcatheter closure of PDA with severe pulmonary hypertension in pediatric patients is safe and effective with minimal complications.
