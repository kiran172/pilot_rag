Title: Use of Rectus Flaps in Reconstructive Surgery for Gynecologic Cancer.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to explore the outcomes of pelvic reconstruction with a rectus abdominis myocutaneous (RAM) or rectus abdominis myoperitoneal (RAMP) flap following radical surgery for gynecologic malignancy. This is a retrospective case series of all pelvic reconstructions with RAM or RAMP flap performed in a gynecologic oncology service between 1998 and 2023. Reconstructions with other flaps were excluded. A total of 28 patients were included. Most patients had vulvar cancer (n = 15, 53.6%) and the majority had disease recurrence (n = 20, 71.4%). Exenteration was the most common procedure, being carried out in 20 (71.4%) patients. Pelvic reconstruction was carried out with a RAM flap in 24 (85.7%) cases and a RAMP flap in 4 (14.3%) cases. Flap-specific complications included cellulitis (14.3%), partial breakdown (17.9%), and necrosis (17.9%). Donor site complications included surgical site infection and necrosis occurring in seven (25.0%) and three (10.7%) patients, respectively. Neovaginal reconstruction was performed in 14 patients. Out of those, two (14.3%) had neovaginal stenosis and three (21.4%) had rectovaginal fistula. In total, 50% of patients were disease-free at the time of the last follow up. In conclusion, pelvic reconstruction with RAM/RAMP flaps, at the time of radical surgery for gynecologic cancer, is an uncommon procedure. In our case series, we had a significant complication rate with the most common being infection and necrosis. The development of a team approach, with input from services including Gynecologic Oncology and Plastic Surgery should be developed to decrease post-operative complications and improve patient outcomes.
