Title: Intraoperative assessment of blood flow using transabdominal ultrasound during laparoscopic surgery of celiac artery compression syndrome.

Abstract: Surgical treatment of celiac artery (CA) compression syndrome (CACS) is to release the median arcuate ligament (MAL) by removing the abdominal nerve plexus surrounding CA. In laparoscopic surgery of CACS, objective intraoperative assessment of blood flow in CA is highly desirable. We herein demonstrate a case of laparoscopic surgery of CACS with use of intraoperative transabdominal ultrasound. A 52-year-old woman was presented with epigastric pain and vomiting after eating. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated significant stenosis at the origin of CA. Doppler study of CA was also performed, and she was diagnosed as CACS. Laparoscopic surgery was performed, and the MAL was divided. And then, Doppler study using intraoperative transabdominal ultrasound confirmed the successful decompression of CA. This patient was discharged on postoperative day 11, and her symptoms was improved. Intraoperative assessment of blood flow in CA using transabdominal ultrasound was a simple and useful method for laparoscopic surgery of CACS.
