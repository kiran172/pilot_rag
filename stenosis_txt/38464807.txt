Title: Segmental Arterial Mediolysis in a Patient With Ascending Aorta Dilatation.

Abstract: A 70-year-old woman consulted us for dyspnea. Echocardiography revealed moderate aortic regurgitation secondary to ascending aorta dilatation. Study was completed with aortic angiography computed tomography, showing stenosis and dissection of several visceral arteries. There were no abnormal inflammatory or autoimmune markers, nor fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake. Segmental arterial mediolysis was diagnosed.
