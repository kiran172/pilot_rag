Title: Dual energy CT: a step ahead in brain and spine imaging.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pictorial essay is to illustrate the utility of dual energy CT as an adjunct or alternative to routine single energy CT (SECT) scan of the brain and spine in emergency neuroradiology practice.
CONCLUSION: Dual energy CT can be used as a problem-solving tool in brain and spine imaging. It enables one to make a confident and accurate diagnosis for a variety of clinical conditions thereby impacting patient management.
