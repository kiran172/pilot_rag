Title: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the diagnostic evaluation of popliteal artery aneurysms, a single-center study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA) are the most common peripheral artery aneurysms. Most common cause is arteriosclerosis. Acute thromboembolic limb ischemia and rupture of the PAA depict severe complications. Diagnostic tools for identifying PAAs are (Doppler) ultrasound, CT/MR angiography and DSA.
PURPOSE: The aim of the present retrospective single-center study is to assess the application and safety of CEUS for assessing untreated and treated PAAs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 13 patients were included in this study on whom CEUS was performed between 2007-2016. CEUS examinations were performed and interpreted by an experienced single radiologist (EFSUMB LevelÂ 3).
RESULTS: CEUS allowed for the detection of PAAs in all cases. CEUS allowed for detection of partial thrombosis of PAA in 7/8 of untreated patients, proper exclusion of PAA upon femoro-popliteal bypass in 3 patients, incomplete exclusion of PAA upon femoro-popliteal bypass in 1 patient and ruling out of in-stent stenosis in 1 patient.
CONCLUSION: CEUS is a useful and safe tool for in real-time evaluation of PAAs in the pre-/post-treatment status. In addition to conventional (Doppler) ultrasound and as an alternative tool to more elaborate imaging modalities, CEUS might be integrated in the future diagnostic work-up and follow-up of PAA patients.
