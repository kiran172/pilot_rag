Title: [Tricuspid Valve Ring Annuloplasty with Posterior Annular Plication for Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation].

Abstract: This report presents a modified procedure of tricuspid valve ring annuloplasty (R-TAP) with posterior annular plication for functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Sutures on the native annulus were placed by a standard fashion in R-TAP, and those on the posterior annulus and its bilateral commissures were passed through in a narrow range between the 3 and 4 o'clock positions of the 26-mm ring. The other sutures were done with an usual manner and the ring was fixed to the annulus, resulting in the posterior annular plication( bicuspidization). Follow-up was performed for more than 5 years( mean: 7.9 years, range:5.5~11.5 years) by echocardiography in 13 cases. Postoperative TR reduced significantly to less than moderate, which was maintained during the entire follow-up period, even in the case with atrial fibrillation. There was no sign of tricuspid stenosis. R-TAP with posterior annular plication was feasible, reproducible, and effective, although further investigation is needed.
