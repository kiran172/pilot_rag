Title: Successful surgical repair of aortic root rupture during transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic root rupture is a rare but potentially fatal complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Herein, we report a case of aortic root rupture during TAVI that was successfully managed with partial aortic root repair and aortic valve replacement.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 83-year-old woman with severe bicuspid aortic stenosis underwent transfemoral TAVI using a 26 mm SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve. Soon after valve implantation, transesophageal echocardiography detected pericardial effusion, which was accompanied by immediate hemodynamic instability. Subxiphoid pericardial drainage was performed, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was promptly initiated. Owing to the eruptive hemorrhage, we converted to open-heart surgery. Direct visualization enabled the detection of the aortic root rupture and the performance of partial aortic root repair using bovine pericardium and aortic valve replacement using a 19 mm INSPIRIS RESILIA valve. The patient was transferred to a different hospital 60 days after surgery without complications and is currently doing well as an outpatient.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present case, prompt treatment decisions and smooth cooperation among the institutional heart team led to the successful repair of aortic root rupture during TAVI and good clinical outcomes.
