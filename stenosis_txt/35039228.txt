Title: 3D Transesophageal Echocardiography for Guiding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Without Prior Cardiac Computed Tomography in Patients With Renal Dysfunction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pre-procedural chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI) are associated with worse outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We tested the feasibility of reducing overall AKI by avoiding pre-procedural cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) by using direct 3D-TEE guidance in TAVR patients with known CKD.
METHODS: An institutional TAVR database was examined from January 2016 to June 2020 to identify 396 patients in whom CCTA sizing was performed and 54 patients with creatinine (Cr) of >1.6 mg/dL in whom direct 3D-TEE, without prior CCTA, was used for TAVR guidance. Baseline demographics, procedural, echocardiographic, and clinical endpoints were compared as defined by the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria.
RESULTS: Baseline demographics and risk factors were similar in both groups other than the creatinine level in CCTA vs. TEE groups (1.33 ± 1.1 vs 1.76 ± 0.7 mg/dL, p = 0.005). Procedural contrast volume was significantly lower in the TEE group compared to the CCTA group. No differences were noted in echocardiographic and clinical endpoints for both groups. Despite higher baseline Cr, patents in the TEE group experienced a similar pattern of changes in Cr compared to the CCTA group, with an overall renal improvement noted at the time of discharge for both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with baseline CKD, careful avoidance of large contrast loads associated with CCTA and intra-procedural aortography by using TEE guidance may help reduce AKI following TAVR.
