Title: Value of a lateral inferior pedicle flap in Draf IIb for recurrent frontal sinus diseases: a prospective study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The Draf IIb procedure allows the widest unilateral access to the frontal sinus in a minimally invasive fashion, with efficiency and safety comparable to the Draf III. However, this technique is still associated with a high postoperative stenosis rate. The exposure of drilled bone induces osteitis predisposing to scarring and neo-osteogenesis causing ostium restenosis. We developed a novel lateral inferior pedicle flap (LIPF) to cover the exposed bone and prevent restenosis during Draf IIb. We aimed to describe our technique.
METHODS: Adult patients requiring a Draf IIb for unilateral recurrent frontal sinus disease were prospectively enrolled. A LIPF technique was systematically performed. Demographics and complications were recorded. The primary outcome measure was neo-ostium patency at 12 months. In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), the clinical control rate was evaluated at 12 months.
RESULTS: 59 patients underwent the Draf IIb with LIPF technique from 2013 to 2021. 49 patients (20 women/29 men, median age of 48.0 years) completed at least 12 months of follow-up (median 41.0 months, range 12-100 months). Indications included recalcitrant CRS (n = 32), inverted papilloma (n = 9) and frontal mucocele (n = 8). Overall, the neo-ostium remained patent at 12 months in all patients, and the clinical control rate of 32 patients with recalcitrant CRS at 12 months was 100%. No main complications were recorded.
CONCLUSION: The LIPF technique was associated with a high rate of success for a Draf IIb.
