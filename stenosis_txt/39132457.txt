Title: Contrast-Induced Encephalopathy Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Case Series.

Abstract: Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is an idiopathic reaction following iodine-contrast dye administration in patients undergoing angiographic procedures. While it has been well-documented following coronary and carotid interventions, literature on CIE following transcatheter aortic valve replacement is limited. We report the multidisciplinary management of 3 patients with CIE following transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
