Title: The clinical value of long noncoding RNA GAS5 in acute ischemic stroke: Correlation with disease risk, inflammation, severity, and risk of recurrence.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (lnc-GAS5) is involved in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) by regulating vascular stenosis, inflammation, and neurocyte apoptosis. This study aimed to explore the clinical value of lnc-GAS5 in patients with AIS.
METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 120 patients with AIS at admission and 60 controls after enrollment, and lnc-GAS5 expression in the plasma of all participants was assessed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In patients with AIS, disease severity was evaluated using National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and plasma inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was calculated during a 36-month follow-up period.
RESULTS: Lnc-GAS5 expression levels were higher in patients with AIS than in the controls (p < 0.001), and it had the potential to discriminate the controls from patients with AIS (area under the curve: 0.893, 95% confidence interval: 0.849-0.938). In patients with AIS, elevated lnc-GAS5 levels were positively correlated with NIHSS score (r = 0.397, p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.046), and higher levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α; r = 0.374, p < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6; r = 0.223, p < 0.001), and interleukin-17A (IL-17A; r = 0.222, p = 0.015). The expression levels of lnc-GAS5 were also negatively correlated with the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10; r = -0.350, p < 0.001) and RFS (p = 0.036).
CONCLUSION: Lnc-GAS5 is correlated with higher susceptibility to AIS, inflammation, and severity, and can predict an increased risk of AIS recurrence, indicating that monitoring of lnc-GAS5 might improve the management of AIS.
