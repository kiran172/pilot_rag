Title: Frequency of silent carotid artery stenosis in diabetics and its associated factors: An analysis in tertiary care hospital.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To estimate frequency of silent carotid artery stenosis and its associated factors in diabetic patients attending a tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in tertiary care Civil Hospital, Karachi from March 2019 to September 2019,. A total of 166 patients with Diabetes Mellitus were included in this study. Brief history was taken for the duration of DM, treatment, and smoking habits. Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) wafrs measured by Doppler ultrasound of right and left common, internal, and external carotid arteries.
RESULTS: Frequency of silent carotid artery stenosis (CAS) in diabetic patients was observed in 28.92% (48/166) cases. The mean age ±SD of the patients was 54.8 ±7.96 years. 27 (22.29%) patients were smoker and all were male. Out of 166 diabetic patients, 59 (35.54%) were treated with insulin and 107 (64.46%) were treated with oral hypoglycemic.
CONCLUSION: Substantial number of diabetic patients with increasing age, increased duration of diabetes and smoking habits have significant silent Silent Carotid Artery Stenosis (CAS).
