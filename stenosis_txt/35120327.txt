Title: Association of occlusion time with successful endovascular recanalization in patients with symptomatic chronic intracranial total occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endovascular treatment is one of the choices for symptomatic chronic intracranial total occlusion (CITO); however, its safety and efficacy remain unclear. The present study was performed to evaluate the safety and long-term outcome of endovascular treatment for CITO at a high-volume stroke center.
METHODS: Data about patients with symptomatic CITO who received endovascular treatment were retrospectively collected. Technique success was regarded as ≤ 30% residual stenosis. Periprocedural complications within 30 days were used to evaluate safety. Baseline characteristics and lesion features were compared between patients with successful recanalization and those with recanalization failure. Stroke recurrence and in-stent restenosis (ISR) of the culprit arteries during follow-up were used to evaluate long-term efficacy.
RESULTS: From June 2012 to September 2019, 117 patients (mean ± SD age 55.8 ± 9.6 years) were included. The successful recanalization rate was 82.9% (97/117 patients). The combined rate of periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, and death was 8.5% (10/117). Compared with patients with successful recanalization, patients with recanalization failure had longer occlusion time and longer lesion length (27.0 mm vs 15.4 mm, p = 0.001). In the median 23.0-month clinical follow-up period, recurrent stroke occurred in 12.6% (11/87) of patients with successful recanalization. In the median 5-month imaging follow-up period, ISR was detected in 26.6% (21/79) of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment was relatively safe for patients with symptomatic CITO. Shorter occlusion time and shorter lesion length may be associated with higher recanalization rate. The rates of stroke recurrence and symptomatic ISR were acceptable but need to be confirmed in future studies.
