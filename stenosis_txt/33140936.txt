Title: [Quincke's edema or angioedema. A contemporary view of the problem].

Abstract: The article describes statistical data on patients with angioedema (AE) in the structure of ambulance services and four large multidisciplinary hospitals with otorhinolaryngological departments of the city of Moscow for 2017. The ratio of the number of calls to the NSR in Moscow for AE to the total number of calls was analyzed; the ratio of the number of calls to the ambulatory system for AE to the total number of calls to patients with allergic reactions; the ratio of patients with AE among the total number of treated patients in 3 hospitals in Moscow; the ratio of patients with AE of the upper respiratory tract (URT) among the total number of patients with AE; the ratio of patients with AE URT among the total number of patients with ENT pathology. As a result of the study, it was found that the share of AE in the structure of emergency calls of ambulance teams (n=3 070 491) was 0.7% (n=20 040) and 38.4% of the total number of calls for allergic reactions (n=giant urticaria 52 153). Patients with AE make up 0.34% (n=919) of the total number of treated patients in hospitals (n=269 980). The proportion of patients in whom AE was manifested with a lesion of URT among patients with AE is 1 1.5%. The frequency of occurrence of AE URT among patients hospitalized with pathology of ENT organs (n=14 395) is 0.7% (n=106).
