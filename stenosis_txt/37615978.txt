Title: Otolaryngology and the Pregnant Patient.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Pregnancy may result in physiologic and pathologic changes in the head and neck. Otolaryngologists may need to intervene medically or surgically with pregnant patients. Careful consideration of risks to both the gravid patient and the developing fetus is vital.
OBSERVATIONS: Patients may present with otolaryngologic complaints exacerbated by or simply occurring during their pregnancy. Symptoms of hearing loss, vertigo, rhinitis or rhinosinusitis, epistaxis, obstructive sleep apnea, sialorrhea, voice changes, reflux, subglottic stenosis, and benign and malignant tumors of the head and neck may prompt evaluation. While conservative measures are often best, there are medications that are safe for use during pregnancy. When required, surgery for the gravid patient requires a multidisciplinary approach.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Otolaryngologic manifestations in pregnant patients may be managed safely with conservative treatment, medication, and surgery when necessary. Treatment should include consideration of both the pregnant patient and the developing fetus.
