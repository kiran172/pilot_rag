Title: Neurofibromatosis Type Two: A Case With Both Intracranial and Spinal Lesions.

Abstract: We discuss the case of a 36-year-old male patient who presented with gait impairment. On examination, he had clinical findings of cervical myelopathy. The patient was evaluated with an MRI of the brain and spine, which revealed multiple spinal tumors, some causing significant canal stenosis. The spinal tumors involved the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions. There were both intramedullary and extramedullary tumors with an extraspinal extension. The patient's MRI brain also revealed bilateral vestibular schwannomas. His family history was negative. He subsequently underwent surgery for multiple spinal lesions followed by debulking of the right-sided vestibular schwannoma. The radiological findings of both intramedullary and extramedullary spinal tumors affecting the spinal cord and extensively involving the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions, and the requirement of spinal and cranial surgery concurrently make this a challenging neurosurgical case.
