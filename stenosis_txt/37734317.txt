Title: Generation of an induced pluripotent stem cell line (ITXi012-A) from a patient with genetically determined high-lipoprotein(a) plasma levels.

Abstract: Elevated circulating lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a genetically determined risk factor for coronary artery disease and aortic valve stenosis (Tsimikas, 2017). Importantly, the LPA gene, which encodes the apolipoprotein(a) (protein-component of Lp(a)), is missing in most species, and human liver cell-lines do not secrete Lp(a). There is a need for the development of human in vitro models suitable for investigating biological mechanisms involved in Lp(a) metabolism. We here generated and characterized iPSCs from a patient with extremely high Lp(a) plasma levels genetically determined (Coassin et al., 2022). This unique cellular model offers great opportunities and new perspectives for investigations on biological mechanisms involved in Lp(a) metabolism.
