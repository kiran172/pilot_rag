Title: [Safety and effectiveness of interventional bronchoscopy under general anesthesia in the elderly patients with central airway stenosis: a retrospective study].

Abstract: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients aged 65 years and older with central airway stenosis who underwent therapeutic bronchoscopy under general anesthesia in Beijing Tiantan Hospital from January 2012 to September 2022. A total of 167 patients were included in the study. One or more comorbidities were present in 151 patients. The number of operation procedure was 230 times. Laryngeal mask ventilation under general anesthesia and electrotomy was the most common method of airway management and operation. The incidence of major complications was 5.2%. One patient with granular cell tumor died of major bleeding during stent removal. The primary malignant lesion, number of comorbidities, electrolyte disturbances and rigid bronchoscopy were risk factors for major complications, and the difference was statistically significant. The overall response rate was 99.4%. The airway stenosis grade, dyspnea score and KPS value were improved, and the differences were statistically significant. Interventional bronchoscopy under general anesthesia appeared to be safe and effective in patients aged 65 years and older with central airway stenosis. Age should not be a contraindication to interventional bronchoscopy.
