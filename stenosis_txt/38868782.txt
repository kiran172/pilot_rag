Title: Predictors of Patient Dissatisfaction after Lumbar Spinal Canal Stenosis Surgery: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Recently, patient satisfaction has gained prominence as a crucial measure for ensuring patient-centered care. Furthermore, patient satisfaction after lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LCS) surgery is an important metric for physician's decision of surgical indication and informed consent to patient. This study aimed to elucidate how patient satisfaction changed after LCS surgery to identify factors that predict patient dissatisfaction.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed time-course data of patients aged ≥40 years who underwent LCS surgery at multiple hospitals. The participants completed the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (JOABPEQ) before surgery and then 6 months and 1 year postsurgery. Patient satisfaction was categorized according to the postoperative score of the satisfaction domain of the ZCQ: satisfied, score ≤2.0; moderately satisfied, 2.0< score ≤2.5; and dissatisfied, score >2.5.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 241 patients. Our data indicated a satisfaction rate of around 70% at 6 months and then again 1 year after LCS surgery. Among those who were dissatisfied 6 months after LCS surgery, 47.6% were more satisfied 1 year postsurgery. Furthermore, 86.2% of those who were satisfied 6 months after LCS surgery remained satisfied at 1 year. Multivariable analysis revealed that age (relative risk, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.8) and preoperative score of psychological disorders on the JOABPEQ (relative risk, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.08) were significantly associated with LCS surgery dissatisfaction. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the cutoff value for the preoperative score of psychological disorder of the JOABPEQ was estimated at 40 for LCS surgery dissatisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Age and psychological disorders were identified as significant predictors of dissatisfaction, with a JOABPEQ cutoff value providing potential clinical applicability.
