Title: Ocular Ischemic Syndrome in the Setting of Normal Carotid Duplex Ultrasound.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To describe two cases of ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) that were initially ruled out due to a negative carotid duplex ultrasound (DUS) but eventually confirmed by angiography studies.
METHODS: Case series.
RESULTS: Case 1: A 67-year-old female presented with symptoms suggestive of OIS, but carotid DUS was negative, and the patient was diagnosed with occlusive retinal vasculitis due to retinal non-perfusion and vascular leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA). Immunosuppressive therapy was initiated but her symptoms did not improve. Computerized tomography angiography (CTA) was significant for severe osteal stenosis of the aortic arch vessels. Left common carotid angioplasty and stenting resulted in complete resolution of the symptoms and vascular leakage of the left eye. Case 2: A 41-year-old male with cryoglobulinemia-associated vasculitis complained of symptoms consistent with OIS, which was initially ruled out through a negative carotid DUS. FA revealed delayed arterial filling with poor retinal perfusion. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed ophthalmic artery stenosis which was attributed to the underlying systemic vasculitis.
CONCLUSION: CTA or MRA should be performed to rule out OIS if DUS is negative in the setting of high clinical suspicion. Carotid ostial and ophthalmic artery stenoses are rare but possible causes of OIS.
