Title: Perforation of a Stenotic Congenitally Bicuspid Aortic Valve Cusp by Heavy Calcium in the Other Cusp.

Abstract: On occasion in patients with stenotic congenitally bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs), the quantity of calcium in one of the cusps is considerably greater than in the other cusp. We examined operatively excised stenotic congenitally BAVs in 630 patients having isolated aortic valve replacement (No other cardiac valve was replaced, and none had had infective endocarditis.) Of the 630 valves, 3 contained a perforation in the mildly calcified cusp due to a large calcific "spur" extending across the orifice from a heavily calcified cusp. In conclusion, heavy calcific deposits in 1 of 2 BAVs may extend across the orifice causing a perforation in the noncalcified portion of the opposing cusp.
