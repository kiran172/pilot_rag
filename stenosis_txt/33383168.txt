Title: The Evolution of Transcatheter Therapies for Mitral Valve Disease: From Mitral Valvuloplasty to Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement.

Abstract: The prevalence of mitral valve disease has evolved over the past 5 decades from primarily a disease of rheumatic origin to a disease affecting the aging population that encompasses a range of phenotypes from rheumatic mitral stenosis, degenerative mitral regurgitation, and degenerative mitral valve calcification to secondary mitral regurgitation. A reflection on the history of therapy for mitral valve disease is an expedition that follows the birth and development of structural heart intervention from the first percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty to innovative technologies for transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement. This review will lead you along this journey, pause to acknowledge the feats accomplished, and reflect on the road that lies ahead.
