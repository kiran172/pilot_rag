Title: Immediate and Late Complications After Liver Transplantation.

Abstract: Other than rejection, hepatic artery and portal vein thrombosis are the most common complications in the immediate postoperative period with hepatic arterial thrombosis more common and more devastating. Hepatic artery stenosis is more common 1Â month after transplantation, whereas portal and hepatic vein stenosis is more often seen as a late complication. Ultrasound is the first-line imaging examination to diagnose vascular complications with contrast-enhanced CT useful if ultrasound findings are equivocal. MR cholangiography is often most helpful in diagnosing bile leaks, biliary strictures, and biliary stones.
