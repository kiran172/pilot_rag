Title: Prevalence and clinical implications of calcification in internal carotid artery stenosis: a retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Calcification is common in advanced atheromatous plaque, but its clinical significance remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of plaque calcification in the moderate-to-severe internal carotid artery stenosis and investigate its relationship with ipsilateral ischemia.
METHODS: The retrospective study included 178 patients detected with proximal internal carotid artery (pICA) stenosis of ≥ 50% on multidetector computed tomography at Zhejiang Hospital from January 2019 to March 2023. Association between plaque calcification characteristics (calcification thickness, position, type, circumferential extent, calcium volume and calcium score) and ipsilateral cerebrovascular events was analyzed.
RESULTS: The 178 patients (mean age 71.24 ± 10.02 years, 79.78% males) had 224 stenosed pICAs overall. Plaque calcification was noted in 200/224 (89.29%) arteries. Calcification rates were higher in older age-groups. Calcification volume (r = 0.219, p &lt; 0.001) and calcification score (r = 0.230, p &lt; 0.001) were correlated with age. Ipsilateral ischemic events were significantly more common in the noncalcification group than in the calcification group (χ2 = 4.160, p = 0.041). The most common calcification type was positive rim sign calcification (87/200, 43.50%), followed by bulky calcification (66/200, 33.00%); both were significantly associated with ischemic events (χ2 = 10.448, p = 0.001 and χ2 = 4.552, p = 0.033, respectively). Calcification position, thickness, and circumferential extent, and calcification volume and score, were not associated with ischemic events. In multivariate analysis, positive rim signs (OR = 2.795, 95%CI 1.182-6.608, p = 0.019) was an independent predictor of ischemic events.
CONCLUSIONS: Plaque calcification in proximal internal carotid artery is common, and prevalence increases with age. Calcification characteristics could be predictive of ipsilateral ischemic events. The positive rim sign within plaque is a high-risk factor for a future ischemic event.
