Title: Left-Atrial Appendage Thrombosis in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data about the impact of left-atrial appendage thrombosis (LAAT) on early safety and mortality in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) are scarce. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and predictors of LAAT and the outcome associated with this condition in patients treated by TF-TAVI.
METHODS: Retrospective data analysis was derived from a prospective single-centre registry comparing patients with and without LAAT regarding early safety at 30 days, according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2) and 2-year mortality.
RESULTS: LAAT was found in 7.6% of the whole cohort (n = 2527) and in 16.6% in those patients with known pre-existing atrial fibrillation (AF cohort, n = 1099). Compared with controls, patients with LAAT were sicker, indicated by a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score and burden of comorbidities. Neither VARC-2-defined early safety at 30 days nor the rate of stroke was different between LAAT and controls in both the whole (early safety: 29.2% vs 24.2%, P = 0.123; stroke: 5.9% vs 4.7%, P = 0.495) and AF cohort (early safety: 29.1% vs 22.9%, P = 0.072; stroke: 5.6% vs 3.3%, P = 0.142). Evaluating the whole cohort in a univariate analysis, the 2-year mortality was significantly higher in LAAT compared with controls (hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.86; P = 0.014). However, multivariate analysis of the whole cohort and the AF cohort revealed no association between LAAT and 2-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: LAAT was frequent in patients undergoing TF-TAVI- in particular, in patients with histories of AF-but it was not associated with an increase in periprocedural complications and did not predict 2-year mortality.
