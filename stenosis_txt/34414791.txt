Title: Bilateral ganglion cysts at L4/5 causing central canal stenosis and producing sciatica and neurogenic claudication: a case report.

Abstract: Symptomatic bilateral juxtafacet ganglion cysts are relatively uncommon in the degenerated spine. The literature describes 16 cases of bilateral ganglion or synovial cysts, none reported sciatica and neurogenic claudication simultaneously. We present a case of a 60-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of bilateral sciatica and neurogenic claudication. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine revealed bilateral lesions related to the facet joints at the L4/5 level, causing bilateral lateral recess stenosis and narrowing of the central canal due to encroachment of these bilateral lesions at the same level. She underwent an elective central canal decompression of the L4/5 level and excision of the facet cysts bilaterally with lateral recess decompression, which resulted in good relief of both the radicular and claudication symptoms.
