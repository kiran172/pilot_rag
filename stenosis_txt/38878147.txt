Title: Coronary computed tomographic angiography-derived anatomic and hemodynamic plaque characteristics in prediction of cardiovascular events.

Abstract: This study investigated the association of anatomic and hemodynamic plaque characteristics based on deep learning coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with high-risk plaques that caused subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent CCTA between 1 month and 3 years prior to the occurrence of a MACE. Deep learning and computational fluid dynamics algorithms based on CCTA were applied to extract adverse plaque characteristics (low-attenuation plaque, positive remodeling, napkin-ring sign, and spotty calcification), and hemodynamic parameters (fractional flow reserve derived by coronary computed tomographic angiography [FFR<sub>CT</sub>], change in FFR<sub>CT</sub> across the lesion [△FFR<sub>CT</sub>], wall shear stress [WSS], and axial plaque stress [APS]). Correlation analysis, logistic regression, and Cox proportional risk analysis were conducted to understand the relationship between these measures and the occurrence of MACE and assess the value of hemodynamic parameters in predicting the incidence of MACE events and their prognosis. Our study included 86 patients with a total of 134 vessels exhibiting plaque formation and 83 culprit vessels with a subsequent coronary event. Culprit vessels had percent diameter stenosis [%DS] (0.54 ± 0.16 vs. 0.62 ± 0.13, P = 0.003), larger non-calcified plaque volume (45.8 vs. 101.7, P &lt; 0.001), larger low-attenuation plaque volume (3.6 vs. 14.5, P &lt; 0.001), more lesions with ≥ 3 adverse plaque characteristics (APC) (4 vs.26, P = 0.002), and worse hemodynamic features of adverse plaque. FFR<sub>CT</sub> demonstrated better visualization of maximum achievable flow in the presence of coronary stenosis and better correlation with the stenosis severity, while maximum of wall shear stress (WSSmax) was highly correlated with low-attenuation plaques and APC. The inclusion of hemodynamic parameters improved the efficacy of the predictive model, and a high WSS suggested a higher probability of MACE. Hemodynamic parameters based on CCTA are significantly correlated with plaque morphology. Importantly, integrating CCTA-derived parameters can refine the predictive performance of MACE occurrence.
