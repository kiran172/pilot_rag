Title: Determinants of Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch after Aortic Valve Replacement-Ten-Year Cohort Data in Single Center of Taiwan.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) after surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis has a significant effect on survival. Few studies have identified the risk factors for PPM and related outcomes. This study investigated these risk factors and clarified the outcomes.
METHODS: This study enrolled consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve replacement surgery between January 2010 and June 2020 in our hospital. Data on clinical profiles, prosthesis types, echocardiographic parameters before and after surgery, and clinical outcomes including the composite of all-cause mortality and redo valve replacement were collected. We defined moderate and severe PPM as an effective orifice area index value of ≤ 0.85 and ≤ 0.65 cm2/m2, respectively, measured postoperatively through echocardiography. Potential risk factors for PPM and clinical outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were enrolled. Body surface area (BSA; 1.68 ± 0.02 vs. 1.62 ± 0.01 m2, p = 0.036), renal insufficiency (32.50% vs. 11.70%, p = 0.026), and aortic annulus diameter (1.99 ± 0.05 vs. 2.17 ± 0.03 cm, p = 0.013) were statistically significant risk factors for severe PPM. The primary outcome was observed in 30.00% and 15.86% of the patients with and without severe PPM, respectively (log-rank p = 0.023). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that severe PPM was a risk factor for the primary outcome (hazard ratio: 2.688, 95% confidence interval: 1.094-6.622, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that large BSA, renal insufficiency, and small annulus diameter were risk factors for severe PPM after aortic valve replacement surgery. Severe PPM was associated with worse clinical outcomes.
