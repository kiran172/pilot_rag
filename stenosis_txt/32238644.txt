Title: Comparative Analysis of the Paclitaxel-Eluting Peripheral Igaki-Tamai Stent and the Drug-Free Igaki-Tamai Stent Using Optical Coherence Tomography and Histological Analysis in a Porcine Iliac Artery Model.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The combination of a bioresorbable scaffold and antiproliferative drugs is a promising treatment for peripheral artery disease. The novel paclitaxel-eluting peripheral Igaki-Tamai stent (PTX-ITS) has the same backbone design as the drug-free peripheral Igaki-Tamai stent and a paclitaxel coating. Arterial responses to the PTX-ITS and ITS using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histological analysis in a porcine iliac artery model were compared.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 6 PTX-ITSs and 6 ITSs implanted in porcine iliac arteries were evaluated. Quantitative measurements of the scaffold, lumen, neointimal areas, and percent area stenosis were performed using OCT at 1 and 3 months. Histological evaluations (PTX-ITS [n=5], ITS [n=4]) were performed following euthanasia at 3 months. Injury, inflammation, endothelialization, and fibrin scores were measured. Baseline angiographic characteristics were similar in both groups. The ITS group showed significantly smaller scaffold areas than the PTX-ITS group at 1 month (18.50±3.62 mm2vs. 23.54±3.64 mm2; P=0.037) and 3 months (15.82±2.57 mm2vs. 21.67±3.57 mm2; P=0.009). Percent area stenosis was significantly lower in the PTX-ITS group at 3 months (28.70±7.24% vs. 40.36±7.07%; P=0.018). Histological evaluations revealed similar low-grade inflammatory reactions for both scaffolds.
CONCLUSIONS: PTX-ITSs showed significantly better suppression of late scaffold shrinkage and lower in-scaffold stenosis for up to 3 months. Additionally, PTX-ITSs exhibited high biocompatibility, which is comparable to ITSs.
