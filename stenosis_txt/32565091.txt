Title: Comparison of Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients ≥85 Years Versus Those <85 Years.

Abstract: The differential outcomes across the age spectrum of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) recipients are still debated. Aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of oldest-old patients undergoing TAVI in the large "Registro Italiano GISE sull'impianto di Valvola Aortica Percutanea (RISPEVA)" registry. A total of 3,507 patients were stratified according to age: 1,381 were ≥85 years, 2,126 were <85 years. Primary endpoints were death at 30-days and complete follow-up (FU) (medium 368 days). Cerebrovascular events, myocardial infarction, bleedings, vascular complications at 30-days and complete FU were considered. In the unadjusted analysis, 30-days mortality in the oldest-old group was higher than in younger patients (4.2% vs 2.4%; p = 0.007); this difference kept true also at complete FU (19.6% vs 15.9%; p = 0.014). After propensity score (PS) matching, the oldest-old population showed a higher mortality solely at 30-days (4.7% vs 2.4%; p = 0.016), while the survival at complete FU was similar to that of younger patients (20.1% vs 18.0%; p = 0.286). The incidence of non-fatal outcomes resulted comparable between the 2 groups, also after propensity score matching. At the multivariate logistic regression analysis procedural major or disabling bleedings, cerebrovascular events, cardiogenic shock resulted predictors of 30-days death in the oldest-old cohort. In conclusion, patients ≥85 years can safely undergo TAVI being not more exposed to procedural complications than those <85 years; nevertheless they showed worse 30-days mortality, probably driven by reduced tolerance to complications. Passed the critical periprocedural phase, patients ≥85 years had a similar survival to those <85 years with comparable risk profile.
