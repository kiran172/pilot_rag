Title: Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease dementia risk.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the absence of a cerebrovascular accident, whether asymptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease (aECAD) affects Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia risk is not clear. Understanding whether aECAD is associated with an increased risk for AD is important as it is present in roughly 10% of the population over 60 and could represent a modifiable risk factor for AD and non-AD dementia.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed Mariner insurance claims. Enrolment criteria included patients aged 55 years or older with at least 5 years of data and no initial dementia diagnosis. Subjects with and without aECAD were evaluated for subsequent AD and non-AD dementia diagnoses. Propensity score matching was performed using confounding factors identified by logistic regression. χ2 tests and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to evaluate the impact of aECAD diagnosis on AD and non-AD dementia risk over time.
RESULTS: 767 354 patients met enrolment criteria. After propensity score matching, 62 963 subjects with aECAD and 62 963 subjects without ECAD were followed through data records. The aECAD cohort exhibited an increased relative risk of 1.22 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.29, p<0.001) for AD and 1.48 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.59, p<0.001) for non-AD dementias compared with the propensity score-matched cohort without aECAD. The increased AD risk associated with aECAD was evident in patients younger than 75 years old and was less apparent in patients over 75 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: aECAD is associated with an increased risk of developing AD and non-AD dementias. These findings underscore the need for further prospective evaluation of interactions between aECAD and dementia, with potential implications for change of clinical care in both of these large patient populations.
