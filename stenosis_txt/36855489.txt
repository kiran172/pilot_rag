Title: Fatal Asphyxia Potentially Caused by COVID-19-Induced Exacerbation of Pre-existing Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: We report a case of cardiac arrest due to asphyxia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient with no history of tracheal intubation but with a history of subglottic stenosis. A 54-year-old man suffered a cardiac arrest at home. The patient had tracheal stenosis; therefore, it was difficult to intubate. The patient had COVID-19, which was presumed to have aggravated the existing tracheal stenosis and caused asphyxiation. The patient died seven days later. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a patient with subglottic stenosis potentially aggravated by COVID-19, resulting in asphyxia-related cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient could not be saved, but emergency physicians should be aware that airway obstruction can be caused by viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections. Physicians should consider the difficulty in performing oral intubation and cricothyrotomy and be aware of alternative methods to secure the airway.
