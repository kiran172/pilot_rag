Title: Preliminary clinical analysis and pathway study of S100A8 as a biomarker for the diagnosis of acute deep vein thrombosis.

Abstract: Herein, we aimed to identify blood biomarkers that compensate for the poor specificity of D-dimer in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). S100A8 was identified by conducting protein microarray analysis of blood samples from patients with and without DVT. We used ELISA to detect S100A8, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 expression levels in human blood and evaluated their correlations. Additionally, we employed human recombinant protein S100A8 to induce human umbilical vein endothelial cells and examined the role of the TLR4/MAPK/VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 signaling axes in the pathogenic mechanism of S100A8. Simultaneously, we constructed a rat model of thrombosis induced by inferior vena cava stenosis and detected levels of S100A8, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 in the blood of DVT rats using ELISA. The associations of thrombus tissue, neutrophils, and CD68-positive cells with S100A8 and p38MAPK, TLR4, and VCAM-1 expression levels in vein walls were explored. The results revealed that blood S100A8 was significantly upregulated during the acute phase of DVT and activated p38MAPK expression by combining with TLR4 to enhance the expression and secretion of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, thereby affecting the occurrence and development of DVT. Therefore, S100A8 could be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and screening of DVT.
