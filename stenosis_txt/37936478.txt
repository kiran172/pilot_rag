Title: Failure of Limb Salvage in a Patient with Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia due to Persistent Sciatic Artery Stenosis: Direct Therapeutic Intervention is Important.

Abstract: A 79-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a complaint of feeling a cold sensation in her right foot. After performing a contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography, severe stenosis in the right persistent sciatic artery (PSA) was identified. However, stenting was considered inadvisable due to compression issues when sitting. Following anticoagulant therapy, the patient's symptoms improved. However, after seventeen months, she experienced recurrent severe pain in her right foot. Catheter angiography revealed occlusions in both the anterior and posterior tibial arteries. To address the issue, we conducted endovascular therapy, followed by a femoro-popliteal artery bypass and ligation of the PSA. Unfortunately, despite these efforts, a below-knee amputation was eventually performed. Limited experience with the PSA and delayed intervention may have led to the need for amputation. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of prompt therapeutic intervention following the onset of initial symptoms.
