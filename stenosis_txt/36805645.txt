Title: Bilateral Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction in Williams-Beuren Syndrome.

Abstract: A 23-year-old patient with Williams-Beuren syndrome presented with ocular irritation and bilateral persistent tearing. Despite probing as an infant which showed bilateral nasolacrimal duct obstruction, dacryocystorhinostomy had been avoided due to the patient's syndromic supravalvular stenosis and related anesthesia risk. As the known diminished production of elastin in Williams-Beuren syndrome causes an array of associated vascular diseases, this case report hypothesizes that the lacrimal duct becomes obstructed through a similar mechanism. This case presents the unique findings of bilateral congenital nasolacrimal duct stenosis in a Williams-Beuren syndrome patient.
