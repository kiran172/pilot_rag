Title: The Effect of Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Plus Partial Splenic Embolization for the Treatment of Patients with Recurrent Variceal Bleeding.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and partial splenic embolization (PSE) were two interventional therapies effective for the management of variceal bleeding with cirrhosis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of TIPS plus PSE for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis and recurrent variceal bleeding.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a single-center, nonrandomized and retrospective study that included 32 patients undergoing TIPS alone (the TIPS group) and 16 patients undergoing TIPS plus PSE (the TIPS+PSE group).
RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative rates of variceal rebleeding (20.0% vs. 37.9%, p = 0.027) and shunt stenosis (35.1% vs. 55.9%, p = 0.036) in the TIPS+PSE group were significantly lower than in the TIPS group, whereas the 5-year cumulative rates of shunt blockage (12.5% vs. 25.8%, p = 0.388), and all-cause mortality (37.5% vs. 69.3%, p = 0.414) were not statistically different between the two groups. The 2-year cumulative rate of remaining free of hepatic encephalopathy was also similar between the two groups (75.0% vs. 81.3%, p = 0.704). Cox-regression analyses showed that group and reduction of portal venous pressure before and after TIPS creation were associated with both variceal rebleeding and shunt stenosis, whereas only reduction of portal venous pressure (hazard ratio 0.648, 95% confidence interval: 0.444-0.946, p = 0.025) was associated with shunt blockage. No severe adverse event was observed in the two groups.
CONCLUSION: TIPS+PSE is superior to TIPS alone in control of variceal rebleeding and shunt stenosis. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm our findings.
