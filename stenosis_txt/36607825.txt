Title: Evaluation of pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation on CT.

Abstract: Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) is the fat deposit surrounding coronary arteries. Although PCAT is part of the larger epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) depot, it has different pathophysiological features and roles in the atherosclerosis process. While EAT evaluation has been studied for years, PCAT evaluation is a relatively new concept. PCAT, especially the mean attenuation derived from CT images may be used to evaluate the inflammatory status of coronary arteries non-invasively. The most commonly used measure, PCAT<sub>MA</sub>, is the mean attenuation of adipose tissue of 3 mm thickness around the proximal right coronary artery with a length of 40 mm. PCAT<sub>MA</sub> can be analyzed on a per-lesion, per-vessel or per-patient basis. Apart from PCAT<sub>MA</sub>, other measures for PCAT have been studied, such as thickness, and volume. Studies have shown associations between PCAT<sub>MA</sub> and anatomical and functional severity of coronary artery disease. PCAT<sub>MA</sub> is associated with plaque components and high-risk plaque features, and can discriminate patients with flow obstructing stenosis and myocardial infarction. Whether PCAT<sub>MA</sub> has value on an individual patient basis remains to be determined. Furthermore, CT imaging settings, such as kV levels and clinical factors such as age and sex affect PCAT<sub>MA</sub> measurements, which complicate implementation in clinical practice. For PCAT<sub>MA</sub> to be widely implemented, a standardized methodology is needed. This review gives an overview of reported PCAT methodologies used in current literature and the potential use cases in clinical practice.
