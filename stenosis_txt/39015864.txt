Title: Logical Fallacies in Missed Diagnosis of Stridorous Patients: A Case Report.

Abstract: Tracheal stenosis and paradoxical vocal fold motion are both common laryngological diagnoses that can present with similar symptoms of dyspnea. Co-morbid psychiatric issues can complicate diagnostic accuracy and lead to logical fallacies in the attribution of symptom etiology. We present a case of a 38-year-old female who presented repeatedly to the emergency department with respiratory distress, inspiratory stridor, wheezing, and anxiety. On examination, she had stridor that appeared to correlate with episodes of elevated anxiety and bedside laryngoscopy which showed intermittent paradoxical vocal fold motion. A computed tomography scan showed 40% narrowing of the distal tracheal lumen, but symptoms were felt to be inconsistent and out of proportion to stenosis. She was seen several more times in the ED and eventually followed up in the laryngology clinic, where she had a tracheoscopy showing Cotton Meyer grade III stenosis. This unique case highlights the logical fallacies that may lead to misdiagnosis when evaluating stridorous patients with comorbid personality and anxiety disorders.
