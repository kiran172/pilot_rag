Title: [A case of cerebral infarction after deep burn tangential excision and skin grafting].

Abstract: A female patient aged 42 years with deep burn on right lower limb was admitted to Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University on January 25, 2019. The patient previously had cerebral infarction, hypertension, and hysteria, with long-term use of aspirin and risperidone. After admission, the patient underwent tangential excision twice. On the third day after the second tangential excision and skin grafting, the muscle strength of the right limb gradually decreased, and the patient was treated with emergency craniocerebral magnetic resonance imaging, which suggested acute cerebral infarction. Improvement of cerebral circulation and vasodilatation were given immediately. The limb muscle strength of the patient gradually recovered on the fifth day after the operation, and no sequela was left when the patient was discharged. After the case was discussed, we think that postoperative decreased blood volume and blood concentration resulting from tangential excision bleeding of deep burn and wound exudate as well as inadequate fluid infusion are the main causes of hemodynamic change, the patient had the basis of multiple cerebral artery stenosis, and superposition of multiple factors led to the occurrence of postoperative acute cerebral infarction. Appropriate increase in the fluid infusion volume during and after surgery and transfusion if necessary to increase blood and oxygen supply to the brain can reduce the occurrence of cerebral infarction.
