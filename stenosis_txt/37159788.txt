Title: An Adult Patient With Acute Ischemic Stroke and Carotid Stenosis Presenting to a Chiropractor: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 59-year-old male, with a recent history of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, presented to a chiropractor with a one-week history of numbness in the right upper and lower extremity that was triggered by neck movement, and lightheadedness/dizziness. On examination, the chiropractor noted limited, painful cervical spine range of motion, right upper extremity weakness, patellar hyperreflexia, positive Hoffman's and Tr√∂mner's signs bilaterally, nystagmus, a sluggish right pupillary light reflex, and carotid bruit. Cervical radiographs were suggestive of Klippel-Feil syndrome. The chiropractor suspected a vascular cause such as a transient ischemic attack and referred the patient to the emergency department, which the patient visited the following day. The patient was admitted, and MRI revealed multiple tiny acute to subacute cortical infarcts of the left frontal and parietal lobes while sonography demonstrated left internal carotid artery stenosis. The patient was treated with anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications and carotid endarterectomy with a positive outcome. Given the overlap between symptoms of stroke and those of the cervical spine, chiropractors should be prepared to recognize potential stroke patients and refer them for emergent medical management.
