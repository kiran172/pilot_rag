Title: Two cases with postintubation tracheal stenosis after COVID-19 pneumonia.

Abstract: Only a small percent of all intubated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients survive because of the development of severe respiratory and multiorgan failure. The development of tracheal stenosis after orotracheal intubation or tracheostomy is a dangerous complication with gross consequences for the patient and medical staff. Endoscopic interventional procedures could be used in simple tracheal stenosis and surgical resection and anastomosis are reserved for complex stenosis or after unsuccessful endoscopic treatment. We present two cases with tracheal stenosis as a complication of prolonged intubation in COVID-19 survivors which was diagnosed up to 6 months after discharge. Clinical management and surgical techniques are also discussed.
