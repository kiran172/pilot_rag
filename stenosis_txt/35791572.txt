Title: Modified Endoscopic Denker's Approach for Management of Anterior Maxillary Sinus Tumors: Multicenter Series of 58 Cases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Tumors involving the anterior portion of the maxillary sinus remain technically challenging to access via an endoscopic approach. The modified endoscopic Denker's (MED) procedure was recently introduced to address such lesions. We present a multicenter series of 58 patients with tumors involving the anterior maxillary sinus successfully resected using a MED procedure and present the clinical outcomes and complications.
METHODS: A multi-institution retrospective chart review was performed on patients who underwent the MED approach for the management of tumors involving the anterior maxillary sinus from 2009 to 2020. Demographic data, pathology, surgical outcomes, and complications were reviewed.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were identified, including 34 (58.6%) male and 24 (41.4%) female patients. The most common pathologies included: inverted papilloma (n = 27; 46.6%), adenoid cystic carcinoma (n = 9; 15.5%), and squamous cell carcinoma (n = 8; 13.8%). Thirty-eight patients (65.5%) underwent MED alone, while 20 (34.5%) had combined expanded endonasal approaches for lesions extending beyond the maxillary sinus. All maxillary sinus lesions were successfully accessed with the MED procedure without the need for an additional approach. After a mean follow-up of 30 months (range, 1-127), 8 of 58 (13.8%) patients developed complications related to the MED, including epiphora requiring an additional procedure (n = 4; 6.9%), prolonged facial/palatal numbness (n = 3; 5.2%), severe epistaxis (n = 1; 1.7%), and vestibular stenosis (n = 1; 1.7%), the latter of which occurred following postoperative radiation.
CONCLUSION: The MED procedure is a safe and highly effective approach for benign and malignant tumors involving the anterior maxillary sinus. However, patients should be counseled preoperatively on potential complications including the risk of facial numbness and epiphora.
