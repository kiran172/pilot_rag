Title: Bacterial meningitis caused by nontraumatic cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea with aqueductal stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nontraumatic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea associated with aqueductal stenosis is rare. The resulting CSF leakage may cause bacterial meningitis, and appropriately timed surgical treatment should be considered.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-old woman with obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to aqueductal stenosis presented with intermittent nasal discharge. CSF rhinorrhea was suspected, but she refused surgery. During the course of conservative treatment, she developed meningitis. Exacerbation of hydrocephalus and CSF rhinorrhea was suspected, and the patient underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy after recovery from meningitis. Postoperatively, ventricular size decreased and CSF leakage completely resolved. There was no recurrence of hydrocephalus or rhinorrhea.
CONCLUSION: Patients with intermittent CSF rhinorrhea due to exacerbation of hydrocephalus are at high risk for bacterial meningitis. Appropriately timed surgical treatment results in a favorable outcome.
