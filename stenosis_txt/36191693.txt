Title: Causes and Determinants of Heart Failure Readmissions Post Transcutaneous Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Transcutaneous aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has transformed the management of aortic stenosis (AS) and is increasingly being used for patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who are ineligible or at high risk for conventional cardiac surgery. PUBMED, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS databases were searched to identify studies reporting heart failure hospitalization after TAVI. Major factors evaluated for HF hospitalization were age, comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic pulmonary disease including COPD, chronic kidney disease, baseline LVEF before the procedure, NYHA symptom class, and society of thoracic surgeons (STS) score. Hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval were computed using random-effects models. A total of eight studies were included comprising 77,745 patients who underwent TAVI for severe aortic stenosis. The presence of diabetes mellitus (HR: 1.39, 95% CI [1.17, 1.66], chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 1.39, 95% CI [1.31, 1.48], atrial fibrillation (HR: 1.69, 95% CI [1.42, 2.01], chronic pulmonary disease (HR: 1.33, 95% CI [1.12, 1.58], and a high STS score (HR: 1.07, 95% CI [1.03, 1.11] were positive predictors of 1-year HF hospitalization after TAVI. Patients with diabetes mellitus, AF, CKD, chronic pulmonary disease, and a high STS score are at an increased risk of heart failure hospitalization at 1-year of TAVI, whereas increasing age, hypertension, LVEF <50%, and NYHA class III/IV symptoms did not predict HF hospitalization. Careful follow-up after TAVI in high-risk patients, with closer surveillance for HF particularly, is key to preventing HF hospitalizations and death.
