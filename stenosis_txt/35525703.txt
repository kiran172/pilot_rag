Title: Dyspnea Declare Yourself! Decoding Doppler.

Abstract: AN APPRECIATION of the utility of echocardiographic Doppler spectral profile analysis in diagnosing cardiac pathology and guiding surgical intervention more than justifies an investment in obtaining proficiency in these skills. Given the relatively low incidence of significant complications associated with transesophageal echocardiographic examination, the facile use of both spectral and color Doppler principles to diagnose unusual pathology is essential. Doppler modalities are used to characterize blood flow, pressure gradients, chamber dimensions, and other anatomic and physiological parameters. The authors present a case in which several Doppler principles were used to evaluate and diagnose the etiology of dyspnea and a high aortic valve gradient.
