Title: Clinical Presentation and Therapy of Tetralogy of Fallot and Double-Outlet Right Ventricle.

Abstract: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic heart defect. TOF consists of the combination of four anomalies (Fig. 35.1): (1) a large malalignment ventricular septal defect, (2) an obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract (usually infundibular and valvular pulmonary stenosis with a small pulmonary valve annulus and supravalvular stenosis, (3) an aorta that "overrides" the ventricular septal defect, and (4) right ventricular hypertrophy. TOF represents 4-8% of congenital heart defects. Specific variations of TOF include all forms of pulmonary atresia with VSD and absent pulmonary valve syndrome. In addition, the left and right main pulmonary arteries may be stenotic or hypoplastic. In these cases, there may be major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) which are vessels arising from the aorta or the subclavian arteries that supply segments of the pulmonary arterial tree. Additional variations include an ASD (Pentalogy of Fallot), a right aortic arch, and coronary abnormalities.
