Title: Tracheal agenesis with esophageal atresia: an autopsy case report of a variant incompatible with life.

Abstract: Background: Tracheal agenesis/atresia (TA) presents with respiratory distress at birth and subsequent difficulty in endotracheal intubation. The antenatal course is complicated by polyhydramnios and premature labor. Case report: We present a newborn baby boy with respiratory distress and unsuccessful intubation. Postmortem neck dissection revealed tracheal atresia with esophageal atresia and high tracheoesophageal fistula. Conclusion: In this variant of tracheal atresia, the coexistent esophageal atresia precluded the establishment of a functional air passage. This variant that does not fall into the any of the described categories in accepted classification systems. The lack of any distal communication makes this case inoperable and fatal.
