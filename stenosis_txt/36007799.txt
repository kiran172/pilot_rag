Title: Venous stent patency is independent of total stented length in nonthrombotic iliac vein and post-thrombotic venous stenoses.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Venous stenting has become the preferred treatment of symptomatic outflow obstruction due to nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVLs) and post-thrombotic venous stenoses (PTs). A paucity of data exists regarding the effect of stent length on patency rates after intervention. We evaluated the association between stent length and patency in patients treated for iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction.
METHODS: The institutional review board approved the present study. A total of 161 patients had undergone venous stenting for NIVLs and thrombotic disease from January 2016 to April 2021. For thrombotic disease, patients with PTs and those with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with underlying outflow obstruction were included. The patient characteristics evaluated included gender, age, body mass index, diagnosed thrombophilia, a history of venous thromboembolism, and CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) score. All the patients had undergone multiplanar venography and intravascular ultrasound during the index procedure. The intravascular ultrasound findings were used to determine the diameter and length of the implanted stents. The patients were placed into two groups, those with stented lengths ≤100 mm and those with stented lengths >100 mm. The primary end point was stent patency between the two groups using duplex ultrasound at 6 months.
RESULTS: A total of 108 patients (58.3% female) had had 6-month duplex ultrasound scans available for review. Their mean age was 55.6 ± 17.2 years. The mean body mass index was 31.7 ± 6.9 kg/m2. Overall, the 6-month patency was 89.9%. Of the 108 patients, 56 (51.9%) had had a total stented length of ≤100 mm with a 6-month patency of 92.9%. The remaining 52 patients (48.1%) had had a total stented length &gt;100 mm with a 6-month patency of 86.5%. The rate of patency did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = .222). Stent patency at 6 months for patients with NIVLs was 98% (40 of 41). Stent patency for patients with PTs was 84% (32 of 38). Patency for patients with acute DVT who had undergone stenting after thrombectomy was 86% (25 of 29). Overall, 10 patients with thrombotic disease, including PT and acute DVT, had developed stent thrombosis. The total stented length was not predictive of the loss of patency.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the length of stent coverage does not confer an increased likelihood of stent thrombosis for patients with iliofemoral venous obstruction. Interventionalists should treat the affected venous segments identified on intravascular ultrasound and effectively stent from normal to normal venous areas, regardless of the stent length required. These results suggest that the total stented length is not a risk factor for stent thrombosis for both NIVL and thrombotic iliofemoral venous lesions.
