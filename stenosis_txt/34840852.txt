Title: Treatment of Aortic and Iliac Artery Occlusion by Catheter Thrombolysis Combined with Catheter Thrombectomy and Aortic Bifurcation Endovascular Stent Reconstruction.

Abstract: Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) is an occlusive disease of the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries usually caused by stenosis or occlusion at the end of the abdominal aorta-common iliac artery. Herein, we reported a case of Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus- (TASC-) D AIOD with pale, cool, and intangible dorsalis pedis artery treated with catheter thrombolysis combined with catheter thrombectomy and aortic bifurcation endovascular stent reconstruction, which proved to be safe, effective, and minimally invasive approach. In the present paper, we discussed the physical and imaging manifestations, as well as treatments.
