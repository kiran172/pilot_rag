Title: Endoscopic Management of Laryngotracheal Disease.

Abstract: Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) encompasses a spectrum of conditions characterized by the luminal narrowing of the supraglottis, glottis, subglottis, and/or trachea. However, endoscopic treatment methods are associated with significantly higher rates of restenosis compared to open techniques. The number of endoscopic modalities continues to expand without a clear consensus on the most appropriate treatment choice. The purpose of this article is to review these options along with their functional outcomes. The article herein reviews the common causes, descriptors, and endoscopic options to address LTS along with their functional outcomes.
