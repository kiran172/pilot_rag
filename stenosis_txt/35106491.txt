Title: Multiple Cardiac Calcified Amorphous Tumors.

Abstract: A 61-year-old woman who underwent hemodialysis presented with heart failure. Echocardiography revealed multiple mobile masses in the left atrium. The masses were excised, and histopathologic examination revealed calcified amorphous tumors. Here, we present several echocardiography images, including 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, demonstrating the revolving masses in the left atrium. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
