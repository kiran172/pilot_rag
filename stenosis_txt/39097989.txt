Title: Angiographic evaluation of coronary artery disease in diabetic patients with and without end-stage kidney disease.

Abstract: The objective of the present investigation was to compare the coronary angiography results in diabetic patients with and without end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We included prolonged diabetic patients with ESKD (93 patients) and without ESKD (control group, 126 patients). Angiography of the coronary arteries was performed on all patients. Our results revealed that the ESKD patients tended to have a higher degree of coronary artery stenosis in all parts of LAD (p = 0.001, 0.024, and 0.005), proximal and distal RCA (p = 0.013, and 0.008), and proximal and distal LCX artery (p = 0.001, 0.008) than non-ESKD patients. Furthermore, we found that the ESKD group had higher significant coronary artery stenosis in the LAD artery (60.5% vs. 39.5%, p < 0.001), RCA (60.3% vs. 39.7%, p < 0.001), LCX artery (79.5% vs. 20.5%, p < 0.001), and LMCA (84.6% vs 15.4%, p = 0.002) compared to control group. There was a greater prevalence of multiple vessels coronary artery disease (≥ two) among ESKD patients (29%), compared with the non-ESKD group (16.8%, p < 0.001). Significant coronary artery stenosis was meaningfully higher in asymptomatic diabetic ESKD patients on hemodialysis than non-ESKD diabetic patients. Coronary angiography may be beneficial in diabetic patients with ESKD regardless of whether they have ischemic symptoms with low complication rate through radial access.
