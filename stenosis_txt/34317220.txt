Title: Quadruple Bioprosthetic Valve Replacement in a Patient With Severe Carcinoid Heart Disease.

Abstract: Carcinoid heart disease typically affects the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, causing severe regurgitation and/or stenosis. Valve surgery has been shown to reduce right heart failure and improve long-term prognosis in these patients. We report a severe case of a patient with all 4 heart valves involved who underwent successful quadruple bioprosthetic valve replacement. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
