Title: A rare case of giant left circumflex coronary artery fistula to coronary sinus in patient with persistent left superior vena cava and bicuspid aortic valve.

Abstract: A 61-year-old male presented with symptoms of decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed severely impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function (LVEF of 20-25%), bicuspid aortic valve with moderate aortic insufficiency and no significant stenosis, dilated coronary sinus and a tortuous vascular structure in the left-sided atrioventricular groove. Cardiac computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of persistent left superior vena cava and a giant coronary artery fistula to the coronary sinus. Cardiac magnetic resonance illustrated non-specific late gadolinium enhancement in the mid-wall of the septum. The patient was treated medically and with cardiac re-synchronization therapy.
