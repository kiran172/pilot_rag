Title: Comparable Patency of Open and Hybrid Treatment of Venous Anastomotic Lesions in Thrombosed Haemodialysis Grafts.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous graft (AVG) failures are typically associated with venous anastomotic (VA) stenosis. Current evidence regarding AVG thrombosis management compares surgical with purely endovascular techniques; few studies have investigated the "hybrid" intervention that combines surgical balloon thrombectomy and endovascular angioplasty and/or stenting to address VA obstruction. This study aimed to describe outcomes after hybrid intervention compared with open revision (patch venoplasty or jump bypass) of the VA in thrombosed AVGs.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients with a thrombosed AVG who underwent thrombectomy between January 2014 and July 2018 were divided into open and hybrid groups based on VA intervention; patients who underwent purely endovascular thrombectomy were excluded. Patient demographics, previous access history, central vein patency, AVG anatomy, type of intervention, and follow up data were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyse time from thrombectomy to first re-intervention (primary patency) and time to abandonment (secondary patency). Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate predictors of failure.
RESULTS: This study included 97 patients (54 females) with 39 forearm, 47 upper arm, and 11 lower extremity AVGs. There were 34 open revisions (25 patches, nine jump bypasses) and 63 hybrid interventions, which included balloon angioplasty ± adjunctive procedures (15 stents, five cutting balloons). Technique selection was based on physician preference. Primary patency for the open and hybrid groups was 27.8% and 34.2%, respectively, at six months and 17.5% and 12.9%, respectively, at 12 months (p = .71). Secondary patency was 45.1% and 38.5% for open and hybrid treatment, respectively, at 12 months (p = .87). An existing VA stent was predictive of graft abandonment (hazard ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval 1.2-16.0; p = .024). Open vs. hybrid intervention was not predictive of failure or abandonment.
CONCLUSION: Hybrid interventions for thrombosed AVGs are not associated with worse patency at six and 12 months compared with open revision.
