Title: Endovascular Treatment for Subclavian Artery Stenosis and Occlusion: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Subclavian artery stenosis and occlusion are common arterial diseases in the upper extremities, with atherosclerosis being the main cause. Endovascular treatment has emerged as a promising alternative to open surgical repair, but data are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of endovascular procedures in the treatment of subclavian artery lesions at a tertiary vascular center in Vietnam.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent endovascular treatment for symptomatic subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion between October 2013 and April 2022. Clinical characteristics, procedural details, short- and long-term outcomes, and patency rates were assessed.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 56.8 years. The majority of patients had risk factors for atherosclerosis, and all presented with symptoms related to subclavian artery disease. The endovascular procedures were successful in 96% of cases, with a low complication rate of 8%. During a median follow-up of 43 months, the overall patency rate was 92% at three years.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of subclavian artery stenosis and occlusion is a safe and effective option, with excellent long-term patency rates. These findings support the use of percutaneous revascularization as the first-line therapy, particularly in experienced centers. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these results.
