Title: Atherosclerotic plaque characteristics in extracranial carotid artery may indicate closer association with white matter hyperintensities than intracranial arteries: A CARE-II study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the associations of atherosclerotic plaque characteristics in intracranial and extracranial carotid arteries with severity of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in symptomatic patients using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
METHOD: Patients with cerebrovascular symptoms and carotid plaque were recruited from the cross-sectional, multicenter study of CARE-II. Luminal stenosis of intracranial and extracranial carotid arteries, carotid plaque compositional features, and WMHs were evaluated by brain structural and vascular MR imaging. The atherosclerotic plaque characteristics in intracranial and extracranial carotid arteries were compared between patients with and without moderate-to-severe WMHs (Fazekas score > 2), and their associations with severity of WMHs were analyzed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of the recruited 622 patients (mean age, 58.7 ± 10.9 years; 422 males), 221 (35.5 %) had moderate-to-severe WMHs with higher prevalence of moderate-to-severe luminal stenosis (17.0 % vs. 10.4 %), intraplaque hemorrhage (15.7 % vs. 9.0 %), thin/ruptured fibrous cap (30.2 % vs. 20.4 %), calcification (44.4 % vs. 22.2 %) and lipid-rich necrotic core (63.8 % vs. 51.1 %) in carotid artery compared to those without (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that carotid calcification (OR, 1.854; 95 % CI, 1.187-2.898; P = 0.007) was independently associated with moderate-to-severe WMHs after adjusting for confounding factors. No significant association was found between intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis and moderate-to-severe WMHs (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Carotid atherosclerotic plaque features, particularly presence of calcification, were independently associated with severity of WMHs, but such association was not found in intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, suggesting that carotid atherosclerotic plaque characteristics may have closer association with severity of WMHs compared to intracranial atherosclerosis.
