Title: Very Delayed Perforation after Esophageal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection and Intralesional Triamcinolone Injection.

Abstract: We report a case of delayed perforation following esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). A patient with Parkinson's disease presented with two superficial carcinomatous lesions in the middle third of the esophagus. ESD was performed, and 4/5 of the esophageal circumference was resected, including the adjacent lesion area. Immediately post-ESD, triamcinolone acetonide was injected into the submucosa underlying the ulcer to prevent scarring and stenosis. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed squamous cell carcinoma limited to the lamina propria with negative margins. Seventeen days post-ESD, the patient experienced sudden-onset chest pain during a meal. Computed tomography showed pneumomediastinum, which indicated a delayed perforation. We immediately performed subtotal esophagectomy. A sharply torn longitudinal perforation was present in the post-ESD ulcer. Delayed perforation after esophageal ESD is extremely rare. In this case, the perforation might have been caused by food impaction and delayed ulcer healing due to triamcinolone injection.
