Title: Transcarotid Artery Revascularization for Symptomatic Retropharyngeal Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Retropharyngeal internal carotid artery (ICA) is a rare, yet well-described anatomical variant that poses significant challenges to the management of carotid artery stenosis. In this case report, we discuss the treatment of symptomatic ICA stenosis with a retropharyngeal ICA using the transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) technique. A 70-year-old female with comorbidities presented with neurological symptoms and severe ICA stenosis. After diagnostic evaluation, TCAR was chosen for surgical intervention. The patient did well postoperatively. This case emphasizes the importance of considering TCAR when treating ICA stenosis in patients with anatomic variation of ICA location. It also supports adding anatomic variants such as retropharyngeal ICA to the list of indications for TCAR.
