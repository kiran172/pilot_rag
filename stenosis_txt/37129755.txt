Title: Nano Carbon Tracer in the Repairing of Congenital Abdominal Chylorus Leakage.

Abstract: Congenital chylous ascites (CCA) is a rare cause of ascites in newborn infants. The main causes include congenital lymphatic obstruction due to atresia or stenosis of the major lacteals, mesenteric cysts and lymphangiomatosis. The mainstay of treatment for CCA is conservative management including medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)-based diet or total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and the addition of octreotide. Surgical exploration is reserved for those cases in whom conservative management has failed. The core problem of chylous abdominal surgery is to find the leakage; once the exact chylous leakage is found, the problem will be solved. The authors used a new carbon nanopartides material to accurately locate the location of chylous leakage. The operation is simple and fast, easy to use, and the effect is remarkable.
