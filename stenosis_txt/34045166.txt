Title: Home Health Care Utilization Trend, Predictors, and Association With Early Rehospitalization Following Endovascular Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Home healthcare (HHC) utilization is associated with higher rates of rehospitalization in patients with heart failure and transcatheter mitral valve repair. This study sought to assess the utilization, predictors, and the association of HHC with 30-day readmission in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS/MATERIALS: We queried the Nationwide Readmission Database from January 2012 to December 2017 for TAVR discharges with and without HHC referral. Using multivariate analysis, we identified predictors of HHC utilization, and its association with outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 60,950 TAVR discharges, 21,724 (35.7%) had HHC referral. On multivariable analysis, female sex (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.29-1.40), non-elective admission (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.42-1.56), diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.13), prior stroke (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12), anemia (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11-1.21), and in-hospital complications including cardiogenic shock (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.16-1.50), cardiac arrest (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00-1.50), stroke (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.20-3.18), and new Permanent pacemaker (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.41-1.58) were identified as independent predictors of HHC referral. HHC utilization was associated with longer median length of stay (4 days vs. 2 days, P < 0.001), higher rate of 30-day all-cause (15.5% vs. 10.6%, P < 0.001) and heart failure (2.1%vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) readmission rates compared to those without HHC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a vulnerable group of TAVR patients that are at higher risk of 30-day readmission. Evidence-based interventions proven effective in reducing the burden of readmissions should be pursed in these patients to improve outcomes and quality of life.
