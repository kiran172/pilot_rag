Title: Clinical Presentation and Therapy of d-Transposition of the Great Arteries.

Abstract: d-Transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) is the most common form of congenital heart disease that presents with cyanosis in a newborn. The aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. It constitutes 3-5% of all congenital heart defects. In a simple d-TGA (about two-thirds of patients), there is no other cardiac abnormality other than a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). In a complex d-TGA additional cardiac abnormalities such as VSD, pulmonary stenosis or coronary abnormalities are present. About one-third to 40% of patients with d-TGA have an associated ventricular septal defect. Among patients with d-TGA, 6% of those with intact ventricular septum and 31% of those with ventricular septal defect have associated pulmonary stenosis. Coronary abnormalities are of importance with regard to the complexity of surgical repair.
