Title: Long-term outcomes of concomitant transcatheter aortic valve implantation and percutaneous coronary intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The safety of concomitant percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) setting is still highly debated. This study aimed to assess the safety and the effectiveness of TAVI and PCI performed in the same session compared with TAVI alone.
METHODS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) (N.=786) who underwent TAVI from June 2007 to April 2021 were divided into two groups: patients who underwent TAVI alone (N.=633) and patients treated with TAVI and concomitant PCI (N.=153). The propensity-score matching adjustment was used to account for baseline confounding variables.
RESULTS: A total of 302 TAVI with CAD patients (151 matched pairs), undergoing either isolated TAVI or TAVI+PCI were compared. In-hospital death (6% vs. 4%; P=0.427), stroke (2% vs. 0.7%; P=0.314), myocardial infarction (MI) (0% vs. 0.7%; P=0.317), major and life-threatening bleeding (14.6% vs. 15.9%; P=0.749), and acute kidney injury (9.3% vs. 10.6%; P=0.700) were similar for both groups. At 3 years, the rates of all-cause death (25.2% vs. 19.2%; P=0.615), the composite endpoints of all-cause death and MI (27.2% vs. 21.2%; P=0.699) and all-cause death, MI, and stroke (28.5% vs. 22.5%; P=0.739) were also comparable between the two groups. Achieving complete coronary revascularization in the TAVI setting did not impact on long-term mortality (P=0.257).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe aortic stenosis and CAD, concomitant TAVI and PCI was as safe and effective as TAVI alone up to 3-year follow-up.
