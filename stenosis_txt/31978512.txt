Title: ciRS-7 targeting miR-135a-5p promotes neuropathic pain in CCI rats via inflammation and autophagy.

Abstract: Neuropathic pain, caused by damage to the nerve system, is one of the most challenging diseases in the world. Moreover, the etiology remains unclear. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been revealed to participate in various biological progress, including neuropathic pain. However, the way circRNAs participate in the progress of neuropathic pain still needs further study. In this research, we established CCI rat models and measured the expression level of ciRS-7 in the spinal dorsal horn in the postoperative rats. The level of ciRS-7 was positively associated with the progress of neuropathic pain. Next, we test the expression of autophagy and inflammation in the CCI rats, and the results indicate that ciRS-7 associates with the progress of neuropathic pain partly by upregulated the expression level of autophagy and inflammation in the CCI rats. Furthermore, we found ciRS-7 regulates neuropathic pain progress by sponging to miR-135a-5p. In CCI rats, inhibiting miR-135a-5p decreases the level of autophagy and inflammation and alleviates neuropathic pain. We present this research that might provide a new insight for neuropathic pain study.
