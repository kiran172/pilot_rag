Title: Integrated approach to aortic valve replacement, coronary intervention, and aortic aneurysm in severe LV dysfunction: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: In the complex field of cardiac care, managing patients with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm, and left ventricular dysfunction poses significant challenges. Traditionally, such conditions demand highly invasive surgeries, like open-heart surgery with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, increasing the risk of complications and the need for mechanical circulatory support.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case report details a management of a 53-year-old with no significant past medical history who presented with a three-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea, mixed aortic valve disease, comprising severe aortic regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis, in addition to coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction."
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The patient was deemed to be high risk for conventional open-heart surgery due to his severely reduced ejection fraction and the likelihood of requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and postoperative mechanical circulatory support. Given these considerations, a decision was made to pursue a less invasive transcatheter valve replacement and coronary intervention, avoiding traditional surgery's risks.
CONCLUSION: This approach significantly improved cardiac function and aneurysm stability, demonstrating the potential of minimally invasive techniques in managing complex cardiac conditions.
