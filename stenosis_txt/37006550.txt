Title: Daily exercise improves the long-term prognosis of patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the effect of daily exercise on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
METHODS: A cohort of 9,636 patients with ACS were consecutively enrolled in our retrospective study between November 2015 and September 2017, which were used for model development. 6,745 patients were assigned as the derivation cohort and 2,891 patients were assigned as the validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and COX regression were used to screen out significant variables for the construction of the nomogram. Multivariable COX regression analysis was employed for the development of a model represented by a nomogram. The nomogram was then evaluated for performance traits such as discrimination, calibration, and clinical efficacy.
RESULTS: Among 9,636 patients with ACS (mean [SD] age, 60.3 [10.4] years; 7,235 men [75.1%]), the 5-year incidence for MACE was 0.19 at a median follow-up of 1,747 (1,160-1,825) days. Derived from the LASSO regression and COX regression, the nomogram has included 15 factors in total including age, previous myocardial infarction (MI), previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), systolic pressure, N-terminal Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), serum creatinine, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), Killip class, the Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score, left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis (≥50%), circumflex (LCX) stenosis (≥50%), right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis (≥50%), exercise intensity, cumulative time. The 5-year area under the ROC curve (AUC) of derivation and validation cohorts were 0.659 (0.643-0.676) and 0.653 (0.629-0.677), respectively. The calibration plots showed the strong concordance performance of the nomogram model in both two cohorts. Moreover, decision curve analysis (DCA) also showed the usefulness of nomogram in clinical practice.
CONCLUSION: The present work provided a prediction nomogram predicting MACE for patients with ACS after incorporating the already known factors and the daily exercise, which demonstrated the effectiveness of daily exercise on the improvement of prognosis for patients with ACS.
