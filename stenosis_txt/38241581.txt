Title: Clinical characteristics of intradermal nevus in the external auditory canal.

Abstract: Melanocytic nevus occurring in the external auditory canal (EAC) is uncommon. Therefore, in the absence of sufficient clinical experience, this disease may be challenging to be suspected even with a physical examination. Herein, clinical and demographic features of intradermal nevus in the EAC were investigated. Patients with an intradermal nevus on histopathological examination (n = 15; 2 men and 13 women; P = .005) were included from a pool of patients who underwent surgical resection for EAC tumors between November 2011 and March 2022. Data were retrospectively collected on their sex, appearance of the lesions, surgical method, and outcomes. Nine patients had a dome shape and 6 patients had a papillomatous shape. Ten patients had dark colors and 5 patients had pale colors. All pale colors appeared only in the dome-shaped nevus, and only dark colored papillomatous nevi were observed. A significant difference was noted in terms of the frequency of occurrence by colors (dark or pale) according to shape (dome or papillomatous) (P = .044). No patient showed recurrence or EAC stenosis after circumferential excision. In women, a dome-shaped or papillomatous mass with dark color in the EAC may likely be predicted as the nevus. However, it can also occur in men, and even if it is a pale color, in the case of a dome shape, taking the nevus into account is important. Moreover, successful treatment outcomes were achieved through circumferential excision.
