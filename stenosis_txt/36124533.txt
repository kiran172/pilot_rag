Title: A novel onlay urethroplasty for hypospadias with mild chordee after degloving: modified for complete removal of scar tissue underlying the urethral plate and for long-term outcomes.

Abstract: Urethral plate (UP)-preserving urethroplasty is simple and has few complications, but it may affect the development of penis in the long term and lead to recurrent chordee. In this study, we used obliquely cut UP to repair hypospadias with mild chordee after degloving (15°-30°) and compared the results with onlay urethroplasty to explore its rationality and feasibility. Between April 2018 and October 2020, 108 hypospadias patients underwent onlay urethroplasty or modified onlay urethroplasty. Clinical data were prospectively collected, and medium-term outcomes were assessed at follow-up. The complications were compared between the two groups. Forty-four patients underwent the modified onlay procedure (Group I), with follow-up time (mean ± standard deviation [s.d.]) of 23.2 ± 4.5 (range: 17-31) months. Sixty-four patients underwent a standard onlay procedure (Group II), with follow-up time (mean ± s.d.) of 39.7 ± 3.9 (range: 32-46) months. There was no difference in age at surgery. The urethral defect length and operative time were longer in Group I. Six cases of fistula and one case each of stricture and diverticulum were reported in Group I. In Group II, 11 cases of fistula and one case each of stricture and diverticulum were reported. The complication rates were 18.2% and 20.3% in Group I and Group II, respectively (P &gt; 0.05). These medium-term follow-up results demonstrate that the modified onlay procedure (oblique cut UP urethroplasty) is a safe and feasible technique for hypospadias with mild chordee after degloving. Compared with standard onlay urethroplasty, this modified procedure is conducive to the complete removal of scar tissue underlying the UP without increasing the risk of surgical complications.
