Title: Unstable Plaque is a Treatable Cause of Cognitive Decline.

Abstract: While many risk factors are modifiable, there remains a compelling need for novel approaches to prevent cognitive impairment. We propose that unstable carotid plaque causes microemboli that, in turn, cause microinfarcts and other adverse pathophysiological cerebral processes, which individually do not manifest clinically but cumulatively manifest as cognitive decline and ultimately cognitive impairment. Animal models support multiple cerebral microemboli having adverse effects on cognition. By addressing the source for microembolization by endarterectomy or stenting, patients with high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis may have better cognitive outcomes. If our hypothesis is verified, then treatment of carotid plaque at elevated risk of generating cerebral microemboli would be effective in preserving cognition, regardless of whether the stenosis is high-grade or causing cerebral hemispheric hypoperfusion.
