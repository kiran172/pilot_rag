Title: Effect of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on the Immune Response Associated With Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: The immune response after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in comparison to that after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) remains to be fully elucidated. In a 2-part study, we assessed laboratory data obtained before, immediately after, and 24 and 48 hours after SAVR (128 patients; age ≥80 [mean 82] years) or transfemoral TAVI (102 patients; age ≥80 [mean 86] years) performed for aortic stenosis. In-hospital mortalities were similar (3% vs 0%), but leukocyte counts and aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinas concentrations were decreased immediately and 24 hours after surgery (all, p <0.001). We performed cytokine profiling in a SAVR group (11 patients; mean age, 77 years) and transfemoral TAVI group (12 patients; mean age, 84 years). By measuring normalized concentrations of 71 cytokines at 3 time points, we found a significant difference (defined as fold change >1.7 and p <0.05 [by Mann-Whitney U-test]) in 23 cytokines. The differentially expressed cytokines fell into 3 hierarchical clusters: cluster A (high increase after SAVR and suppressed increase after TAVI only immediately after surgery [CCL2, CCL4, and 2 others]), cluster B (high increase after SAVR and suppressed increase after TAVI at 2 time points [IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and 5 others]), and cluster C (various patterns [TRAIL, CCL11, and 8 others]). Gene enrichment analysis identified multiple pathways associated with the inflammatory responses in SAVR and altered responses in TAVI, including cellular responses to tumor necrosis factor (p = 0.0035) and interleukin-1 (p = 0.0062). In conclusion, a robust inflammatory response follows SAVR, and a comparatively attenuated response follows TAVI.
