Title: [Prognosis of patients with vulnerable plaques indicated by coronary CT angiography].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognosis of patients with vulnerable plaque indicated by coronary CT angiography (CCTA).
METHODS: Totally 1963 patients underwent CCTA from February 2nd 2015 to September 13th 2015, and 2728 coronary borderline lesions (stenosis of 50%-70%) were detected. Among them 804 patients had vulnerable plaques and 1159 patients had stable plaques. The primary endpoint was major cardiac adverse events (MACE), including cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization.
RESULTS: Patients were followed up for a mean follow-up of 27.4±2.3 months. The incidence of MACE in the vulnerable plaque group was significantly higher than that in the stable plaque group (10.8%vs 2.3%, P &amp;lt; 0.01). After adjusting for age, gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, the MACE hazard ratio (HR) in the vulnerable plaque group was 5.022 (95% CI:3.254-7.751, P &amp;lt; 0.01).Subgroup analysis showed that in the vulnerable plaque group, the incidence of MACE in patients taking antiplatelet and statin ≤3 months and those taking antiplatelet and statin &amp;gt; 3 months was 17.0%and 5.8%, respectively (HR=3.149, 95% CI:1.987-4.992, P &amp;lt; 0.01); but the difference did not seen in stable plaque group (HR=1.721, 95% CI:0.798-3.712, P&amp;gt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the risk of MACE in patients with vulnerable plaque detected by CCTA and the drug treatment may reduce the risk for patients with vulnerable plaque.
