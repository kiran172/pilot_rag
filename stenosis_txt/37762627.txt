Title: Novel Therapeutic Approaches to Prevent Atherothrombotic Ischemic Stroke in Patients with Carotid Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Atherothrombotic stroke represents approximately 20% of all ischemic strokes. It is caused by large-artery atherosclerosis, mostly in the internal carotid artery, and it is associated with a high risk of early recurrence. After an ischemic stroke, tissue plasminogen activator is used in clinical practice, although it is not possible in all patients. In severe clinical situations, such as high carotid stenosis (â‰¥70%), revascularization by carotid endarterectomy or by stent placement is carried out to avoid recurrences. In stroke prevention, the pharmacological recommendations are based on antithrombotic, lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive therapy. Inflammation is a promising target in stroke prevention, particularly in ischemic strokes associated with atherosclerosis. However, the use of anti-inflammatory strategies has been scarcely studied. No clinical trials are clearly successful and most preclinical studies are focused on protection after a stroke. The present review describes novel therapies addressed to counteract inflammation in the prevention of the first-ever or recurrent stroke. The putative clinical use of broad-spectrum and specific anti-inflammatory drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies and microRNAs (miRNAs) as regulators of atherosclerosis, will be outlined. Further studies are necessary to ascertain which patients may benefit from anti-inflammatory agents and how.
