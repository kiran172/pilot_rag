Title: A potential diagnostic pitfall in ST elevation: Acute pulmonary embolism or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Abstract: The diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (APE) is a great challenge for physicians due to its nonspecific symptoms, and often missed or misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome. Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities are seen in majority of patients with APE. Recently, APE with ST-segment elevation (STE) in leads V<sub>1</sub> -V<sub>3</sub> /V<sub>4</sub> , mimicking ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), has been described. However, coronary angiography showed that the patient's coronary arteries were mostly normal. Herein, we describe a case of APE presenting with STE in V<sub>1</sub> -V<sub>4</sub> , along with severe stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
