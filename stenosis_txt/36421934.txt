Title: The Role of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Patients with Mitral Regurgitation.

Abstract: The 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated that there were approximately 24.2 million people affected worldwide by degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR), resulting in 34,200 deaths. After aortic stenosis, MR is the most prevalent VHD in Europe and the second-most common VHD to pose indications for surgery in western countries. Current ESC and AHA/ACC guidelines for the management of VHD emphasize the importance of an integrative approach for the assessment of MR severity, which is of paramount importance in dictating the timing for surgery. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are the first-line imaging modalities; however, despite the technological advancement, sometimes, the final diagnosis on the degree of the disease may still be challenging. In the last 20 years, CMR has emerged as a robust technique in the assessment of patients with cardiac disease, and, recently, its role is gaining more and more importance in the field of VHD. In fact, CMR is the gold standard in the assessment of cardiac volumes, and it is possible to accurately evaluate the regurgitant volume. The purpose of this review is to outline the current state-of-the-art management of MR by using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR).
