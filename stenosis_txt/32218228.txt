Title: Bedside Renal Doppler Ultrasonography and Acute Kidney Injury after TAVR.

Abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with a dismal prognosis. Elevated renal resistive index (RRI), through renal Doppler ultrasound (RDU) evaluation, has been associated with AKI development and increased systemic arterial stiffness. Our pilot study aimed to investigate the performance of Doppler based RRI to predict AKI and outcomes in TAVR patients. From May 2018 to May 2019, 100 patients with severe aortic stenosis were prospectively enrolled for TAVR and concomitant RDU evaluation at our institution (Nouvel Hôpital Civil, Strasbourg University, France). AKI by serum Creatinine (sCr-AKI) was defined according to the VARC-2 definition and AKI by serum Cystatin C (sCyC-AKI) was defined as an sCyC increase of greater than 15% with baseline value. Concomitant RRI measurements as well as renal and systemic hemodynamic parameters were recorded before, one day, and three days after TAVR. It was found that 10% of patients presented with AKI<sub>sCr</sub> and AKI<sub>sCyC</sub>. The whole cohort showed higher baseline RRI values (0.76 ± 0.7) compared to normal known and accepted values. AKI<sub>sCyC</sub> had significant higher post-procedural RRI one day (Day 1) after TAVR (0.83 ± 0.1 vs. 0.77 ± 0.6, CI 95%, p = 0.005). AUC for AKI<sub>sCyC</sub> was 0.766 and a RRI cut-off value of ≥ 0.795 had the most optimal sensitivity/specificity (80/62%) combination. By univariate Cox analysis, Mehran Risk Score, higher baseline right atrial pressure at baseline &gt; 0.8 RRI values one day after TAVR (HR 6.5 (95% CI 1.3-32.9; p = 0.021) but not RRI at baseline were significant predictors of AKI<sub>sCyC</sub>. Importantly, no significant impact of baseline biological parameters, renal or systemic parameters could be demonstrated. Doppler-based RRI can be helpful for the non-invasive assessment of AKI development after TAVR.
