Title: Cerebral Bypass Using the Descending Branch of the Lateral Circumflex Femoral Artery: A Case Series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: When performing extracranial to intracranial (EC-IC) and intracranial to intracranial (IC-IC) bypass, the choice of donor vessel and interposition graft depends on several factors: vessel size and accessibility, desired blood flow augmentation, revascularization site anatomy, and pathology. The descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery (DLCFA) is an attractive conduit for cerebrovascular bypass.
OBJECTIVE: To present our institutional experience using DLCFA grafts for cerebral revascularization.
METHODS: Retrospective review of perioperative data and outcomes for patients undergoing cerebrovascular bypass surgery using a DLCFA graft from 2016 to 2019.
RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients underwent EC-IC bypass using a DLCFA interposition graft. Bypass indications included 13 (65%) intracranial aneurysms, 4 (20%) medically refractory atherosclerotic large artery occlusions (internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery), 2 (10%) internal carotid artery dissections, and 1 (5%) patient with moyamoya disease. Most commonly, a donor superior temporal artery was bypassed to a recipient middle cerebral artery (14 of 20; 70%). Two cases demonstrated graft spasm. Graft occlusion occurred in one patient and was asymptomatic. Perioperative bypass surgery-related ischemia occurred in 3 patients: 1 patient with insufficient bypass flow, 1 patient with graft stenosis because of an adventitial band, and 1 patient with focal status epilepticus in the bypassed territory resulting in cortical ischemia. One donor site hematoma occurred. The median (range) modified Rankin scale (mRS) score on follow-up was 1.5 (1-4) at 7.8 (1-27) months, with most patients achieving good functional outcomes (mRS â‰¤2).
CONCLUSION: The DLCFA is a versatile graft for cerebral revascularization surgery, demonstrating good outcomes with minimal graft harvest site morbidity and an acceptable graft patency rate.
