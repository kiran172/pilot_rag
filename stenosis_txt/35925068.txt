Title: [Focal fibromuscular dysplasia : Iliac artery revascularization using a double-layer stent].

Abstract: The case of a young man with left intermittent claudication is reported. Initially, common left pelvic-type peripheral arterial occlusive disease is assumed. Angiographically, however, there is a high degree of fibromuscular dysplasia with a focal lesion in the left iliac flow area, directly at the origin of the internal iliac artery (IIA). After vessel preparation, a double-layer stent is implanted off-label to protect the IIA and to create peripheral embolic protection.
