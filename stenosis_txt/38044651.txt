Title: Advances in diagnosis and treatment of mechanical hemolysis following percutaneous interventional for valvular heart diseases.

Abstract: Valvular heart disease is one of the common heart diseases in clinical practice, characterized by valve stenosis and/or incomplete closure. At present, drug therapy, surgery, and emerging percutaneous intervention therapy are the main treating methods for heart valve disease. Although the research and development of percutaneous intervention therapy devices is relatively mature, there are still problems such as postoperative mechanical hemolysis. The occurrence of mechanical hemolysis is associated with factors such as excessive shear stress experienced by red blood cells, direct interaction between red blood cells and the heart and valve surfaces, and thrombus formation. Furthermore, the presence of postoperative infection and other hemolytic diseases can also affect the occurrence of mechanical hemolysis. Although most patients are asymptomatic when hemolysis occurs, there are still critical cases. This type of hemolysis can accelerate the deterioration of the condition, and even endanger life in severe cases. Therefore, elucidating the background, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and related clinical research progress of mechanical hemolysis after percutaneous intervention therapy for valvular heart disease is of great significance for guiding the standardized diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
