Title: Delayed coronary artery stenosis: a rare complication of the left atrial clipping device.

Abstract: A clipping device may impinge on the coronary artery following left atrial appendage occlusion during cardiac surgery, causing rare cardiac ischaemia perioperatively. This report highlights a case of delayed severe coronary artery stenosis resulting in ventricular fibrillation 2â€‰months after cardiac surgery with the implantation of a left atrial clipping device. Following a percutaneous coronary intervention, the patient underwent clip removal surgery. Postoperative three-dimensional heart model verification revealed that the base of the left atrial appendage was more dorsal than usual, thereby increasing the potential risk of the clip impinging on the coronary artery. We should remember that this rare complication can occur after left atrial clipping, either in the early postoperative period or later.
