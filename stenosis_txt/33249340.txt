Title: Conventional Angiography in the Assessment of Recently Symptomatic Patients with Ipsilateral Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Benefits of revascularization for moderate and severe (≥50%) carotid stenosis were established based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We aimed to assess the discrepancy between invasive and non-invasive angiography in a consecutive, prospective cohort of patients with recent stroke and non-invasive imaging suggesting ≥50% ipsilateral carotid stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed prospectively-collected data for consecutive patients admitted with recent stroke/TIA and ≥50% ipsilateral carotid stenosis on non-invasive imaging over 28 months. All patients underwent DSA to confirm the degree of stenosis per NASCET criteria. All patients with <50% stenosis by DSA were treated with medical therapy only and their recurrent event rates were assessed at 6 months.
RESULTS: 148 symptomatic patients with ≥50% ipsilateral carotid stenosis on CTA (82%) and MRA (18%) underwent DSA to confirm degree of stenosis. Median age was 73 years and 64% were male. DSA demonstrated <50% stenosis in 28 patients (19%). Median presenting NIHSS was 1 (IQR 0-3). Median carotid stenosis evaluated by non-invasive imaging was 70% (IQR 60-85%) and by DSA was 40% (IQR 30-45%). One of 28 patients (4%) experienced recurrent nondisabling stroke (NIHSS 1) after stopping dual antiplatelet therapy.
CONCLUSION: In nearly one-in-five cases with recent stroke due to ipsilateral carotid stenosis deemed to be candidates for revascularization based on CTA or MRA, DSA led to institution of medical therapy only due to insufficiently severe stenosis. In patients treated with medical therapy based on the findings of <50% stenosis on DSA, the rate of recurrent stroke is low.
