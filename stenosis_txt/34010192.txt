Title: One-year outcome of single-stent crossover versus accurate ostial stenting for isolated left anterior descending ostial stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal strategy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for isolated left anterior descending (LAD) ostial lesions remains debatable. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes of patients with isolated LAD ostial stenosis treated by single-stent crossover versus accurate ostial stenting.
METHODS: A total of 216 eligible consecutive patients with isolated de novo LAD ostial stenosis were enrolled, and were stratified according to the stenting techniques. Clinical follow-up was performed by review of medical charts or telephone contact with the patients, and repeat angiography was made at 9-12 months after the procedure. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and target vessel revascularization (TVR) were recorded.
RESULTS: Single-stent crossover and accurate ostial stenting were applied to 78 (36%) and 138 (64%) patients, respectively. During a mean of 13 ± 4.1 months of follow-up, the rate of composite MACE (19.6 vs. 8.9%; P = 0.040) was higher in LAD ostial stenosis patients treated with accurate ostial stenting than those treated with single-stent crossover technique, mainly driven by more frequent TVR (17.4 vs. 7.7%; P = 0.048). PCI strategy was an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio 2.561; 95% CI, 1.041-6.299; P = 0.021) in the multivariable Cox regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study suggests that the single-stent crossover technique is associated with a better 1-year clinical outcome compared with accurate ostial stenting in patients with isolated LAD ostial stenosis.
