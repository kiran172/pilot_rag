Title: Branch pulmonary artery stent placement in a dog with heart base neoplasia.

Abstract: A 7-year-old French bulldog was presented for evaluation ofÂ cardiac neoplasia. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography revealed a mass on the base of the heart, compressing the right pulmonary artery. Computed tomography exam confirmed that a surgical approach to remove the mass would not be viable. Stent placement in the right pulmonary artery was performed to relieve external compression caused by the neoplasia. When surgery is not feasible, pulmonary artery stenting could be one aspect of a multidisciplinary approach to palliative management of heart base neoplasia.
