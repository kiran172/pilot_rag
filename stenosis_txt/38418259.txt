Title: A Cost-Effective Approach to Resistant AV Fistula Stenosis: Successful Treatment Using Coronary OPN NC速 Balloon in a Low-Income Setting.

Abstract: Stenosis in the anastomotic site or venous limb of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the most frequent cause of AVF failure. Percutaneous angioplasty with a standard or high-pressure balloon is the first-line treatment for AVF stenosis due to its higher technical success rate (90%) and lower complication rate (4%). Almost 20% of stenosis cases are resistant or undilatable by regular-pressure balloon angioplasty due to fibrosis, leading to technical failure or restenosis. Alternative therapies, such as atherectomy devices or cutting balloons, are expensive and difficult to obtain in low-income developing countries. We successfully treated resistant AVF stenosis with a coronary OPN-NC速 ultra-high-pressure balloon and produced a good angiographic result with technical success. Coronary hardware is easily available and relatively cheaper compared to dedicated peripheral balloons or devices in our country due to reuse, which can be a boon in such type of cases. According to the standard hospital protocol, Cathlab hardware was reused.
