Title: [Beneficial Effects of the Modified Bicaval Anastomosis Technique for Orthotopic Heart Transplantation from a Size-Mismatched Donor:20-year Single Center Experience].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Size-mismatched heart transplantation( HTx) is associated with a risk of stenosis of the caval anastomosis site or low cardiac output syndrome. We developed a modified bicaval anastomosis technique( mBCAT) that achieved an adjustable caval anastomosis to compensate for the size mismatch. This study clarified clinical outcomes of HTx with mBCAT technique according to the degree of the size mismatch.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study consisted of 130 adult patients who underwent HTx with the mBCAT during a 22-year period and were followed up for at least 1 year. The cohort was divided into three groups according to the donor-to-recipient body weight ratio:<0.8, undersized group (n=19);0.8 ~1.3, size-matched group( n=89);and >1.3, oversized group( n=22). The undersized, size-matched, and oversized groups showed no significant differences in the rate of mild or worse tricuspid regurgitation on echocardiography at 1 month [ 1( 5.3%), 8( 9.0%), and 1( 4.6%), respectively;p=0.683] or the survival rate at 10 years( 100%, 96%, and 95%, respectively;p=0.452). The right heart catheter study revealed no pressure gradient across the orifices of both cavae in any patient. Additionally, the cardiac index immediately post-HTx was low in the undersized group, but improved over time in all groups, achieving the comparable value at 6 and 12 months post-HTx.
CONCLUSIONS: The mBCAT prevented caval anastomosis-related complications in size-mismatched HTx and achieved excellent hemodynamics regardless of donor size.
