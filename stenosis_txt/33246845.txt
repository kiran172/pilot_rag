Title: Diagnostic performance and limitation of quantitative flow ratio for functional assessment of intermediate coronary stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to simultaneously investigate diagnostic performance and limitation of quantitative flow reserve (QFR) for assessing functionally significant coronary stenosis, focusing on factors affecting diagnostic accuracy of QFR.
METHODS: This study evaluated 1) QFR diagnostic accuracy compared with fractional flow reserve (FFR) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (Cohort-A, n = 95) and 2) QFR reproducibility for non-culprit lesions (NCLs) assessment between acute and staged (14±5 days later) procedures in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (Cohort-B, n = 65). All coronary angiography image acquisition was performed before the introduction of QFR system into our institution.
RESULTS: Cohort-A showed good correlation (r = 0.80, p<0.0001) between QFR and FFR; diagnostic accuracy of QFR for FFR ≤0.80 was 85.2% (sensitivity 80.4%, specificity 91.0%, positive predictive value 91.1%, negative predictive value 80.0%). There were 14 lesions showing discordance between QFR and FFR, which was primarily attributable to inadequate lesion visualization due to vessel overlap/tortuosity and/or insufficient intra-coronary contrast-media injection. In Cohort-B, there was also excellent correlation between acute and staged QFR; classification agreement of acute and staged QFR was 92.3%. Five lesions showed discordance between acute and staged QFR, 4 were due to limited image acquisition and/or high coronary flow velocity at acute phase of STEMI and 1 was borderline ischemia.
CONCLUSIONS: QFR-derived physiological assessment of intermediate coronary stenosis is feasible, even in the acute setting of STEMI. Adjusting some technical factors may further improve the diagnostic performance of QFR.
