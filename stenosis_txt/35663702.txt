Title: The Role of Interventional Pain Management in Proteus Syndrome: A Case Report.

Abstract: Proteus syndrome (PS) is a rare overgrowth disease process with only a few hundred cases being reported in the literature. Abnormal formation of the vertebral bodies causing scoliosis and spinal stenosis are common features that lead to debilitating pain in these patients. We present a case of a 35-year-old male landscaper with a history of PS causing severe scoliosis and vertebral overgrowth who underwent recurrent sets of multilevel zygapophyseal joint injections for management of his axial back pain. This case illustrates the utility of interventional spinal procedures in patients with progressive pain from PS.
