Title: Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis of a bioprosthetic valve: Questions to ponder before replacement of the valve.

Abstract: Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) of bioprosthetic valves is extremely rare. We report a 67-year-old lady with early bioprosthetic "failure" that at reoperation was proven to be NBTE. The choice of a prosthesis in this condition may have implications for patients' late clinical course.
