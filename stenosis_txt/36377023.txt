Title: Hyperthyroidism Presenting with Coronary Vasospasm.

Abstract: Hyperthyroidism is associated with a number of heart diseases, and it may aggravate previous cardiac problems or cause new ones, such as hyperthyroid cardiopathy. Cases of hyperthyroidism presenting with coronary vasospasm are rarely reported. Herein, we present a case of a 54-year male patient with recurrent left chest pain for 2 months. Coronary angiography showed no obvious coronary artery stenosis, and coronary vasospasm was suspected. After admission, the patient's thyroid function and TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) were abnormal. However, there was no obvious palpitation, hyperhidrosis, or weight loss, and the diagnosis of Graves' disease was rendered, which seemed to be the cause of coronary vasospasm. The patient did not experience chest pain after treatment with methimazole. Patients with coronary vasospasm should be investigated for the possibility of hyperthyroidism. Key Words: Hyperthyroidism, Chest pain, Coronary angiography, Coronary vasospasm.
