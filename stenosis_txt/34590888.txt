Title: Auditory and speech performance after unilateral cochlear implantation for cochlear nerve canal stenosis.

Abstract: To explore the correlation between the width of the bony cochlear nerve canal (CNC) and long-term auditory rehabilitation after unilateral cochlear implantation (CI) in pediatric patients with congenital deafness and bilateral cochlear nerve canal stenosis (CNCS). A retrospective review was performed on 10 patients with bilateral CNCS and bilateral congenital profound hearing loss who each underwent unilateral cochlear implantation. The width of the CNC was determined on computed tomography (CT) imaging and following CI, auditory and speech performance following CI were graded using categories of auditory performance (CAP), speech intelligibility rating (SIR), and the meaningful auditory integration scale (MAIS) at 24 months following implantation. No correlation was noted between CAP score and CNCS at 24 months post CI (P &gt; .05). A positive correlation was noted between SIR score and CNC width (ρ = .81, P &lt; .05). Similarly, a positive correlation was noted between MAIS and CNC width (ρ = .71, P &lt; .05). The width of the CNC in patients with CNCS is positively correlated with some long-term auditory and speech outcomes after CI.
