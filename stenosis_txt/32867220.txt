Title: Evaluation of Hemodialysis Arteriovenous Bruit by Deep Learning.

Abstract: Physical findings of auscultation cannot be quantified at the arteriovenous fistula examination site during daily dialysis treatment. Consequently, minute changes over time cannot be recorded based only on subjective observations. In this study, we sought to supplement the daily arteriovenous fistula consultation for hemodialysis patients by recording the sounds made by the arteriovenous fistula and evaluating the sounds using deep learning methods to provide an objective index. We sampled arteriovenous fistula auscultation sounds (192 kHz, 24 bits) recorded over 1 min from 20 patients. We also extracted arteriovenous fistula sounds for each heartbeat without environmental sound by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was made by comparing these sound patterns with 5000 environmental sounds. The extracted single-heartbeat arteriovenous fistula sounds were sent to a spectrogram and scored using a CNN learning model with bidirectional long short-term memory, in which the degree of arteriovenous fistula stenosis was assigned to one of five sound types (i.e., normal, hard, high, intermittent, and whistling). After 100 training epochs, the method exhibited an accuracy rate of 70-93%. According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curves (AUC) was 0.75-0.92. The analysis of arteriovenous fistula sound using deep learning has the potential to be used as an objective index in daily medical care.
