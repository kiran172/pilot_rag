Title: Treatment of Cerebral Vasospasm Following Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage using the Neurospeed Semi-compliant Balloon.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral vasospasm (CV) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) may lead to morbidity and mortality. Endovascular mechanical angioplasty may be performed if symptomatic CV is refractory to noninvasive medical management. Off-label compliant remodelling balloons tend to conform to the course of the vessel, contrary to noncompliant or semi-compliant balloons. Our objective is to describe our initial experience with the semi-compliant Neurospeed balloon (approved for intracranial stenosis) in cerebral vasospasm treatment following aSAH.
METHODS: All patients included in the prospective observational SAVEBRAIN PWI (NCT05276934 on clinicaltrial.gov) study who underwent cerebral angioplasty using the Neurospeed balloon for the treatment of medically refractory and symptomatic CV after aSAH were identified. Patient demographic information, procedural details and outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records.
RESULTS: Between February 2022 and June 2023, 8 consecutive patients underwent CV treatment with the Neurospeed balloon. Angioplasty of 48 arterial segments (supraclinoid internal carotid artery, A1 and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral artery, M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery) was attempted and 44/48 (92%) were performed. The vessel diameter significantly improved following angioplasty (+81%), while brain hypoperfusion decreased (-81% of the mean TMax). There was no long-term clinical complication, 4% periprocedural complications occurred.
CONCLUSION: The semi-compliant Neurospeed balloon is effective in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following aSAH, bringing a new device into the armamentarium of the neurointerventionalist to perform intracranial angioplasty.
