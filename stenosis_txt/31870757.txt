Title: Contemporary results with the biosynthetic glutaraldehyde denatured ovine collagen graft (Omniflow II) in femoropopliteal position.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the outcome of a contemporary series of femoropopliteal bypass operations with the glutaraldehyde denatured polyester mesh-reinforced ovine collagen prosthesis (OCP; Omniflow II [LeMaitre Vascular, Inc, Burlington, Mass]). The experience of two tertiary centers regarding long-term graft function, secondary reinterventions, and biodegeneration of the OCP prosthesis is presented.
METHODS: Between January 2006 and January 2014, a series of 205 consecutive operations with the OCP in the femoropopliteal position (54 above knee and 151 below knee) were performed in 194 patients in 202 limbs for disabling claudication (72), chronic critical ischemia (105), acute ischemia (18), popliteal artery aneurysm (4), degeneration of a venous or prosthetic graft (5), and infection of a synthetic bypass graft (1). Grafts were observed with duplex ultrasound scan supplemented by additional angiography in case of recurrent ischemia with prospective documentation of follow-up data in a computerized vascular database. Retrospective analysis of graft patency, limb salvage, and diagnosis of aneurysmal graft degeneration was performed.
RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 3.9%. Early thrombotic bypass occlusion occurred in 8.2% of cases. Four early graft infections could be successfully managed by local treatment with graft preservation. After a mean (median) follow-up of 56 (55) months (range, 1-135 months), primary patency, primary assisted patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage were 71%, 78%, 78%, and 91% for above-knee bypass and 40%, 50%, 63%, and 87% for below-knee bypass at 5 years. Biodegeneration in the form of graft aneurysm or graft stenosis was detected in 26 grafts (12.6%), resulting in secondary open or endovascular procedures in 16 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The OCP provides satisfactory medium- and long-term patency and limb salvage in the femoropopliteal position. Aneurysmal degeneration or graft stenosis may develop over time, demanding lifelong duplex ultrasound surveillance and secondary intervention if needed. Its possible infection-resistant behavior in a contaminated field combined with an acceptable graft patency and limb salvage justifies the use of this graft in the absence of autologous vein.
