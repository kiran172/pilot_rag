Title: Radiological Analysis of Minimally Invasive Microscopic Laminectomy for Lumbar Canal Stenosis with a Focus on Multilevel Stenosis and Spondylolisthesis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We retrospectively compared the radiological and clinical outcomes of two different surgical techniques (lumbar spinous process splitting laminectomy [LSPSL] and unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression [ULBD]) to treat lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LCS).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective comparative study of 141 consecutive patients with an average age of 70.8 Â± 9.4 years who had undergone LSPSL or ULBD for LCS between April 2015 and April 2019. None of the patients had developed remote fractures of the spinous processes using either technique. These cases were divided into 2 groups: group L, 73 patients who had undergone LSPSL from April 2015 to April 2017; and group U, 68 patients who had undergone ULBD from May 2017 to April 2019. The clinical and radiological outcomes and surgical complications at the 1-year postoperative follow-up period were evaluated.
RESULTS: We found no significant differences in the operative time between the 2 groups. However, group U had had significantly less blood loss than group L. The facet joints were significantly well preserved in group U. We examined the multilevel and spondylolisthesis cases separately and found that both surgical procedures were equally effective and that the visual analog scale scores for back or leg pain and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores had significantly improved postoperatively in each group. Group U showed better outcomes in terms of LCS recurrence, with 3 patients in the group L requiring repeat surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: We found both ULBD and LSPSL to be safe and effective techniques for LCS, even for patients with spondylolisthesis and multilevel disease. ULBD was superior in terms of recurrence prevention, preservation of the facet joints, and less blood loss.
