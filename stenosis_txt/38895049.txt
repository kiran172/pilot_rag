Title: CT Characteristics and Clinical Findings of Bronchopneumonia Caused by Pepper Aspiration.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the computed tomography (CT) features of bronchopneumonia caused by pepper aspiration to improve the diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 28 adult patients diagnosed with obstructive pneumonia caused by pepper aspiration from January 2016 to September 2022 were enrolled. The CT characteristics of bronchial changes and pulmonary lesions caused by pepper were analyzed and summarized.
RESULTS: Among 28 patients, the most common symptom was cough (26, 92.9%), followed by expectoration (23, 82.1%). Bronchoscopy revealed that peppers were mainly found in the bronchus of the right lower lobe (n = 18, 64.3%), followed by the bronchus of the left lower lobe (n = 5, 17.9%). In combination with bronchoscopy results, the pepper in the bronchus manifested as circular or V/U-shaped high-density, localized soft tissue, and flocculent opacification in 8 (28.6%), 16 (57.1%), and 3 (10.7%) cases on CT images, respectively. The bronchial wall around the pepper was thickened with localized occlusion (n = 19, 67.9%) and stenosis (n = 9, 32.1%). Regarding adjacent bronchi without peppers, extensive wall thickening with stenosis and/or occlusion was found in 23 (82.1%) cases. Distal pulmonary lesions frequently involved two or three segments (21, 75.0%) and mainly presented as patchy consolidation or atelectasis (24, 85.7%).
CONCLUSION: In combination to a history of eating peppers and clinical symptoms, bronchopneumonia caused by pepper should be highly suspected if U/V-shaped and annular high-density or localized soft tissue density is detected in the bronchi of the lower lobes, accompanied by extensive bronchial wall thickening, stenosis, or occlusion, and consolidation or atelectasis in multiple distal lung segments.
