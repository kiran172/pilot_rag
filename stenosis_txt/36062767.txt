Title: Collateral Flow in Magnetic Resonance Angiography: Prognostic Value for Vertebrobasilar Stenosis With Stroke Recurrence.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial vertebrobasilar atherosclerotic stenosis (IVBAS) is a major cause of posterior circulation stroke. Some patients suffer from stroke recurrence despite receiving medical treatment. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of a new score for the posterior communicating artery and the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCoA-P1) for predicting stroke recurrence in IVBAS.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled patients with severe IVBAS (70%-99%). According to the number of stroke recurrences, patients were divided into no-recurrence, single-recurrence, and multiple-recurrences groups. We developed a new 5-point grading scale, with the PCoA-P1 score ranging from 0 to 4 based on magnetic resonance angiography, in which primary collaterals were dichotomized into good (2-4 points) and poor (0 or 1 point). Stroke recurrences after the index stroke were recorded. Patients who did not experience stroke recurrence were compared with those who experienced single or multiple stroke recurrences.
RESULTS: From January 2012 to December 2019, 176 patients were enrolled, of which 116 (65.9%) had no stroke recurrence, 35 (19.9%) had a single stroke recurrence, and 25 (14.2%) had multiple stroke recurrences. Patients with single stroke recurrence (odds ratio [OR]=4.134, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.822-9.380, p=0.001) and multiple stroke recurrences (OR=6.894, 95% CI=2.489-19.092, p&lt;0.001) were more likely to have poor primary collaterals than those with no stroke recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: The new PCoA-P1 score appears to provide improve predictions of stroke recurrence in patients with IVBAS.
