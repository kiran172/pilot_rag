Title: Lumbar Endoscopic Unilateral Laminotomy With Bilateral Decompression Surgery in Severe Lumbar Stenosis Under Electrophysiological Monitoring-Focused on Full-Visualized Trephine/Osteotome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although endoscopic drill has the advantages in manipulation and hemostasis, whose low efficiency and blurred vision reduce the efficacy of lumbar endoscopic unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression (LE-ULBD). The present study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of full-visualized trephine/osteotome in the LE-ULBD surgery for severe lumbar stenosis.
METHODS: Fifty-seven severe lumbar stenosis patients who underwent LE-ULBD between January 2020 to January 2023 were enrolled, who were divided into drill and visualized trephine groups. The medical records including demographics, operative duration, intraoperative electrophysiological findings, postoperative hospital stay or hospital stay, postoperative outcomes and complications were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 57 patients included 15 in drill and 42 in trephine group were enrolled in the study. There was significant difference in the pre- and postoperative visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores in both groups (p < 0.05). The mean operative duration in the trephine group (101.05 ± 12.18 minutes) was shorter than that in the drill group (134.67 ± 9.68 minutes) (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups in electrophysiological monitoring, posthospital stays, postoperative outcomes and complications. Abnormal free-electromyography (EMG) were recorded in 2 (13.3%) and 5 patients (11.9%) in the drill and trephine group. Intraoperative somatosensory evoked potential changes occurred in 3 (20%) and 3 patients (7.1%) in the drill and trephine group and all patients recovered immediately when surgery ended. No serious complications and recurrence occurred in all the patients.
CONCLUSION: Full-visualized trephine/osteotome has been approved to be convenient, safe and efficient in our study, which combined with translaminar inside-out technique and EMG monitoring especially free-EMG may offer a new choice in LE-ULBD surgery for lumbar stenosis patients.
