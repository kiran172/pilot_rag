Title: Latissimus dorsi myocutaneous free flap for the laryngopharyngectomy defect.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Partial or total laryngopharyngectomy defects have traditionally been reconstructed using the radial forearm, anterolateral thigh, or jejunal free flaps. The latissimus dorsi myocutaneous free flap (LDMFF) is an option for high-risk patients with complex laryngopharyngeal Â± cutaneous neck defects.
METHODS: Retrospective single-surgeon case series from 2017 to 2022. Outcomes were assessed at both the back donor site and head and neck.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were identified. Flap survival was 100%. There was 1 (4.2%) pharyngocutaneous fistula and 2 (8.3%) tracheo-esophageal peristomal fistulas. At last follow-up, 17 (71%) were sustaining weight on oral intake, and 7 (29%) were G-tube dependent with 4 of these able to do some type of oral intake. Seven (29.2%) had post-operative stricture/stenosis requiring dilation. There were only minor donor site complications, all managed conservatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The LDMFF can be a robust reconstructive option, particularly for radiated high-risk patients with complex pharyngeal defects, including skin.
