Title: Impact of Pulmonary Hypertension on Outcomes in Patients With Mitral Annular Calcium and Associated Mitral Valve Dysfunction.

Abstract: The prevalence of mitral annular calcium (MAC) is increasing in our aging population. However, data regarding prognostication in MAC-related mitral valve (MV) disease remain limited. This retrospective observational study aims to explore the prognostic impact of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) in MAC-related MV dysfunction and define its determinants. We identified 4,384 patients (mean age 78 ± 11 years and 69% female) with MAC-related MV dysfunction (documented transmitral gradient ≥3 mm Hg) from a large institutional echocardiographic database between 2001 and 2019. In Cox regression analysis, higher SPAP strongly associated with all-cause mortality, independent of cardiovascular risk factors and indices of MV dysfunction (adjusted hazard ratio 1.22 per 10 mm Hg SPAP increase, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.27). Patients with SPAP ≥50 mm Hg had significantly higher mortality compared with SPAP <50 mm Hg (log-rank p <0.001), a finding that was consistent across different transmitral gradient subgroups (≤5, 5 to 10, and ≥10 mm Hg). Independent determinants of SPAP included the mean transmitral gradient, mitral regurgitation severity, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ≥moderate aortic stenosis (adjusted p <0.05), and atrial fibrillation and left atrial dimension. The impact of concomitant mitral regurgitation on SPAP decreased at higher transmitral gradients and was no longer significant at gradients ≥10 mm Hg (p = 0.100). In conclusion, SPAP strongly associates with mortality in MAC, independent of cardiovascular risk factors and indices of MAC-related MV dysfunction. These findings suggest an incremental role for SPAP in the risk stratification and prognostication in this increasingly prevalent condition with expanding the scope of possible interventions.
