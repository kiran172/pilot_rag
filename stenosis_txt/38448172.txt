Title: [Pulmonary artery stenting in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: a report of 2 cases].

Abstract: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a pulmonary vascular disease characterized by an insidious onset, progressive deterioration, and poor prognosis. It is distinguished by the thrombotic organization within the pulmonary arteries, leading to vascular stenosis or occlusion. This results in a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, ultimately leading to right heart failure. In recent years, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has emerged as an effective treatment option for patients ineligible for pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). However, the use of stents in patients with suboptimal balloon dilation remains controversial. This article describes two cases of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) in which balloon angioplasty yielded unsatisfactory results, subsequently leading to stent placement. Following stent implantation, there was improved blood flow, significant reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure, and notable alleviation of patient symptoms. One-year follow-up showed no recurrence of stenosis within the stent, suggesting potential guidance for the use of pulmonary artery stenting as a treatment modality for CTEPH. This report provided new insights into the therapeutic approach for CTEPH.
