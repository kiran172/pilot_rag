Title: Mature teratoma of the anterior mediastinum revealed by supravalvular pulmonary stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: The mature teratoma of the mediastinum is a benign tumour made up of several adult-type tissue components which result from the abnormal development of two or three embryonic layers (ectoderm, endoderm or mesoderm). We report the case of a 31-year-old patient, admitted for management of a mediastinal tumour, revealed by a pulmonary supravalvular stenosis, symptomatic of exertional dyspnea and mid-thoracic pain. The clinical examination objectified a respiratory rate at 18 c/min and an oxygen saturation at 96% in ambient air. The chest X-ray showed a mediastinal enlargement with a left paracardiac opacity, while the echocardiac showed a supravalvular pulmonary stenosis, hence the realization of a thoracic computed tomography (CT), which objectified a voluminous anterior mediastinal cystic formation and superior lateralized on the left, with an effect of compression on the trunk of the pulmonary artery. The median sternotomy allowed the complete exeresis of this tumor and the postoperative course was simple. The mature teratoma of the anterior mediastinum should be suspected in view of these clinical and radiological signs in a young patient. Surgery with a complete resection remains the treatment of choice.
