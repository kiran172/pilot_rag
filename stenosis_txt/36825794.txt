Title: Y-shaped stenting of brachiocephalic vein in a symptomatic hemodialysis patient.

Abstract: Stenosis or obstruction of neck great veins represent a frequent and severe complication in hemodialysis patients. Endovascular treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or stenting of these veins is the gold standard to restore patency. However, the jugular vein is frequently overstented in these cases and this might lead to persistent symptomatology of those patients also losing an access for future catheter placement. Herein, we present the 6-months performance of a Y-shaped stenting of the brachiocephalic and internal jugular vein leading to complete resolution of the symptoms, and maintenance of the jugular vein access.
