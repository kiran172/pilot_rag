Title: Ascending colon stenosis caused by repeated diverticulitis that clinically mimicked advanced colon cancer: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We experienced a rare case of right-sided large bowl obstruction (LBO) of the colon caused by chronic diverticulitis, which was challenging to diagnose.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A young male was admitted to our department with a fever, diarrhea, and right-sided lateral abdominal pain for several days. CT showed a thickened ascending colon wall with stenosis and adjacent retroperitoneal inflammation without marked diverticula. The next day, he developed severe abdominal pain, and perforation was suspected. We chose the "interval definitive surgery"; at that time, intestinal decompression and laparoscopic drainage. Colonoscopy showed an edematous membrane, but no cancerous lesions or diverticula. Hemi-colectomy was performed after 10Â days' nutritional therapy. No postoperative complication occurred. The histopathology showed that the pathogenesis was chronic diverticulitis.
DISCUSSION: There have been few reported cases of right-sided LBO caused by diverticulitis, but it is important to be aware that benign disease, such as chronic diverticulitis, can cause LBO. Initial conservative therapy and nutritional therapy produced a correct diagnosis and good outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Performing "interval surgery" allowed us to make an accurate diagnosis and may help to prevent surgical complications in rare cases of right-sided LBO due to diverticulitis.
