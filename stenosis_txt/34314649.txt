Title: Compression of the Right Atrium and Inferior Vena Cava from an Extrahepatic Biloma Following Liver Trauma.

Abstract: A 26-year-old male presented to a Level 1 trauma center following a motorcycle crash. Workup of his injuries demonstrated a grade 5 liver laceration with active extravasation, grade 5 kidney laceration, right apical pneumothorax, and a sternal fracture. The patient underwent hepatic artery embolization with interventional radiology (IR) followed by an exploratory laparotomy, liver packing, and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis. Four days post-op, the patient developed dyspnea, tachycardia, and decreasing oxygen saturation. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography demonstrated perihepatic fluid compressing the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Percutaneous perihepatic drain placement with aspiration of 700Â mL bilious fluid resulted in immediate resolution of the compression. He subsequently underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stenting of the ampulla nine days later. The patient was discharged ten days post-ERCP with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for polymicrobial coverage and follow-up with gastroenterology and IR for stent removal and drain maintenance.
