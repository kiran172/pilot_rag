Title: Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in an Academic General Surgical Program: Implications for Acute Care Surgeons.

Abstract: Background. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is an important tool in the evolving specialty of acute care surgery (ACS). Understanding the types of nonelective EGDs performed by ACS groups is important for the development of ACS programs and the training of future general surgeons. Methods. We conducted a retrospective review of all EGDs performed by ACS surgeons at a single urban academic center over a 5-year period (January 2013-December 2018). Results. A total of 495 EGDs were performed, of which 129 (26%) were urgent, nonelective procedures. Patients who underwent urgent EGD were younger than those who underwent elective procedures (median 55 vs 60 years, P = .03), had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classes (median ASA 3 vs 2, P = .0002), and longer hospital stays (median 5 days vs 0 days, P &lt; .0001). The most common indications for urgent endoscopies were the management of leak, dysphagia, or stenosis in patients with a history of foregut surgery, followed by the management of esophageal perforation. The success rate of endoscopic therapy was high (median 88%, interquartile range (IQR) 78-89%). However, some patients required multiple interventions (median 1, IQR 1-3), and patients treated for leaks were less likely to be successfully treated with endoscopic therapy alone than patients treated for other indications (success rate 65% vs 88%, P = .003). Conclusions. Our experience suggests that EGD has an important role in current ACS practice and that endoscopic management is safe and effective in a range of urgent surgical scenarios. Future ACS surgeons should be facile with endoscopic techniques.
