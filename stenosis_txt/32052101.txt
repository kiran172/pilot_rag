Title: Single Center Experience in Stent-Assisted Coiling of Complex Intracranial Aneurysms Using Low-Profile Stents : The ACCLINO® Stent Versus the ACCLINO® Flex Stent.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The introduction of low-profile stent systems has broadened and facilitated the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. This retrospective case series study was conducted to assess and compare the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with complex intracranial aneurysms who were treated with ACCLINO® (AS) and ACCLINO® flex stents (AFS).
METHODS: In 85 patients (female 61; male 24) a total of 95 complex intracranial aneurysms, 71 (74.7%) in the anterior circulation and 24 (25.3%) in the posterior circulation were treated. Angiographic and clinical data, aneurysm characteristics and follow-up results were analyzed.
RESULTS: The AS was used in 47 cases (49.5%) and the AFS in 48 cases (50.5%). Initial angiography after the intervention showed a complete occlusion in 52.6% (Raymond-Roy occlusion classification [RROC] 1), a neck remnant in 38.9% (RROC 2) and an incomplete occlusion in 8.4% (RROC 3). Follow-up (AS: 25.2 ± 15.4 months; AFS: 9.6 ± 8.0 months) revealed an occlusion rate of 70.5% (RROC 1), 27.4% (RROC 2) and 2.1% (RROC 3). There was no statistically significant difference between the initial (p = 0.484) and the follow-up occlusion rate (p = 0.284) when comparing the two devices. Recoiling was performed in 8 cases (8.4%). The overall complication rate was 9.5% with 5 strokes (5.3%), 2 hemorrhages (2.1%), 1 in-stent stenosis (1.1%), 1 stent occlusion (1.1%) and 2 stent thromboses (2.1%). There was no procedure-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: Using the ACCLINO® and ACCLINO® flex stent system is a feasible and effective procedure with an acceptable safety profile. Initial and follow-up angiographic results were satisfactory.
