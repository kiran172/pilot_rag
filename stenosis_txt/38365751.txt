Title: Prognostic effect of stress hyperglycemia ratio on patients with severe aortic stenosis receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a prospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) has recently been recognized as a novel biomarker that accurately reflects acute hyperglycemia status and is associated with poor prognosis of heart failure. We evaluated the relationship between SHR and clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: There were 582 patients with severe native aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR consecutively enrolled in the study. The formula used to determine SHR was as follows: admission blood glucose (mmol/L)/(1.59×HbA<sub>1c</sub>[%]-2.59). The primary endpoint was defined as all-cause mortality, while secondary endpoints included a composite of cardiovascular mortality or readmission for heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. Multivariable Cox regression and restricted cubic spline analysis were employed to assess the relationship between SHR and endpoints, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 3.9 years, a total of 130 cases (22.3%) of all-cause mortality were recorded. Results from the restricted cubic spline analysis indicated a linear association between SHR and all endpoints (p for non-linearity > 0.05), even after adjustment for other confounding factors. Per 0.1 unit increase in SHR was associated with a 12% (adjusted HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.21) higher incidence of the primary endpoint, a 12% (adjusted HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.22) higher incidence of cardiovascular mortality or readmission for heart failure, and a 12% (adjusted HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01-1.23) higher incidence of MACE. Subgroup analysis revealed that SHR had a significant interaction with diabetes mellitus with regard to the risk of all-cause mortality (p for interaction: 0.042). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that there were significant differences in the incidence of all endpoints between the two groups with 0.944 as the optimal binary cutoff point of SHR (all log-rank test: p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates linear relationships of SHR with the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or readmission for heart failure, and MACE in patients with severe aortic stenosis receiving TAVR after a median follow-up of 3.9 years. Patients with an SHR exceeding 0.944 had a poorer prognosis compared to those with lower SHR values.
