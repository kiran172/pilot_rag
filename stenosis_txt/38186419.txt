Title: Cerebral Hyperperfusion Syndrome Presenting as Epilepsia partialis Continua Following Carotid Stenting: A Case Report.

Abstract: Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) is a rare prodrome of symptoms, including headaches, focal neurological deficits, seizures, or encephalopathy. Herein, we report a unique case of focal motor status epilepticus (Epilepsia partialis continua [EPC]). A 76-year-old male underwent right carotid stenting (CAS) for symptomatic high-grade stenosis. Immediately post-operation, he was recovering well without neurologic deficits; however, four days later, his blood pressure increased, and he experienced focal motor seizures involving the left arm and face without impaired awareness. He was managed with antihypertensive and antiseizure medications. Subsequently, his respiratory function worsened, necessitating intubation for status epilepticus. Repeated imaging demonstrated only the previously known infarcts without cerebral edema, bilaterally patent carotid arteries or any signs of acute infarct or intracerebral hemorrhage.  While CHS is a rare syndrome with well-documented symptomatology, focal motor status epilepticus can occur abruptly without the more typical CHS symptoms, despite the best preventive measures.
