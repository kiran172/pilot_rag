Title: Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Transmural Biliary Drainage With 6 mm and 8 mm Cautery-enhanced Lumen-apposing Metal Stents: A Multicenter Collaborative Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be unsuccessful in patients with duodenal stenosis or malignant ampullary infiltration. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) has been proposed as an alternative. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of EUS-BD for malignant distal bile duct obstruction using the newly introduced smaller caliber 6 or 8 mm cautery-enhanced lumen-apposing metal stent.
METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was performed on patients with unresectable malignant distal bile duct obstruction who underwent EUS-BD between 2021 and 2022 after unsuccessful ERCP.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included [7 (53.13%) males], with a mean age of 72.2 ± 12.5 years. The technical success rate was 100%. Altered anatomy was present in 2 (6.25%). The indication for drainage was biliary obstruction from pancreatic cancer in 26 patients (84.5%), cholangiocarcinoma in 3 (9.4%), and ampullary mass in 3 (9.4%). The procedure was performed mostly in an outpatient setting (n = 19, 59.38%). The clinical success rate was 92.3% [bilirubin: 14.1 (SD: 8.9) preprocedure vs 4.9 (SD: 1.1) postprocedure; P = 0.0001]. There was one early adverse event of a perforation, which was closed endoscopically and drained percutaneously. Delayed adverse events included food impaction of the stent (n = 1), which was resolved with a repeat procedure and insertion of a double pigtail stent.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of EUS-BD drainage using smaller caliber 6 or 8 mm lumen-apposing metal stent to relieve malignant distal bile duct obstruction in patients who fail conventional ERCP.
