Title: Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene D-allele and the severity of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the first cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. An important goal is to diagnose patients in early stages, in order to reduce acute cardiovascular events. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an important element for the cardiovascular system, through its actions on hydro-salin balance and vascular tone. ACE polymorphism consists of insertions (I)/deletions (D) and there are 3 genotypes: II, ID, DD. It is speculated that the DD genotype may be a genetic basis for severe CAD, while the II genotype may have a protective effect on the coronary arteries. The present study included 154 patients with acute coronary syndroms admitted to the Institute for Cardiovascular Disease 'George I.M. Georgescu', Iasi. The patients underwent coronary angiography in order to assess the severity of the lesions and the ACE genotypes were determined for each patient. The genotypes were correlated with the severity of the vessel-disease and the exposure to classic risk factors. It was concluded that the D-allele is associated with a greater risk for acute coronary events and severe coronary stenosis, especially when risk genotype and risk phenotype interact.
