Title: An unusual presentation of a rare formation of the common hepatic duct and right hepatic artery in a case of pediatric congenital biliary dilatation.

Abstract: A 15-year-old girl with recurrent upper abdominal pain was diagnosed with congenital biliary dilatation. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed the anterior segmental branch of the right hepatic artery (RHA) running across the ventral aspect of the dilated common hepatic duct (CHD). Laparoscopic extrahepatic dilated biliary duct excision and Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy were planned. Intraoperatively, the dilated CHD was observed to bifurcate into the ventral and dorsal ducts, between which the anterior segmental branch of the RHA crossed through the CHD. The CHD rejoined on the distal side as one duct. We transected the CHD just above the cystic duct. The patency of the ventral and dorsal sides of the bifurcated CHD was confirmed. Laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy was performed at the distal side of the rejoined CHD, without sacrificing the anterior segmental branch of the RHA. There was no postoperative blood flow impairment in the right hepatic lobe or anastomotic stenosis.
