Title: Renal function and outcomes in TAVR patients: Complexity in real world.

Abstract: Renal dysfunction is a relevant medical issue for patients undergoing TAVR. Chronic kidney disease and postprocedural acute kidney injury are independent predictors of worse outcome after TAVR procedure. Meticulous preprocedural planning and multidisciplinary heart-team management could mitigate renal damage.
