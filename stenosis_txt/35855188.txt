Title: Successful multiple burr hole openings for limb-shaking transient ischemic attack due to moyamoya disease: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Limb-shaking transient ischemic attacks (LS-TIAs) are a rare form of TIAs that present as involuntary movements of the limbs and indicate severe cerebral hypoperfusion. LS-TIAs are often reported in patients with carotid artery stenosis but can also affect patients with intracranial artery stenosis and moyamoya disease (MMD).
OBSERVATIONS: A 72-year-old woman presented with repeated episodes of involuntary shaking movements of the right upper limb. Cerebral angiography revealed complete occlusion of the M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA), and the left hemisphere was supplied by moyamoya vessels. She was treated with left direct revascularization without complications, and her involuntary movements subsided. However, she demonstrated involuntary shaking movements of the right lower limb 2 months postoperatively. Cerebral angiography revealed complete occlusion of the A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The multiple burr hole opening (MBHO) procedure was performed to improve perfusion in the left ACA territory and after 3 months, the patient's symptoms resolved.
LESSONS: This case demonstrated that LS-TIAs can also develop as ischemic symptoms due to MMD. Moreover, instances of LS-TIA of the upper and lower limbs developed separately in the same patient. The patient's symptoms improved with direct revascularization and MBHO.
