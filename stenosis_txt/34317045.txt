Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a Patient With Levo-Transposition of the Great Arteries.

Abstract: Levo-transposition of the great arteries is a congenital heart disease characterized by atrioventricular and ventricular-arterial discordance. Aortic valve disease in levo-transposition of the great arteries patients is uncommon. We present a patient with levo-transposition of the great arteries and severe aortic stenosis who successfully underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement and the diagnostic and procedural challenges involved. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
