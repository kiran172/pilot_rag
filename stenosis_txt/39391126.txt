Title: Superior Mesenteric Artery Stenosis With Dissection Secondary to Fibromuscular Dysplasia: A Case Report.

Abstract: Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) stenosis increases with advancing age and is usually associated with atherosclerosis or thrombosis. Mesenteric ischemia occurs when the blood flow to the visceral organs is inadequate to meet their metabolic needs. While it can be asymptomatic, the patient can experience chronic or acute mesenteric ischemia symptoms. Although not frequently encountered, Superior Mesenteric Artery stenosis can be rarely caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Here we report a case of a 66-year-old female with SMA stenosis and subsequent mesenteric ischemia secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia. The main objective of this case report is to raise awareness about the occurrence of mesenteric ischemia from FMD due to a limited understanding of its risk factors and etiology.
