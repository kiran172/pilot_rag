Title: Aortic aneurysm lesions in Echinococcus infection. A review of cases in literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Parasitic infections are common in developing countries, due to poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene. Undiagnosed and untreated parasitic infections can have severe acute and chronic consequences, including cardiovascular lesions. Aortic aneurysms have been described in patients with disease of parasitological interest, including hydatidosis.
AIM AND METHODS: We have described, through a review of case reports in literature, the occurrence of aortic aneurysm in patients with hydatidosis, analysing the specific clinical features, peculiarities of vascular involvement, treatment and outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 9 case reports has been included. Mean age of patients was 41.7 ± 12.2 years (range 12-54). Vascular pathology presentation was chronic in the majority of cases, acute in three and subacute in one. The majority of lesions occurred in the descending thoracic aorta; one case involved the ascending aorta and arch, one the abdominal aorta. Open surgical intervention was reported in the majority of cases, endovascular treatment in two. Complications, reported twice at follow up, included one endograft stenosis and, in two cases, vertebral erosion. No deaths were reported.
CONCLUSION: Aortic aneurysms can occur in patients with hydatidosis. The surgical vascular treatment of this non communicable complication of a disease of parasitological interest needs to take into account the specific clinical and surgical context in which occurs, to better target pharmacological and surgical treatment.
