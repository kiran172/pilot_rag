Title: Patient-specific hemodynamic analysis of IVCS-induced DVT.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to perform patient-specific hemodynamic simulations of patients with iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS) and evaluate the deep venous thrombosis (DVT) potential, with clinical observations as reference. 15 patient-specific IVCS models were reconstructed from computed tomography venography (CTV) data, and divided into three groups, i.e. two groups with thrombosis: Group A (complete obstruction) and Group B (incomplete obstruction), and a third group without DVT, Group C. Hemodynamic simulations were conducted with patient-specific inlet flow rates. The blood residue was predicted using the blood stasis model. Time histories of old blood volume fraction (OBVF) was obtained, in addition to conventional hemodynamic parameters such as wall shear stress (WSS). The mean area-averaged WSS of the stenosis region for Group A and Group B were 3.68 Pa and 1.78 Pa, respectively. For the telecentric end region, the WSS were 0.76 Pa and 0.58 Pa, respectively. For Group C, the WSS at these two regions were 4.61 Pa and 1.57 Pa, respectively. The OBVF was 74.0% at the stenosis region and 76.2% at the telecentric end region for Group A, much higher than 4.8% and 43.1% of Group B. For Group C, the OBVF at the two regions were close to 0. This corresponded well with clinical observations. The potential of DVT can be predicted through patient-specific hemodynamic simulations in combination of blood stasis model. The findings of this study are of great significance for the preoperative evaluation and treatment prognosis of IVCS patients with DVT.
