Title: [Delayed coronary obstruction of the left main artery after transcatheter aortic valve replacement].

Abstract: Coronary arteries obstruction associated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may occur either during the procedure or after it. In the latter coronary obstruction can be further divided into early (7 days after procedure) or delayed one (7 days). Delayed coronary obstruction (DCO) is referred as a rare but devastating complication after TAVI and is associated with the extremely high mortality. This case demonstrates the objective difficulties of timely diagnostics of DCO. Since the results of non-invasive methods are indetermined in most cases, the authors conclude that even low-specific clinical symptoms must be interpreted as the definite rationale for the implementation of invasive diagnostic and treatment strategy.
