Title: Prolonged pulmonary pulse transit time is associated with symptoms in patients with significant mitral stenosis and sinus rhythm.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary pulse transit time (pPTT) is a novel noninvasive echocardiographic measure to assess pulmonary arterial hemodynamics. It has been shown to be shorter in precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PHT). Mitral stenosis (MS) is one of the causes of postcapillary PHT. We aimed to investigate pPTT in patients with MS and its relationship with symptoms.
METHODS: We included 51 patients with MS (25 were asymptomatic, NYHA I, and 26 were symptomatic, NHYA II or III), and 50 controls, and evaluated their demographic characteristics and echocardiographic variables, including pPTT.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index, and cardiovascular risk factors, were similar between the MS and the control group. The pPTT was longer in the MS group than in the control group (0.21 ± 0.08 vs 0.15 ± 0.05, P < .001). Patients with symptomatic MS had longer pPTT than asymptomatic patients (P = .005). The pPTT was positively correlated with left atrial volume index and systolic pulmonary artery pressure, and negatively with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (r = .432; P < .001, r = .319; P = .001, r = -.293; and P = .003, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The measurement of pPTT appears clinically relevant in patients with PHT. Further studies evaluating whether it is useful in distinguishing precapillary from postcapillary PHT are required.
