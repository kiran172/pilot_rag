Title: Cervical laminoplasty: indication, technique, complications.

Abstract: Cervical laminoplasty is a non-fusion, decompression procedure for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). It is most commonly indicated for patients with multilevel stenosis who have preserved sagittal alignment and minimal to no axial neck pain related to spondylosis. Expansion of the laminar arch can allow for direct and indirect decompression of the spinal canal. Relative contraindications include those patients with significant preoperative neck pain, kyphotic alignment and substantial instability. Potential advantages over laminectomy and fusion include avoiding fusion-related complications, and the preservation of motion. Important technical considerations include meticulous extensor muscle management, with special attention being given to preserving the soft tissue attachments to C2. In the properly selected patient, outcomes are comparable, and in some studies superior, to other operations for CSM.
