Title: Pulmonary Vein Stenosis After Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation Using a Cryoballoon, Hot Balloon, or Laser Balloon.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) after PV isolation (PVI) for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a severe complication that requires angioplasty. This study aimed to compare the reduction of the cross-sectional PV area (PVA) and the incidence of PVS after cryoballoon (CB)-PVI, hot balloon (HB)-PVI, or laser balloon (LB)-PVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 320 patients who underwent an initial catheter ablation procedure for AF using a CB, HB, or LB in 2 hospitals were included. They underwent contrast-enhanced multidetector CT before and 3 months after the procedure. In all 4 PVs, the reduction in PVA was more significant in the LB group than in the CB or HB groups, respectively. Moderate (50-75%) and severe (>75%) PVS were observed in 5.3% and 0.5% of the PVs, respectively. Although moderate PVS was more frequently observed in the LB group than in the CB or HB groups (8.2%, 3.8%, and 5.0%; P=0.03), the incidence of severe PVS was similar in the LB, CB, and HB groups (0.3%, 0.5%, and 1.0%; P=0.46). Symptomatic PVS requiring intervention occurred in 1 (0.3%) patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the reduction in cross-sectional PVA and the incidence of moderate PVS after LB-PVI was more significant than after CB-PVI or HB-PVI, it rarely led to severe PVS. Symptomatic PVS requiring intervention was rare after the balloon ablation of AF.
