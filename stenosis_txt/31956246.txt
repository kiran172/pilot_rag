Title: [Functional Mitral Stenosis after Mitral Valve Repair for Degenerative Mitral Valve Regurgitation].

Abstract: Functional mitral stenosis after mitral valve repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation( DMR) is an evolving concept. Mitral annuloplasty devices stabilize the mitral annulus, reduce leaflet stress and increase leaflet coaptation, which leads to improvement of repair durability at the cost of dynamic and physiological annular movement and diastolic annular area. An elevation in rest and peak transmitral gradient has been observed in some patients with annuloplasty devices, and this elevation may associate with worse prognosis as late atrial fibrillation or lower functional capacity after surgery. In this review, we summarize the current reports describing functional mitral stenosis after mitral valve repair for DMR.
