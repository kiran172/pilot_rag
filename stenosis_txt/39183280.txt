Title: SIRT6 prevent chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced cognitive impairment by remodeling mitochondrial dynamics in a STAT5-PGAM5-Drp1 dependent manner.

Abstract: Vascular dementia (VaD) is a prevalent form of dementia resulting from chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). However, the pathogenic mechanisms of VaD and corresponding therapeutic strategies are not well understood. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) has been implicated in various biological processes, including cellular metabolism, DNA repair, redox homeostasis, and aging. Nevertheless, its functional relevance in VaD remains unexplored. In this study, we utilized a bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model of VaD to investigate the role of SIRT6. We detected a significant decrease in neuronal SIRT6 protein expression following CCH. Intriguingly, neuron-specific ablation of Sirt6 in mice exacerbated neuronal damage and cognitive deficits after CCH. Conversely, treatment with MDL-800, an agonist of SIRT6, effectively mitigated neuronal loss and facilitated neurological recovery. Mechanistically, SIRT6 inhibited excessive mitochondrial fission by suppressing the CCH-induced STAT5-PGAM5-Drp1 signaling cascade. Additionally, the gene expression of monocyte SIRT6 in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis showed a correlation with cognitive outcomes, suggesting translational implications in human subjects. Our findings provide the first evidence that SIRT6 prevents cognitive impairment induced by CCH, and mechanistically, this protection is achieved through the remodeling of mitochondrial dynamics in a STAT5-PGAM5-Drp1-dependent manner.
