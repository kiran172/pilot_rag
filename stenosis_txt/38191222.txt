Title: Dural arteriovenous fistula embolisation with venous remodelling following venous sinus stenting.

Abstract: We report a case of the formation of a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) of the transverse-sigmoid sinus following venous sinus stenting (VSS), treated with trans-arterial embolisation and venous remodelling. An obese woman in her 30s presented with persistent daily headaches after undergoing endoscopic repair of a skull base cerebrospinal fluid leak. Angiography demonstrated a focal right transverse-sigmoid sinus stenosis, and she underwent VSS of the right transverse sinus. She developed progressive pulsatile tinnitus within 3 months, and angiography demonstrated the formation of a Borden type 1 dAVF along the stent. Trans-arterial embolisation of the dAVF was performed with venous remodelling using a Copernic RC balloon. While VSS has become a promising treatment for venous sinus stenosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, dAVF formation is a rare but significant potential complication. Embolisation with venous remodelling can be performed to treat these lesions.
