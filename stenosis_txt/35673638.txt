Title: Carotid endarterectomy with stent removal for recurring in-stent restenosis: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transcatheter angioplasty (PTA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) are often performed repeatedly for in-stent restenosis (ISR) after CAS. Only a few reports describe the treatment for repeated ISR. Furthermore, only a few reports describe carotid endarterectomy (CEA) after CAS; thus, the evidence for this procedure is insufficient.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein, we describe a case in which CEA with stent removal was performed in a patient with repeated ISR after CAS. A 78-year-old man presented with dysarthria and slight left limb weakness. CAS was performed for the right internal carotid artery stenosis. ISR occurred again and PTA and stenting were performed. After the second CAS, ISR occurred again. CEA with stent removal was performed. After the CEA with stent removal, the patient experienced no restenosis or other complications.
CONCLUSION: CEA with stent removal can be a good option for treating repeated ISR after CAS.
