Title: Unilateral biportal endoscopic decompression for degenerative lumbar canal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) decompression is a minimally invasive (MI) approach to treat degenerative lumbar canal stenosis (DLCS). Decompression can be performed in a clear and magnified surgical field with proper control of normal saline inflow and outflow.
METHODS: Clinical and radiographic data of 81 consecutive patients of DLCS treated between July 2018 and Feb 2019 using UBE techniques were reviewed. They were 38 males and 43 females with an average age of 70.2. Sixty-nine had pure canal stenosis and 12 patients had associated spondylolisthesis. Bilateral decompression via unilateral laminotomy was performed from the side on patients with more severe neurological symptoms. This is a retrospective study from chart review and image analysis. Therefore, we don't have formal ethical information for this study, and it is not mandatory in our hospital.
RESULTS: At the final follow-up, the mean VAS for low back pain was improved from 4.3±3.0 to 1.2±1.0 and the VAS for leg symptoms was improved from 7.3±2.2 to 0.9±0.7. The mean JOA score and ODI was significantly improved from 13.3±7.9 to 25.3±5.0 and from 54.6±16.9 to 14.6±12.6, respectively. Modified Macnab criteria were excellent in 47 patients (58.0%), good in 29 (35.8%), fair in 5 (6.2%). The average hospital stay was 3.6±2.4 days. MRI before and after the operation showed the cross-sectional dural area (CSDA) was significantly increased from 71.4±36.5 to 177.3±59.2 mm2, corresponding to a 201.9%±188.0% increase. The percentage of facet joint preservation was 84.2% on the approach side and 92.9% on the contralateral side. Complications included 4 dural tears, 1 transient motor weakness, 1 inadequate decompression, and 1 epidural hematoma.
CONCLUSIONS: With UBE techniques, decompression for DLCS can be performed safely and effectively. The soft tissue and facet joint destruction are minimized; therefore, it is possible to avoid spinal fusion as well as to preserve the segmental stability.
