Title: Transcarotid Revascularization Associated Extended Reverse Flow Duration is Not a Harbinger of Poor Perioperative Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcarotid revascularization (TCAR) is a carotid stenting technique in which an external shunt between the common carotid artery and femoral vein is created to induce cerebral flow reversal as protection against procedure-related plaque embolism. We completed this analysis to determine if prolonged cerebral flow reversal was associated with adverse perioperative outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a combined carotid revascularization database separately maintained at 2 high-volume TCAR health systems was completed. Procedures with captured intraoperative reverse flow duration was included, stratified into two cohorts at a cut-off of 8 mi, and examined with univariate analysis.
RESULTS: Within the predesignated study period, 800 patients received a carotid stent via the TCAR technique at Indiana University Health (n = 350) and Memorial Hermann Health Systems (n = 450). In 132 of these procedures, the duration of reverse flow time was not captured and, therefore, excluded from further analysis. Using our prespecified cutoff for extended reverse flow duration (ERFD), we generated 256 cases, leaving an additional 412 procedures completed with a short reverse flow duration. Baseline comorbidities were comparable with respect to individual diagnoses but the overall disease burden in ERFD patients was slightly higher by Charlson Comorbidity Index (5.3 ± 0.1 vs. 5.7 ± 0.1, P = 0.02). With respect to indications and high anatomic risk criteria, both groups were similar, with exception of the presence of a surgically inaccessible carotid bifurcation, which was more frequent in the ERFD procedures (5.3% vs. 10.2%, P = 0.02). Intraoperatively, more blood loss (40.9 ± 2.2 vs. 48.9 ± 2.9 mLs, P = 0.03), operative time (55.2 ± 0.8 vs. 76.3 ± 1.6 min, P < 0.01), radiation (126.3 ± 17.5 vs. 281.9 ± 28.5 mGys, P < 0.01), contrast volume (19.9 ± 0.4 vs. 26.9 ± 0.9 mLs, P < 0.01), and fluoroscopy time (3.3 ± 0.8 vs. 6.3 ± 0.3 min, P < 0.01) were noted in the patients with extended flow reversal. However, this did not increase the risk of stroke (2.7% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.61), myocardial infarction (0.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.53), or death (1.2% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.41) in the 30-day perioperative period.
CONCLUSIONS: Extended cerebral flow reversal, defined here as greater than 8 min, was not associated with increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death in this institutionally derived series.
