Title: Successful complex percutaneous intervention in patient with Fontan circulation and severe heart failure: A case report.

Abstract: We report the case of a successful complex percutaneous intervention in a patient with Fontan circulation and severe heart failure. The patient presented with cyanosis; Fontan conduit stenosis was detected, and the fenestration was patent. The complex interventional procedure allowed for a long-term stabilization of the patient's condition.
