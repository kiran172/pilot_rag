Title: Long-term follow-up of adventitial cyst surgical excision in external iliac vein.

Abstract: Adventitial cystic disease of the venous system is an extremely rare condition. Forty-five cases have been described in the literature during the last 70Â years, but they may not be representative of the real incidence of this pathologic process. We report a case of an adventitial cyst compressing the right external iliac vein and presenting with edema of the ipsilateral leg. Ultrasound imaging and computed tomography angiography showed the typical features of cystic disease and venous stenosis. Cyst excision was performed with a double surgical access. No perioperative complications were reported. There was no recurrence at 4-year follow-up.
