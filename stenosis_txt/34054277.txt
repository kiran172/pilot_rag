Title: Free-Floating Thrombus in the Distal Internal Carotid Artery Causing a Stroke.

Abstract: We present a patient suffering from a stroke with a free-floating thrombus extending up to the distal internal carotid artery. The thrombus was totally resolved after a 2-week anticoagulation regimen without leaving behind any severe residual stenosis in the carotid bulb. The optimal treatment of this rare condition remains uncertain. We report some important treatment strategies that have been used in the literature, emphasizing the anticoagulation as the mainstay of therapy. Immediate surgical and interventional manipulations carry the risk of thrombus dislodgement and embolization and should be considered if there are recurrent symptoms despite medical management.
