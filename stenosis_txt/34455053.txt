Title: An Uncommon Variant of Nutcracker Syndrome Secondary to Left Renal Vein Compression Between the Right Renal Artery and The Proper Hepatic Artery.

Abstract: Nutcracker syndrome refers to the compression of the left renal vein between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. The subsequent venous congestion of the left kidney, when symptomatic, could be associated with left flank pain, hematuria, varicocele, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and proteinuria. Here we describe a 42-year-old female patient with simultaneous Dunbar syndrome and a rare variant of nutcracker syndrome in which the left renal vein (LRV) compression is secondary to the unusual path of the vein between the right renal artery and the proper hepatic artery. For both the nutcracker syndrome and the Dunbar syndrome, open approach by median mini-laparotomic access for transposition of LRV, and resection of the diaphragmatic pillars and arcuate ligament was attempted. During the intervention, due to anatomical issues, the LRV transposition was converted to endovascular stenting of the LRV, moreover the implanted stent was transfixed with an external non-absorbable suture to avoid migration. At the 12 months follow-up the patient was asymptomatic, and the duplex scan confirmed the patency of the celiac trunk without re-stenosis and a correct position of the LRV stent with no proximal or distal migration.
