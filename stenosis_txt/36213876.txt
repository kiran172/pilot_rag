Title: Pulmonary Vein Occlusion After Surgical Atrial Fibrillation Ablation and Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion.

Abstract: We report a case of pulmonary vein (PV) occlusion in a patient with a history of surgical atrial fibrillation ablation and left atrial appendage occlusion with unsuccessful endovascular management. Delayed diagnosis of PV stenosis post-ablation can make interventional treatment options less likely to be successful. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
