Title: String-like mobile echodensities on postoperative ultrasound after CEA: A retrospective observational study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: String-like mobile echodensities (SLMEs) are sometimes found on postoperative duplex ultrasound (DUS) performed after carotid endarterectomy (CEA); however, they may not be visible on intraoperative DUS. The reasons for these echo findings and associated clinical course remain unknown.
METHODS: Routine postoperative DUS evaluation after CEA was retrospectively examined in 101 consecutive patients (107 lesions) who underwent CEA between April 2015 and December 2021, at our institution.
RESULTS: Ten SLMEs were identified in eight patients. All SLMEs were 1-3Â mm long, mobile, and extended straight from the intima-media complex of the wall of the common carotid artery or carotid bulb. Most lesions resolved spontaneously; a few lesions were observed repeatedly, albeit not causing cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attacks.
CONCLUSIONS: SLMEs can be observed in a small percentage of patients after CEA, and they do not seem to be of clinical significance.
