Title: [Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreatobiliary strictures].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To improve the outcomes in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice using intraluminal stenting.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study included 62 patients with clinical symptoms of malignant obstructive jaundice. In the main group, we performed biliary stenting with self-expanding multi-perforated stents (Hanarostent Multi-hole Biliary). Microscopic perforations of these stents prevent migration and reduce the risk of blocking the cystic and main pancreatic ducts. In the control group, stenting was performed with fully and partially covered self-expanding stents.
RESULTS: Lower incidence of obstructive cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis in the main group was associated with multiperforated stents reducing the risk of blocking the main pancreatic and cystic ducts.
CONCLUSION: In our study, multiperforated stents excluded migration and reduced the incidence of complications (acute cholecystitis from 11.5 to 3.8%, acute pancreatitis from 15.3 to 7.7%).
