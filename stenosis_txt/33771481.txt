Title: Utility of Cerebral Embolic Protection in Non-TAVR Transcatheter Procedures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular events that occur during structural and interventional procedures are a well known risk which is associated with increased mortality. The FDA has approved the use of the Sentinel device in TAVR. Hereby we report on our experience on the safety and efficacy of using Sentinel in a patient population undergoing non-TAVR transcatheter procedures.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a single center experience with using the Sentinel device for non-TAVR transcatheter procedures.
RESULTS: We identified 33 patients (average age was 73.8Â years, 36.7% females, and 30% with history of a prior stroke) felt to be at high risk for cerebroembolic events that underwent Sentinel device placement. Sentinel placement was successful in all patients. Examples of high risk features included high atheroma burden in the aortic arch, left sided valve vegetations, intra-cardiac thrombi and severe left sided valve calcifications/thrombi. No patients developed periprocedural stroke or vascular complications.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the use of Sentinel for non-TAVR indications appears feasible and safe. The use of cerebral protection devices should be studied further in non-TAVR patients to establish its role and its benefits, especially with expanding the number of non-TAVR transcatheter interventions.
