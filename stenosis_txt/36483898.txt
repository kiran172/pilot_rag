Title: Spinal Lymphoma Presenting as an Epidural and Retropleural Mass With Concomitant Pathologic Compression Fracture: A Case Report.

Abstract: Lymphoma has traditionally earned the nickname "the great mimicker". Its presentation as a primary spinal tumor is rare, and therefore seldom included in the differential diagnosis. However, its mimicking nature and diverse presentation make it very difficult to exclude entirely. Here, we present an elderly patient with histology-confirmed spinal lymphoma presenting as both an epidural mass with transforaminal extension into the retropleural space as well as vertebral body compression fracture, together leading to severe spinal stenosis and compressive myelopathy. Additional non-malignant compression fractures found in our patient allow for an interesting discussion on disease presentation and imaging-based diagnosis. We discuss our approach to diagnosis, surgical treatment, and post-operative medical care.
