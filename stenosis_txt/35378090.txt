Title: Pulmonary Valve Reconstruction Using Autologous Pericardium: A Promising Technique to Consider.

Abstract: Pulmonary valve (PV) surgical treatment is uncommon in adults; however, when it is indicated, replacement with a prosthesis is suggested. Nevertheless, mechanical prostheses have an inherent risk of complications derived from anticoagulation and thrombosis, and biologic prostheses do not have adequate long-term durability. In this context, PV reconstruction surgery emerges as an alternative, avoiding anticoagulation and promising good durability. We present our experience with this procedure in 3 patients with severe PV insufficiency and 1 patient with severe PV stenosis.
