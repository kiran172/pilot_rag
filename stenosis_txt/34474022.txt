Title: Novel Technique for Fixing Tracheal Stents.

Abstract: Endoscopic management of benign or malignant airway obstructions sometimes requires stenting after dilatation or debulking of the tumor. Straight stents are highly prone to migration in the trachea and the main bronchus, with potential catastrophic consequences. Multiple fixation strategies have been described to secure subglottic stents, each having certain limitations. This report describes a novel, "inside-to-outside" stent fixation in the upper airway using the Lichtenberger needle carrier in 2 consecutive patients.
