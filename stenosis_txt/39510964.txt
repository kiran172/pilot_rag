Title: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism attenuates arteriovenous fistula stenosis by modulating the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fistula stenosis is a primary contributor to arteriovenous fistula (AVF) failure in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Emerging data indicated excessive fibrotic remodeling was the primarily contributor to fistula stenosis during AVF remodeling. The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) has been implicated in vascular remodeling across various cardiovascular pathologies. However, its role in AVF remodeling, particularly concerning fibrotic remodeling, remains elusive.
METHODS: MR expression and the phenotypes of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were assessed in dysfunctional AVF. The effects of MR on VSMC phenotypic switching were examined in vitro, and the protective effects of MR antagonists on AVF outcome were evaluated in a rat AVF model.
RESULTS: Dysfunctional fistula exhibited significant medial fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition, alongside markedly increased MR activity. In the dysfunctional fistula vessels, VSMC displayed reduced expression of the contractile marker SMMHC and featured characteristic of a synthetic phenotype, including increased osteopontin expression and heightened proliferation. In vitro studies with cultured VSMC revealed that MR overactivity induced by aldosterone led to phenotypic switching from contractile to synthetic state, concomitant with EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway overactivation. These effects were largely abolished by the MR antagonist fineronone. Knockdown of EGFR expression abrogated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and inhibited the VSMC phenotypic switching. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of EGFR in VSMC diminished the protective effect of finerenone. In rat AVF models, pharmacologic targeting of MR with finerenone significantly improved AVF outcomes, characterized by increased luminal diameters and flow volume, reduced medial fibrosis, and inhibited VSMC phenotypic switching. These beneficial outcomes were likely attributable to a restrained activity of EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway in VSMC and elevated NO production in endothelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that therapeutic targeting of MR may improve AVF outcome by modulating VSMC phenotypic switching. These findings offer promising avenues for further clinical investigations aimed at optimizing AVF outcomes in the hemodialysis population.
