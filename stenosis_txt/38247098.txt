Title: [A Case of Meningeal Carcinomatosis following Esophagogastric Junction Cancer Surgery].

Abstract: In a 79-year-old man, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and CT revealed an entire circumferential type 3 tumor with stenosis from the lower thoracic esophagus to the abdominal esophagus. He was diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma and underwent middle and lower esophageal resection and 2 regional lymph node dissections. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, pT3N0M0, pStage ⅡA esophagogastric junction cancer(Siewert type Ⅱ). The patient was followed-up without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, following the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines 2021(6th edition). Six months postoperatively, contrast-enhanced CT revealed multiple lymph node, small intestinal mesenteric, and left adrenal metastases, and SOX therapy was initiated. After 4 courses of SOX therapy, the patient was brought to the emergency room and admitted with anorexia and weakness, and consciousness disorder was observed on the next day. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the head was indicative of meningeal carcinomatosis, and cytological examination of the spinal fluid revealed adenocarcinoma, which was diagnosed as meningeal carcinomatosis from esophagogastric junction carcinoma. Subsequently, his consciousness disorder worsened, and he died on the 9th day of hospitalization. We report a rare case of meningeal carcinomatosis following esophagogastric junction cancer.
