Title: Lobar Lung Transplantation: A Single-Center 10-Year Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The shortage of donors for lung transplants is the main limitation of the preceding. Lobar transplantation is an alternative especially useful in patients with short stature and small thoracic cavities. The aim of this study was to perform a descriptive analysis of Portuguese patients who underwent lobar lung transplantation.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted, and patients submitted to lobar lung transplantation from January 2012 to December 2023 were evaluated. A descriptive analysis was made, including demographic data, lung diseases, waiting list dynamics, pre-transplant evaluations, and post-transplant outcomes.
RESULTS: Sixteen lobar transplants were performed with a predominance of female patients and a median age of 47 years. Most patients had interstitial lung disease or bronchiectasis either due to cystic fibrosis or non-cystic fibrosis. The median predicted total lung capacity (pTLC) ratio was 0.73. The median waiting list time was 6 months with 9 urgent transplants and 1 emergent lobar retransplant. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used in pre-, intra-, and postoperative periods. Most transplanted lobes were the median lobe (ML) + right upper lobe (RUL) and left upper lobe (LUL). The median length of stay was 58 days, with complications such as PDG grade 3, bronchial tree ischemia, and concentrical stenosis of bronchial anastomosis. Six patients died in this period, 1 in the immediate postoperative period and 5 during the post-transplant hospitalization, with a median survival of 20.7 months and a 1-year and 5-year survival rate of 60%.
CONCLUSION: Our results show a population with an increased waiting list converging in many urgent cases, with an early mortality and high primary graft dysfunction rate. Nevertheless, mid- and long-term survival are promising.
