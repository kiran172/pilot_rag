Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy for Acute Stent Under-Expansion and In-Stent Restenosis: A Case Series.

Abstract: Coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) has an incidence of about 10% of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) performed in the United States. Traditional management strategies for ISR include balloon angioplasty with non-compliant or use of cutting/scoring balloons or atheroablative therapies (like laser and rotational atherectomy), all of which are inherently limited in their ability to treat stent under-expansion or calcification around the stent. Shockwave intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has recently demonstrated safe and efficacious treatment of severely calcified coronary stenoses with reported cases of treating ISR as an off-label use. In this case series, we describe the successful use of IVL for 6 cases of ISR and 1 case of stent under-expansion using 40-80 IVL pulses per lesion. Angiographic success was obtained in all seven patients, and there were no intra-procedural complications or adverse cardiac events at a mean follow-up of 200 days. Our report indicates that IVL can be safely and effectively used to treat ISR and stent under-expansion.
