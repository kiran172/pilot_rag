Title: Anesthetic management of tracheal stent extraction using a double gum elastic bougie technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheal stenosis is a life-threatening condition, and management of a patient with a risk of tracheal stenosis is challenging for anesthesiologists. In this report, we describe a method for airway management using two gum elastic bougie method when removing a tracheal stent via a tracheostomy orifice with a risk of airway restenosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old man had an enlarged squamous cell carcinoma of the lung invading the upper mediastinum that had caused severe stenosis of the trachea. Two months after diagnosis, a tracheal stent had been placed to maintain tracheal patency. One month after stent placement, acute respiratory failure was induced by upper airway obstruction caused by subglottic airway edema due to mechanical stimulation of the cranial end of the stent, and the patient was rescued by oral tracheal intubation. Tracheal stent extraction was scheduled to relieve the laryngeal edema. Since there was a risk of tracheal restenosis because of the possibility of accidental evulsion of the orally tracheal tube which intubated to secure an emergency airway and tracheal stent extraction, two gum elastic bougies were inserted through the oral tracheal tube and tracheostomy orifice to facilitate re-intubation. After extraction of the tracheal stent, airway openness was maintained and tracheostomy was completed without any complication.
CONCLUSION: Successful management of tracheal stent extraction was performed using a double gum elastic bougie technique.
