Title: Endovascular Aortic Repair for Heavily Calcified Abdominal Aortic Stenosis Using the Gore Viabahn Vbx Balloon-Expandable Covered Stent.

Abstract: Open surgery for the treatment of focal infrarenal aortic stenosis in high-risk patients may result in complications and mortality. Endovascular aortic repair may be used to treat these lesions. Here, we present the case of a 78-year-old woman with severe, highly calcified stenosis of the infrarenal abdominal aorta, which was successfully treated with the GORE VIABAHN VBX (Gore Medical; Flagstaff, AZ) balloon-expandable covered stent. Long-term and randomized controlled studies comparing open surgery with EVAR are necessary to evaluate the usefulness of this novel device.
