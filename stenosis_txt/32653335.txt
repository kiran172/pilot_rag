Title: Deep endometriosis: The place of laparoscopic shaving.

Abstract: Deep endometriosis (DE) is considered to be one of the most challenging conditions to manage, especially when it invades surrounding organs like the rectum. Surgical excision of deep rectovaginal endometriosis is required when lesions are symptomatic, impairing bowel, urinary, sexual, and reproductive functions, or if they evolve. Preoperative radiological examination should be extensive to determine the appropriate surgery: laparoscopic shaving, disc excision, or rectal resection. We demonstrated that in the hands of experienced surgeons, rectal shaving is possible for DE in more than 95% of cases, with low complication rates compared to rectal resection. Shaving and bowel resection are associated with comparable recurrence rates. As shaving is indicated whatever the size of deep lesions, surgeons should first consider rectal shaving to remove DE. Bowel resection should only be performed in case of major rectal stenosis (>80%), multiple and/or posterior rectal lesions and stenotic sigmoid colon lesions.
