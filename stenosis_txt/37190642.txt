Title: The Role of High-Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Cerebrovascular Disease: A Narrative Review.

Abstract: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI) is the most important and popular vessel wall imaging technique for the direct assessment of vessel wall and cerebral arterial disease. It can identify the cause of stroke in high-risk plaques and differentiate the diagnosis of head and carotid artery dissection, including inflammation, Moya Moya disease, cerebral aneurysm, vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, blunt cerebrovascular injury, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, and other stenosis or occlusion conditions. Through noninvasive visualization of the vessel wall in vitro, quantified assessment of luminal stenosis and pathological features of the vessel wall can provide clinicians with further disease information. In this report, technical considerations of HRMRI are discussed, and current clinical applications of HRMRI are reviewed.
