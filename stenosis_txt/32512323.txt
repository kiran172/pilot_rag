Title: Congenital nasal piriform aperture atresia: A case report and novel finding.

Abstract: Congenital nasal piriform aperture stenosis and choanal atresia are types of nasal obstructions that can be life threatening to infants if left untreated. While there has been numerous reports on both of them there has not been a single reported case of congenital nasal piriform aperture atresia. Here, we present the first case of piriform aperture atresia that includes the diagnostic and clinical approach.
