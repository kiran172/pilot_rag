Title: Late Period Rastelli Take-Down and Arterial Switch Operation After Rastelli Operation.

Abstract: The Rastelli operation is a useful technique for treating the transposition of the great arteries. However, conduit stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract is a late complication of the procedure. We report the case of a 35-year-old man for whom an arterial switch operation was performed to treat conduit stenosis and improve ventricular arterial alignment 28 years after he underwent a Rastelli operation to treat transposition of the great arteries with a ventricular septal defect. In the 8 years that followed the operation, he was asymptomatic and was treated with warfarin.
