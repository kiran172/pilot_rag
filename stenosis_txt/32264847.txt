Title: Anxiety and depression in patients who undergo a cerebrovascular procedure.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Observe the relationship of anxiety and depression on quality of life outcomes after open and endovascular cerebrovascular procedures.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 349 patients who underwent a procedure for aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, carotid stenosis, acute stroke, and conventional catheter angiogram over three years at a community hospital. We correlated pre-procedural anxiety and depression with Global Physical Health, Global Mental Health, and Modified Rankin Scale scores. We performed univariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses adjusting for past medical history and sociodemographic factors.
RESULTS: Anxiety or depression occurred in 18 % of patients. Patients with anxiety or depression were more likely to be female (81% vs 60.8%; p = 0.002) and younger (54 vs. 59 years old; p = 0.025). The groups did not differ in type or urgency of procedure, smoking or history of diabetes. Patients with anxiety or depression reported lower mental health scores at 30 days (45.1 vs 48.2; p = 0.002) post-procedure. In multivariate analyses, anxious or depressed patients had worse mental health scores at 30 days (t = - 2.893; p = 0.008) than those who did not have a history of anxiety or depression. There was no difference between groups in length of stay, mortality, physical health t-scores, functionality scores, or six month quality of life outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing cerebrovascular procedures who self-reported anxiety or depression showed a significant difference in mental health outcomes at 30 days, but six month mental health and other medical and functional outcomes measures were similar to patients without these diagnoses.
