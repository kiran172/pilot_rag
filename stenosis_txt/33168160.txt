Title: Temporal Trends in Resource Use, Cost, and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the United States.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contemporary trends in outcomes and resource use associated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the United States.
METHODS: We identified patients who underwent TAVR between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017, in the National Readmission Database. We assessed temporal trends in clinical outcomes, length-of-stay, non-home discharges, and cost of the index TAVR hospitalization. We also evaluated the changes in the burden of hospitalizations before and after TAVR.
RESULTS: A total of 89,202 patients were included. In-hospital mortality decreased from 5.3% (188) in 2012 to 1.6% (484) in 2017 (adjusted odds ratio: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.46). Risk-adjusted incidences of new dialysis, vascular complications, blood transfusion, and mechanical ventilation decreased, but strokes and pacemaker implantations remained unchanged. Length of stay decreased from median of 7 (interquartile range [IQR]: 4 to 11) to 2 (IQR: 2 to 5) days (P<.001). Risk-adjusted non-home discharges decreased from 32.2% (1134) to 15.5% (386) (P<.001). Median cost of the TAVR hospitalization decreased from $56,022 (IQR: $43,690 to $75,174) to $46,101 (IQR: $36,083 to $59,752) (P<.001). Pre-TAVR admissions at 30, 90, and 180 days decreased from 21.6% (713), 39.5% (1160), and 50.5% (1009) in 2012 to 15.5% (4451), 30.2% (7186), and 36.8% (5928) in 2017, respectively (P<.001). Similarly, re-hospitalizations at 30, 90, and 180 days post-TAVR decreased from 17.5% (531), 27.9% (657), and 34.2% (521) to 12.4% (3486), 21.1% (4783), and 29.1% (4306), respectively (P<.001). The expenditure on index, pre-, and post-TAVR hospitalizations increased from $0.53 to $2.8 billion between 2012 andÂ 2017.
CONCLUSION: This study reflects the changes in the characteristics and outcomes of TAVR in the United States between 2012 and 2017. It also shows the temporal decrease in resource use, cost, and burden of hospitalizations among patients undergoing TAVR in the United States, but an increase in the overall expenditure on TAVR-related hospitalizations.
