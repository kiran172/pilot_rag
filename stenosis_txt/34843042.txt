Title: Metallic stent placement versus catheter drainage for malignant bilioenteric anastomotic stricture.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to compare self-expandable metallic stent placement with catheter drainage for malignant bilioenteric anastomotic stricture in terms of efficacy and safety.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 54 patients with malignant bilioenteric anastomotic stricture treated from March 2016 to February 2021. Twenty-seven patients underwent insertion of self-expandable metallic stent (Stent group); the remaining twenty-seven patients underwent internal-external catheter drainage (Catheter group). Technical success was defined as successful placement of stent or drainage catheter in the appropriate position; clinical success was defined as a 20% reduction in serum bilirubin within 1 week after the procedure, compared with baseline. Complications, duration to stent/catheter malfunction, and overall survival were evaluated.
RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all patients in both groups. In the Stent group, 21 patients received one stent and the other 6 patients required two stents. Clinical success rates were similar between the groups [Stent group, 92.6% (25/27); Catheter group, 88.9% (24/27)]. There were no major complications. The median duration to stent/catheter malfunction was significantly longer in the Stent group (130 days) than in the Catheter group (82 days; P = 0.010). The median overall survival was also significantly longer in the Stent group (187 days) than in the Catheter group (118 days; P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: Self-expandable metallic stent placement might be better than internal-external catheter drainage for malignant bilioenteric anastomotic stricture in terms of the duration before stent/catheter malfunction and patient survival.
