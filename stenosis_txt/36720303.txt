Title: Outcome and Risk Factors of Restenosis Post Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty at Juxta-Anastomotic of Wrist Autogenous Radial-Cephalic Arteriovenous Fistulas: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This retrospective cohort study was to determine the factors related to restenosis post percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) at juxta-anastomotic of wrist radial-cephalic arteriovenous fistulas (RC-AVFs).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent their first PTA for juxta-anastomotic stenosis at RC-AVF from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020. Patient and stenotic lesion characteristics and PTA procedure factors were included in the analysis. The primary and assisted primary patency post PTA of RC-AVFs were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify factors associated with restenosis post PTA. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to evaluate the predictive value of the risk factors for restenosis post PTA.
RESULTS: A total of 65 patients with a mean age of 59.09 ± 14.94 years were enrolled in the study. The mean RC-AVF age was 9.2 (4.9, 35.05) months, and the median time of intervention for stenosis was 10.8 (4.05, 41.35) months after AVF creation. The primary patency rates following the first PTA at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 93.9, 84.6, 63.1, and 55.4%, respectively. The assisted primary patency rates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 95.4, 90.8, 87.7, and 84.6%, respectively. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed the maximum balloon diameter >5 mm had a lower postoperative restenosis rate compared with the maximum balloon diameter ≤5 mm (hazard ratio = 0.422; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.201-0.884; P = 0.022). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of the maximum balloon diameter during PTA was 0.624 (95% CI, 0.486-0.762). The best critical value for the maximum balloon diameter was 6 mm, the sensitivity was 64.5%, and the specificity was 61.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first PTA at juxta-anastomotic of wrist RC-AVFs without thrombosis and complete occlusion, the use of a balloon with a maximum diameter of ≤5 mm is a risk factor to the occurrence of restenosis within 12 months post PTA. The result may help in tailoring surveillance programs in patients with RC-AVF stenosis.
