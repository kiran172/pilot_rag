Title: Tracheal resection and modified T-tube in the treatment of benign tracheal stenosis. A retrospective study of 48 patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective was to prove efficiency of tracheal resection in the cohort of patients of our clinic and to introduce our own modification of T-cannula as a surgical alternative if tracheal resection is contraindicated.
BACKGROUND: Benign tracheal stenosis, the most often represented by post tracheostomy (PTTS) and post intubation (PITS) stenosis, is a rare, but serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition. We present our experience with the management of the patients, who were referred with a benign tracheal stenosis.
METHODS: In the retrospective study, patient's outcome was evaluated after tracheal resection or treatment with T-cannula from all the patients presented with a benign tracheal stenosis from January 2015 to January 2021.
RESULTS: The cohort consists of forty-eight patients. Thirty-one (64,6 %) patients underwent a tracheal resection and seventeen (35,4 %) were treated with tracheostomy and T-tube insertion. In the series of patients after tracheal resection, we observed no mortality, complications occurred in ten (32,2 %) patients. They were spread proportionally; anastomotic complications were noticed in 5 (16,1 %) patients, as well as non-anastomotic complications.
CONCLUSION: Tracheal resection is a safe and effective procedure with good results. T- tube insertion presents a surgical alternative if bronchoscopy is unavailable or failed (Tab. 4, Fig. 2, Ref. 20).
