Title: Immune Markers Are Associated With Asymptomatic Intracranial Large Artery Stenosis and Future Vascular Events in NOMAS.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inflammation contributes to atherosclerosis but is incompletely characterized in intracranial large artery stenosis (ICAS). We hypothesized that immune markers would be associated with ICAS and modify the risk ICAS confers on future vascular events.
METHODS: This study included a subsample of stroke-free participants in the prospective NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study), who had blood samples analyzed with a 60-plex immunoassay (collected from 1993 to 2001) and ICAS assessment with time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (obtained from 2003 to 2008). We dichotomized ICAS as either ≥50% stenosis or not (including no ICAS). We ascertained post-magnetic resonance imaging vascular events. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator procedures to select immune markers independently associated with ICAS. Then, we grouped selected immune markers into a derived composite Z score. Using proportional odds regression, we quantified the association of the composite immune marker Z score, ICAS, and risk of vascular events.
RESULTS: Among 1211 participants (mean age, 71±9 years; 59% women; 65% Hispanic participants), 8% had ≥50% ICAS. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, we identified CXCL9 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9), HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), resistin, SCF (stem cell factor), and VEGF-A(vascular endothelial growth factor A) to have the strongest positive relationships with ≥50% ICAS in fully adjusted models. Selected markers were used to derive a composite immune marker Z score. Over an average follow-up of 12 years, we found that each unit increase in immune marker Z scores was associated with an 8% (95% CI, 1.05-1.11), 11% (95% CI, 1.06-1.16), and 5% (95% CI, 1.01-1.09) increased hazard of death, vascular death, and any vascular event, respectively, in adjusted models. We did not find a significant interaction between immune marker Z scores and ICAS in their relationship with any longitudinal outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Among a diverse stroke-free population, selected serum immune markers were associated with ICAS and future vascular events. Further study is needed to better understand their role in the pathogenesis of ICAS and as a potential therapeutic target in stroke prevention.
