Title: BCOR-CCNB3 sarcoma with concurrent RNF213-SLC26A11 gene fusion: a rare sarcoma with altered histopathological features after chemotherapy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is a common approach for cancer treatment, but intrinsic genetic mutations in different individuals may cause different responses to chemotherapy, resulting in unique histopathological changes. The genetic mutation along with the distinct histopathological features may indicate new tumor entities. BCOR-CCNB3 sarcomas is a kind of Ewing-like sarcomas (ELS) occurring mostly in bone and soft tissues. No gene fusion other than BCOR-CCNB3 has been found in this type of tumor.
CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report a case of 17-year-old male patient, presented with a mass on his left shoulder that was diagnosed as undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma according to core biopsy. The patient received 5 courses of preoperational chemotherapy, and the tumor was resected and analyzed. Primitive small round cells and larger myoid cells in the resected tumor tissue but not in biopsy were observed, and arterioles stenosis and occlusion were also detected, indicating a dramatic change of histopathological features of this tumor. In addition, the immunohistochemical results showed the altered staining patterns of BCOR, bcl2, CyclinD1, TLE1, AR, SMA, CD117, STAB2, CD56, and CD99 in tumor tissues after chemotherapy. Notably, RNA sequencing revealed a RNF213-SLC26A11 fusion in the tumor sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The BCOR-CCNB3 sarcoma with RNF213-SLC26A11 fusion may indicate a subset of tumors that undergo histopathological changes in response to chemotherapy. More similar cases in the future may help to clarify the clinical meanings of RNF213-SLC26A11 fusion in BCOR-CCNB3 sarcomas and the underlying mechanisms.
