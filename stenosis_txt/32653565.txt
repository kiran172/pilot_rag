Title: Uretero-Enteric Anastomotic Stricture Following Radical Cystectomy: A Comparison of Open, Robotic Extracorporeal, and Robotic Intracorporeal Approaches.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence of benign uretero-enteric anastomotic strictures between open cystectomy, robotic cystectomy with extracorporeal urinary diversion, and robotic cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion. The effect of surgeon learning curve on stricture incidence following intracorporeal diversion was investigated as a secondary outcome.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent radical cystectomy at an academic hospital between 2011 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome, incidence of anastomotic stricture over time, was assessed by a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. A Cox regression model adjusting for sequential case number in a surgeon's experience was used to assess intracorporeal learning curve.
RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty-eight patients were included: 279 open, 382 robotic extracorporeal, and 307 robotic intracorporeal. Benign stricture incidence was 11.3% overall: 26 (9.3%) after open, 43 (11.3%) after robotic extracorporeal, and 40 (13.0%) after robotic intracorporeal. An intracorporeal approach was associated with anastomotic stricture on multivariable analysis (HR 1.66; P = .05). After 75 intracorporeal cases, stricture incidence declined from 17.5% to 4.9%. Higher sequential case volume was independently associated with reduced stricture incidence (Hazard Ratio per 10 cases: 0.90; P = .02).
CONCLUSION: An intracorporeal approach to urinary reconstruction following robotic radical cystectomy was associated with an increased risk of benign uretero-enteric anastomotic stricture. In surgeons' early experience with intracorporeal diversion the difference in stricture incidence was more pronounced compared to alternative approaches; however, increased intracorporeal case volume was associated with a decline in stricture incidence leading to a modest difference between the 3 surgical approaches overall.
