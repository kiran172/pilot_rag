Title: Interventions and Outcomes in Glottic Versus Multi-level Airway Stenosis: A Multi-institutional Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Airway stenosis-particularly multi-level-presents complex management challenges. This study assessed rates of tracheostomy, decannulation, and the number of surgeries required in patients with posterior glottic stenosis (PGS), multi-level airway stenosis (MLAS), and bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP).
METHODS: Airway stenosis patients treated between 2016 and 2021 at three tertiary medical centers were identified. Demographics, etiology of stenosis, medical comorbidities, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected.
RESULTS: 158 patients (84 women, mean age 56.98 ± 15.5 years) were identified (54 PGS, 38 MLAS, and 66 BVFP). 72.3% required tracheostomy, including 72.2%, 86.8%, and 63.6% in these groups, respectively. Decannulation rates were 43.6%, 21.2%, and 32.5% in these groups, respectively. Patients with MLAS had higher rates of tracheostomy than BVFP (p < 0.05). However, decannulation rates were not different between groups (p > 0.05). MLAS required more surgeries (mean 4.0 ± 3.9) than PGS (2.4 ± 2.2, p = 0.02) or BVFP (1.0 ± 1.8, p < 0.0001). Mean PROMs scores at the latest follow-up were abnormal: 15.4 ± 12.2 (Dyspnea Index), 19.9 ± 12.2 (Voice Handicap Index-10), and 9.67 ± 11.1 (Eating Assessment Tool-10). Co-morbidities present included body mass index >30 (41.4%), diabetes (31.8%), pulmonary disease (50.7%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (39.4%), autoimmune disease (22.9%), and tobacco use history (55.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Airway stenosis is a challenging clinical problem that negatively impacts patients' quality of life and often requires numerous surgeries. PGS more frequently requires tracheostomy compared to BVFP, but patients can often decannulate successfully. Patients with multi-level stenosis have lower decannulation rates and require more surgeries than glottic stenosis alone; these patients may benefit from earlier and/or more aggressive intervention.
