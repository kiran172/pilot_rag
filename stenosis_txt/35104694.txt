Title: Open Versus Laparoscopic Pyloromyotomy for Pyloric Stenosis-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is treated by either open pyloromyotomy (OP) or laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP). The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the open versus laparoscopic technique.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted from 1990 to February 2021 using the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Primary outcomes were mucosal perforation and incomplete pyloromyotomy. Secondary outcomes consisted of length of hospital stay, time to full feeds, operating time, postoperative wound infection/abscess, incisional hernia, hematoma/seroma formation, and death.
RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials including 720 patients (357 with OP and 363 with LP) were included. Mucosal perforation rate was not different between groups (relative risk [RR] LP versus OP 1.60 [0.49-5.26]). LP was associated with nonsignificant higher risk of incomplete pyloromyotomy (RR 7.37 [0.92-59.11]). There was no difference in neither postoperative wound infections after LP compared with OP (RR 0.59 [0.24-1.45]) nor in postoperative seroma/hematoma formation (RR 3.44 [0.39-30.43]) or occurrence of incisional hernias (RR 1.01 [0.11-9.53]). Length of hospital stay (-3.01 h for LP [-8.39 to 2.37 h]) and time to full feeds (-5.86 h for LP [-15.95 to 4.24 h]) were nonsignificantly shorter after LP. Operation time was almost identical between groups (+0.53 min for LP [-3.53 to 4.59 min]).
CONCLUSIONS: On a meta-level, there is no precise effect estimate indicating that LP carries a higher risk for mucosal perforation or incomplete pyloromyotomies compared with the open equivalent. Because of very low certainty of evidence, we do not know about the effect of the laparoscopic approach on postoperative wound infections, postoperative hematoma or seroma formation, incisional hernia occurrence, length of postoperative stay, time to full feeds, or operating time.
