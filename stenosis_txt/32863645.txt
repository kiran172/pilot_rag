Title: An Unusual Case of a Displaced Hemodialysis Catheter Guidewire Spontaneously Coming Out of Skull.

Abstract: Hemodialysis catheter insertion is a common practice for the patients with renal failure. There are several complications associated with hemodialysis catheter insertion such as infection, catheter thrombosis, malposition, or vein stenosis; however, loss of guidewire during catheter insertion with its migration is a rare complication. We report the case of a 75-year-old male with forgotten displaced guidewire which came out spontaneously from the skull in the occipital region, three years after the hemodialysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case that has been reported in literature till date. We also discuss the possible causes of a retained guidewire and measure to prevent it.
