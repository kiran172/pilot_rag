Title: Diagnostic value of myocardial bridge-mural coronary artery vascular morphology based on CTA technique.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of coronary CT angiography (CTA) technique on the vascular morphology of the myocardial bridge-mural coronary artery (MB-MCA).
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 180 patients with suspected MB-MCA attending Hebei Huaao Hospital from February 2019 to February 2020 were analyzed. The image quality, myocardial bridge distribution, type, length, and degree of stenosis of wall coronary vessels were compared between CTA and Coronary angiography (CAG). The area under the curve (AUC) was used to analyze the diagnostic efficiency of CTA.
RESULTS: There was no difference in the excellent CTA image quality rate between the two methods (P > 0.05). The mean length of myocardial bridges measured by CTA was greater than that measured by CAG (P < 0.05), while the mean degree of stenosis measured by CTA was lower than that measured by CAG (P < 0.05). The Kappa value of CTA for determining MB-MCA stenosis versus CAG results was 0.831 (P < 0.05); The Kappa value of CTA for determining MB-MCA versus CAG results was 0.895 (P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the AUC was 92.41, sensitivity was 98.73%, and specificity was 92.47% (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: CTA showed good distribution and length of myocardial bridges, high accuracy for MB-MCA assessment and diagnosis, and good agreement with the gold standard CAG diagnosis.
