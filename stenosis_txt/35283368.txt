Title: Long-Term Outcomes in Elderly Patients After Deferral of Coronary Revascularization Guided by Fractional Flow Reserve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Little evidence is available regarding the long-term outcome in elderly patients after deferral of revascularization based on fractional flow reserve (FFR).
METHODS AND RESULTS: From the J-CONFIRM registry (long-term outcomes of Japanese patients with deferral of coronary intervention based on fractional flow reserve in multicenter registry), 1,262 patients were divided into 2 groups according to age: elderly and younger patients (aged ≥75 or <75 years, respectively). The primary endpoint was the cumulative 5-year incidence of target vessel failure (TVF), defined as a composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction (TVMI), and clinically driven target vessel revascularization (CDTVR). Cumulative 5-year incidence of TVF was not significantly different between elderly and younger patients (14.3% vs. 10.8%, P=0.12). Cardiac death occurred more frequently in elderly patients than younger patients (4.4% vs. 0.8%, P<0.001), whereas TVMI and CDTVR did not differ between groups (1.3% vs. 0.9%, P=0.80; 10.7% vs. 10.1%, P=0.80, respectively). FFR values in lesions with diameter stenosis <50% were significantly higher in elderly patients than in younger patients (0.88±0.07 vs. 0.85±0.07, P=0.01), whereas this relationship was not observed in those with diameter stenosis ≥50%.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients had no excess risk of ischemic events related to the deferred coronary lesions by FFR, although FFR values in mild coronary artery stenosis were modestly different between elderly and younger patients.
