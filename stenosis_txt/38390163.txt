Title: Four case reports of left anterior descending restenosis treated via the internal mammary artery: A literature review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyse four cases of intervention via the internal mammary artery-anterior descending branch and provide and summarise the clinical treatment experience.
METHODS: The clinical data of four patients with distal restenosis of a left anterior descending artery (LAD) anastomosis after left internal mammary artery (LIMA)-LAD bypass surgery, who were admitted to the Gansu Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases between March 2013 and April 2022, were retrospectively analysed and reviewed together with the relevant literature.
RESULTS: Among the four patients, one was treated with intracoronary stenting via the internal mammary artery route, two were treated with intracoronary drug-coated balloon dilation (one of whom underwent fractional flow reserve [FFR] testing), and two underwent FFR testing (one of whom had a negative test result until the end of the procedure and continued to take medication during follow-up; the other patient had a positive result and further interventions). There were no deaths or postoperative complications in the group, and the patients were followed up for 4 months to 9 years, with good long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) via the internal mammary artery route is safe and effective, and patients with anastomotic distal stenosis or anastomotic stenosis of LAD bypass anastomosis may be considered for PCI via the internal mammary artery route.
