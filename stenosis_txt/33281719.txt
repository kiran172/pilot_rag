Title: Stent-Assisted Angioplasty in Spontaneous Bilateral Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery Dissection.

Abstract: Internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD) results from a tear in the intima or rupture of the vasa vasorum with bleeding within the media resulting in separation of the vessel wall layers and a false lumen. It may cause arterial stenosis, occlusion, or dissecting pseudoaneurysm. Currently, the treatment of ICAD is controversial, including drug therapy and endovascular stent implantation. Simultaneous spontaneous dissection of bilateral carotid artery is rarely reported. We reported a 39-year-old-man with bilateral ICAD. Although the long-term durability of endovascular stent remains to be determined, for ICAD failed with active drug treatment and combined with hemodynamic impairment, early endovascular stent should be considered.
