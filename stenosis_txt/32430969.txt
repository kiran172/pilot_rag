Title: Use of human amniotic membrane repair of anterior urethral defect: First clinical report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of human amniotic membrane allograft to prevent urethrocutaneous fistula after tubularized incised plate repair for redo-hypospadias and anterior urethral defects.
METHODS: This pilot study included 28 patients (mean age 25.3 ± 11 years) with a history of previous failed hypospadia repair, who underwent tubularized incised plate urethroplasty in one session by the same surgical team from April 2016 to April 2019. After the reconstruction of a neourethra and proper hemostasis, a human amniotic membrane allograft - Grafting Scaffold - was used to cover the suture lines.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 13.3 ± 4.5 months. Two urethrocutaneous fistulas occurred within the first 2 weeks after the surgery, one of which was caused by the infection of the surgical site. No penile torsion, urethral diverticula, meatal stenosis or glans dehiscence was reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Amniotic membrane graft provides an applicable, low-cost, feasible, biodegradable and safe second cover in redo-hypospadias repairs by tubularized incised plate technique. Its use is technically easy; it has satisfactory cosmetic outcomes and might decrease urethrocutaneous fistula formation.
