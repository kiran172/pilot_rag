Title: Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm Associated with Bicuspid Pulmonary Valve.

Abstract: A 73-year-old Japanese man was admitted with an asymptomatic pulmonary artery aneurysm. However, chest X-ray and contrast-enhanced thoracic computed tomography revealed a protrusion at the second left branch that in fact was a pulmonary artery aneurysm with a diameter of 50 mm. Transesophageal echocardiography showed a bicuspid pulmonary valve, and cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary stenosis with a pressure gradient of 45 mmHg, but no other heart diseases were noted. An extremely rare pulmonary artery aneurysm associated with an isolated bicuspid pulmonary valve was diagnosed.
