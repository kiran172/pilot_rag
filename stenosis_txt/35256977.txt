Title: In-Office Needle Tendoscopy of the Peroneal Tendons.

Abstract: In-office needle tendoscopy (IONT) can be used for the diagnosis and treatment of several peroneal tendon pathologies including peroneal tendon tendinopathy, tears, and instability. Benefits of IONT for peroneal tendon disorders include the ability to dynamically evaluate peroneal tendon stability, quicker patient recovery, reduced cost, and improved patient satisfaction. Several studies have suggested that tendoscopic treatment may avoid several complications related to open treatment of peroneal tendon pathologies, including scar formation and groove stenosis. The purpose of the present report is to describe the technique for performing IONT for common peroneal tendon pathologies. This Technical Note describes the techniques for obtaining adequate anesthesia and performing IONT, indications, and advantages of performing these procedures in the office rather than in the operating room.
