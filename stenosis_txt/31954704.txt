Title: Clinical outcomes of adults with eosinophilic esophagitis with severe stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory disease of the esophagus. Its prevalence has been increasing steadily over the past 3 decades. The prognosis of patients with EoE presenting with severe esophageal strictures is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes of patients with EoE with severe strictures and identify factors associated with a greater likelihood of improvement in esophageal diameter.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review of patients with EoE with severe stricture, defined as an esophageal diameter of 10 mm or less at one point in their disease course. Each patient's clinical course was followed during standard-of-care follow-up with medical or dietary therapy in conjunction with repeated esophageal dilation. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine which variables are associated with endoscopic response, defined by an improvement in esophageal diameter to 13 mm and to 15 mm.
RESULTS: From a cohort of 1091 adults with EoE, severe strictures were identified in 66 patients (7%). Of the 66 patients, 59 (89%) achieved an esophageal diameter of ≥13 mm and 43 (65%) achieved ≥15 mm. Initial diameter (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.35; P = .025) and histologic remission (odds ratio, 34.97; 95% confidence interval, 6.45-189.49; P < .0001) were significantly associated with achieving a diameter ≥15 mm. Age at diagnosis, gender, and number of months to maximum esophageal diameter were not associated with achieving either diameter.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with EoE with severe stricture experienced improvement in esophageal diameter to ≥15 mm with treatment, suggesting that the currently available treatment options are effective for patients with severe strictures. The most significant factors associated with disease reversibility are initial esophageal diameter and histologic remission.
