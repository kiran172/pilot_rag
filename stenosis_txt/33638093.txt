Title: Angiographic evaluation of radial artery injury after transradial approach for percutaneous coronary intervention.

Abstract: The transradial approach for percutaneous coronary intervention (TRA-PCI) has been increasingly gaining popularity in clinical practice. However, its association with risk for long-term radial artery injury has not been yet thoroughly defined. We retrospectively examined the patients undergoing radial artery angiography (RAG) after TRA-PCI to determine the incidence and risk factors of radial artery injury. The study included 558 patients undergoing follow-up radial artery angiography at 12 month after TRA-PCI. Radial artery injury occurred in 140 patients (25%) with 3 distinct morphological patterns: focal radial artery stenosis (RAS) P.7,7: in 7 patients (1%), diffuse radial artery stenosis (RAS) in 78 patients (14%), and radial artery occlusion (RAO) in 55 patients (10%). Patients with RAS/RAO were more likely to be female, had smaller height and body weight, smaller body mass index and smaller body surface area (BSA) as compared with those without RAS/RAO. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified BSA (odds ratio, 1.34 per 0.1 m2 increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.71; p = 0.01) and a history of TRA-PCI (odds ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-5.08; p = 0.017) as independent predisposing factors of radial artery injury. In a sub-analysis of 323 patients undergoing both pre-PCI RAG and follow-up RAG, pre-PCI radial diameter as well as BSA and a history of TRA-PCI were independently associated with radial artery injury. Long-term injury after TRA-PCI is considerably common and care should be paid for RAS/RAO, especially for those patients with lower BSA, history of TRA-PCI and small radial artery diameter.
