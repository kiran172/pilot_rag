Title: Permanent perineal urethrostomy for anterior urethral strictures: A critical appraisal of long-term outcomes and erectile function.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In complex strictures, especially in elderly patients, perineal urethrostomy (PU) provide excellent voiding function. This study aimed at evaluating the long-term voiding and erectile function of PU as a permanent procedure for such strictures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 146 patients who underwent permanent PU at our institution from January 2000 to December 2018. All patients had complex urethral strictures. Patients with posterior urethral involvement were excluded. Patients were followed up at 3 months and then yearly. Failure was defined as the need for any additional procedures. They were also evaluated with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire. Fisher's exact test and χ2 test were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The median age at the time of surgery was 58±7.3 years. The mean stricture length was 6.5±2.1 cm. All the patients had a history of previous surgery, and the average number of procedures per patient was 2.4. The median follow-up period was 26 months. The most common early and late postoperative complications were bleeding and stenosis of the urethrostomy, respectively. A total of 129 (88.3%) patients had a successful surgery. The number of patients with no erectile dysfunction increased from 55.4% to 67.8% after PU. The mean IIEF-5 score improved from 20.07 to 21.31 after PU, but this did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.3558).
CONCLUSION: Permanent PU is an acceptable option for complex long-segment anterior urethral strictures, especially in elderly patients, with an excellent long-term outcome. A majority of patients also maintain a satisfactory erectile function.
