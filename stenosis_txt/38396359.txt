Title: Increased prevalence of high-risk coronary plaques in metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease patients: A meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography (CTCA) can assess both the extent and the features of coronary plaques. We aimed to gather evidence about the prevalence and features of coronary plaques among MASLD patients.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched for randomized controlled trials and adjusted observational studies assessing the prevalence and features of coronary plaques by means of CTCA in MASLD patients as compared with a control group. The prevalence of coronary stenosis (defined as >30% and >50% diameter of stenosis), of increasing coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and of high-risk features (namely low-attenuation plaques, napkin ring sign, spotty calcification and positive remodelling) in MASLD patients were the endpoints of interest.
RESULTS: Twenty-four observational studies were included. MASLD was associated with an increased prevalence of critical coronary stenosis compared with controls (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95%CI 1.23-1.93). Increased values of CAC score were observed in MASLD patients (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.02-1.78 and OR 2.26, 95%CI 1.57-3.23 for CAC score 0-100 and >100, respectively). An increased risk of 'high-risk' coronary plaques was observed in MASLD patients (OR 2.13, 95%CI 1.42-3.19). As high-risk features plaques, a higher prevalence of positive remodelling and spotty calcification characterize MASLD patients (OR 2.92, 95%CI 1.79-4.77 and OR 2.96, 95%CI 1.22-7.20).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MASLD are at increased risk of developing critical coronary stenosis and coronary plaques characterized by high-risk features as detected by CTCA.
