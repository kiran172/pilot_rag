Title: Left atrial appendage aneurysm: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: An aneurysm of the left atrial appendage is one of the rare but potentially hazardous heart defects. The risk of lethal complications grows with its size. To date, about 150 cases of this defect have been described in the literature. We present a case of left atrial appendage aneurysm with the deformation of the mitral valve and the left main coronary and circumflex artery, which required mitral valve annuloplasty and bifurcation stenting.
CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old man presented to our hospital complaining of shortness of breath, general weakness, dizziness during physical exertion, and fatigue. Based on the results of echocardiography, an aneurysm of the left atrium was suspected. A free-breathing real-time cine magnetic resonance imaging with electrocardiograph synchronization confirmed the diagnosis of left atrial appendage aneurysm. The patient underwent an aneurysmectomy via a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed relative mitral insufficiency that was corrected with an annuloplasty ring. Intraoperative coronary angiogram showed impaired blood flow in the left main coronary and circumflex artery and 60% stenosis. For this reason, bifurcation stenting was performed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative clinical course and was discharged from the hospital on the 10th day in a satisfactory condition.
CONCLUSION: Left atrial appendage aneurysm is a rare and dangerous heart pathology that requires surgery to prevent related complications.
