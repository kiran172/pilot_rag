Title: Laryngeal Surgery as It Pertains to the Thoracic Surgeon.

Abstract: A surgeon managing complex airway disease benefits from knowledge of laryngeal physiology and pathology. The Larynx provides phonation and protection for the lower airway via closure and cough reflex. Disruption of these functions or development of paralysis or stenosis can lead to respiratory failure. Management includes a variety of endoscopic and open management techniques. Understanding of laryngeal physiology can also limit laryngeal functional impairment through careful preservation of motor nerves and early recognition of injuries.
