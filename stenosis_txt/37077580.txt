Title: Impact of C-reactive protein levels on lipoprotein(a)-associated aortic stenosis incidence and progression.

Abstract: AIMS: Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels are associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Observational studies revealed that Lp(a) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a biomarker of systemic inflammation, may jointly predict CAD risk. Whether Lp(a) and CRP levels also jointly predict CAVS incidence and progression is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the association of Lp(a) with CAVS according to CRP levels in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Norfolk study (n = 18 226, 406 incident cases) and the UK Biobank (n = 438 260, 4582 incident cases), as well as in the ASTRONOMER study (n = 220), which assessed the haemodynamic progression rate of pre-existing mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis. In EPIC-Norfolk, in comparison to individuals with low Lp(a) levels (&lt;50 mg/dL) and low CRP levels (&lt;2.0 mg/L), those with elevated Lp(a) (&gt;50 mg/dL) and low CRP levels (&lt;2.0 mg/L) and those with elevated Lp(a) (&gt;50 mg/dL) and elevated CRP levels (&gt;2.0 mg/L) had a higher CAVS risk [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.86 (95% confidence intervals, 1.30-2.67) and 2.08 (1.44-2.99), respectively]. A comparable predictive value of Lp(a) in patients with vs. without elevated CRP levels was also noted in the UK Biobank. In ASTRONOMER, CAVS progression was comparable in patients with elevated Lp(a) levels with or without elevated CRP levels.
CONCLUSION: Lp(a) predicts the incidence and possibly progression of CAVS regardless of plasma CRP levels. Lowering Lp(a) levels may warrant further investigation in the prevention and treatment of CAVS, regardless of systemic inflammation.
