Title: Scientific View on Endoscopic Spine Surgery: Can Spinal Endoscopy Become a Mainstream Surgical Tool?

Abstract: With the health care environment becoming increasingly patient centric and cost-conscious, interest levels in spinal endoscopy are at an all-time high. Patient demand for the least invasive procedures combined with surgeon desire to maximally shorten the postoperative recovery period has further driven this surgical evolution. Mounting scientific evidence demonstrates the noninferiority and perhaps even superiority of endoscopic techniques to more conventional spinal surgery for the treatment of spinal stenosis and disc herniations. Although higher level evidence is much needed to support the clinical utility of the latest endoscopic techniques and surgical indications, it appears that the entrance of spinal endoscopy into the mainstream arena of spinal surgery is inevitable.
