Title: Situs inversus with congenital absence of left circumflex artery and a superdominant left-sided right coronary artery: A case report.

Abstract: Situs inversus with a coronary artery defect is an extremely rare congenital anomaly, which is often only incidentally detected during cardiac imaging studies, particularly when the patient is complaining of chest pain. We present a case study of a 37-year-old man who presented with a 3-month history of chest pain. A chest X-ray revealed dextrocardia with stomach gas in the lower right diaphragm. A CT examination showed that the right lung had 2 lobes, and the left lung had 3 lobes. This confirmed that the patient had dextrocardia with situs inversus, where the heart, organs and coronary arteries are inverted to the opposite side of the body. It is also known as a mirroring image, as the arrangement of the anatomy is unaffected. The patient's right coronary artery was prominently inversed to the left side, while the left main coronary artery was inversed to the right side and continued toward the anterior interventricular sulcus, eventually becoming the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The left circumflex artery was absent in the atrioventricular groove. There was also a plaque in the right-sided LAD with no significant stenosis. The patient received conservative medical therapy and had frequent follow-ups to check for potential complications.
