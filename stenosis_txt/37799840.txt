Title: Management of hepatic caval stenosis and obstruction with modified Gianturco Z-stents.

Abstract: Hepatic caval stenosis is managed with stenting; however, stent placement can be complicated by migration, which can be life-threatening. The risk of migration can be mitigated by increasing the length of the stent, which increases contact with the vessel wall. We describe the cases of three patients with hepatic caval stenosis treated with two Z-stents sutured together. Each had an uncomplicated postoperative course and demonstrated clinical improvement. The use of sutured Z-stents can increase the stability of the stent and, therefore, decrease the morbidity associated with stent placement for hepatic caval stenosis.
