Title: Additive value of epicardial adipose tissue quantification to coronary CT angiography-derived plaque characterization and CT fractional flow reserve for the prediction of lesion-specific ischemia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) from coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is strongly associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated the additive value of EAT volume to coronary plaque quantification and CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) to predict lesion-specific ischemia.
METHODS: Patients (n = 128, 60.6 ± 10.5 years, 61% male) with suspected CAD who had undergone invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and CCTA were retrospectively analyzed. EAT volume and plaque measures were derived from CCTA using a semi-automatic software approach, while CT-FFR was calculated using a machine learning algorithm. The predictive value and discriminatory power of EAT volume, plaque measures, and CT-FFR to identify ischemic CAD were assessed using invasive FFR as the reference standard.
RESULTS: Fifty-five of 152 lesions showed ischemic CAD by invasive FFR. EAT volume, CCTA ≥ 50% stenosis, and CT-FFR were significantly different in lesions with and without hemodynamic significance (all p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed predictive value for lesion-specific ischemia of these parameters: EAT volume (OR 2.93, p = 0.021), CCTA ≥ 50% (OR 4.56, p = 0.002), and CT-FFR (OR 6.74, p < 0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated incremental discriminatory value with the addition of EAT volume to plaque measures alone (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.62, p < 0.05). CT-FFR (AUC 0.89) showed slightly superior performance over EAT volume with plaque measures (AUC 0.84), however without significant difference (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: EAT volume is significantly associated with ischemic CAD. The combination of EAT volume with plaque quantification demonstrates a predictive value for lesion-specific ischemia similar to that of CT-FFR. Thus, EAT may aid in the identification of hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis.
KEY POINTS: • CT-derived EAT volume quantification demonstrates high discriminatory power to identify lesion-specific ischemia. • EAT volume shows incremental diagnostic performance over CCTA-derived plaque measures in detecting lesion-specific ischemia. • A combination of plaque measures with EAT volume provides a similar discriminatory value for detecting lesion-specific ischemia compared to CT-FFR.
