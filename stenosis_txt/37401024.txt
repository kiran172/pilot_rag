Title: Role of Pelvic Ischemia in Human Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Sexual Function Among Patients With Common Iliac Artery Obstruction Undergoing Revascularization Surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: In this case-control study, we explored the relationships among pelvic ischemia, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and sexual function in patients with common iliac artery steno-occlusive disease, along with the potential therapeutic role of revascularization.
METHODS: We recruited 33 men diagnosed with radiologically documented common iliac artery stenosis (>80%) who underwent endovascular revascularization, and 33 healthy controls. Five patients had obstruction of the abdominal aorta (Leriche syndrome). The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, and International Index of Erectile Function were used to evaluate LUTS and erectile function. Medical history, anthropometrics, urinalysis, and blood tests, including levels of serum prostate-specific antigen, urea, creatinine, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and hemoglobin A1c, were recorded. Uroflow (maximum flow, average flow, voided volume, and voiding time) and ultrasound parameters (prostate volume and postvoid residual [PVR]) were also measured. Patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS (IPSS>7) underwent complete urodynamic investigation. Patients were examined at baseline and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: Patients exhibited poorer total IPSS (P<0.001), storage (P=0.001) and voiding symptom (P<0.001) subscores, as well as worse OAB-bother (P=0.015), OAB-sleep (P<0.001), OAB-coping (P<0.001), and OAB-total (P<0.001) scores than control participants. Additionally, erectile function (P=0.002), sexual desire (P<0.001), and satisfaction from intercourse (P=0.016) deteriorated in the patient group. Six months postoperatively, significant improvements were observed in erectile function (P=0.008), orgasm (P=0.021), and desire (P=0.014). Similarly, PVR significantly improved (P=0.012), while fewer patients experienced increased bladder sensation (P=0.035) and detrusor overactivity (P=0.035) upon postoperative urodynamic study. No significant differences were found between patients with bilateral and unilateral obstruction or between either of those groups and Leriche syndrome patients.
CONCLUSION: Patients with steno-occlusive disease of the common iliac artery experienced more severe LUTS and sexual dysfunction than healthy controls. Endovascular revascularization alleviated LUTS in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms and improved bladder and erectile function.
