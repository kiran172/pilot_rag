Title: miR-33a and Its Association with Lipid Profile in Patients with Carotid Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a complex, multifactorial pathogenesis, which includes lipid metabolism alterations. miR-33a is a microRNA that plays a key role in cholesterol efflux and promotes atherosclerosis, yet its relationship with lipid markers in carotid atherosclerosis (CA) remains unclear. The objective is to evaluate possible associations between miR-33a expression and lipid biomarkers in patients with CA. This was a prospective study that included 61 patients (median age 66.0 years, 55.7% male) with evidence of CA. Lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides [TG], high-density lipoprotein [HDL] and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol) was analyzed. Extraction and quantification of miR-33a-5p/3p was performed according to protocol. Patients were further divided depending on the target LDL level (&lt;1.8 mmol/L). Patients with CA had relatively favorable LDL levels with a median of 2.0 mmol/L. Both miR-33a-5p and miR-33a-3p levels were lower in patients with less than targeted LDL levels (37.4 and 38.3 vs. 41.8 and 42.5 respectively, p &lt; 0.05). A significant positive correlation between expression levels of miR-33a-5p/3p and degree of carotid stenosis was found (r = 0.44 and r = 0.38 respectively, p &lt; 0.05). In a univariate linear regression model miR-33a-3p/5p was positively associated with LDL cholesterol (p = 0.02). miR-33a up-regulation is associated with CA and may, in fact, be a key player by targeting cholesterol metabolism. A decrease in LDL cholesterol (&lt;1.8 mmol/L) corresponded to lower levels of miR-33a, yet the direction and causality of this association remains unclear.
