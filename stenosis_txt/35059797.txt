Title: Novel Common Femoral Artery Lesion Classification in Patients Undergoing Endovascular Revascularization.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Common femoral artery (CFA) is a critical segment of the lower-limb arterial tree. We sought to propose an extensive classification in order to appraise a diagnostic and therapeutic approach.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of CFA lesions with endovascular therapy was evaluated. We appraised the extension, the degree of stenosis and the calcium burden. A new group "IV" included lesions that started at the external iliac artery or common iliac artery extending into the CFA and affecting its bifurcation. The primary outcome was the need for a retrograde bailout access after failed anterograde access and the procedural time.
RESULTS: From 2012 to 2020, a total of 58 lower limbs in patients with CFA lesions were included. New proposed group IV compromised 36% of lesions. Additionally, procedural time was significantly longer in group IV lesions compared with the rest (76.9 ± 32.23 min vs 47.67 ± 17.93 min, p < 0.01), as was the requirement of retrograde bailout access (23.8 vs 2.6%, p = 0.03). Occlusive lesions were associated with longer procedural times and bailout retrograde access compared to stenotic lesions (74.7 ± 33.6 min vs 48.29 ± 16 min, p < 0.001 and 26.1 vs 0%, p = 0.006, respectively), as well as heavy calcification compared to mild or moderate calcification (73.18 ± 28.15 vs 51.86 ± 25.1, p = 0.06 and 29.4 vs 2.4%, p = 0.009, respectively). Secondary clinical outcomes and target lesion revascularization did not differ among groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our classification includes a new group of extensive and frequent lesions, which did not fit in previous classifications.
