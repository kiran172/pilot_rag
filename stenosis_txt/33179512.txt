Title: Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation in patients with unresectable malignant biliary strictures.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: previous studies have shown that endoscopic radiofrequency ablation in unresectable biliary duct tumors prolongs survival.
METHODS: this was an observational study of patients with an unresectable malignant stricture. The aim was to evaluate survival, stent patency and adverse events of radiofrequency compared with a matched control group.
RESULTS: the study included 40 patients, 12 with radiofrequency. There were no differences between baseline parameters in both groups. The survival time was longer in the radiofrequency group with no statistically significant difference (217 vs 129 days, log-rank 0.31). There was no difference in stent permeability or adverse events.
CONCLUSION: the radiofrequency group had a three-month increase in survival, which did not reach statistical significance.
