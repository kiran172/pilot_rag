Title: Spinal stenosis caused by epidural and paraspinal abscess due to brucella Infection.

Abstract: Human brucellosis is a common zoonotic infectious disease in the world. Spinal epidural abscess development in brucellosis is a rare but serious complication. We aimed to discuss the clinical, radiological and serological findings of the spinal stenosis caused by epidural and paraspinal abscess due to brucella infection. Treatment of the abscess usually consists of surgical drainage, decompression and antibiotherapy. In our case, since the Brucellar spinal epidural abscess was diagnosed in the early period, it was improved with medical treatment without any surgical intervention. In the early diagnosis of the disease, serology and culture as well as magnetic resonance imaging are extremely important..
