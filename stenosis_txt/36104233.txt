Title: Novel Endovascular Therapy, AGET, for In-Stent Occlusions in Iliac and Femoropopliteal Arteries.

Abstract: Catheter-directed intra-arterial thrombolysis (CDT) is useful for not only patients with acute limb ischemia but also those with chronic total occlusions (CTOs) of the lower extremity arteries. However, it is difficult to determine whether CTO lesions have significant thrombi, which can be treated by CDT, or not in a clinical setting. Angioscopy can accurately detect thrombi. We investigated the clinical impact of angioscopy guided endovascular therapy following thrombolysis (AGET) for in-stent occlusions (ISOs) in iliac or femoropopliteal arteries.We performed AGET in 7 patients with ISOs whose occlusion duration was less than 1 year. We performed angioscopy to evaluate the area of the thrombi after a successful wire crossing of an ISO lesion. In addition, we performed biopsies of ISO lesions to confirm whether the angioscopic findings coincided with the histopathological findings at 20 sites. We selectively performed a continuous infusion of urokinase using a fountain infusion catheter for ISO lesions. The next day, we evaluated the lesion flow and performed intervention only at the plaque stenosis site if necessary.AGET could achieve TIMI 3 flow in all patients, and preserved a 1-year patency in 5 patients (71.4%). The angioscopic findings of thrombi and plaque perfectly coincided with the histopathological findings.In conclusion, this new endovascular therapy technique, AGET, was observed to be feasible and safe for iliac or femoropopliteal artery ISO lesions.
