Title: Developments in Clinical management of Sialadenitis in Africa.

Abstract: Sialendoscopy is a relatively new technique that offers the potential to be both diagnostic and therapeutic. It follows the principle of gland sparing therapy to manage conditions such as ductal stenoses and sialolithiasis. The procedure is relatively easy to learn and more affordable than the traditional methods of intervention. It is well suited to the African continent in that the equipment is relatively portable and may be taken to peripheral and rural areas, while still providing world-class care and minimal disruption to the patients. We hereby present the evolution of sialendoscopy.
