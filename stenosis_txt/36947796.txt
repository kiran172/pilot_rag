Title: Urethral Stricture Formation After Artificial Urinary Sphincter Cuff Erosion Is Uncommon in the Absence of Pelvic Radiation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Reported rates of urethral stricture development after artificial urinary sphincter erosion are highly variable. We hypothesized that the risk of stricture is commensurate with the degree of erosion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed our prospectively maintained quality improvement database for all patients with artificial urinary sphincter erosion from 2011 to 2022. The incidence of postoperative stricture development was compared to the severity of erosion using a graded scale: 1, <25% circumference; 2, 25%-50% circumference; 3, >50% and <100% circumference; and 4, 100% circumference. From 862 artificial urinary sphincter surgeries, 102 erosion cases were identified, and 63 with documented erosion severity were included for analysis. Additional analysis was performed on 28 cases without documented erosion severity for validation.
RESULTS: Within the main cohort, urethral stricture developed in 22 (34.9%) patients. The incidence of stricture did not vary by grade of erosion (P = .73) and was not significantly higher in men with grade 4 erosion vs lower-grade erosions (32.7% vs 50.0%, P = .34). Radiation exposure was associated with a 41.1% higher incidence of stricture (P &lt; .01) and nearly every stricture occurred in the setting of prior radiation (21 of 22; 95.5%). In the validation group, 10 (35.7%) developed stricture, mostly in the setting of radiation (8 of 10; 80%). Overall, 29 of 32 (90.6%) cases of stricture involved a history of radiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Artificial urinary sphincter erosion does not lead to urethral stricture formation in most cases and is not associated with degree of erosion. Those who develop strictures nearly always have a history of pelvic radiation.
