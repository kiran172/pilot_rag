Title: Hyperperfusion Syndrome and Baroreflex Failure following Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting for Symptomatic Radiation-Associated Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular manifestations of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers are well described. In Southeast Asia, because nasopharyngeal cancer is common, patients with late cerebrovascular consequences are encountered regularly. This case report describes the long-term follow-up of a Chinese male patient with symptomatic severe radiation-associated atherosclerosis, who had carotid artery angioplasty and stenting performed, and the subsequent complications encountered: cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, baroreflex failure, and progressive carotid artery stenosis.
