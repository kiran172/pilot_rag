Title: Aortic Root Enlargement and Aortic Valve Replacement for Calcified Supravalvular and Valvular Aortic Stenosis in Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Case Report.

Abstract: Familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia is a rare disease with diverse clinical presentations ranging from premature ischemic heart disease to aortic root stenosis but rarely presents with anginal symptoms due to supravalvular and valvular aortic stenosis. We report a 19-year-old male patient with familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia with progressive supravalvular and valvular aortic stenosis that ultimately required aortic root enlargement and aortic valve replacement using a mechanical prosthesis, despite aggressive medical therapy. Surgical importance of this rare condition is highlighted.
