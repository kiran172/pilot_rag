Title: Balloon dilatation complications during esophagogastric anastomotic stricture treatment under fluoroscopy: Risk factors, prevention, and management.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Balloon dilatation (BD) is a common treatment for esophagogastric anastomotic stricture (EAS), but with complications. This study investigates the risk factors, prevention, and management of BD complications to provide clinical guidance.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 378 patients with EAS treated by BD from March 2011 to June 2021. The association between esophagogastric anastomotic rupture outcome and patient and stricture characteristics and treatment were analyzed by logistic regression.
RESULTS: BD was performed 552 times and technical success, 98.0%; overall clinical success, 97.8%; major adverse events, 1.3%; minor adverse events, 9.4%; mortality, 0.3%. Logistic regression showed that age (p = 0.080), sex (p = 0.256), interval from surgery to stricture development (p = 0.817), number of dilatations (p = 0.054), cause of stricture (p ≥ 0.168), and preoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.679) were not associated with anastomotic rupture. Balloon diameter (p < 0.001), preoperative radiotherapy (p = 0.003), and chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.021) were correlated with anastomotic rupture. All patients with type I and II ruptures resumed oral feeding without developing into type III rupture. Type III rupture occurred in six cases, who resumed oral feeding after 7-21 days of nasal feeding and liquid feeding. One patient died of massive bleeding after BD.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic treatment for type I and II ruptures and transnasal decompression and jejunal nutrition tubes for type III rupture, are suggested pending rupture healing. Tumor recurrence, preoperative radiotherapy, and balloon diameter affected the anastomotic rupture outcome.
