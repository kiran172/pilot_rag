Title: Prognosis of Heart Valve Calcification on Cardiovascular Events in Hemodialysis Patients without Central Venous Catheters.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Heart valvular calcification (HVC) is an important predictor of cardiovascular events (CEs) and all-cause mortality in dialysis patients. Patients in the early stage of dialysis or those with central venous catheters (CVC) are also at high risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It could be a confounding factor for the prognosis of HVC on CE.
METHODS: From March 2017 to April 2022, the prognosis of HVC on CE and all-cause mortality was studied retrospectively in 158 hemodialysis (HD) patients who used arteriovenous fistulas or arteriovenous grafts as vascular access and entered HD for more than 12 months.
RESULTS: Out of 158 patients, 70 (44.3%) were diagnosed with HVC via echocardiography. A total of 180 CEs occurred during follow-up. Among them, acute heart failure accounted for 62.66%, and its prevalence was significantly higher in the HVC group than that in the non-HVC group (p &lt; 0.0001). The cumulative incidence of CE-free survival in the HVC group was significantly lower than that in the non-HVC group (p = 0.030). Only 11 patients died, and there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the two groups (p = 0.560). Multivariate COX regression analyses showed that HD vintage, mitral valve calcification, and aortic valve regurgitation (AR)/aortic valve stenosis (AS) but not aortic valve calcification were risk factors for CE (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: After excluding the factors of the early stage of HD and CVC, HVC remained a predictor of adverse CE in HD patients.
