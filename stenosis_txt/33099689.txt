Title: Left atrial thrombus formation within a few days of hospitalization in semi-acute ischemic heart disease despite no atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Currently, the occurrence of left atrial thrombus despite the provision of heparinization within a few days of hospitalization without atrial fibrillation (AF) and mitral stenosis (MS) is rarely reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old woman presented with chest discomfort and dyspnea. Examination revealed ST elevation with sinus rhythm, congestive heart failure, and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Diuretics, a coronary vasodilator, and unfractionated heparin (15,000 units/day) were administered. Four days after hospitalization, her C-reactive protein level had increased; therefore, TTE was repeated, revealing a thrombus in the left atrial appendage, which was probably affected by heparin resistance because of low antithrombin (49%). On day 5, the patient underwent emergency removal of the thrombus, mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass.
CONCLUSION: Patients can exhibit low left ventricular contractility, even sinus rhythm without MS. Thus, TTE and subsequent coagulation tests including antithrombin must be performed to prevent thrombus.
