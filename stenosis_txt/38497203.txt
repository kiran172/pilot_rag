Title: Pulmonary edema in a young male with severe uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors and pan-vascular atherosclerosis: a case report.

Abstract: Cardiovascular risk factors are the cause of atherosclerotic disease, which can involve all the elastic and muscolo-elastic arteries. The etiopathogenesis of atherosclerosis is multifactorial since genetics, lifestyle, and comorbidities can be simultaneously involved. Clinical manifestations can be heterogeneous and include myocardial infarction, stroke, aortic aneurysms, renal artery stenosis, renal insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, etc. Currently, 70% of clinical events cannot be prevented with available drug therapy, statins included, and at least 10% of coronary events occur in apparently healthy individuals in the absence of major traditional risk factors. The case of a young male with a history of coronary artery disease and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors not properly treated who was admitted to the emergency department for pulmonary edema and high blood pressure is presented. During the diagnostic workup, a dramatic atherosclerotic involvement of all arterial trees emerged. Moreover, the patient presented with thrombosis of the right subclavian artery, which was treated with a heparin infusion and later complicated by cerebral hemorrhage with residual hemiplegia.
