Title: Impact of ramus coronary artery on computed tomography derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub> ) in no apparent coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The ramus artery contributes to the development of turbulence, which may influence computed tomography (CT) derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub> ) even without coronary artery disease (CAD). The relationship between ramus-induced turbulence and FFR<sub>CT</sub> is unclear.
METHOD AND RESULTS: A total of 120 patients with &lt;20% coronary stenosis assessed by both FFR<sub>CT</sub> and invasive coronary angiography were evaluated. The patients were divided into three groups: absent-ramus (n = 72), small-ramus that could not be analyzed by FFR<sub>CT</sub> (n = 18), and large-ramus that could be analyzed by FFR<sub>CT</sub> (n = 30). FFR<sub>CT</sub> measurements were performed at the proximal and distal segments of the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and ramus artery. With absent-ramus and small-absent ramus groups, FFR<sub>CT</sub> was measured at the distal end of the left main trunk at the same level for the proximal segments of the LAD and LCX. In absent-ramus group, proximal FFR<sub>CT</sub> showed no significant differences between three vessels (LAD = .96 ± .02; MID = .97 ± .02; LCX = .97 ± .02). However, in small and large-ramus groups, proximal FFR<sub>CT</sub> was significantly higher in the ramus artery than LAD and LCX (small-ramus, LAD = .95 ± .03, Ramus = .97 ± .02, LCX = .95 ± .03; large-ramus: LAD = .95 ± .03, Ramus = .98 ± .01; LCX = .96 ± .03; p &lt; .05). A large ramus was associated with a higher prevalence of a distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤.80 (odds ratio 7.0, 95% CI 1.2-40.1, p = .03). A proximal ramus diameter predicted distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤.80 (cut-off 2.1 mm, AUC .76, sensitivity 100%, specificity 52%, 95% CI .61-.90).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a large-ramus artery may cause an FFR<sub>CT</sub> decline in no apparent CAD.
