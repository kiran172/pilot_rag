Title: Prevalence of non-stenotic vulnerable carotid plaques in embolic stroke of undetermined source.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The latest research in ischaemic stroke pathogenesis is directed to unveil what is inside embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). Whether vulnerable non stenotic carotid plaques (NSTEPS), i.e. atherosclerotic lesions in carotid arteries determining a stenosis lower than 50%, may represent a cause of stroke in ESUS is a matter of debate. We aimed to study the prevalence of NSTEPS in an ESUS population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified a consecutive ESUS population admitted to the Stroke-Unit of Careggi Hospital, Italy from 2019 to 2022. Characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques (thickness, ulceration, hypodensity) and their location (ipsilateral versus contralateral to the stroke) were studied on carotid CT angiography (CTA). Follow-up data were recorded up to 24 months after stroke.
RESULTS: We identified 57 ESUS patients with unilateral ischaemic lesions studied with CTA; 53 (93%) had an ipsilateral carotid plaque, 81% contralateral, (p = 0.754) and 74% both. Plaques ipsilateral to stroke were ≥ 3 mm thick in 15 (28%) patients; hypodense in 14 (26%) and ulcerated in 5 (9%). The frequency of hypodensity was higher in ipsilateral compared to contralateral plaques (26% vs. 13%, p = 0.039) and ulceration was around four times more frequent, although not statistically significant (9% vs. 2%, p = 0.219). At follow-up, six patients had stroke recurrence (11%), 2 of them were in the same vascular territory of the former.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that plaques ipsilateral to stroke seem to be more frequently vulnerable and consequently more prone to embolization. Prospective data are needed to clarify the causal role of NSTEPS in ESUS.
