Title: Low Levels of IgM Recognizing 4-Hydroxy-2-Nonenal-Modified Apolipoprotein A-I Peptide and Its Association with the Severity of Coronary Artery Disease in Taiwanese Patients.

Abstract: Autoantibodies against apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) are associated with cardiovascular disease risks. We aimed to examine the 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) modification of ApoA-I in coronary artery disease (CAD) and evaluate the potential risk of autoantibodies against their unmodified and HNE-modified peptides. We assessed plasma levels of ApoA-I, HNE-protein adducts, and autoantibodies against unmodified and HNE-peptide adducts, and significant correlations and odds ratios (ORs) were examined. Two novel CAD-specific HNE-peptide adducts, ApoA-I251-262 and ApoA-I70-83, were identified. Notably, immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-ApoA-I251-262 HNE, IgM anti-ApoA-I70-83 HNE, IgG anti-ApoA-I251-262, IgG anti-ApoA-I70-83, and HNE-protein adducts were significantly correlated with triglycerides, creatinine, or high-density lipoprotein in CAD with various degrees of stenosis (&lt;30% or &gt;70%). The HNE-protein adduct (OR = 2.208-fold, p = 0.020) and IgM anti-ApoA-I251-262 HNE (2.046-fold, p = 0.035) showed an increased risk of progression from &gt;30% stenosis in CAD. HNE-protein adducts and IgM anti-ApoA-I251-262 HNE may increase the severity of CAD at high and low levels, respectively.
