Title: Cervical Foraminal Changes in Patients with Intermittent Arm Radiculopathy Studied with a New MRI-Compatible Compression Device.

Abstract: Diagnosing cervical foraminal stenosis with intermittent arm radiculopathy is challenging due to discrepancies between MRI findings and symptoms. This can be attributed to the fact that MRI images are often obtained in a relaxed supine position. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the Dynamic MRI Compression System (DMRICS) and to assess possible changes in cervical foramina, with both quantitative measurements and qualitative grading systems, with MRI during a simulated Spurling test. Ten patients (five women and five men, ages 29-45) with previously confirmed cervical foraminal stenosis underwent MRI scans using DMRICS. MRI images were acquired in both relaxed and provoked states. A radiologist assessed 30 foramina (C4-C7) on the symptomatic side in both patient positions. Quantitative and qualitative measures were performed, including the numeric rating scale (NRS) and the Park and Kim grading systems. The provoked state induced concordant neck and arm pain in 9 of 10 patients. Significant shifts in Park and Kim foraminal gradings were noted: 13 of 27 Park gradings and 9 of 27 Kim gradings escalated post provocation. No quantitative changes were observed. This pilot study indicates that the DMRICS device has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy for cervical radiculopathy, demonstrating induced cervical foraminal changes during a simulated Spurling test while performing MRI.
