Title: Impact of a Less Than 50% Residual Stenosis Following Vessel Preparation in Femoropopliteal Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Drug-coated balloon (DCB) has been established as first-line therapy in femoropopliteal (FP) intervention, and successful vessel preparation (VP) is considered a key element. However, the clinical impact of successful VP remains unknown. This retrospective study examined the clinical impact of successful VP in DCB FP intervention.
METHODS: In total, 268 patients (308 limbs) who underwent successful FP intervention using DCB without atherectomy devices for symptomatic lower extremity artery disease between March 2018 and December 2019 were included in this study (high-dose DCB: 69.8%; low-dose DCB: 30.2%). Successful VP was defined as <50% residual stenosis and <dissection grade D before DCB (the successful VP group). The primary outcome measure was primary patency, and its associated factors were evaluated.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 2.1 (interquartile range=1.1-2.7) years. Successful VP was achieved in 163 patients (60.8%). Primary patency and freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) were significantly higher in the successful VP group than in the nonsuccessful VP group (54.2% vs 33.0%, p<0.001; 69.9% vs 57.7%, p=0.047). In the successful VP group, high-dose DCB and low-dose DCB were comparable in primary patency and freedom from CD-TLR (53.2% vs 53.6%, p=0.48; 68.7% vs 70.9%, p=0.69). In nonsuccessful VP group, high-dose DCB demonstrated numerically higher primary patency but not statistically significant than low-dose DCB (44.5% vs 16.0%, p=0.06), whereas no significant difference in freedom from CD-TLR was observed (56.0% vs 58.9%, p=0.29). On multivariate analysis, successful VP and preballoon size to reference vessel diameter ratio were significantly associated with primary patency.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving successful VP before DCB was independently associated with primary patency in DCB FP intervention.
CLINICAL IMPACT: This study revealed that the successful vessel preparation (VP) before DCB and preballoonsize to reference vessel diameter ratio were independently associated with primary patency in DCB femoropopliteal intervention. When successful VP was achieved only before DCB treatment, the clinical outcomes were comparable between high-dose DCB and low-dose DCB at midterm follow-up.To maximized DCB efficacy, successful VP is very important in daily clinical practice.
