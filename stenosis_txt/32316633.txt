Title: Krukenberg Tumor in Association with Ureteral Stenosis Due to Peritoneal Carcinomatosis from Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma: A Case Report.

Abstract: Krukenberg tumors from pulmonary adenocarcinoma represent an extremely rare situation; only a few cases have been reported. The aim of this paper is to report an unusual such case in which almost complete dysphagia and ureteral stenosis occurred. The 62-year-old patient was initially investigated for dysphagia and weight loss. Computed tomography showed the presence of a thoracic mass compressing the esophagus in association with a few suspect pulmonary and peritoneal nodules, one of them invading the right ureter. A biopsy was performed laparoscopically on the peritoneal nodules. The right adnexa presented an atypical aspect; right adnexectomy was also found. The histopathological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed that the primitive origin was pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Although both peritoneal carcinomatosis and ovarian metastases from pulmonary adenocarcinoma represent a very uncommon situation, this pathology should not be excluded, especially in cases presenting suspect pulmonary lesions.
