Title: Book-Binding Technique in Totally Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy with Billroth I Reconstruction: Clinical Results and Outcomes in 188 Patients with Gastric Cancer.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic gastrectomy is widely used as a curative treatment for gastric cancer. Although delta-shaped anastomosis is commonly used for Billroth I anastomosis after totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG), it has some drawbacks. The book-binding technique (BBT) was developed as an alternative, and this study aimed to examine its short-term results in 188 consecutive cases.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study included patients who underwent BBT reconstruction after TLDG for gastric malignancy between 2011 and 2020. BBT is a technique for intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy, which is a triangular anastomosis with a linear stapler that does not require additional dissection or rotation of the duodenum. The short-term outcomes of BBT reconstruction and postoperative endoscopic findings were analyzed.
RESULTS: This study evaluated 188 patients who underwent TLDG and BBT reconstruction. Anastomotic stenosis and leakage occurred in 1.1% and 0.5% of the patients, respectively. The median time to the first diet was 3.1 days, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 11.9 days. BBT anastomoses were performed by 19 surgeons and took an average of 32.8 minutes to complete, with completion times decreasing as the surgical team became more proficient. On endoscopy performed 1 year postoperatively, 5.2% had reflux esophagitis (grade A or higher), 67.8% had gastritis (grade 1 or higher), 37.4% had residual food (grade 1 or higher), and 37.4% had bile reflux (grade 1).
CONCLUSIONS: BBT is a safe and feasible method for intracorporeal gastroduodenostomy in TLDG for patients with gastric malignancy and demonstrates good surgical outcomes.
