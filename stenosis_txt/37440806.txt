Title: Enigma of Bowel Angina: Unraveling Celiac Trunk Stenosis.

Abstract: The celiac axis is commonly involved in conditions that cause the narrowing or blockage of a celiac artery atherosclerosis and other vascular disease. Celiac artery compression syndrome is defined as chronic abdominal pain occurring because of compression of the celiac artery commonly in middle-aged (40 to 60 years) females. Various etiologies include atherosclerosis of mesenteries vessels, pancreatitis, median arcuate ligament syndrome, and tumor invasion. It is an uncommon condition, and symptoms include post-prandial abdominal pain mostly in the epigastrium, weight loss, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, and bloating. Patients are asymptomatic for a prolonged duration due to collateral blood supply to the bowel from the patent superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries. We present a case of a 67-year-old female who initially presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of small bowel obstruction, however, due to persistent abdominal pain, she underwent a CT scan suggestive of severe celiac trunk stenosis causing abdominal angina. The patient was managed conservatively and responded well with close follow-up.
