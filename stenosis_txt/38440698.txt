Title: Urosymphyseal fistula development following treatment for radiation-induced urethral stenosis in three patients with prostate cancer.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Urosymphyseal fistula is a rare and devastating complication that develops after radiation therapy for prostate cancer and is often triggered by the treatment of radiation-induced urethral stenosis. Here, we report our experience with urosymphyseal fistulas in three patients with prostate cancer.
CASE PRESENTATION: Three patients with prostate cancer developed urethral stenosis after radiotherapy. The management of urethral stenosis was suprapubic tube placement in case 1, direct vision internal urethrotomy in case 2, and excision with primary anastomosis in case 3. All patients presented with severe suprapubic or thigh pain or both. Urosymphyseal fistulas were detected on magnetic resonance imaging. Conservative treatment was unsuccessful, and all patients required debridement of the necrotic pubic symphysis and simple cystectomy. In cases 1 and 2, ileal conduit urinary diversion was performed.
CONCLUSION: Urologists need to be aware that urosymphyseal fistulas can occur in irradiated patients with prostate cancer, especially after urethral stenosis treatment.
