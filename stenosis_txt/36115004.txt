Title: Antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is a major valvular disease, which affects prognosis, and its prevalence is increasing due to an aging population. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a well-established therapy for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis across the entire risk spectrum, and the number of patients who undergo TAVR is increasing worldwide. Generally, ischemic and bleeding events after TAVR are not rare and can be devastating. Thus, antithrombotic therapy is recommended to prevent thromboembolic events after TAVR. Recently, a lot of randomized control trials have been published on antithrombotic therapy following TAVR, and the situation regarding the optimal antithrombotic regiment following TAVR is dramatically changing. This report reviews the current status and remaining issues in the field of optimal antithrombotic therapy following TAVR and leaflet thrombosis.
