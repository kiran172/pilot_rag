Title: Long-term efficacy and risk factors for stent occlusion in portal vein stent placement: a multi-institutional retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment for PV (portal vein) stenosis/occlusion can pose a fatal risk of massive bleeding from severe adhesions and collateral vessel formation. PV stents placement is a minimally invasive and effective procedure for PV stenosis/occlusion, but PV stents sometimes occlude. The relationship between post-stent PV hemodynamics and stent occlusion has not been thoroughly investigated. Certain precautions during PV stent placement may reduce the risk of stent occlusion. This study aimed to evaluate long-term outcomes of PV stent patency and investigate factors including PV hemodynamics associated with stent occlusion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four consecutive patients with PV stenosis/occlusion who underwent PV stent placement in four institutions between December 2006 and February 2021 were retrospectively examined. The primary study endpoints were technical success, clinical success, and cumulative stent patency rate. The secondary endpoints were risk factors of stent occlusion. A univariable Cox proportional hazards model with sixteen variables was used to determine predictors of stent occlusion. Factors with p-value ≤ 0.1 in univariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. Alpha was set at 0.05.
RESULTS: Technical and clinical success rates were 88.2% and 79.4%, respectively. Six patients (17.7%) experienced stent occlusion. The cumulative stent patency rate at six months, one year, and three years was 79.1%, 79.1%, and 65.9%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, the variables with p-value ≤ 0.1 were lesion length > 4 cm, hepatofugal collateral vein visualization after stent placement, and residual stenosis > 30% after stent placement. In the multivariate analysis, residual stenosis > 30% after stent placement was significantly associated with stent occlusion (hazard ratio, 10.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-108.44; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: PV stent placement was technically feasible and effective in improving portal hypertension. However, stent occlusion was not uncommon. Residual stenosis > 30% after stent placement was significantly associated with stent occlusion. We should pay attention to correctly assess the range of stenosis and release the stenosis as much as possible.
