Title: Aortic Valve Calcium Score Is Associated With Acute Stroke in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is the treatment of choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis who are at a moderate or higher surgical risk. Stroke is a recognised and serious complication of TAVR, and it is important to identify patients at higher stroke risk. This study aims to discover if aortic valve calcium score calculated from pre-TAVR computed tomography is associated with acute stroke in TAVR patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of 433 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR between January 2017 and December 2019 at the Hammersmith Hospital.
RESULTS: This cohort had a median age of 83 years (interquartile range, 78-87), and 52.7% were male. Fifty-two patients (12.0%) had a history of previous stroke or transient ischemic attack. Median aortic valve calcium score was 2145 (interquartile range, 1427-3247) Agatston units. Twenty-two patients had a stroke up to the time of discharge (5.1%). In a logistic regression model, aortic valve calcium score was significantly associated with acute stroke (odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.53; P = .02). Acute stroke was also significantly associated with peripheral arterial disease (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.65-10.65; P = .0018) and a longer procedure time (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .0006).
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve calcium score from pre-TAVR computed tomography is an independent risk factor for acute stroke in the TAVR population. This is an additional clinical value of the pre-TAVR aortic valve calcium score and should be considered when discussing periprocedural stroke risk.
