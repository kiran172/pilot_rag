Title: The correlation between imaging expression of P16 and S100 in hypertrophic ligamentum flavum.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common degenerative disease, which can lead to neurological dysfunction and requires surgical treatment. In the previous study, we used H&E staining and immunohistochemistry to qualitatively analyze the expression of S100 and P16 in the pathological process of ligamentum flavum (LF) hypertrophy in patients with LSS. To further explore the relationship between P16, S100 and LF hypertrophy in patients with LSS, we quantitatively detected S100 and P16 and their expressed products based on molecular biology techniques, and analyzed their imaging correlation.
METHODS: Before posterior lumbar surgery, LF thickness was measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Through the operation, we obtained the specimens of LF from 120 patients, all of whom were L4/5 LF. They were designated: simple lumbar disc herniation (LDH), single-segment spinal stenosis (SLSS), and double-segment LSS (DLSS). The detection of each side of LF was assessed. S100 and P16 and their expression products were detected by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
RESULTS: The dorsal mRNA expression of P16 in DLSS group was significantly higher than that in SLSS group. On the dorsal and dural side of LF, the expression of P16 mRNA and proteins in the LDH group was significantly lower than that in SLSS and DLSS groups. We found a correlation between the thickness of LF and the expression of P16. However, there was no significant difference in the expression of S100 mRNA and S100 protein on both sides of the ligament and among the three groups, and no significant correlation between the expression of S100 and the thickness of LF.
CONCLUSIONS: P16 is involved in the process of LF hypertrophy in patients with LSS, and the imaging thickness of LF is related to the expression of P16. No obvious evidence proves that S100 may be related to the hypertrophy of LF in patients with LSS.
