Title: Invasive aspergillosis of gastrointestinal debut without apparent respiratory involvement in an immunocompetent host.

Abstract: A 72-year-old female presented with abdominal pain and constipation and intestinal dilation was found. Abdominal computed tomography showed two areas of thickening and stenosis in the proximal jejunum and preterminal ileum, with an unknown etiology. Exploratory laparotomy was proposed but the patient suffered a sudden and progressive decrease in consciousness. Cranial computed tomography showed an ischemic area and a midline shift. Brain biopsies suggested infection by Aspergillus Fumigatus. Despite antifungal drugs, the patient had a progressive clinical deterioration and died. The autopsy concluded a systemic infection due to Aspergillus Fumigatus. Invasive aspergillosis is a serious fungal infection and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. It mainly affects the lungs, followed by the gastrointestinal tract. The most frequent location in gastrointestinal involvement is the small bowel. Gastrointestinal involvement is more frequent in invasive disease. Although, there are case reports of isolated gastrointestinal aspergillosis, even in immunocompetent patients without risk factors. The prognosis is poor.
