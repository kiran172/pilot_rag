Title: NIK Is a Mediator of Inflammation and Intimal Hyperplasia in Endothelial Denudation-Induced Vascular Injury.

Abstract: Neointimal hyperplasia is the main cause of vascular graft failure in the medium term. NFκB is a key mediator of inflammation that is activated during neointimal hyperplasia following endothelial injury. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in NFκB activation are poorly understood. NFκB may be activated through canonical (transient) and non-canonical (persistent) pathways. NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK, MAP3K14) is the upstream kinase of the non-canonical pathway. We have now explored the impact of NIK deficiency on neointimal hyperplasia following guidewire-induced endothelial cell injury and on local inflammation by comparing NIK activity-deficient alymphoplasia mice (NIKaly/aly) with control wild-type (NIK+/+) mice. Guidewire-induced endothelial cell injury caused neointimal hyperplasia and luminal stenosis and upregulated the local expression of NIK and the NFκB target chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and chemokine ligand 5 (RANTES/CCL5). Immunohistochemistry disclosed the infiltration of the media and intima by F4/80 positive macrophages. The intima/media ratio and percentage of stenosis were milder in the NIKaly/aly than in the NIK+/+ mice. Additionally, the gene expression for MCP-1 and RANTES was lower and F4/80+ cell infiltration was milder in the NIKaly/aly than in the NIK+/+ mice. Finally, circulating MCP-1 levels were lower in the NIKaly/aly than in the NIK+/+ mice, reflecting milder systemic inflammation. In conclusion, NIK is a driver of vascular wall inflammation and stenosis following guidewire-induced endothelial cell injury. NIK targeting may be a novel therapeutic approach to limit arterial stenosis following endothelial cell injury.
