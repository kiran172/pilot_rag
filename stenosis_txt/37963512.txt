Title: Electrocardiograms Do Not Detect Myocardial Ischemia in Patients With Williams Syndrome and Nonsyndromic Elastin Arteriopathy With Coronary Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Coronary artery stenosis (CAS) may affect up to 27% of patients with Williams syndrome (WS), which may lead to myocardial ischemia. Patients with WS face a 25- to 100-fold greater risk of sudden cardiac death, frequently linked to anesthesia. Assessing CAS requires either imaging while under general anesthesia or intraoperative assessment, with the latter considered the gold standard. Our study aimed to identify electrocardiogram (ECG) markers of myocardial ischemia in patients with WS or nonsyndromic elastin arteriopathy and documented CAS. We retrospectively reviewed patients with WS/elastin arteriopathy who underwent supravalvar aortic stenosis surgery and CAS assessment from January 1, 2006 to April 30, 2021. A pediatric electrophysiologist, not aware of the patients' CAS status, reviewed their preoperative ECGs for markers of ischemia. We assessed associations of study parameters using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher's exact tests. Of 34 patients, 62% were male, with a median age of 20 months (interquartile range: 8 to 34). CAS was present in 62% (21 of 34), 76% of whom (16 of 21) were male. There were no ECG indicators of myocardial ischemia in patients with CAS. In conclusion, CAS was present in >1/2 the children with WS/elastin arteriopathy who underwent repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis. CAS in WS/nonsyndromic elastin arteriopathy does not appear to exhibit typical ECG-detectable myocardial ischemia. ECGs are not a useful screening tool for CAS in WS/elastin arteriopathy. Given the high anesthesia-related cardiac arrest risk, other noninvasive indicators of CAS are needed.
