Title: Results of Haberal's Corner-Saving Ureteral Anastomosis Technique for Renal Transplantation: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Urological complications after renal transplantation (RT), including urine leaks, remain the most common type of surgical complications in the early post-transplant period. In this study we evaluated 324 consecutive RTs recipients in whom Haberal's corner-saving anastomosis technique was used for ureteroneocystostomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since January 2018, 461 RTs were performed at our center. Haberal's corner-saving anastomosis technique was used in 324 of these 461 RTs and the effectiveness of the technique was analyzed retrospectively. There were 115 female patients and 209 male patients, with a mean age of 42.1 Â± 13.9 years. The most common etiology resulting in RT was hypertension among the recipients.
RESULTS: We observed 8 (2.4%) ureteral complications in 7 recipients as follows: ureteral stenosis in 2 recipients (0.6%), anastomotic leaks in 1 (0.3%), concomitant leak-stenosis in 1 (0.3%), and vesicoureteral reflux in 3 (0.9%). Six complications were treated with interventional radiological techniques and 2 were treated surgically. There was no graft and patient loss in the event of urological complications.
CONCLUSION: Because of the low complication rate, we believe that Haberal's corner-saving ureteral anastomosis technique is a safe method for performing a ureteroneocystostomy.
