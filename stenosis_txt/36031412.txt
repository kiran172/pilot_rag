Title: Effect of Myocardial Tissue Characterization Using Native T1 to Predict the Occurrence of Adverse Events in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease and Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with a significantly higher rate of mortality. We aimed to evaluate whether diffuse myocardial fibrosis, determined using native T1 mapping, has prognostic utility in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization, in patients with CKD and severe AS who are evaluated for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Cardiac magnetic resonance with T1 mapping using the modified Look-Locker inversion recovery technique was performed in 117 consecutive patients with severe AS and CKD (stage ≥3). Patients were followed up to determine the occurrence of MACE. The mean age of the 117 patients in the cohort was 82 ± 8 years. Native T1 was 1,055 ms (25th- to 75th percentiles 1,031 to 1,078 ms), which is higher than previously reported in healthy controls. Patients with higher T1 times were more likely to have higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (4,122 [IQR 1,578 to 7,980] pg/ml vs 1,678 [IQR 493 to 2,851] pg/ml, p = 0.005) and a history of heart failure (33% vs 9%, p = 0.034). After median follow-up of 3.4 years, MACE occurred in 71 patients (61%). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 1.12, p = 0.006), native T1 >1,024 ms (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.06, p = 0.028), and New York Heart Association class (HR 1.56, 95% 1.09 to 2.34, p = 0.016) were independent predictors of MACE. Longer native T1 was associated with MACE occurrence in patients with CKD and severe AS.
