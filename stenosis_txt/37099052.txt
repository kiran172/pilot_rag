Title: Long-term valve performance of St Jude Medical Epic porcine bioprosthesis in aortic position.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to review long-term clinical outcomes and valve performance after Epic Supra valve implantation in aortic position. From 2011 to 2022, 44 patients (mean age 75 ± 8 years) underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with an Epic Supra valve at our hospital. Survival, incidence of late complications, and echocardiographic date were retrospectively analyzed. During a mean follow-up period of 6.2 ± 3.5 years, the overall survival rate was 91 ± 4% at 2 and 88 ± 5% at 5 years, while rates of freedom from major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were 86 ± 5% and 83 ± 6%, respectively. There was one case of reoperation for prosthetic valve endocarditis at 6 years after the initial surgery. Echocardiographic examinations showed 5-year rates of freedom from severe structural valve deterioration (SVD) and moderate SVD of 100 and 92%, respectively. There was no significant increase in mean pressure gradient or decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 1 week after surgery to the late follow-up period. Long-term clinical results and durability of the Epic Supra valve in aortic position were satisfactory.
