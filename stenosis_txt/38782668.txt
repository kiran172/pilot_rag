Title: Cardiac computed tomography post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is performed to treat aortic stenosis and is increasingly being utilised in the low-to-intermediate-risk population. Currently, attention has shifted towards long-term outcomes, complications and lifelong maintenance of the bioprosthesis. Some patients with TAVR in-situ may develop significant coronary artery disease over time requiring invasive coronary angiography, which may be problematic with the TAVR bioprosthesis in close proximity to the coronary ostia. In addition, younger patients may require a second transcatheter heart valve (THV) to 'replace' their in-situ THV because of gradual structural valve degeneration. Implantation of a second THV carries a risk of coronary obstruction, thereby requiring comprehensive pre-procedural planning. Unlike in the pre-TAVR period, cardiac CT angiography in the post-TAVR period is not well established. However, post-TAVR cardiac CT is being increasingly utilised to evaluate mechanisms for structural valve degeneration and complications, including leaflet thrombosis. Post-TAVR CT is also expected to have a significant role in risk-stratifying and planning future invasive procedures including coronary angiography and valve-in-valve interventions. Overall, there is emerging evidence for post-TAVR CT to be eventually incorporated into long-term TAVR monitoring and lifelong planning.
