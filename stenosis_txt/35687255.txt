Title: Learning Curve for Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: a Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) Analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Bariatric surgery is currently considered the most effective and durable treatment option for morbid obesity. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become a popular technique and may currently be the most frequently practiced surgical operation to treat obesity. However, no objective analyses of its learning curve have been reported.
OBJECTIVE: to analyze the learning curve for LSG.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included all LSGs performed in our hospital (University Hospital, Spain; Public Practice) from April 2013 to February 2016. The learning curve for LSG was evaluated using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. All variables among the learning curve phases were compared.
RESULTS: According to the CUSUM analysis, the learning curve was divided into three unique phases: early learning (the initial 26 patients), acquisition of skills (the middle 30 patients), and mastery of technique (the final 56 patients). The operative time and gastric stenosis significantly decreased with progression of the learning curve without differences in the 30-day postoperative complication rate, postoperative stay, or weight loss.
CONCLUSION: According to this study, the learning curve for LSG can be divided into 3 distinct phases, and about 25 patients are needed to demonstrate an improvement in surgical skill.
