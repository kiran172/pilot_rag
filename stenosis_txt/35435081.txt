Title: Linear Stapler versus Circular Stapler for Patients Undergoing Anastomosis for Laparoscopic Gastric Surgery: A Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anastomotic devices, including linear staplers (LSs) and circular staplers (CSs), have been widely used after laparoscopic gastric surgery. However, it is controversial whether linear stapling is superior to circular stapling for anastomosis. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the aspects of postoperative complications, particularly anastomotic stricture and anastomotic leakage, on the use of the two techniques to assist clinical decision-making.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search using Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library to evaluate studies that compared LSs and CSs after laparoscopic gastric surgery.
RESULTS: Pooled analysis suggested that patients who received LSs had fewer postoperative complications (P = 0.019), and anastomotic complications (P < 0.001), stricture (P = 0.001), and bleeding (P = 0.005). The subgroup analyses showed that LSs caused fewer anastomotic complications (P < 0.001), anastomotic strictures (P < 0.001), and postoperative hemorrhage (P = 0.007) in patients with gastric cancer than CS. In addition, LSs caused fewer incidences of overall morbidity (P = 0.042), anastomotic strictures (P = 0.023), postoperative hemorrhage (P < 0.001), wound infection (P < 0.001), and shorter length of hospital stay (P = 0.048) in patients with obesity. Furthermore, the subgroup analyses showed that the use of LS resulted in lower overall morbidity (P = 0.042), anastomotic stricture (P = 0.023), wound infection (P < 0.001), length of hospital stay (P = 0.048), and postoperative hemorrhage (P < 0.001) when applied in gastrojejunostomy, while LSs resulted in fewer anastomotic complications (P < 0.001), anastomotic stricture (P = 0.016) than CS when applied in esophagojejunostomy.
CONCLUSION: Compared with CSs, LSs yielded a lower incidence of overall morbidity, anastomotic complications, anastomotic stricture, bleeding, and wound infection, indicating that linear stapling is safer and more efficient than circular stapling when performing anastomosis after laparoscopic gastric surgery.
