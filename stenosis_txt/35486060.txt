Title: Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery with Kommerell's Diverticulum and Patent Ductus Arteriosus: Unusual Combination of Congenital Heart Anomalies and Clinical Manifestations in A Neonate.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A one-month-old neonate presented to the hospital with dyspnea and bloody stool, which happened suddenly and progressed over two days.
CASE PRESENTATION: Computed tomography and three-dimensional reconstruction of the trachea and heart was done, demonstrating significant trachea stenosis, aberrant right subclavian artery arising from Kommerell's diverticulum, and patent ductus arteriosus. Reconstruction of the aberrant subclavian artery, resection of the diverticulum, and ligation of ductus arteriosus was performed.
CONCLUSION: The case reported a rare combination of congenital anomalies and rare clinical manifestations at the same time. We thought the anatomical anomalies caused necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which lead to bloody stool.
