Title: Left main coronary artery stenosis treated with renal stents after Cabrol operation.

Abstract: Cabrol procedure is an alternative technique of anastomosing coronary arteries to the aortic root graft by an extra graft, if direct implantation of coronary arteries to the aortic root graft is not possible. The left main coronary artery stenosis is a rarely seen complication after aortic root operations. Treatment of large coronary arteries with renal stents is a challenging procedure. Herein, we, for the first time in the literature, present a case of left main coronary artery stenosis treated with renal stents after Cabrol operation.
