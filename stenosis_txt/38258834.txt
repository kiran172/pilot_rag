Title: Ureteroscopic lithotripsy with pressure-measuring ureteral access sheath for large ureteral stones.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ureteroscopic lithotripsy with pressure-measuring ureteral access sheath (PM-UAS) for large ureteral stones.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 258 consecutive patients with large ureteral stones ≥15 mm was enrolled. They were treated by ureteroscopic lithotripsy with PM-UAS in the oblique supine lithotomy position. The technology can precisely monitor and automatically control cavity pressure. The cavity pressure control value was set at -15 mmHg∼-5 mmHg. The cavity pressure limit value was set at 30 mmHg. Infusion flow rate was set at 100-200 ml/min. Postoperative data such as stone-free rate and complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: PM-UAS was successfully implanted in 225 patients at one stage. Eighteen cases of patients who had failed the first surgery were successfully treated with a second operation. Fifty-one cases with stones migrating up to the kidney were converted to flexible lithotripsy. The other 15 cases were converted to percutaneous nephrolithotomy due to significant ureteral stenosis. The operative time was 49.5 ± 11.2 min. The stone-free rates after one month and three months were 87.2% (212/243) and 94.2% (229/243), respectively. Complications from grade I to II were observed in 25(10.3%) patients. No other complications from grade III to V were noted.
CONCLUSION: The ureteroscopic lithotripsy with PM-UAS is safe and efficacious for large ureteral stones.
