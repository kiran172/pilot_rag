Title: Covid-19 associated free hanging clots in acute symptomatic carotid stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Thrombotic complications including stroke were previously described following Covid-19. We aim to describe the clinical and radiological characteristics of Covid-19 related with acutely symptomatic carotid stenosis (aSCS).
METHOD: All patients presenting with an aSCS were prospectively enrolled in an ongoing institutional database. Inclusion criteria for the Covid-19-aSCS group were a combination of both antigen test and a positive reverse-transcriptase (PCR) test for Covid-19 upon admission. Patients with additional potential etiologies for stroke including cardioembolism, carotid dissection or patients with stenosis of <50% on CTA were excluded. A cohort of non-Covid-19 related aSCS patients admitted to the same institution before the pandemic during 2019 served as controls.
RESULTS: Compared to controls (n = 31), Covid-19-aSCS (n = 8), were younger (64.2 ± 10.7 vs 73.5 ± 10, p = 0.027), and less frequently had hypertension (50% vs 90%, p = 0.008) or hyperlipidemia (38% vs 77%, p = 0.029) before admission. Covid-19-aSCS patients had a higher admission NIHSS score (mean 9 ± 7 vs 3 ± 4, p = 0.004) and tended to present more often with stroke (88% vs 55%, p = 0.09) rather than a TIA. Covid-19-aSCS patients had higher rates of free-floating thrombus and clot burden on CTA (88% vs 6.5%, p = 0.002). Covid-19 patients also less often achieved excellent outcomes, with lower percentage of mRS score of 0 after 90-days (13% vs 58%, p = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: Covid-19- aSCS may occur in a younger and healthier subpopulation. Covid-19- aSCS patients may have higher tendencies for developing complex clots and less often achieve excellent outcomes.
