Title: Dynamic 3D-CT angiography during swallowing for diagnosing hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage compression-induced thromboembolism.

Abstract: A 76-year-old man was admitted because of visual loss in his right eye, and was diagnosed with central retinal artery occlusion. Brain MRI revealed asymptomatic acute infarctions in the right middle cerebral artery territory. The proximal right internal carotid artery had migrated into a retropharyngeal location, presenting a 50% stenosis with calcified plaques, and was compressed by the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage during swallowing on dynamic 3D-CT angiography. Partial resection of the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage was performed and the postoperative course was uneventful. This case supports the utility of dynamic 3D-CT angiography during swallowing for diagnosing hyoid bone or thyroid cartilage compression-induced thromboembolism.
