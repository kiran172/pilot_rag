Title: Outcomes of endoscopic therapy in donation after cardiac death liver transplant biliary strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Biliary strictures after donation-after-cardiac-death (DCD) liver transplantation (LT) require multiple endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCP). The outcomes of endoscopic dilation and maximal stenting are not well-characterized in this high-risk population.
METHODS: DCD LT recipients who underwent LT and ERCP from 2012-2018 were selected. Anastomotic and non-anastomotic strictures were treated with balloon dilation and maximal stenting. A successful stent-free trial was defined as absence of biochemical, clinical or imaging evidence of strictures on follow-up exceeding 6 months. Adverse events were defined as unplanned admission or inpatient evaluation within 7 days of ERCP.
RESULTS: Forty-nine DCD LT recipients underwent ERCP and 34 patients were diagnosed with strictures (20 anastomotic). Stent-free trial was successful in 27 patients. Adverse events occurred after 20 ERCPs. Patients with anastomotic strictures required fewer stents (1.43 ± 1.37 vs 2.63 ± 1.66; P < 0.001), shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times (34.15 ± 20.9 vs 59.6 ± 30.7 minutes, P < 0.001; 5.99 ± 7.4 vs 14.73 ± 10.74 minutes, P < 0.001), fewer relapses (10% vs 57%, P = 0.003), shorter intervals between initial ERCP and stent-free success (136.9 ± 118.3 vs 399.56 ± 234.7; P = 0.003), and between LT and stent-free success (227.8 ± 171.9 vs 464.1 ± 224.6 days; P = 0.005) compared to non-anastomotic strictures.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic dilation and maximal stenting resolves biliary strictures in DCD LT recipients with sustained success and relatively few adverse events.
