Title: Intravascular Imaging to Guide Lithotripsy in Concentric and Eccentric Calcific Coronary Lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Calcified coronary lesions still represent a challenge for coronary angioplasty, with sub-optimal acute PCI results causing more frequent late stent failure.
PURPOSE: The study aimed at the evaluation of the immediate procedural outcome in a real-world consecutive population of a selective use of lithotripsy based on the intravascular imaging assessment with IVUS or OCT.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-one calcified stenoses (28 patients) out of a total of 455 lesions (370 patients) treated between November 2018 and May 2019 received IVL under intravascular imaging guidance. The majority of the IVL lesions had angiographically severe calcifications and were selected after intravascular imaging. A smaller group was identified by poor expansion after high-pressure balloon dilatation, in one case despite preliminary small burr Rotablation. After IVL, when OCT was performed calcium fractures were observed in 71% of cases. After OCT/IVUS guided stent optimization a satisfactory lumen enlargement (minimal stent area 7.09 ± 2.77 mm2) was observed with good stent expansion (residual area stenosis&lt;20% in 29 lesions, 93.5%) Peri-procedural complications were limited to one dissection at the distal edge requiring an additional stent and 3 peri-procedural myocardial infarctions. There were no periprocedural coronary perforations or pericardial effusions, and no in-hospital or 30 days stent thrombosis. When patients were divided into two subgroups according to a calcium arc ≤180° (Group A: 10 lesions, calcium arc 140 ± 24°; Group B: 21 lesions, calcium arc 289 ± 53°), at OCT Group B presented also a higher number of calcium fractures post IVL than group A (group A: 38% vs group B: 92%, p = 0.03). The in-stent minimum lumen diameter (MSD), the in stent minimal lumen area (MSA) and the acute gain, however, were similar between the two groups (acute gain group A: 1.22 ± 0.29 mm; group B: 1.31 ± 0.52 mm, p = 0.63).
CONCLUSIONS: A standardized algorithm applying intravascular imaging guidance of IVL facilitated second generation DES expansion delivers excellent immediate lumen expansion and patient outcome, both in concentric and eccentric calcifications.
