Title: Multicenter CT Image-Based Anatomic Assessment of Patients with Aortoiliac Aneurysm Undergoing Endovascular Repair with Iliac Branch Devices.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Global Iliac Branch Study (NCT05607277) is an international, multicenter, retrospective cohort study of anatomic predictors of adverse iliac events (AIEs) in aortoiliac aneurysms treated with iliac branch devices (IBDs).
METHODS: Patients with pre-IBD and post-IBD computed tomography imaging were included. We measured arterial diameters, stenosis, calcification, bifurcation angles, and tortuosity indices using a standardized, validated protocol. A composite of ipsilateral AIE was defined, a priori, as occlusion, type I or III endoleak, device constriction, or clinical event requiring reintervention. Paired t-test compared tortuosity indices and splay angles pretreatment and post-treatment for all IBDs and by device material (stainless steel and nitinol). Two-sample t-test compared anatomical changes from pretreatment to post-treatment by device material. Logistic regression assessed associations between AIE and anatomic measurements. Analysis was performed by IBD.
RESULTS: We analyzed 297 patients (286 males, 11 females) with 331 IBDs (227 stainless steel, 104 nitinol). Median clinical follow-up was 3.8 years. Iliac anatomy was significantly straightened with all IBD treatment, though stainless steel IBDs had a greater reduction in total iliac artery tortuosity index and aortic splay angle compared to nitinol IBDs (absolute reduction -0.20 [-0.22 to -0.18] vs. -0.09 [-0.12 to -0.06], P &lt; 0.0001 and -19.6° [-22.4° to -16.9°] vs. -11.2° [-15.3° to -7.0°], P = 0.001, respectively). There were 54 AIEs in 44 IBDs in 42 patients (AIE in 13.3% of IBD systems), requiring 35 reinterventions (median time to event 41 days; median time to reintervention 153 days). There were 18 endoleaks, 29 occlusions, and 5 device constrictions. There were no strong associations between anatomic measurements and AIE overall, though internal iliac diameter was inversely associated with AIE in nitinol devices (n<sub>AIE, nitinol</sub> = 8).
CONCLUSIONS: Purpose-built IBDs effectively treat aortoiliac disease, including that with tortuous anatomy, with a high patency rate (91.5%) and low reintervention rate (9.1%) at 4 years. Anatomic predictors of AIE are limited.
