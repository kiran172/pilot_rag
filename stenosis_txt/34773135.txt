Title: End-stage renal disease, calcification patterns and clinical outcomes after TAVI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic hemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or severely impaired kidney function (CKD) constitute a relevant share of patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, data on specific challenges and outcomes remain limited.
AIM: We aimed to characterize this patient population, evaluate clinical results and assess the significance of calcification patterns.
METHODS: This retrospective single-center analysis evaluated 2,712 TAVI procedures (2012-2019) according to baseline renal function: GFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 (CKD; n = 210), chronic hemodialysis (ESRD; n = 119) and control (CTRL; n = 2383). Valvular and vascular calcification patterns were assessed from contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography. Outcomes were evaluated in accordance with the VARC-2 definitions.
RESULTS: Operative risk was higher in ESRD and CKD vs. CTRL (STS-score 8.4% and 7.6% vs. 3.9%, p < 0.001) and patients with ESRD had more severe vascular calcifications (49.1% vs. 33.9% and 29.0%, p < 0.01). Immediate procedural results were similar but non-procedure-related major/life-threatening bleeding was higher in ESRD and CKD (5.0% and 5.3% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.01). 3-year survival was impaired in patients with ESRD and CKD (33.3% and 35.3% vs. 65.4%, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified ESRD (HR 1.60), CKD (HR 1.79) and vascular calcifications (HR 1.29) as predictors for 3-year and vascular calcifications (HR 1.51) for 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSION: Patients with ESRD and CKD constitute a vulnerable patient group with extensive vascular calcifications. Immediate procedural results were largely unaffected by renal impairment, yielding TAVI a particularly valuable treatment option in these high-risk operative patients. Mid-term survival was determined by underlying renal disease, cardiovascular comorbidities, and vascular calcifications as a novel risk marker.
