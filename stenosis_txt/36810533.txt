Title: Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis in an Adolescent Girl: An Atypical Presentation of an Unexpected Disease.

Abstract: Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a common cause of vomiting in the first few weeks of life, but in rare cases, it may occur in older subjects with a major risk of delayed diagnosis and complications. We describe the case of a 12-year-and-8-month-old girl who presented to our department for epigastric pain, coffee-ground emesis, and melena, which arose after taking ketoprofen. An abdomen ultrasound showed thickening (1 cm) of the gastric pyloric antrum, while upper-GI endoscopy documented esophagitis and antral gastritis with a non-bleeding pyloric ulcer. During her hospital stay, she had no further episodes of vomiting and was therefore discharged with a diagnosis of "NSAIDs-induced acute upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding". After 14 days, following recurrence of abdominal pain and vomiting, she was hospitalized again. At endoscopy, pyloric sub-stenosis was found, abdominal CT showed thickening of large gastric curvature and pyloric walls, and an Rx barium study documented delayed gastric emptying. On suspicion of idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, she underwent Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty with resolution of symptoms and restoration of a regular caliber of the pylorus. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, although occurring rarely in older children, should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of recurrent vomiting at any age.
