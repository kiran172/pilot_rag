Title: Myocardial Perfusion Imaging by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance: Research Progress and Current Implementation.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases pose a significant health and economic burden worldwide, with coronary artery disease still recognized as a major problem. It is closely associated with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet, and excessive alcohol consumption, which may lead to macro- and microvascular abnormalities in the heart. Coronary artery stenosis reduces the local supply of oxygen and nutrients to the myocardium and results in reduced levels of myocardial perfusion, which can lead to more severe conditions and irreversible damage to myocardial tissues. Therefore, accurate evaluation of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients with these risk factors is critical. As technology advances, magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging has become more accurate at evaluating the myocardial microcirculation and has shown a powerful ability to detect myocardial ischemia. The purpose of this review is to summarize the principle, research progress of acquisition and analysis, and clinical implementation of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) myocardial perfusion imaging.
