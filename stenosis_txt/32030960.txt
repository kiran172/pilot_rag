Title: [Research progress in minimally invasive treatment of cervical nerve root canal stenosis under total endoscope].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To review the research progress of total endoscopic minimally invasive technique in treating cervical nerve root canal stenosis (CNRCS).
METHODS: The related literature at home and abroad was extensively reviewed. The research history, current situation, research progress, advantages and disadvantages of minimally invasive treatment of CNRCS under total endoscope were summarized.
RESULTS: In recent years, with the continuous development of minimally invasive technique of total endoscope in spine surgery, the surgical treatment methods are also constantly innovated. Compared with the traditional open surgery, minimally invasive treatment of CNRCS under total endoscope can obtain better effectiveness, keep the stability of the cervical segment to the maximum extent, reduce the impact on the activity of the cervical spine and the occurrence of related surgical complications, which is an effective minimally invasive technology.
CONCLUSION: The minimally invasive treatment of CNRCS under total endoscope has achieved some results, which is expected to be one of the indispensable means to treat CNRCS, but it still needs to be improved.
