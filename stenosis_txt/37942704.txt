Title: Ross procedure with personalized external aortic root support.

Abstract: The Ross-Personalized External Aortic Root Support procedure is a surgical aortic valve replacement technique in which the autologous pulmonary valve is transposed in the aortic position to replace the malfunctioning aortic valve and a homograft is implanted in the pulmonary position. To prevent autograft dilatation, a Personalized External Aortic Root Support prosthesis is included in the proximal autograft anastomosis and wrapped around the ascending aorta. The aorta is transected transversely, the aortic valve is resected, and the coronary arteries are mobilized and cut out of the sinuses, leaving a rim. The pulmonary autograft is harvested by transecting the pulmonary artery and part of the right ventricular outflow tract. The autograft is approximated to the aortic root and inverted inside the ventricle. The proximal anastomosis is performed including the prosthesis between the aortic root and the autograft. The coronary buttons are threaded through appropriately positioned and sized holes in the prosthesis and reimplanted into the autograft. The ascending aorta is appropriately adapted and anastomosed with the distal autograft. When the patient is off cardiopulmonary bypass, the prosthesis can be closed longitudinally and is anchored to the distal aortic adventitia.
