Title: Low back pain improvement after cervical laminoplasty in patients without tandem lumbar stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to demonstrate the impact of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) on LBP after cervical laminoplasty for cervical spinal stenosis by analyzing the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 56 consecutive patients with cervical spinal stenosis who underwent cervical laminoplasty. Data on age, sex, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, JOA Back Pain Evaluation Questionnaire (BPEQ), and visual analog scale (VAS) were collected. The patients with VAS for LBP ≥ 30 or more were included and divided into two groups: without LSS [LSS (-)]or with LSS [LSS (+)]. Preoperative clinical characteristics and postoperative changes were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Preoperative VAS for LBP were 50.7 ± 16.2 mm and 59.8 ± 19.5 mm in the LSS (+) and LSS (-), respectively (p = 0.09). Patients in the LSS (-) were younger (57.6 ± 11.2 vs. 70.7 ± 8.6, p < 0.001) and showed significantly milder preoperative lumbar symptoms in terms of JOA and BPEQ. Patients in the LSS (-) group showed more postoperative changes in low back pain (18.3 ± 26.4 vs. - 8.3 ± 37.6, p = 0.005) and lumbar function (10.8 ± 25.7 vs. - 2.0 ± 22.5, p = 0.04) at BPEQ, and higher recovery in terms of VAS of LBP (23.0 ± 23.8 mm vs. 5.3 ± 25.9 mm, p = 0.008) and buttocks and low limbs (12.5 ± 35.0 mm vs. - 4.3 ± 24.4 mm, p = 0.029). Nine patients in the LSS (+) group underwent lumbar surgery at 12.8 ± 8.5 months after cervical laminoplasty.
CONCLUSION: LBP improved after cervical laminoplasty in patients without lumbar stenosis.
