Title: Long-term complications after extrahepatic cyst excision for type IV-A choledochal cysts.

Abstract: Forty-five adults with type IV-A choledochal cysts (CDC) who underwent extrahepatic cyst excision from January 2013 to December 2021 were followed up for a median interval of 25 months (range, 2 to 10 years) to observe the long-term complications in the remaining intrahepatic cyst. Late complications in varying combinations were seen in 10 patients, which included cholangitis and/or intrahepatic stones in 9 patients, intrahepatic bile duct stenosis with stones in 2 patients, anastomotic stricture in 6 patients, and left lobar atrophy with intrahepatic stones in 3 patients. Out of 6 patients who required re-do hepaticojejunostomy (HJ), three patients had left lobe atrophy with patent HJ anastomosis and a recurrent attack of cholangitis on follow-up at 3, 8, and 10 years. Complications occur frequently after extrahepatic cyst excision for type IV-A CDC and require a long-term follow-up.
