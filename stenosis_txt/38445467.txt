Title: Inflammatory Type Focal Cerebral Arteriopathy of the Posterior Circulation in Children: A Comparative Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Inflammatory type focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA-i) in the anterior circulation (AC) is well characterized, and the focal cerebral arteriopathy severity score (FCASS) reflects the severity of the disease. We identified cases of FCA-i in the posterior circulation (PC) and adapted the FCASS to describe these cases.
METHODS: In this comparative cohort study, patients from the Swiss NeuroPaediatric Stroke Registry with ischemic stroke due to FCA-i between January 2000 and December 2018 were analyzed. A comparison between PC and AC cases regarding pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and pediatric stroke outcome measure and FCASS was performed. We estimated infarct size by the modified pediatric Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score in children with AC stroke and the adapted Bernese posterior diffusion-weighted imaging score in the PC.
RESULTS: Thirty-five children with a median age of 6.3 (interquartile range, 2.7-8.2 [95% CI, 0.9-15.6]; 20 male; 57.1%) years with FCA-i were identified. The total incidence rate was 0.15/100â€…000/year (95% CI, 0.11-0.21). Six had PC-FCA-i. Time to final FCASS was longer in the PC compared with AC; the evolution of FCASS did not differ. Initial pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was higher in children with FCA-i in the PC with a median of 10.0 (interquartile range, 5.75-21.0) compared with 4.5 (interquartile range, 2.0-8.0) in those with AC-FCA-i. Different from the anterior cases, PC infarct volume did not correlate with higher discharge, maximum, or final FCASS scores (Pearson correlation coefficient [r], 0.25, 0.35, and 0.54).
CONCLUSIONS: FCA-i also affects the PC. These cases should be included in future investigations into FCA-i. Although it did not correlate with clinical outcomes in our cohort, the modified FCASS may well serve as a marker for the evolution of the arteriopathy in posterior FCA-i.
