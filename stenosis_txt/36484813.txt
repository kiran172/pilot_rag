Title: Validation of pressure-bounded coronary flow reserve using invasive coronary physiologic assessment.

Abstract: Coronary flow reserve (CFR) represents entire coronary compensatory capacity. While CFR assessment is recommended to identify patients at an increased risk of cardiovascular events and coronary microvascular dysfunction, invasive CFR measurement is often technically challenging. Although not well validated yet, pressure-bounded CFR (pbCFR) has been proposed as a simple surrogate to estimate impaired CFR. In this study, we evaluated coronary physiological characteristics of low pbCFR using detailed invasive assessment. Invasive physiological assessment including resting ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure (Pd/Pa), fractional flow reserve (FFR), resting and hyperemic mean transit time, index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), CFR, resistive reserve ratio, and microvascular resistance reserve (MRR) was performed in 107 patients in the left anterior descending coronary artery. pbCFR was calculated only with resting Pd/Pa and FFR. Patients were divided into low pbCFR and non-low pbCFR groups. Of 107 patients, 50 (46.7%) had low pbCFR. FFR (0.90 ± 0.05 vs. 0.83 ± 0.05, p < 0.001), hyperemic mean transit time (0.27 ± 0.17 vs. 0.21 ± 0.12, p = 0.04), and IMR (20.4 ± 13.2 vs. 15.0 ± 9.1, p = 0.01) were significantly higher in the low pbCFR group than their counterpart. While directly measured CFR did not differ significantly (4.4 ± 2.3 vs. 5.1 ± 2.8, p = 0.18), MRR was lower in the low pbCFR group (5.4 ± 3.0 vs. 6.8 ± 3.8, p = 0.047). The rates of CFR < 2.0 and IMR ≥ 25 were not significantly different between the 2 groups. In conclusion, although CFR did not differ significantly, IMR and MRR were impaired in patients with low pbCFR, suggesting pbCFR as a potential surrogate of coronary microvascular function in clinical practice.
