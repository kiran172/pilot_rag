Title: Virtual Reality-Guided Simulation for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in a Patient with Anatomical Anomalies: A Case Report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Virtual reality (VR)-guided GC simulation for patients with anatomical anomalies using cardiac computed tomography (CT) has been recently reported. Rotational atherectomy (RA) for the left circumflex (LCX) ostium is challenging due to the tortuous anatomy, acute angulation, and variable vessel size compared to other lesions. The appropriate positioning and coaxiality of the guide catheter (GC) are key factors for safely performing RA. It would be beneficial if it could be simulated prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). CASE REPORT We treated a 55-year-old man with angina. We performed coronary angiography and detected an ostial calcified lesion of the LCX. We needed RA for this lesion, but PCI was very difficult and challenging. CT revealed right-sided aortic arch with stenosis of left subclavian artery from the Kommerell diverticulum at the distal part of the aortic arch. Therefore, the approach site for PCI was limited. We simulated the appropriate guide catheter and approach site for PCI by VR. PCI was successfully performed with RA, as in the VR simulation. CONCLUSIONS We successfully performed PCI for an ostial calcified lesion of the LCX in a patient with a right-sided aortic arch. Use of VR-guided GC simulation is a useful new option that can help visualize the anatomy and ensure safe procedures for complex lesions.
