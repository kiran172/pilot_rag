Title: Nonintubated Tracheal Surgery.

Abstract: The article describes an anesthetic management strategy for resection of the cervical trachea due to benign stenosis without using an endotracheal tube. The strategy includes: (1) insertion of an airway stent in the stenotic area, (2) insertion of a supraglottic airway device (SGAD), and (3) advancing a jet ventilation catheter through the SGAD. The stent is removed during surgery together with the resected part of the trachea. The technique of nonintubated tracheal resection allows the surgeon to work most comfortably and helps the anesthesiologist properly maintain the patient's vital functions in the operating room.
