Title: Lumbar fusion efficacy with local bone grafting and platelet-rich plasma: a clinical investigation in treating degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis in the elderly.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The focus of this study was to comprehensively assess the clinical outcomes of lumbar fusion utilizing autogenous bone grafting and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the management of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) in elderly individuals.
METHOD: A cohort of 40 senior individuals diagnosed with DLSS, who underwent treatment at our hospital between January 2020 and March 2022. The control group consisted of 20 participants who underwent local bone grafting for intervertebral fusion, while the observation group comprised 20 individuals who received a combination of local bone grafting and PRP for lumbar fusion. MRI imaging was employed for a comprehensive assessment of spinal structure. The efficacy of spinal fusion was evaluated through MRI imaging. Clinical treatment outcomes were assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scoring systems. Postoperative low back pain was quantified using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
RESULT: During the final follow-up, the observation group demonstrated a significant increase in the inner diameter of the spinal canal and the height of the disc space compared to the control group (P < 0.05).Moreover, the observation group displayed a larger spinal canal than the control group (P < 0.05).A reduced lesion score in the bone grafting region was observed in the observation group compared to the control group during the final follow-up (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the observation group displayed a higher intervertebral fusion continuity score than the control group (P < 0.05).The JOA score in the observation group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.05), while the ODI score was significantly lower (P < 0.05). Of note, the back pain VAS score in the observation group was lower than in the control group at both the three months post-surgery mark and the final follow-up (P < 0.05).The satisfaction rate and overall satisfaction rate in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), while the dissatisfaction rate in the observation group was evidently lower than in the control group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In the management of DLSS in elderly individuals, the utilization of local bone grafting and PRP in lumbar spinal fusion yields notable outcomes.
