Title: Surgical Melody速 valve implantation to replace the mitral valve in children.

Abstract: In this video tutorial we present our technique for hybrid surgical Melody速 valve implantation in the left atrio-ventricular valve (henceforth referred to as mitral valve) position in children. The key steps, including valve preparation, implantation, and balloon dilatation, are depicted. We discuss the short-term outcome, we red-flag potential complications, and we hypothesize medium-term outcomes, including late balloon dilatation.
