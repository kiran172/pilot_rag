Title: Aliskiren Reduces the Adrenal Zona Glomerulosa Apoptosis and Autophagy in Wistar Rats with 2K1C Hypertension.

Abstract: Hypertension is a disease classified as primary or secondary, manifested not only by elevation of blood pressure but also involved in structural and functional changes of target organs. Renal artery stenosis is a leading factor of secondary hypertension, and its progress is associated with overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aliskiren is a renin inhibiting drug that suppresses RAAS and culminates in decreased renin release, plasma angiotensin II concentration, and inhibition of aldosterone secretion. In this sense, the aim of the present study was to analyze the structural and ultrastructural morphophysiology of the adrenal glomerular zone, after treatment with aliskiren in Wistar rats with 2K1C hypertension. Parameters as structure and ultrastructure of the adrenal glomerular zone, cellular apoptosis, nuclear cell proliferation, and AT1 receptor expression were analyzed by immunostaining and electron microscopy. Our results showed that the hypertensive animals treated with aliskiren presented a reestablishment of AT1 receptor expression and decrease in apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, treatment with aliskiren improves the cell aspects in the adrenal glomerular zone, evidenced by ultrastructural analysis through preserved nuclei and well-developed mitochondria. Therefore, our evidence suggests that aliskiren has a beneficial effect on the adrenal glomerular zone remodeling in animals with renovascular hypertension.
