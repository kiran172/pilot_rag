Title: A multilevel posterior tension band-sparing laminectomy for intraspinal lesions: patient series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) represents a major development in spinal tumor surgery. However, considering that many intradural lesions compromise multiple spinal segments, MISS has certain limitations. Thus, some intraspinal lesions still require traditional approaches. Because laminectomy has been shown to predispose patients to kyphosis, laminoplasty and hemilaminectomy are the most widely used approaches to preserve the posterior tension band (PTB). However, these techniques are not devoid of complications. To overcome these issues, the authors modified a previously described technique to preserve the PTB while removing various types of intradural lesions. This procedure was originally designed to treat lumbar stenosis and was modified to avoid muscle ischemia during long procedures.
OBSERVATIONS: Between 2014 and 2021, the authors found 17 cases of spinal lesions with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up after surgical treatment using their approach. No significant postoperative changes in the paraspinal Goutallier grade or spinal angles were observed. The cross-sectional area of the measured paraspinal muscles decreased 6% postoperatively. By performing certain technical modifications in this PTB-sparing (PBS) laminectomy, the authors avoided ipsilateral muscle ischemia.
LESSONS: In this initial series, PBS laminectomy proved to be a safe, versatile, inexpensive, and reliable technique to remove intraspinal lesions.
