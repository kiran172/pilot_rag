Title: Large Tissue Debris Causing Cerebral Embolism After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Cerebral vascular embolism is one of the complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Thrombolytic therapy is not expected to be effective when embolic material consists of a large tissue fragment. Instead, mechanical aspiration may be more effective therapy for acute cerebral infarction after TAVR. Here, we describe the case of an 87-year-old woman with aortic valve stenosis and heart failure who underwent TAVR using a self-expandable valve. Acute cerebral infarction with left middle cerebral artery occlusion caused by a large tissue fragment developed after the procedure.
