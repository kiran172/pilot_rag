Title: Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia in a Patient With Limited Systemic Sclerosis.

Abstract: Chronic mesenteric ischemia typically develops secondary to the development of atherosclerosis within mesenteric vessels leading to the insufficient blood supply. While autoimmune conditions are an established independent risk factor for developing atherosclerotic plaques, the association between scleroderma and chronic mesenteric ischemia has been less studied. We present a case of a 64-year-old female with limited systemic sclerosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who presented to the Gastroenterology Clinic with progressive abdominal pain who was subsequently diagnosed with chronic mesenteric ischemia secondary to superior mesenteric artery stenosis and successfully treated with endovascular stenting.
