Title: The Effects of Valvular Heart Disease on Atrial Conduction During Sinus Rhythm.

Abstract: Different arrhythmogenic substrates for atrial fibrillation (AF) may underlie aortic valve (AV) and mitral valve (MV) disease. We located conduction disorders during sinus rhythm by high-resolution epicardial mapping in patients undergoing AV (n = 85) or MV (n = 54) surgery. Extent and distribution of conduction delay (CD) and block (CD) across the entire right and left atrial surface was determined from circa 1880 unipolar electrogram recordings per patient. CD and CB were most pronounced at the superior intercaval area (2.5% of surface, maximal degree 6.6%/cm2). MV patients had a higher maximal degree of CD at the lateral left atrium than AV patients (4.2 vs 2.3%/cm2, p = 0.001). A history of AF was most strongly correlated to CD/CB at Bachmann's bundle and age. Although MV patients have more conduction disorders at the lateral left atrium, disturbed conduction at Bachmann's bundle during sinus rhythm indicates the presence of atrial remodeling which is related to AF episodes.
