Title: Relationship of 82Rb PET territorial myocardial asynchrony to arterial stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: 82Rb PET/CT rest/regadenoson-stress data enable quantification of left ventricular rest and stress function, perfusion, and asynchrony. Our study was conducted to determine which parameters best identify patients with multi-vessel disease (MVD) and individual stenosed arteries.
METHODS: PET/CT data were reviewed retrospectively for 105 patients referred for evaluation of CAD, who also underwent angiography. % arterial stenosis was determined quantitatively at a core laboratory. Severe stenosis was defined as ≥ 70%, and MVD as 2 or more stenosed arteries. Segmental MBF was calculated from first-pass data for arterial territories. Regional rest and stress systolic and diastolic asynchrony (Asynch) scores were determined from visual examination of phase polar maps.
RESULTS: 65 vessels had stenoses ≥ 70%. 15 patients had MVD. ROC area under curve (ROC AUC) for identifying patients with MVD was 83% for Asynch and 73% for MFR. ROC AUC for identifying individual arterial territories with stenoses ≥ 70% was 81% and 72% for Asynch and MFR.
CONCLUSION: 82Rb PET/CT accurately identified patients with MVD and individual stenosed territories, with regional asynchrony measurements contributing significantly to identify patients with CAD.
