Title: Respiratory problems and associated factors following endoscopic balloon dilatation procedure in children with acquired subglottic stenosıs.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) offers a safe and non-invasive surgical option for the treatment of subglottic stenosis. Patient selection is important to achieve good results and to detect which patients are more prone to the development of complications. The aim of this study was to determine predictors of postoperative problems and early complications in primary EBD surgeries.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was made of patients with acquired subglottic stenosis who were operated on with the EBD technique between January 2010 and December 2019 in the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Department of Baskent University Hospital. Demographic data including the age and sex of the patients were collected together with etiology, presence of chromosomal or craniofacial anomaly (C/CA), duration of prolonged intubation (DPI), and extubation dilatation timeframe (EDT). Intra and postoperative follow-up data were recorded of the need for intubation or tracheotomy, development of desaturation, and grade and type of stenosis.
RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 2:1. The patients comprised 42 males and 22 females with a mean age of 296.52 ± 551.93 days. The cause of prolonged intubation was surgery for congenital heart disease in 50 (78.1%) patients and prematurity in 14 (21.9%). The type of lesion was acute granulation in 44 (72.1%) and chronic granulation in 17 (27.9%) patients. C/CA was determined in 13 patients, the mean grade of stenosis was 76.33 ± 15.21%, mean DPI was 25.25 ± 35.49 days, and mean EDT was calculated as 78.23 ± 373.82 days. Desaturation following endoscopic balloon dilatation developed in 26 (40.6%), orotracheal intubation was required in 10 (15.6%), tracheotomy in 10 (15.6%), and cardiopulmonary arrest occurred in 4 (6.25%). Prematurity, a longer duration of preoperative intubation, longer time from extubation to dilatation, older age, and higher grade of stenosis were determined as factors associated with postoperative early respiratory complications.
CONCLUSION: EBD indication should be carefully considered in children with acquired subglottic stenosis. To achieve better results and minimise complications, EBD should be performed without delay.
