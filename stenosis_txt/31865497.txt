Title: Measurement errors in serial echocardiographic assessments of aortic valve stenosis severity.

Abstract: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) evaluation of aortic stenosis (AS) is routinely performed using the continuity equation. Inaccurate measurements of the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract (LVOT) diameter are considered the most common source of error in AS grading. We hypothesized that inconsistency in LVOT velocity time integral (VTI) is an under-recognized cause of AS assessment error. We sought to determine which parameters contribute most towards inconsistencies in AS grading by studying the prevalence of different errors in a historic cohort. We identified patients with mild to severe AS with multiple studies from our database from 1994 to 2018 (n = 988 patients, 2859 studies). Errors were defined when: (1) LVOT diameter changed by > 2 mm, (2) LVOT VTI changed by > 15% without change in LV function from the initial TTE, (3) aortic valve (AV) maximum velocity (Vmax), mean pressure gradient (ΔP) or AV VTI decreased by > 15% without change in LV function from prior study. The most common error was the LVOT VTI measurement with 22% prevalence. LVOT diameter, AV VTI, AV Vmax and AV ΔP measurement caused errors in < 7% studies. Patients with normal LV function and more severe AS were more likely to have LVOT VTI errors (P < 0.05). LVOT VTI is a frequent, under-recognized source of error in assessing AS. Greater attention should be directed toward the proper positioning of the pulsed Doppler sample volume, particularly in patients with higher grades of AS and normal systolic function, to ensure accurate and reproducible assessment of AS.
