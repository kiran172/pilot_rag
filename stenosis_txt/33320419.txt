Title: Evaluation of functional outcomes after disc excision of deep endometriosis involving low and mid rectum using standardized questionnaires: a series of 80 patients.

Abstract: AIM: The aim was to assess the functional outcome and quality of life in patients with low and mid rectal endometriosis who have undergone disc excision using a semicircular transanal staple device, a procedure we have named the Rouen technique.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing the Rouen technique between October 2009 and November 2018. Preoperative and postoperative demographic and operative data were recorded prospectively (mean ± SEM). Postoperative complications were recorded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Rectal function and quality of life were assessed by the low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) and Bowel Endometriosis Syndrome (BENS) scores respectively at ≥6 months.
RESULTS: The Rouen procedure was performed on 80 patients (29.7 ± 4.3). The mean diameter of resected specimens was 57 ± 10 mm, and the height of the rectal suture from the anal verge was 4.6 ± 1.2 cm. The Clavien-Dindo complications were Clavien-Dindo 1 (leg compression), Clavien-Dindo 2 (urinary tract infection, bladder self-catheterization) and Clavien-Dindo 3b (bowel obstruction, rectovaginal fistula, pyelic dilation, colorectal stenosis after resection). A rectovaginal fistula (Clavien-Dindo 3b) developed in nine (11.3%) patients and their stoma could be reversed after 99-162 days. The majority of patients (n = 50, 62.5%) had normal postoperative rectal function with LARS score ≤20. However, minor (LARS ≥ 21-29) and major rectal dysfunction (LARS ≥ 30) was seen in 18 (22.5%) and 12 (15%) patients respectively. Quality of life as measured using the BENS score was normal (BENS score 0-8) in 51 (63.8%) patients, slightly reduced (BENS score 9-16) in 24 (30%) patients and in only five (6.3%) was this a major issue (BENS score > 17). The development of a rectovaginal fistula was independently related to risk of major rectal dysfunction (adjusted OR 6.3, 95% CI 1.3-30.6).
CONCLUSIONS: In our series of 80 patients with transmural low and mid rectal endometriosis disc excision using a semicircular staple device can result in good functional outcomes and quality of life and avoid the complexity and potential complications of a low anterior resection.
