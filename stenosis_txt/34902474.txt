Title: Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty Versus Standard Uncoated Balloon Angioplasty for Long Femoropopliteal Lesions: Post Hoc Analysis of the 24-Month Results of the AcoArt I Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Restenosis is a common complication after endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment has been proven safe and effective in reducing the rate of restenosis for simple and short lesions. However, the clinical results of DCBs for long lesions are still very limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DCBs in the treatment of long femoropopliteal artery disease. And the results of this study will also complement the existing evidence of DCB treatment of long lesions.
METHODS: Patients with lesion length ≥ 15cm according to computed tomography angiography (CTA) or angiography in the AcoArt I Study were included into this study. Based on the balloon catheter used in treatment, patients were divided into the DCB group and the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) group. The demographic, lesion, and procedural characteristics and 24-month follow-up results were compared between the 2 groups. The primary efficacy endpoints were angiographic late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months or at the time of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), primary patency (PP), freedom from CD-TLR, and changes in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford class during 24 months of follow-up. The safety endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse events.
RESULTS: The total number of patients was 87, including 42 in the DCB group and 45 in the PTA group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in demographic, lesion,and procedural characteristics. The 6-month follow-up angiography showed that the LLL was significantly smaller in the DCB group than the PTA group (0.27 ± 0.90 mm vs 1.32 ± 0.91 mm; P < 0.001). At 24 months, compared with the PTA group, the DCB group had a significantly higher rate of freedom from CD-TLR (81.58% vs 43.18%; P < 0.001) and a significantly higher PP rate (46.88% vs 15.00%; P = 0.003). The DCB group had a significantly higher ABI than the PTA group at 6, 12, and 24 months (P < 0.001, P = 0.004 and P = 0.018, respectively). The DCB group had a better Rutherford class than the PTA group at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.033 and P = 0.012, respectively); the Rutherford class did not significantly differ between the 2 groups at 24 months (P = 0.127). The incidence of major adverse events did not significantly differ between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of the DCB is superior to a standard uncoated balloon in treating long lesions during 24 months of follow-up. Furthermore, the safety of the DCB is equivalent to that of PTA.
