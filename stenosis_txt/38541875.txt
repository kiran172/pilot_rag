Title: The Effect of Hydrostatic Pressure on Coronary Flow and Pressure-Based Indices of Coronary Stenosis Severity.

Abstract: Background: To assess whether hydrostatic pressure gradients caused by coronary height differences in supine versus prone positioning during invasive physiological stenosis assessment affect resting and hyperaemic pressure-based indices or coronary flow. Methods: Twenty-three coronary stenoses were assessed in twenty-one patients with stable coronary artery disease. All patients had a stenosis of at least 50% visually defined on previous coronary angiography. Pd/Pa, iFR, FFR, and coronary flow velocity (APV) measured using a Doppler were recorded across the same stenosis, with the patient in the prone position, followed by repeat measurements in the standard supine position. Results: When comparing prone to supine measurements in the same stenosis, in the LAD, there was a significant change in mean Pd/Pa of 0.08 ± 0.04 (p = 0.0006), in the iFR of 0.06 ± 0.07 (p = 0.02), and in the FFR of 0.09 ± 0.07 (p = 0.003). In the Cx, there was a change in mean Pd/Pa of 0.05 ± 0.04 (p = 0.009), iFR of 0.07 ± 0.04 (p = 0.01), and FFR of 0.05 ± 0.03 (p = 0.006). In the RCA, there was a change in Pd/Pa of 0.05 ± 0.04 (p = 0.032), iFR of 0.04 ± 0.05 (p = 0.19), and FFR of 0.04+-0.03 (p = 0.004). Resting and hyperaemic coronary flow did not change significantly (resting delta APV = 1.6 cm/s, p = 0.31; hyperaemic delta APV = 0.9 cm/s, p = 0.85). Finally, 36% of iFR measurements and 26% of FFR measurements were re-classified across an ischaemic threshold when prone and supine measurements were compared across the same stenosis. Conclusions: Pd/Pa, iFR, and FFR were affected by hydrostatic pressure variations caused by coronary height differences in prone versus supine positioning. Coronary flow did not change signifying a purely pressure-based phenomenon.
