Title: Endovascular treatment for a ruptured lumbar artery aneurysm in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1.

Abstract: The present medical case report describes successful endovascular treatment via stent graft and coil packing for a ruptured lumbar artery aneurysm in a 55-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1. Although less common, vasculopathy, such as an aneurysm, stenosis, rupture, and arteriovenous fistula, have been reported and can be a cause of death for patients with this disorder. However, only a few cases of a ruptured lumbar aneurysm have been reported.
