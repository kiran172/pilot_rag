Title: Outcomes of self-expandable metal stent placement for malignant oesophageal strictures.

Abstract: AIM: To analyse the outcomes of oesophageal stenting for malignant strictures and to study the correlation between the follow-up time and major complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with oesophageal malignancy who underwent stent placement between 2011 and 2016 for dysphagia were included. The data included age, sex, dysphagia, length and location of stenosis, date of stent placement, complications, follow-up time, and survival.
RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety-eight patients were included in the study. Minor complications occurred in 113 patients (37.9%) including chest pain (17.1%), foreign body sensation (25.5%), hiccups (1.68%), and reflux symptoms (27.5%). Major adverse events occurred in 93 (31.1%) patients including pneumonia (25.5%), migration (3%), perforation (0.67%), bleeding (1.68%), and restenosis (22.5%). oesophago-airway fistula occurred in 45 (15.1%) patients. The incidence of recurrent dysphagia, pneumonia, and oesophago-airway fistula increased over 3 months and decreased after another 3 months. The incidence of major complications as a percentage of survivors remained high after 3 months (>40%). Spearman analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between the incidence and the follow-up time over this period (rs=0.907, p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: The major complications of oesophageal stenting increased with time over 3 months and remained high for another 3 months. Therefore, stenting should be considered for palliation in patients with short expected survival (usually <3 months).
