Title: Application of cardiovascular 3-dimensional printing in Transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been performed for nearly 20â€‰years, with reliable safety and efficacy in moderate- to high-risk patients with aortic stenosis or regurgitation, with the advantage of less trauma and better prognosis than traditional open surgery. However, because surgeons have not been able to obtain a full view of the aortic root, 3-dimensional printing has been used to reconstruct the aortic root so that they could clearly and intuitively understand the specific anatomical structure. In addition, the 3D printed model has been used for the in vitro simulation of the planned procedures to predict the potential complications of TAVR, the goal being to provide guidance to reasonably plan the procedure to achieve the best outcome. Postprocedural 3D printing can be used to understand the depth, shape, and distribution of the stent. Cardiovascular 3D printing has achieved remarkable results in TAVR and has a great potential.
