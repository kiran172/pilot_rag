Title: Successful management of acute left main coronary occlusion following transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an established, highly effective procedure in selected patients with severe degenerative aortic valve stenosis at high risk for conventional surgery.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 74-year-old Caucasian man who had an acute left main occlusion after transcatheter implantation of balloon-expandable valve prosthesis, followed by coronary intervention with successful recanalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute coronary occlusion is a rare life-threatening complication of transcatheter aortic valve implantation that is poorly predictable and requires immediate diagnosis and treatment.
