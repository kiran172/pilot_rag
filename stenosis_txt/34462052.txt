Title: Frequency and Significance of Right Bundle Branch Block and Subclinical Coronary Atherosclerosis in Asymptomatic Individuals.

Abstract: Limited data exist regarding the association between right bundle branch block (RBBB) and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. This study investigated the influence of RBBB on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis detected by coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) in an asymptomatic population. We retrospectively analyzed 7,205 asymptomatic individuals (mean age 54.4 ± 7.9 years and 4,695 men [65.2%]) with no prior history of coronary artery disease who voluntarily underwent CCTA and 12-lead electrocardiographic evaluation as part of a general health examination. The degree and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis were evaluated by CCTA, and ≥50% diameter stenosis was defined as significant. The association between RBBB and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis was determined by logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses. Of study participants, 116 (1.6%) had RBBB. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, there were no statistically significant differences in the adjusted odds ratios of RBBB for any atherosclerotic plaque (0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 1.32), calcified plaque (0.78, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.19), noncalcified plaque (1.44, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.69), mixed plaque (1.12, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.39), and significant coronary artery stenosis (0.92, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.74). Similarly, in the 5: 1 propensity score-matched population (n = 696), there were no statistically significant differences in the odds ratios for any subclinical coronary atherosclerosis between participants with and without RBBB (p for all >0.05). In conclusion, through this large cross-sectional study of asymptomatic individuals who underwent CCTA and electrocardiography evaluation, individuals with RBBB were not associated with an increased risk of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis compared with those without RBBB.
