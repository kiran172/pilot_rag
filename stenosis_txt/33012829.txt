Title: Left-sided dacryostenosis in a dog.

Abstract: A 1.5-year-old neutered male black Labrador retriever dog was presented to a referral teaching hospital for evaluation of chronic, continuous, mucoid discharge and associated conjunctivitis of the left eye. Nasolacrimal flush revealed a patent duct on the right side but not on the left side. Computed tomography (CT) with a dacryocystogram identified severe stenosis or atresia of the left nasolacrimal duct. The patient was referred to a veterinary ophthalmologist for a reconstruction of the left nasolacrimal system. Ultimately, a conjunctivobuccostomy was performed and resolved all ocular clinical signs. Key clinical message: Dacryostography, a procedure in which the lacrimal punctum is cannulated, and iodinated contrast is instilled into the nasolacrimal system was combined with CT to enable excellent visualization and evaluation of the nasolacrimal canal.
