Title: Minimally Invasive Short-Segment Anteroposterior Surgery for Thoracolumbar Osteoporotic Fractures with Canal Compromise: A Prospective Study with a Minimum 2-Year Follow-up.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study with a minimum follow-up of 24 months.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the results of minimally invasive anteroposterior surgery for osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) associated with bony spinal canal compromise in elderly patients.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: There is a recent increase in the incidence of osteoporosis with OVFs, causing an increasing burden on medical systems.
METHODS: The study included 47 patients, of whom 45 completed a minimum of 24-month follow-up. The inclusion criteria were OVF types 3 and 4 according to the osteoporotic fracture classification in patients aged ≥65 years with bony stenosis. The surgical management consisted of anterior corpectomy and decompression using a thoracoscopic or mini-laparotomy approach, together with posterior percutaneous cement-augmented short-segment fixation. Self-reported outcome measures included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) in the preoperative phase and regular follow-up at a minimum of 24 months. Radiological measures included segmental lordosis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for osteoporosis assessment, and radiological fracture healing.
RESULTS: There were 33 patients with lumbar fracture and 12 patients with thoracic fracture. Thirteen patients had preoperative neurological deficits. The mean age was 77.4±8.3 years. The mean preoperative VAS score was 8.12±1.5, and the mean ODI score was 24.4±8.2. The mean preoperative sagittal Cobb angle was 6.3°±4.2° kyphosis. The mean operative time was 220.3±55.5 minutes, with a mean blood loss of 360.75±200.6 mL. After a mean follow-up of 32.6±6.4 months, the mean VAS significantly improved to 2.3, and the ODI to 12. Only three patients still had a partial neurological deficit. The mean final sagittal Cobb angle was significantly better, with 12.5°±4.3° of lordosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment percutaneous fixation with cement augmentation combined with minimally invasive anterior decompression and corpectomy is a less invasive and safe approach in elderly patients with OVF and canal compromise.
