Title: Emergency bailout surgery saves lives in high-risk patients with complications after TAVR.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: With the expansion of the indication for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR), the value of access to on-site emergency heart surgery at performing centers needs to be assessed.
AIMS: To evaluate postoperative mortality after surgical rescue post-TAVR, in a population at high surgical risk.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients included in the France-TAVI registry who had undergone TAVR with the latest generation valves between January 2017 and February 2020.
RESULTS: Among the 968 patients undergoing TAVR, 6 patients (0.62%) were identified as candidates for surgery: 3 in the peri-operative context and 3 during hospitalization. Four subjects were managed in a salvage situation, two due to tamponade, one due to aortic dissection, and one due to aortic annulus rupture. One patient died of a delayed aortic annulus rupture and one patient presented a right coronary occlusion which was medically treated. All patients who underwent emergency surgery were discharged alive from the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: In TAVR patients initially contraindicated for surgery, emergency bailout surgery could be performed successfully with all patients discharged alive. Access to on-site heart surgery represents a life-saving resource for TAVR centers.
