Title: A case of syncope after exertion due to sigmoid septum evaluated by exercise stress echocardiography.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: A sigmoid septum is associated with sharp angulation and aging of the aortic root; however, it does not affect the pressure gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract and is generally asymptomatic. This report describes a 73-year-old woman who presented with syncope after exertion. Echocardiography revealed that the cause was left ventricular outflow tract stenosis associated with a sigmoid septum; her symptoms improved with beta-blocker therapy. Exercise stress echocardiography was performed to determine treatment efficacy. Sigmoid septum causes syncope on exertion; however, drug therapy is effective. Exercise stress echocardiography is effective in determining treatment efficacy. If syncope is present, a sigmoid septum should be considered as a cause.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 1.A sigmoid septum is part of or resembles hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, resulting in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) stenosis that is exacerbated by exertion and may cause syncope.2.A sigmoid septum is a differential diagnosis for the cause of syncope and is diagnosed using cardiac echocardiography.3.LVOT stenosis due to a sigmoid septum can be improved with drug therapy such as beta-blockers.4.The effects of beta-blocker therapy can be determined by exercise stress echocardiography.
