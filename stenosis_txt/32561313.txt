Title: Feasibility and Durability of the Modified Cabrol Coronary Artery Reattachment Technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the feasibility and durability of the modified Cabrol coronary reattachment technique after aortic root replacement.
METHODS: The study retrospectively reviewed 370 patients who underwent aortic root replacement, during 1991 and 2018, and who were separated into 2 groups: a modified Carol (mCabrol) group (n = 84), consisting of patients with 1 or both coronary ostia reimplanted using a modified Cabrol technique; and a Carrel group (n = 286), consisting of patients with both coronary ostia reimplanted using the Carrel button technique.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups, except the mCabrol group had higher rates of redo sternotomy (74% vs 16%), chronic aortic dissection (58% vs 19%), and infection (14% vs 3%). In the mCabrol group, 60% had both coronary arteries reattached with the technique, and 40% of the procedures were unilateral. Operative mortality was significantly higher in mCabrol group compared with the Carrel group. However, in the stratified analysis for resternotomy, operative mortality between 2 groups were similar (16% vs 13%; P = .786). The survival rate at 5 years and 10 years was 68 ± 6% and 44 ± 6%, respectively, in the mCabrol group and 87 ± 2% and 80 ± 3%, respectively, in the Carrel group (log-rank P < .001). After propensity adjustment, chronic kidney disease and prior coronary artery bypass grafting, but not the modified Cabrol technique, were independent predictors of both operative mortality and follow-up mortality (operative, P = .518; follow-up, P = .080). A total of 47 (66%) of 71 discharged patients in the mCabrol group had follow-up imaging, and no Cabrol graft was occluded. Two patients in the mCabrol group required interventions related to the reattachment technique: 1 coronary ostial anastomosis stenosis and 1 graft-to-graft anastomosis pseudoaneurysm.
CONCLUSIONS: The modified Cabrol reattachment technique was not predictive of increased mortality and has excellent patency.
