Title: Usefulness of percutaneous transesophageal gastrotubing for gastric outlet obstruction secondary to duodenal ulcer, a case report.

Abstract: Severe duodenal ulcer stenosis requires continuous decompression, which makes oral ingestion difficult, yet poor nutritional status before surgery increases the risk postoperative complications. Double percutaneous transesophageal gastrotubing (dPTEG) is a new treatment that provides both decompression and enteral nutrition. We report a case of duodenal ulcer scar stenosis in which dPTEG was used for preoperative management. A man in his 40s visited our hospital with vomiting as a chief complaint. CT scan showed duodenal ulcer stenosis. As the existence of malignant disease could not be ruled out, surgery was planned. Before surgery, dPTEG was inserted to achieve decompression and nutritional management. The patient's gastric distension and nutritional status improved significantly, and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy was performed 22 days after the insertion. dPTEG may be an effective management method for patients with pyloric stenosis due to duodenal ulcer.
