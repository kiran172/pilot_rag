Title: Transcranial color Doppler sonography as an alternative tool for evaluation of terminal internal carotid artery steno-occlusion in moyamoya disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate color Doppler ultrasonography criteria and its value in assessing the steno-occlusion of the terminal internal carotid artery in moyamoya disease.
METHODS: According to the digital subtraction angiography findings, patients were divided into three groups: occlusion of the terminal internal carotid artery, >50% stenosis, and ≤50% stenosis. We measured the terminal and proximal internal carotid artery parameters of each group using transcranial and cervical color Doppler sonography.
RESULTS: Blood flow signals in 12 terminal internal carotid arteries were absent, which were verified as occlusion by digital subtraction angiography. Parameters were obtained in the remaining 159 terminal/proximal internal carotid arteries to predict cutoffs for >50% stenosis and occlusion. For >50% stenosis, mean flow velocity >88.50 cm/s in the terminal internal carotid artery could achieved the highest receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.776 with 62.50% sensitivity, 88.15% specificity, 48.39% positive predictive values, 92.97% negative predictive value, and 84.27% overall accuracy. For the occlusion, mean flow velocity <49.50 cm/s in the terminal internal carotid artery achieve the highest receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.734 with 55.56% sensitivity, 83.81% specificity, 63.83% positive predictive values, 78.57% negative predictive value, and 74.21% overall accuracy. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve cutoffs for other parameters were less than 0.7.
CONCLUSION: Mean flow velocity of terminal internal carotid artery provides useful diagnostic information for detecting steno-occlusion in moyamoya disease. It may be used as an alternative tool to evaluate steno-occlusion of the terminal internal carotid artery in moyamoya disease.
