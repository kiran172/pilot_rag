Title: Carotid intimal sarcoma causing stroke and intracranial metastasis via tumor embolization.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings of a patient with carotid intimal sarcoma.
METHODS: Detailed medical interview, neurologic examination, and diagnostic evaluation including CT angiography head and neck, MRI brain and neck, digital subtraction angiography, and biopsy of the mass were performed.
RESULTS: We report a patient who presented with symptoms of multifocal, bilateral strokes over weeks caused by an enlarging tumor thrombus associated with an intimal sarcoma of the carotid artery. The presence of a carotid space mass encasing the left internal carotid artery was initially not recognized on imaging and was mistakenly attributed to soft atheromatous plaque rather than tumor thrombus. Rapid disease progression resulted in multiple intracranial metastases from tumor embolization.
CONCLUSION: Clinical and radiologic findings of intimal sarcoma may be similar to those of thrombotic disease. However, patients with sarcoma may show an associated perivascular soft tissue mass and an unusual distribution of vessel stenosis. Reevaluation of imaging should be considered in patients presenting with initial imaging findings suggestive of rapidly progressive thrombotic disease who have a poor response to antithrombotic therapy and do not follow an expected clinical course.
