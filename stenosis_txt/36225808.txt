Title: Re-intervention percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty in a patient with left atrial appendage thrombus: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) using an Accura balloon is an effective method for management of rheumatic mitral stenosis.
CASE SUMMARY: Herein, we present a case of a 43-year-old female, who had undergone a previous PBMV, who presented with very severe mitral re-stenosis with Type Ia left atrial (LA) clot, in atrial fibrillation and New York Heart Association functional Class III. We used the modified septal puncture and over-the-wire technique, avoiding inadvertent manipulation of the LA clot for PBMV. The mitral valve was successfully dilated from 0.9 to 1.5â€…cm2, and the patient had an uneventful post-procedure recovery.
DISCUSSION: The presence of LA clot and mitral re-stenosis in a previously intervened valve are considered unfavourable characteristics for a PBMV procedure, and patients are usually advised surgical intervention. These patients are also high-risk candidates for surgery due to late presentation with advanced disease and poor functional capacity. Our patient underwent successful re-intervention with PBMV despite having suboptimal characteristics.
