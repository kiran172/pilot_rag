Title: Laminoplasty Versus Laminectomy and Posterior Fusion for Cervical Myelopathy : A Meta-Analysis of Radiographic and Clinical Outcomes.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis.
OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis investigates the outcomes of laminoplasty (LP) and laminectomy with fusion (LF) to guide effective patient selection for these 2 procedures.
BACKGROUND: Although LF traditionally offers the ability for excellent posterior decompression, it may alter cervical spine biomechanics and increase the risk of adjacent segment degeneration. LP aims to preserve the natural kinematics of the spine but has not been universally accepted, and may be associated with inadequate decompression, neck pain, and recurrent stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar (pages 1-20) were searched up until March 2024. The outcomes studied were surgery-related outcomes [operative time (OR) time, estimated blood loss (EBL), and length of stay], adverse events (overall complications, C5 palsy, and reoperations), radiographic outcomes (cervical lordosis, cervical sagittal vertical axis, and T1 slope angle), and patient-reported outcome measures (Neck Disability Index, Visual Analog Scale for neck pain, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association).
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included in this meta-analysis, of which 19 were retrospective studies, 2 were prospective nonrandomized studies, and 1 was a randomized controlled trial. A total of 2128 patients were included, with 1025 undergoing LP and 1103 undergoing LF. Patients undergoing LP experienced significantly shorter operative time ( P = 0.009), less EBL ( P = 0.02), a lower rate of overall complications ( P < 0.00001) and C5 palsy ( P = 0.003), a lower T1 slope angle ( P = 0.02), and a lower Neck Disability Index ( P = 0.0004). No significant difference was observed in the remaining outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that for cervical myelopathy, LP has the benefits of shorter operative time time, less EBL, and reduced incidence of C5 palsy as well as overall complication rate. Given these findings, LP remains an important surgical option with a favorable complication profile in patients with cervical myelopathy, although careful patient selection is still paramount in choosing the right procedure for individual patients.
