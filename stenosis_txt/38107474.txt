Title: Spontaneous cervical hematoma caused by giant parathyroid adenoma in an elderly patient: A case report.

Abstract: Spontaneous cervical hematoma usually occurs as a consequence of extracapsular bleeding from a parathyroid gland, generally due to the presence of an adenoma (giant adenoma), glandular hyperplasia, cystic component, or, less frequently, due to the existence of a carcinoma. The hematoma can be confined to the cervical compartment or extend to the mediastinum, potentially causing airway compression. Despite this, the recommended management in hemodynamically stable patients consists of surveillance and hospital monitoring with delayed surgery after a few weeks. On the other hand, in those patients with airway compromise and instability, emergency surgery, consisting of cervicotomy and drainage, is mandatory. The present study describes the case of a 78-year-old patient with a medical history of high blood pressure, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, moderate aortic stenosis, chronic kidney disease and sarcoidosis under pharmacological treatment who attended the emergency department due to symptoms of neck pain, an increase in soft tissue, and dyspnea on moderate exertion with an evolution leading to respiratory failure. This was secondary to a diagnosis of spontaneous cervical hematoma that required urgent surgical intervention. The results of histopathological analysis revealed that a giant parathyroid adenoma was responsible for the bleeding. The patient had a complicated post-operative period with a prolonged admission to the intensive care unit.
