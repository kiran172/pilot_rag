Title: Retrospective Multicenter Analysis of Intravascular Lithotripsy Use During Calcified Left Main Coronary Artery Percutaneous Coronary Interventions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) safely and effectively modifies calcified coronary lesions during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Data regarding its utility in modifying calcified left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease are limited. This study aimed to evaluate short-term outcomes of IVL-assisted LMCA PCI.
METHODS: This retrospective multicenter all-comers study analyzed patients who underwent intravascular imaging-guided, IVL-assisted PCI for calcified LMCA disease. Clinical and procedural characteristics were obtained, including intravascular imaging measurements. Technical success was defined as successful stent deployment with <30% residual diameter stenosis. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization evaluated immediately postprocedure and at 30-day follow-up.
RESULTS: Among 184 patients treated at 7 centers from 2019-2023, IVL-assisted LMCA PCI achieved 99.4% technical success. Calcium fracture was identified in 136/165 cases (82.4%) on post-IVL imaging. Pretreatment minimal luminal area increased significantly compared to post-PCI minimal stent area (MSA) (4.1 ± 1.3 to 9.3 ± 2.5 mm2, respectively; P &lt; .001). There was a direct correlation between IVL balloon size and the final MSA (P = .002). In-hospital MACE was 4.4% and 30-day MACE was 8.8%. In multivariate logistic regression, presentation with troponin-positive myocardial infarction was the sole predictor of 30-day MACE.
CONCLUSIONS: IVL-assisted PCI for calcified LMCA lesions was safe and resulted in high technical success rates, confirming its utility as an effective treatment in this challenging lesion subset.
