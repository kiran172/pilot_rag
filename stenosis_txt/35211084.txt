Title: Intracranial Arterial Calcification and Intracranial Atherosclerosis: Close but Different.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) may be present in the intimal or medial arterial layer. This study aimed to elucidate the link between the calcification and atherosclerotic disease in the intracranial vasculature.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke were included. Bilateral intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery, M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery, intracranial segment of the vertebral artery, and the basilar artery were visualized by the multi-detector computed tomography (CT) and vessel-wall magnetic resonance imaging (vwMRI) within 14 days after stroke onset. IAC was into the intimal or medial pattern. Subsequently, on the vwMRI, we assessed the luminal stenosis, eccentricity, plaque burden, and intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) as markers of atherosclerosis at each IAC site.
RESULTS: Among 69 patients with stroke, IAC was identified in 35% of (161/483) artery segments, of which 61.5% were predominantly intimal calcification and 38.5% were predominantly medial calcification. About 79.8% of intimal calcifications and 64.5% of medial calcifications co-existed with atherosclerotic plaques. Intimal calcification was associated with luminal stenosis (p = 0.003) caused by atherosclerotic lesions. Compared with the medial IAC, intimal IAC was more often accompanied by eccentric plaques (p = 0.02), larger plaque burden (p = 0.001), and IPH (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our multimodal imaging-based comparison study on intracranial arteriosclerosis demonstrated that intimal IAC, compared with medial IAC, was more often accompanied by the luminal stenosis, larger plaque burden, eccentricity, and IPH, providing strong evidence for clinical evaluation on the mechanism, risk, and prognosis of ischemic stroke.
