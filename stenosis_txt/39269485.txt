Title: Impact of congenital spinal stenosis on the outcome of three-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a retrospective study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate whether congenital cervical spinal stenosis (CCSS) affects the outcome of three-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
METHODS: One hundred seventeen patients with CSM who underwent three-level ACDF between January 2019 and January 2023 were retrospectively examined. Patients were grouped according to presence of CCSS, which was defined as Pavlov ratio ≤ 0.75. The CCSS and no CCSS groups comprised 68 (58.1%) and 49 (41.9%) patients, respectively.
RESULTS: The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score did not significantly differ between the two groups at any postoperative time point (p > 0.05). The JOA improvement rate was lower in the CCSS group 1 month after surgery (41.7% vs. 45.5%, p < 0.05), but showed no difference at any follow-up time point after one month. Multivariate logistic regression identified preoperative age (OR = 10.639), JOA score (OR = 0.370), increased signal intensity (ISI) in the spinal cord on T2-weighted MRI (T2-WI) (Grade 1: OR = 6.135; Grade 2: OR = 29.892), and degree of spinal cord compression (30-60%: OR = 17.919; ≥60%: OR = 46.624) as independent predictors of a poor one year outcome (JOA recovery rate < 50%).
CONCLUSION: Although early JOA improvement is slower in the CCSS group, it does not affect the final neurological improvement at 1 year. Therefore, CCSS should not be considered a contraindication for three-level ACDF in patients with CSM. The main factors influencing one year outcome were preoperative age, JOA score, ISI grade, and degree of spinal cord compression.
