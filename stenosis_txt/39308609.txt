Title: Fibromuscular dysplasia: An underrated cause of chronic kidney disease in developing countries: A rare case report.

Abstract: Renal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is one of the rare cardiovascular conditions affecting the kidneys at very young ages. The exact pathophysiology is still not known and is one of the causes of resistant hypertension in young patients. Severe forms of FMD such as those involving bilateral renal arteries are very few reported in the literature. In this case, we report a severe form of FMD resulting in the rapid progression of chronic kidney diseases in a young patient which results in requirement of renal replacement therapy.
