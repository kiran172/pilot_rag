Title: Effect of patient characteristics on vessel enhancement on arterio-venous fistula CT angiography in a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: To evaluate the effects of various patient characteristics on vessel enhancement on arterio-venous fistula (AVF) computed tomography (CT) angiography (AVF-CT angiography). A total of 127 patients with suspected or confirmed shunt stenosis and internal AVF complications were considered for inclusion in a retrospective cohort study. The tube voltage was 120 kVp, and the tube current was changed from 300 to 770 mA to maintain the image quality (noise index: 14) using automatic tube current modulation. To evaluate the effects of age, sex, body size, and scan delay on the CT number of the brachial artery or vein, we used correlation coefficients and multivariate regression analyses. There was a significant positive correlation between the CT number of the brachial artery or vein and age (R = 0.21 or 0.23, P < .01). The correlations were inverse with the height (r = -0.45 or -0.42), total body weight (r = -0.52 or -0.50), body mass index (r = -0.21 or -0.23), body surface area (body surface area [BSA]; r = -0.56 or -0.54), and lean body weight (r = -0.55 or -0.53) in linear regression analysis (P < .01 for all). There was a significant correlation between the CT number of the brachial artery or vein and scan delay (R = 0.19 or 01.9, P < .01). Only the BSA had significant effects on the CT number in multivariate regression analysis (P < .01). The BSA was significantly correlated with the CT number of the brachial artery or vein on AVF-CT angiography.
