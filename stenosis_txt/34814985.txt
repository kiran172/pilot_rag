Title: [Management of complications of upper urinary tract trauma (kidney and ureter)].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Complications of kidney and ureter trauma are directly in the field of the urologist. If they have a second place in the vital prognosis, a good knowledge of these pathologies is essential.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was carried out using the Medline database in order to identify the most relevant articles in English and French.
RESULTS: Urinary extravasation in the context of blunt kidney trauma has a good functional prognosis. Impaired function of the traumatized kidney is linked to vascular damage associated with grade IV and V. Non operative management is the treatment of choice with deferred management in the event of septic or painful deterioration. The lesions of the ureter are predominantly iatrogenic. While incomplete lesions can be treated endoscopically, complete lesions (stenosis or wound) require surgery. The most frequent lesions, in the distal ureter are easily treated by ureterovesical reimplantation. Large losses of substance may require ileal replacement.
CONCLUSION: Blunt kidney trauma causing urinary extravasation, with an excellent prognosis, are treated conservatively. Conversely, lesions of the ureter require in the majority of cases an intervention to restore continuity.
