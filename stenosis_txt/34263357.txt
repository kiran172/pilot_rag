Title: The diagnostic performance of on-site workstation-based computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve. Comparison with myocardium perfusion imaging.

Abstract: To compare the diagnostic performance of on-site workstation-based computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR)Few data of CT-FFR were reported regarding the diagnostic performance for detecting hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease (CAD). This retrospective single-center analysis included 132 vessels in 77 patients who underwent CT angiography, myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), and invasive FFR. The correlation coefficient between CT-FFR and invasive FFR and optimal cut-off value for CT-FFR to identify invasive FFR ≤ 0.8 were evaluated. The diagnostic accuracies of CT- FFR, and MPI were evaluated using an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) with invasive FFR as a reference standard. Diagnostic performance of CT-FFR was also evaluated concerning lesion characteristics, including intermediate lesions, left main lesions, tandem lesions, and/or diffuse lesions, and coronary calcium (Agatston score over 400). The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off value of CT-FFR for detecting invasive FFR ≤ 0.80 was 0.80 [AUC = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.76-0.90). Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy of CT-FFR when compared with those of MPI regarding per-patient analysis were 93% vs. 63%, 48% vs. 61%, 81% vs. 79%, 73% vs. 41%, and 79% vs. 62%, respectively, and for per-vessel analysis were 89% vs. 24%, 66% vs. 82%, 75% vs. 61%, 83% vs. 48%, and 78% vs. 51%, respectively. The AUC of the CT-FFR was significantly higher than MPI (0.83 vs. 0.57, p < 0.0001) regarding the per-vessel analysis. No differences in the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR were noted in the presence of intermediate lesions, left main lesions, tandem lesions, and/or diffuse lesions, and severe coronary calcium. On-site CT-FFR delivered a higher diagnostic performance than MPI for detecting CAD with invasive FFR ≤ 0.8, indicating the potential of CT-FFR as the gatekeeper of invasive coronary angiogram as well as percutaneous coronary intervention.
