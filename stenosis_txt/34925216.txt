Title: Associations of Monocytes and the Monocyte/High-Density Lipoprotein Ratio With Extracranial and Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis.

Abstract: Background: Although the monocyte/high-density lipoprotein ratio (MHR) has been shown to be a potential marker of inflammatory of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, there are few studies on its relationships with the degree of intracranial and extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis and the stenosis distribution. Methods: In total, 271 patients were admitted for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) examination and were classified into a non-stenosis group and a stenosis group. (1) The two groups were compared and the arteries were categorized according to the degree of intracranial or extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (if ≥two branches were stenotic, the artery with the most severe stenosis was used). (2) Clinical baseline data and laboratory indexes of patients grouped according to stenosis location (intracranial vs. extracranial) were collected. Results: (1) MHR × 102 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.119, p &lt; 0.001], age (OR = 1.057, p = 0.007), and lymphocyte count (OR = 0.273, p = 0.002) significantly affected the presence of cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis, with an MHR area of 0.82 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and an optimal diagnostic value of 0.486. Analyses of the moderate, mild, and severe stenosis groups showed that MHR × 102 (OR = 1.07, p &lt; 0.001) significantly affected the severity of stenosis in patients. (2) In the analysis of stenosis at different sites, the rate of extracranial artery stenosis in patients who smoked (OR = 3.86, p = 0.023) and had a reduced lymphocyte level (OR = 0.202, p = 0.001) was remarkably greater than that in patients who smoked (OR = 3.86, p = 0.023). With increasing age, the rate of extracranial artery stenosis raised sharply. With the increase in the MHR level, the stenosis rate of each group was highly greater than that of the non-stenosis group. Conclusion: The MHR has a predictive value for the diagnosis of extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis and is correlated with the degree and distribution of stenosis.
