Title: Symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis: 3 years' prospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial stenoses can cause TIA/ischaemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to assess vascular risk factors, clinical and imaging findings and outcome in Caucasians with intracranial stenosis under best prevention management.
METHODS: In this prospective observational study (from 05/2012, to last follow-up 06/2017) we compared vascular risk factors, imaging findings and long-term outcome in Swiss patients with symptomatic versus asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses on best prevention management.
RESULTS: 62 patients were included [35.5% women, median age 68.3 years], 33 (53.2%) with symptomatic intracranial stenoses. Vascular risk factors (p = 0.635) and frequency of anterior circulation stenoses (66.7% vs. 55.2%; p = 0.354) did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, but CT/MR-perfusion deficits in the territory of the stenosis (81.8% vs. 51.7%; p = 0.011) were more common in symptomatic patients. Outcome in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients at last follow-up was similar (mRS 0-1:66.7% vs. 75%;<sub>adj</sub>p = 0.937, mRS <sub>adj</sub>p-shift = 0.354, survival:100% vs. 96.4%;<sub>adj</sub>p = 0.979). However, during 59,417 patient follow-up days, symptomatic patients experienced more cerebrovascular events (ischaemic stroke or TIA) [37.5% vs. 7.1%;<sub>adj</sub>HR 7.58;<sub>adj</sub>p = 0.012], mainly in the territory of the stenosis [31.3% vs. 3.6%;<sub>adj</sub>HR 12.69;<sub>adj</sub>p = 0.019], more vascular events (i.e. ischaemic stroke/TIA/TNA and acute coronary/peripheral vascular events) [62.5% vs. 14.3%;<sub>adj</sub>HR 6.37;<sub>adj</sub>p = 0.001]) and more multiple vascular events (p-trend = 0.006; ≥ 2:37.5% vs. 10.7%;<sub>adj</sub> OR 5.37;<sub>adj</sub>p = 0.022) than asymptomatic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite best prevention management, one in three patients with a symptomatic intracranial stenosis suffered a cerebrovascular event, three in five a vascular event and two in five ≥ 2 vascular events. There is an unmet need for more rigorous and effective preventive strategies in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenoses.
