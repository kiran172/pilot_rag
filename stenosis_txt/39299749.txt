Title: Kawasaki disease: contemporary perspectives.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease is a paediatric vasculitis that presents with fever, rash, conjunctivitis, mucositis, lymphadenopathy, and extremity changes, and primarily affects children younger than 5 years. Coronary artery aneurysms are observed in approximately 20% of patients without treatment. Giant coronary artery aneurysms are rare but can result in substantial morbidity and mortality due to the risk of thrombosis, stenosis, and myocardial infarction. Infants younger than 6 months and children with coronary artery abnormalities are at highest risk for the development of large or giant coronary artery aneurysms, necessitating swift identification and aggressive treatment. The children at high risk for coronary artery aneurysms warrant primary intensification therapy; however, what the most optimal adjunct therapy might be to reduce their risk is unclear and large-scale international trials are needed. Kawasaki disease is a clinical diagnosis that shares many features with other common febrile illnesses, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Identifying biomarkers that can distinguish Kawasaki disease from similar conditions and predict coronary artery aneurysm risk are needed to aid timely diagnosis, guide management, and improve patient outcomes.
