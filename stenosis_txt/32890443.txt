Title: Carotid access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the feasibility and safety of carotid access transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) by performing a meta-analysis of published cases.
BACKGROUND: Several case series and regional data have provided initial basis for carotid access TAVR in patients with prohibitive femoral approach. We performed this meta-analysis to provide further evidence of feasibility and safety of carotid TAVR.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL for any study on carotid access TAVR involving ⩾5 patients since inception till March 1, 2020. Random-effects model was used to compute overall effects. The outcomes analyzed were all-cause mortality, Transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke, need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, pericardial tamponade, access site complications, major bleeding, and length of stay.
RESULTS: There was a total of 17 retrospective studies (n = 2082) with a median follow-up of 1 month. Mean age of the patient was 80 years. Mean Euroscore and STS scores were 15 ± 6.2 and 7.9 ± 3.3, respectively. The procedural success rate was 99%. The rate of all-cause mortality was 6.7% (range 4.6-9.7%, p &lt; .001, I2 = 67%). Incidence of TIA/stroke was 3.9% (range 3.1-4.8%, p &lt; .001, I2 = 0%) and PPM implantation was 16.7% (range 12.5-21.9%, p &lt; .001, I2 = 56%). Rate of pericardial tamponade, vascular complication, and major bleeding were 1.7, 2.5, and 7%, respectively. Average length of hospital stay was 7.7 days.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that transcarotid approach is a feasible option in patients with prohibitive femoral access for TAVR.
