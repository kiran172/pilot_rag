Title: Carotid artery replacement with superficial femoral artery in a patient with recurrent radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: A 58-year-old man presented with a right hemispheric transient ischemic attack from recurrent common carotid artery (CCA) in-stent restenosis. He had undergone prior neck radiation for carcinoma of the right tonsil and subsequent right carotid endarterectomy (10 years prior) and right CCA stenting (5 years prior), all for symptomatic radiation-induced stenosis. We performed CCA reconstruction using a transposed superficial femoral artery and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap coverage. Early stenosis of the proximal graft required angioplasty and stent grafting. However, at 1.5 years postoperatively, he has no further issues and a patent graft. This case highlights the options available for complex radiation-induced lesions of the carotid vessels.
