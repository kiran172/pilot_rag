Title: Medical complications in children with achondroplasia.

Abstract: AIM: To determine the rates of medical investigations, complications, interventions, and outcomes in children with achondroplasia.
METHOD: Children and adolescents with achondroplasia born between 2000 and 2019, aged between 0 and 18 years of age, and seen at The Children's Hospital at Westmead skeletal dysplasia clinic were included. Data were collected retrospectively from clinical records. Standard descriptive statistics were used for analysis.
RESULTS: The study included 108 participants, 58 males and 50 females. Ninety-nine participants (91.7%) entered the study at birth. The other nine (8.3%) participants entered the study after birth (mean age = 2 years 4 months, SD = 1 year 8 months). The median age of exit from the study was 8 years 8 months (IQR = 8 years 9 months) with a median follow-up of 8 years 8 months (IQR = 8 years 9 months). Fifty-two (48%) participants presented with craniocervical stenosis, 15 (13.9%) with hydrocephalus, 66 (61.1%) with hearing impairment, 44 (40.7%) with sleep-disordered breathing, 46 (42.6%) with lower-limb malalignment, 24 (22.2%) with thoracolumbar kyphosis, 10 (9.3%) with symptomatic spinal stenosis, 12 (11.1%) with obesity, and 16 (14.8%) who had at least one admission for respiratory illness. Two children died during the study period.
INTERPRETATION: We report contemporary rates of medical complications in an Australian population of children with achondroplasia. Recommendations for surveillance in clinical practice are discussed. This information will help guide clinicians with their expectant management of achondroplasia and provide prognostic information to the families of children with achondroplasia.
