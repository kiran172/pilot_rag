Title: A 3D scaling law for supravalvular aortic stenosis suited for stethoscopic auscultations.

Abstract: In this study a frequency scaling law for 3D anatomically representative supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) cases is proposed. The law is uncovered for stethoscopy's preferred auscultation range (70-120 Hz). LES simulations are performed on the CFD solver Fluent, leveraging Simulia's Living Heart Human Model (LHHM), modified to feature hourglass stenoses that range between 30 to 80 percent (mild to severe) in addition to the descending aorta. For physiological hemodynamic boundary conditions the Windkessel model is implemented via a UDF subroutine. The flow-generated acoustic signal is then extracted using the FW-H model and analyzed using FFT. A preferred receiver location that matches clinical practice is confirmed (right intercostal space) and a correlation between the degree of stenosis and a corresponding acoustic frequency is obtained. Five clinical auscultation signals are tested against the scaling law, with the findings interpreted in relation to the NHS classification of stenosis and to the assessments of experienced cardiologists. The scaling law is thus shown to succeed as a potential quantitative decision-support tool for clinicians, enabling them to reliably interpret stethoscopic auscultations for all degrees of stenosis, which is especially useful for moderate degrees of SVAS. Computational investigation of more complex stenotic cases would enhance the clinical relevance of this proposed scaling law, and will be explored in future research.
