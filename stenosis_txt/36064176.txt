Title: The impact of COVID-19 in patients with severe aortic stenosis: Artificial intelligence research.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Untreated, severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis is associated with an ominous diagnosis without intervention. This study aims to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mortality of patients with severe stenosis during the first wave and compare it with the same period last year.
METHODS: All patients who went to the hospitals in a spanish region during the first wave, and in the same period of previous year, were analysed using Artificial Intelligence-based software, evaluating the mortality of patients with severe aortic stenosis with and without COVID-19 during the pandemic and the pre-COVID era. Mortality of the three groups were compared. Regarding cardiac surgeries was a tendency to decrease (p = .07) in patients without COVID-19 between the pandemic and the previous period was observed. A significant decrease of surgeries between patients with COVID-19 and without COVID-19 was shown.
RESULTS: Data showed 13.82% less admitted patients during the first wave. 1112 of them, had aortic stenosis and 5.48% were COVID-19 positive. Mortality was higher (p = .01), in COVID-19 negative during the pandemic (4.37%) versus those in the pre-COVID19 era (2.57%); it was also in the COVID-19 positive group (11.47%), versus covid-19 negative (4.37%) during the first wave (p = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a decrease in patients who went to the hospital and an excess of mortality in patients with severe AD without infection during the first wave, compared to the same period last year; and also, in COVID-19 positive patients versus COVID-19 negative.
