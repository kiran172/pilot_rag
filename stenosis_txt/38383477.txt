Title: Importance of cerebral angiography in the evaluation of delayed carotid stent thrombosis: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: While noninvasive imaging is typically used during the initial assessment of carotid artery disease, digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for evaluating carotid stent thrombosis and stenosis (Krawisz in Cardiol Clin 39:539-549, 2021). This case highlights the importance of digital subtraction angiography for assessing carotid artery stent patency in place of non-invasive imaging.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 61-year-old African American male patient with a history of right cervical internal carotid artery dissection that was treated with carotid artery stenting and endovascular thrombectomy, who developed recurrent right hemispheric infarcts related to delayed carotid stent thrombosis. Digital subtraction angiography found multiple filling defects consistent with extensive in-stent thrombosis not clearly observed with magnetic resonance angiography. Etiology was likely secondary to chronic antiplatelet noncompliance. Therefore, the patient was treated medically with a heparin drip, and dual antiplatelet therapy (dAPT) was restarted. At 1-month follow-up the patient did not report new motor or sensory deficits.
CONCLUSION: In the setting of delayed carotid stent thrombosis secondary to antiplatelet noncompliance, digital subtraction angiography may play an essential diagnostic role for early identification and determination of the most appropriate treatment.
