Title: Very long-term follow-up of Indiana Pouches proves durability.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: An Indiana Pouch (IP) is a heterotopic, continent, urinary diversion from an ileocolonic segment. Numerous studies have investigated its long-term outcomes, albeit none extending beyond a 5-year follow-up period. IPs can be used as urinary diversion for benign indications and as such are constructed in typically young patients. As a consequence of their extended lifespan, there is a need for very long-term (>5 years) IP outcome data and comprehensive complication analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the data of all patients attending our academic functional urology tertiary referral center for surveillance between 2015 and 2022 after an earlier IP procedure without uro-oncological indication were analyzed. The primary objective was to identify the prevalence of complications associated with IP, including stomal stenosis, ureter-pouch stenosis, pouch calculi, stomal leakage, pouch perforation, and parastomal herniation, and to determine the time span between creation of the IP and occurrence of complications.
RESULTS: A cohort of 33 patients (23 female) was analyzed. Median age at IP creation was 38 (range 5-62) years. Median follow-up was 258 (range 24-452) months. During follow-up, 22 (67%) patients underwent at least one surgical revision. In total, 45 revision procedures were performed. The estimated mean revision-free survival was 198 (95%-CI 144-242) months.
CONCLUSION: Two-thirds of our IP patients required surgical revision during very long-term follow-up. However, the mean revision-free survival was 198 months. This establishes the IP as a durable and resilient option for urinary diversion, yet underlines the need for lifelong follow-up as some of these complications and indication were subclinical. These results contribute significantly to patient counseling when discussing different options for urinary diversion, especially at a younger age.
