Title: One-stop transcatheter aortic valve replacement and fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair: A case report.

Abstract: The management of patients with severe aortic valve stenosis and an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a real therapeutic challenge. Minimally invasive treatment is more beneficial than open surgery for treating both aortic valve stenosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm. We present a case of a 77-year-old male initially treated with a 26 mm Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Subsequently, using the same femoral access points, a custom fenestrated endoprosthesis and stents in digestive trunks and renal arteries were implanted. Follow-up imaging revealed no dysfunction of the valve, endoprosthesis, or stents. This is the first reported successful concomitant management of significant aortic valve stenosis and infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm through transcatheter aortic valve replacement and fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.
