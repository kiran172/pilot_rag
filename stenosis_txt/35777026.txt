Title: Comparison of outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement between elderly (65-79 years) and super-elderly (≥80 years) patients.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an effective treatment option for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of data regarding the differences in the clinical outcomes of TAVR procedures between elderly and super-elderly patients. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients aged 65 to 79 years and ≥80 years who underwent TAVR for aortic stenosis. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of 134 patients with aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR were analyzed. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: an elderly group (EG; 65-79 years) and a super-elderly group (SEG) (≥80 years). The in-hospital and follow-up clinical outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The EG tended to be more overweight, obese, and diabetic than the SEG, whereas the SEG had a higher surgical risk but lower creatinine clearance, hematocrit level, and effective orifice area than the EG. However, no difference was found in in-hospital clinical outcomes between the 2 groups, except for atrial fibrillation. In the propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted analyses, these results were similar. All follow-up clinical outcomes were similar, except for rehospitalization, which was statistically attenuated after propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted analyses. TAVR was associated with similar safety outcomes in the EG (65-79 years) and the SEG (≥80 years). Advanced age is not negatively associated with clinical outcomes after the TAVR procedure.
