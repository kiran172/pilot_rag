Title: Investigation on the mechanism of p38MAPK in the failure of autogenous arteriovenous fistula caused by stenosis.

Abstract: The present study aimed to probe into the mechanism of p38MAPK in the failure of autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) caused by stenosis. A total of 24 patients with maintenance hemodialysis and the autologous AVF as the hemodialysis route were enrolled in the present study. In the experimental group, the internal fistula operation mode was the end-to-side anastomosis, and patients were those who needed autogenous AVF repair due to the venous hyperplasia and stenosis of the internal fistula anastomosis (n = 12). The control group was composed of patients who underwent autogenous AVF surgery for the first time (n = 12). The discarded venous tissues in each group were used for immunohistochemistry and Western blot detection of ASK1, P38, and ATF-2. SPSS 17.0 and GraphPad Prism 5 software were adopted for data analysis. The measurement data were expressed as means ± standard deviations ( x ± s), and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results of immunohistochemistry staining: the expressions of ASK1, P38, and ATF-2 in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The results of Western blot: the expression of P38 in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the expression of ASK1 and ATF-2 between the experimental group and the control group (P > 0.05). In stenotic AVF, the expressions of ASK1, P38, and ATF-2 all significantly increased, indicating that the p38MAPK signaling pathway might be involved in the formation of venous stenosis in AVF, and the p38MAPK signaling pathway might become a therapeutic target in preventing and treating the vascular stenosis in the fistula.
