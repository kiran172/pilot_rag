Title: Facial fire with use of high-flow nasal oxygen during laser surgery.

Abstract: Use of high-flow nasal oxygen to enable apnoeic oxygenation during tubeless airway surgery is well-established. The use of an ignition source in this oxygen-rich environment increases the risk of surgical fire. We present a case of facial fire secondary to the use of carbon dioxide laser and high-flow nasal oxygen during a surgical procedure for subglottic stenosis. The incident occurred when the laser was being tested near the patient, resulting in superficial burns to the patient's face and neck. The airway was unaffected and the burns were managed conservatively. This case highlights important safety consideration for the use of an ignition source in the presence of high-flow nasal oxygen and the role of human factors and in-built risk mitigation features.
