Title: Vascular compression syndromes: the value of Doppler ultrasonography.

Abstract: Vascular compression syndromes arise when a vessel in a tight anatomic space is entrapped by another structure, resulting in diverse symptoms for which different imaging tests are used to diagnose. Radiologists need to be familiar with vascular compression syndromes and to be able to identify their most representative findings. This paper aims to review the principal symptoms of vascular compression, describing and illustrating the key findings on Doppler ultrasonography that enable accurate diagnosis and guide further workup, avoiding unnecessary invasive tests and pointing to the appropriate treatment.
