Title: Comparison of third generation balloon-expandable Edwards Sapien 3 versus self-expandable Evolut R in transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The 3rd generations of transcatheter heart valve system, including Edwards SAPIEN S3 (ES3) and Medtronic's Evolut R, has been developed to specifically improve the safety of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of this work was to provide a summary effect estimate of the peri-procedural characteristics and clinical outcome of patients treated with ES3 versus the Evolut R.
METHODS: We conducted a literature search of PubMed, Ovid and EMBASE (2002 to 2018). Two authors extracted the data independently. The safety and feasibility of Sapien 3 and Evolut R were compared by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in inverse variance method.
RESULTS: After a multi-step assessment, a total 6 studies were finally included, yielding 1,664 patients, of which, 768 (46%) used ES3 and 896 (54%) used Evolut R. There was no statistical difference with device success rate (OR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.70-1.91, I2 =0%), 30-day mortality [OR: 0.72 (0.33-1.57), I2 =0%], pre-dilation rate, 30-day stroke, bleeding complication (BC) (major and life-threating), major vascular complication (VC), and paravalvular leakage between the two groups. However, the ES3 group was associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), higher mean aortic valve gradient and better mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after TAVR procedure. Moreover, the Evolut R group had a higher rate of post-dilation and new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI).
CONCLUSIONS: Both devices had demonstrated excellent procedural success rate and short-term safety. At 30-day follow-up, both devices shared similar rates of mortality, BC, VC, stroke, and paravalvular leakage (PVL). However, the rate of AKI was higher in the ES3 group, and the rate of PPM was higher in the Evolut R group.
