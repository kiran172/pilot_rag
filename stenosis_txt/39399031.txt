Title: Severity of lumbar spinal stenosis does not impact responsiveness to exercise-based rehabilitation.

Abstract: Spine pain is a prevalent and costly condition affecting up to 85% of individuals throughout their lifetime, and spinal stenosis is one of the most debilitating sources of spine pain. Although conservative management is the first line of treatment for spinal stenosis, severe cases often are directly referred to surgical intervention due to the belief that conservative strategies delay necessary treatment. However, there are no studies supporting the premise that individuals with more severe stenosis respond poorly to conservative management. The purpose of this study was to compare improvements in pain, disability, strength, medication usage, and patient goals in response to an exercise-based physical therapy program across 1,806 individuals with mild, moderate, or severe lumbar spine stenosis. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in all variables of interest (p<0.001), and 11.5% of participants reported cessation of narcotic use with treatment. There were no significant differences in treatment response across mild, moderate, or severe stenosis groups for any outcome (p>0.546). Exercise-based rehabilitation is as beneficial in the short term for individuals presenting for nonoperative care with severe stenosis compared to their milder counterparts. Future research is needed to evaluate long term durability and cost effectiveness of rehabilitation in this patient population.
