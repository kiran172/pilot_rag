Title: Airway complications following lung transplantation.

Abstract: Airway complications post lung transplant account for significant morbidity (between 2 and 18%) and mortality (2 to 4%). The commonly encountered airway complications include necrosis and dehiscence, exophytic granulation tissue, bronchial stenosis, tracheo-broncho-malacia, bronchial fistulae, and airway infections. With growing experience in surveillance bronchoscopy post lung transplant and availability of advanced endobronchial interventional therapies, better management of lung transplant recipients is now possible. In this article, we review the various contributing factors, clinical manifestations, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options for post lung transplant airway complications.
