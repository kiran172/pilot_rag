Title: Prognostic Impact of the Clinical Frailty Scale After Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty.

Abstract: Background: The clinical frailty scale (CFS) predicts late mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. We evaluated the CFS and other parameters associated with 1-year mortality after balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). Methods and Results: Between January 2013 and May 2018, 148 patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent BAV at the present hospital were enrolled. We recorded pre-procedural CFS grade, baseline characteristics, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic parameters. To investigate the potential risk to patients before BAV, we evaluated the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score. After patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement, transcatheter aortic valve replacement or repeat BAV were excluded, we investigated 1-year survival. Of 127 patients, 41 (32.3%) died ≤1 year after BAV, 8 of whom (19.5% of all-cause deaths) had cardiac deaths. Higher grade of CFS and STS score significantly correlated with 1-year mortality. Severe frailty and the high operative risk group (CFS ≥7 and STS score ≥8.7%) had an extremely poor prognosis (1-year mortality, 81.2%). Conclusions: In this BAV cohort, severe frailty was a predictor of 1-year mortality in elderly patients with severe AS.
