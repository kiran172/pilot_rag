Title: [Advantages of minimally invasive approach for carotid endarterectomy].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To identify the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches for carotid endarterectomy (conventional, longitudinal and transverse incision).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 58 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on surgical approach. Group 1 (n=37) - minimal skin incision (less than 5 cm). There were subgroup 1A (transverse minimal skin incision along the natural skin wrinkle, n=17) and subgroup 1B (longitudinal minimal skin incision, n=20). Group 2 (n=21) - conventional longitudinal incision. Surgical outcomes were analyzed after 1 month and 1 year. End-points were mortality, stroke, TIA, cranial nerve neuropathy. Cosmetic effect was evaluated using POSAS scale (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale, Draaijers, 2004).
RESULTS: Mortality, stroke and TIA were absent after 1 month. Cranial nerve neuropathy was not observed in subgroup 1A and diagnosed in 2 (10%) patients of subgroup 1B and 6 (28.5%) patients of group 2. Cosmetic effect: subgroup 1A - 48.4±9.5 scores, subgroup 1B - 52.4±9.2, group 2 - 63.1±11.1 (p<0.05). The outcomes after 12 months: mortality was absent in subgroups 1A and 1B, 2 patients died in group 2 from AMI. Stroke was absent in subgroups 1A and 1B, group 2 - 1 patient. Cranial nerve neuropathy was absent in 1A and 1B subgroups and diagnosed in 4 (21%) patients of group 2. Cosmetic effect: subgroup 1A - 37.2 scores, subgroup 1B - 40.0 scores, group 2 - 55.1 scores. Physical component of QOL: subgroup 1A - 51.63±6.31 scores, subgroup 1B - 46.01±7.53 scores, group 2 - 38.85±5.33 scores. Psychological component of QOL: subgroup 1A - 49.64±6.72 scores, subgroup 1B - 45.68±5.63 scores, group 2 - 48.6±7.36 scores (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Transverse minimal skin incision for carotid endarterectomy is a safe alternative to classic longitudinal incision and reduces the risk of postoperative complications with significant cosmetic effect.
