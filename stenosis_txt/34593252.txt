Title: Portal Vein Stent Placement in Anastomotic Stenosis After Deceased Donor Liver Transplantation: A Case Report.

Abstract: Vascular complications (VCs) after liver transplantation (LT) frequently result in graft and patient loss. The smaller vessels and the insufficient length for reconstruction in living donor LT and pediatric transplantation predispose patients to a higher incidence of VCs. Herein we present a case of portal vein stenosis (PVS) in an adult deceased donor LT recipient with portal vein thrombosis requiring extended thrombectomy at the time of LT. He presented with ascites 4 months after LT, was diagnosed with PVS, and was successfully treated with percutaneous transhepatic venoplasty and placement of a portal stent. This case highlights the importance of Doppler ultrasound as a screening modality for detection of VCs after LT and the pivotal role of endovascular repair as a first-line treatment for PVS.
