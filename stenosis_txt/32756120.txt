Title: Surgical treatment of extensive hepatic alveolar echinococcosis using a three-dimensional visualization technique combined with allograft blood vessels: A case report.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE) presents a high pathogenicity and case fatality rate. The main treatment for HAE is surgical resection. Giant lesions in the liver and invasion of the pathogen into the retrohepatic inferior vena cava are usually associated with a poor prognosis when radical resection cannot be performed.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year-old man who underwent hydatidectomy 7 years prior noted a recurrence of HAE. He was subsidized and admitted to our hospital for the purpose of surgical treatment.
DIAGNOSIS: By computed tomography, angiography and three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography reconstruction images, multiple, giant HAE with 75% stenosis was confirmed.
INTERVENTIONS: With the 3D visualization technique, we designed the surgical plan and performed radical resection of the lesions, including the invaded inferior vena cava, and maximized retention of normal liver tissue. The abdominal aorta of an organ donor was used for vascular allograft reconstruction.
OUTCOMES: The patient recovered gradually after the operation. He was followed up for 3 months, and the reconstructed vein patency was good.
LESSONS: The 3D visualization technique combined with a blood vessel allograft allowed us to expand indications for radical resection of extensive HAE.
