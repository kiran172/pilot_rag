Title: Perioperative Management of Valvular Heart Disease in Patients Undergoing Non-Cardiac Surgery.

Abstract: Postoperative cardiovascular complications (either in a hospital or within 30 days after the operation) are among the most common problems with non-cardiac surgeries (NCSs). Pre-existing cardiac comorbidities add significant risk to the development of such complications. Valvular heart disease (VHD), a rather frequent cardiac comorbidity (especially in the elderly population), can pose serious life-threatening peri-/postoperative complications. Being familiar with the recommended perioperative management of patients with VHD or an implanted prosthetic heart valve who are scheduled for NCS is of great importance in daily clinical practice. Although recently published guidelines by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) for the management of VHD and perioperative management of patients undergoing NCS addresses the mentioned problem, a comprehensive review of the guidelines that provides an easy-to-use summary of the recommendations and their similarities and differences is missing in the published literature. In this review article, we summarize all of the relevant important information based on the latest data published in both guidelines needed for practical decision-making in the perioperative management of patients with VHD or after valvular repair (with prosthetic heart valve) who are scheduled for NCS.
