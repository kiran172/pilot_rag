Title: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by acute coronary syndrome: A case report.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) can be provoked by various triggers. It should be differentiated from acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Herein, we report a case of TC triggered by ACS. An 80-year-old woman was referred to the emergency room because of prolonged chest pain and ST-segment elevations. Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular apical ballooning, findings suggestive of TC rather than ACS. Emergency coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis of the first diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery with distal flow delay. Recanalization of the diagonal branch was achieved by stent implantation and her chest pain was resolved. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased signal intensities in the apex and the inner layer of the anterior wall on fat-suppressed, T2-weighted imaging. The present case highlights the importance of recognizing TC in relation to ACS not only as a differential diagnosis but also as a possibly concomitant condition unless clinical features fit one diagnosis.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can be provoked by various conditions and differentiated from acute coronary syndrome based on the presence or absence of coronary artery stenosis. Our case highlights the importance of acknowledging that takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be induced by acute coronary syndrome.
