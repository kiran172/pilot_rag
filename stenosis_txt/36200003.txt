Title: Diabetes Mellitus and Clinical Outcomes in Carotid Artery Revascularization Using Second-Generation, MicroNet-Covered Stents: Analysis from the PARADIGM Study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) using conventional (single-layer) stents is associated with worse clinical outcomes in diabetes mellitus (DM) vs. non-DM patients: an effect driven largely by lesion-related adverse events. CAS outcomes with MicroNet-covered stents (MCS) in diabetic patients have not been evaluated.
AIM: To compare short- and long-term clinical outcomes and restenosis rate in DM vs. non-DM patients with carotid stenosis treated using MCS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective study in all-comer symptomatic and increased-stroke-risk asymptomatic carotid stenosis, 101 consecutive patients (age 51-86 years, 41% diabetics) underwent 106 MCS-CAS. Clinical outcomes and duplex ultrasound velocities were assessed periprocedurally and at 30 days/12 months.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of DM vs. non-DM patients were similar except for a higher prevalence of recent cerebral symptoms in DM. Type 1 and type 1+2 plaques were more prevalent in DM patients (26.7% vs. 9.8%, p = 0.02; 62.2% vs. 37.7%, p = 0.01). Proximal embolic protection was more prevalent in DM (60% vs. 36%; p = 0.015). 30-day clinical complications were limited to a single periprocedural minor stroke in DM (2.4% vs. 0%, p = 0.22). 12-month in-stent velocities and clinical outcomes were not different (death rate 4.8% vs. 3.3%; p = 0.69; no new strokes). Restenosis rate was not different (0% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS: MCS may offset the adverse impact of DM on periprocedural, 30-day, and 12-month clinical complications of CAS and minimize the risk of in-stent restenosis. In this increased-stroke-risk cohort, adverse event rate was low both in DM and non-DM. Further larger-scale clinical datasets including extended follow-ups are warranted.
