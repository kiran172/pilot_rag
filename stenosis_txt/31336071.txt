Title: Effect of Pulmonary Hypertension on Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes of mitral valve replacement (MVR) recipients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) remain unclear. We determined the effect of concomitant PH on the clinical outcomes and late-onset progression of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) after MVR for rheumatic mitral stenosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 394 patients who underwent MVR between January 2000 and December 2013. PH was defined as systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) >50 mm Hg. Changes in echocardiographic parameters (preoperative to postoperative), TR progression (grade ≥ II), and long-term survival were evaluated according to the presence of PH at MVR (non-PH, n = 322; PH, n = 72).
RESULTS: The 10-year overall survival rate was significantly lower in the PH group (79.7% vs 90.7%, P = .04), whereas the rate of freedom from TR progression was similar between groups (76.9% vs 80.5%, P = .373). High preoperative sPAP and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) did not affect TR progression. However, substantial postoperative reductions in sPAP and RVSP protected against TR progression (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.966 [0.942-0.991], P = .008, and 0.973 [0.960-0.986], P < .001, respectively). The 10-year rate of freedom from TR progression was significantly higher in patients with substantial sPAP and RVSP reductions (sPAP, 84.2% vs 70.6%, P = .003; RVSP, 84.9% vs 71.0%, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although concomitant PH at MVR is associated with poor long-term survival, adequate sPAP and RVSP reduction can prevent TR progression even in patients with severe PH preoperatively. Therefore, we suggest careful monitoring of PAP and RVSP after MVR and should make an effort to reduce postoperative PAP.
