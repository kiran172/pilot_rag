Title: Anatomical and surgical considerations for Bow Hunter's syndrome in an elderly patient.

Abstract: Bow Hunter's syndrome (BHS) is an uncommon condition characterized by impingement of one of the two vertebral arteries induced by cervical rotation, causing symptomatic vertebrobasilar insufficiency of the posterior cerebral circulation. We report a case of BHS in an 84-year-old male. Two months following a motor vehicle accident, the patient presented to an urgent care facility with subsequent transfer to the emergency department with complaints of lightheadedness upon right-lateral head movement. A cerebral angiogram demonstrated mild focal stenosis in the dominant left vertebral artery at the C2 level when in neutral position with significant worsening of the stenosis in the right-lateral head position with absent anterograde flow, consistent with BHS. Resultantly, the patient was referred for neurosurgery and successfully underwent placement of right-sided C2-C4 postero-lateral instrumentation and left-sided C2-C3 laminar screws projected towards the right side. This case highlights the importance of imaging in BHS diagnosis and guidance for treatment, as well as the need for a surgical standard of care for BHS patients.
