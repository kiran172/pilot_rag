Title: Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement after pulmonary homograft dysfunction.

Abstract: Pulmonary homograft dysfunction is challenging to treat in patients with a previous Ross procedure, and results in significant morbidity and mortality in case of reoperation. We report the case of a patient with early severe pulmonary homograft stenosis 18 months after a Ross procedure and successful management using transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement.
