Title: Achieving normal pulmonary function following tracheoplasty in infancy.

Abstract: Infant long-segment congenital tracheal stenosis (LTS) is rare and presents a challenging clinical scenario. We describe the management of a child who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following a respiratory arrest and underwent slide tracheoplasty in infancy for severe LTS and required repeated bronchoscopic reinterventions for recurrent tracheal granulations. At 9â€‰years of age, the child has normal pulmonary function testing and a normal exercise tolerance.
