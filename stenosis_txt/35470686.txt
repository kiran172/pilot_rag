Title: Coronary Flow Variations Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Affect Diastolic Nonhyperemic Pressure Ratios More Than the Whole Cycle Ratios.

Abstract: Background Post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) fractional flow reserve ≥0.90 is an accepted marker of procedural success, and a cutoff of ≥0.95 has recently been proposed for post-PCI instantaneous wave-free ratio. However, stability of nonhyperemic pressure ratios (NHPRs) post-PCI is not well characterized, and transient reactive submaximal hyperemia post-PCI may affect their precision. We performed this study to assess stability and reproducibility of NHPRs post-PCI. Methods and Results Fifty-seven patients (age, 63.77±10.67 years; men, 71%) underwent hemodynamic assessment immediately post-PCI and then after a recovery period of 10, 20, and 30 minutes and repeated at 3 months. Manual offline analysis was performed to derive resting and hyperemic pressure indexes (Pd/Pa resting pressure gradient, mathematically derived instantaneous wave-free ratio, resting full cycle ratio, and fractional flow reserve) and microcirculatory resistances (basal microvascular resistance and index of microvascular resistance). Transient submaximal hyperemia occurring post-PCI was demonstrated by longer thermodilution time at 30 minutes compared with immediately post-PCI; mean difference of thermodilution time was 0.17 seconds (95% CI, 0.07-0.26 seconds; P=0.04). Basal microcirculatory resistance was also higher at 30 minutes than immediately post-PCI; mean difference of basal microvascular resistance was 10.89 mm Hg.s (95% CI, 2.25-19.52 mm Hg.s; P=0.04). Despite this, group analysis confirmed no significant differences in the values of resting whole cycle pressure ratios (Pd/Pa and resting full cycle ratio) as well as diastolic pressure ratios (diastolic pressure ratio and mathematically derived instantaneous wave-free ratio). Whole cardiac cycle NHPRs demonstrated the best overall stability post-PCI, and 1 in 5 repeated diastolic NHPRs crossed the clinical decision threshold. Conclusions Whole cycle NHPRs demonstrate better reproducibility and clinical precision post-PCI than diastolic NHPRs, possibly because of less perturbation from predominantly diastolic reactive hyperemia and left ventricular stunning.
