Title: The Antiproliferative and Antifibrotic Effects of Cisplatin on Primary Human Vocal Fold Fibroblasts.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Vocal fold scarring and laryngeal stenosis are major clinical challenges. Current drugs do not efficiently reduce scarring. We examined the antiproliferative and antifibrotic effects of cisplatin on primary human vocal fold fibroblasts (HVFFs).
METHODS: HVFFs were cultured in vitro and identified by immunocytochemistry. The relative viability of HVFFs was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assays (CCK-8). The fibrogenic phenotype was induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and reversed by cisplatin as shown by immunocytochemistry. Real-time PCR and Western blotting assessed collagen III and I. Western blotting for Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad-3, p-Smad3 and caspase-3 were performed.
RESULTS: CCK-8 results showed that cisplatin decreased the relative viability of HVFFs, and Western blots revealed elevation of the apoptosis-related protein caspase-3 in HVFFs. Cisplatin treatment reduced α-smooth muscle actin staining intensity in the presence of TGF-β1. Real-time PCR revealed the downregulation of collagen III and I in cisplatin-treated HVFFs. The TGF-β1-induced increased fibrogenic protein levels were decreased by cisplatin. Reduced levels were detected at late time points.
CONCLUSIONS: Cisplatin induces antiproliferative and antifibrotic alterations in HVFFs. Cisplatin may prevent postoperative vocal fold scarring and laryngeal stenosis in patients treated with CO2 laser microsurgery and undergoing delayed wound healing.
