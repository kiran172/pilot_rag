Title: An unusual urethral foreign body "AA battery" associated with urethral stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Urethral foreign bodies are rare with a variety of causes, including psychiatric illness, autoeroticism, intoxication, and perceived contraception, we present a 49-yr-old man who went to the emergency ward 9-month ago inserting an AA battery in his urethra. The battery was removed without surgery after 24 hours. The patient was then referred to the hospital after 5 months with complaints of obstructive urinary symptoms such as decreased urinary caliber, diagnosed with penile urethral stricture, and undergoes dilatation of the urethra. Usually, in the case of urethral stricture, the initial steps including urethral dilation and internal urethrotomy can be used.
