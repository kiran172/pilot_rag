Title: Exercise-induced hypertension can increase the prevalence of coronary artery plaque among middle-aged male marathon runners.

Abstract: Marathon runners demonstrate a high incidence of coronary artery plaque; however, studies on runners with exercise-induced hypertension (EIH) are sparse. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of coronary artery plaque among marathon runners with EIH.Veteran male marathon runners (≥40 and <60 years) underwent an exercise stress test. They were divided into 2 groups: normal blood pressure group (NBPG, n = 22), with resting systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg and maximal exercise SBP <210 mm Hg, and EIH group (EIHG, n = 28), with resting blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg and maximal exercise SBP ≥210 mm Hg. Coronary artery plaque and stenosis were compared using multi-detector computed tomography.The proportion of subjects with a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score ≥10 or ≥100 units, 1 or ≥2 plaques, or plaques in ≥2 blood vessels was higher in the EIHG than in the normal blood pressure group (NBPG) (P<.05). The absolute CAC score was higher in the EIHG (42.6 ± 67.8) than in the NBPG (2.8 ± 6.0; P < .05). The CAC score distribution was higher in the EIHG (5-300 units) than in the NBPG (P < .05). The prevalence of coronary plaques and maximal luminal artery stenosis was higher in the EIHG than in the NBPG (P < .05). The EIHG showed 12 cases of stenosis, whereas the NBPG showed only 1 case (P < .05).In marathon runners, EIH was associated with increased prevalence of coronary artery plaques and could be a new risk factor for coronary artery plaque formation. Therefore, preventive measures and EIH monitoring using an exercise stress test, alongside multi-detector computed tomography, are recommended.
