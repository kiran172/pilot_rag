Title: The Association between Exercise-Induced Ventricular Premature Contractions and Long-Term Mortality in Patients without Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treadmill exercise test is widely used to determine cardiovascular risk and mortality. Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are frequently observed during exercise stress testing. The literature on the role of PVCs observed during treadmill exercise testing in predicting prognosis is controversial. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the clinical results of PVCs seen during exercise testing in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease confirmed by coronary angiography (CAG).
METHODS: The study population consisted of 1624 consecutive patients who were considered high risk according to the Duke treadmill risk score and had no significant stenosis on CAG from January 2016 to April 2021. The primary endpoints of the study were long-term all-cause mortality of patients who had PVCs during the exercise test or during the resting phase.
RESULTS: Long-term mortality was observed in 53 of the 1624 patients after a mean follow-up of 47 months. PVCs were observed in 293 (18.7%) patients without long-term mortality, and in 24 (45.3%) patients with long-term mortality (p < 0.001). The model adjusted for all covariates showed that the presence of PVCs in the recovery phase [p < 0.007, hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) 2.244 (1.244-4.047)] and advanced age [p < 0.001, HR (95% CI) 1.194 (1.143-1.247)] were associated with long-term all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: PVCs observed during treadmill exercise testing and the recovery phase were related to long-term mortality in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease.
