Title: Robotic YV plasty outcomes for bladder neck contracture vs. vesico-urethral anastomotic stricture.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of patients undergoing robotic YV plasty for bladder neck contracture (BNC) vs. vesico-urethral anastomotic stricture (VUAS).
METHODS: A retrospective study included male patients who underwent robotic YV plasty for BNC after endoscopic treatment of BPH or VUAS between August 2019 and March 2023 at a single academic center. The primary assessed was the patency rate at 1 month post-YV plasty and during the last follow-up visit.
RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were analyzed, comprising 6 in the VUAS group and 15 in the BNC group. Patients with VUAS had significantly longer operative times (277.5 vs. 146.7 min; p = 0.008) and hospital stay (3.2 vs. 1.7 days; p = 0.03). Postoperative complications were more common in the VUAS group (66.7% vs. 26.7%; p = 0.14). All patients resumed spontaneous voiding postoperatively. Five patients (23.8%) who developed de novo stress urinary incontinence had already an AUS (n = 1) or required concomitant AUS implantation (n = 3), all of whom were in the VUAS group (83.3% vs. 0%; p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients improved was similar in both groups (PGII = 1 or 2: 83.3% vs. 80%; p = 0.31). Stricture recurrence occurred in 9.5% of patients in the whole cohort, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.50). Long-term reoperation was required in three VUAS patients, showing a statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Robotic YV plasty is feasible for both VUAS and BNC. While functional outcomes and stricture-free survival may be similar for both conditions, the perioperative outcomes were less favorable for VUAS patients.
