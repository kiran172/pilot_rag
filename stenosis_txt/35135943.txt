Title: Early and Long-Term Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Selected Nonagenarians in Japan.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is increasingly being performed in very elderly patients, although its efficacy and validity remain unclear. This study evaluated real-world TAVI outcomes in Japanese nonagenarians with severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This single-center study retrospectively assessed the early and long-term clinical outcomes of TAVI in nonagenarians (n=35) and in patients aged <90 years (group Y; n=171). There were no in-hospital deaths in either group. The device success rate and early safety were comparable between the 2 groups. The 5-year rates of freedom from cardiac events and deaths were equivalent in both groups. The cumulative survival rate at 5 years was non-significantly lower in nonagenarians (32.6% in nonagenarians vs. 57.5% in patients aged <90 years, P=0.49). There were no differences in the 5-year survival between nonagenarians after TAVI and the sex- and age-matched populations (P=0.18). The Cox regression model revealed that lower hemoglobin levels were associated with all-cause mortality (P=0.02), and age ≥90 years was not associated with all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The early and long-term clinical outcomes of TAVI for selected Japanese nonagenarians were comparable to those in patients aged <90 years. Nonagenarians who underwent TAVI achieved an acceptable prognosis compared to the sex- and age-matched population; thus, TAVI appears to be effective for treating aortic stenosis in Japanese nonagenarians.
