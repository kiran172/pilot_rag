Title: Williams Syndrome With Rare Ureteric Abnormality.

Abstract: Williams syndrome (WS), also known as Williams-Beuren syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by infantile hypercalcemia, short stature, a varying degree of mental retardation, elfin-like facial features, and cardiovascular abnormalities, including systemic hypertension, aortic hypoplasia, coarctation of the aorta, and valvular heart disease (aortic and pulmonic stenosis, mitral valve prolapsed or bicuspid aortic valve). It is also characterized by friendly and outgoing personality. The majority of WS cases are sporadic, while few are familial. Both sporadic and familial cases are due to deletion of chromosome 7 (7q11.23). Herein, we present an autopsy case of a 16-day-old male infant born to a 25-year-old mother with a history of William syndrome. Prenatal echocardiogram showed supravalvular aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis. The postnatal course was complicated by feeding difficulties and desaturation. Gross autopsy findings included generalized edema, macrocephaly with short neck, and multiple facial anomalies (mandibular hypoplasia, depressed nasal bridge, long philtrum, ear malformation, and wide mouth). The heart was hypertrophied with obstructed ventricles and rudimentary, hypoplastic aortic root. An enlarged, dilated, and tortuous left ureter was a unique finding to this case, in addition to variation in the renal arteries' size and an small bowel outpouching located 33 cm from the ileocecal valve. Cytogenetic analysis revealed deletion of chromosome 7 (7q11.23). In conclusion, majority of WS cases are sporadic, and few are familial and are inherited as autosomal dominant.
