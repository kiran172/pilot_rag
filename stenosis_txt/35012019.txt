Title: Clinical Implications of Changes in Respiratory Instability Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Respiratory instability, which can be quantified using respiratory stability time (RST), is associated with the severity and prognostic impact of the disease in patients with chronic heart failure. However, its clinical implications in patients with severe aortic stenosis receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remain unknown.
METHODS: Patients who received TAVR and had paired measurements of RST at a baseline and one week following TAVR were prospectively included. Changes in RST following TAVR and its impact on post-TAVR heart failure readmissions were investigated.
RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (median age, 86 years old; 35% men) were included. The baseline RST was correlated with the severity of heart failure including elevated levels of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (p &lt; 0.05 for all). RST improved significantly following TAVR from 34 (26, 37) s to 36 (33, 38) s (p &lt; 0.001). Post-TAVR lower RST (&lt;33 s, n = 18) was associated with a higher 2-year cumulative incidence of heart failure readmission (21% vs. 8%, p = 0.039) with a hazard ratio of 5.47 (95% confidence interval 0.90-33.2).
CONCLUSION: Overall, respiratory instability improved following TAVR. Persistent respiratory instability following TAVR was associated with heart failure recurrence.
