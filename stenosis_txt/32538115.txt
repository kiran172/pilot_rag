Title: Paclitaxel coated-balloon (PCB) versus standard plain old balloon (POB) fistuloplasty for failing dialysis access.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel-coated balloon compared with conventional plain balloon for the treatment of failing native dialysis access.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 60 patients presenting to the Kasr Alainy Hospitals and Aseer Central Hospital in the period from September 2015 to December 2017 with failing native vascular access. Dilatation with a plain balloon was done in 30 patients (group I) and with a paclitaxel-coated balloon in 30 patients (group II) with either stenosis or occlusion. The majority were outflow lesions, with 20 (66.7 %) patients in group I and 21 (70%) patients in group II. Mean balloon diameter was 7.1mm (± 1.5mm) compared with 6.5mm (± 1.2mm) and length 66mm (± 19.1mm) compared with 54.6mm (± 15.7mm), respectively. Safety endpoint was reported as 30 day's freedom from procedure-related major complications and mortality. Procedural technical success was defined as a residual diameter 30% or less for treated lesions. Target lesion primary patency, circuit primary patency and secondary patency were reported at 3, 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: There were no 30-day procedure-related major complications or mortality in either group. Procedural technical success of 100% was achieved in both groups. Target lesion primary patency, circuit primary patency and secondary patency in group II were better than in group I, especially at 12 months (90% vs 66.7%, 83.3% vs 60% and 96.7% vs 93.3%, respectively). There was a statistically significant difference in target lesion primary patency (p = 0.029) in patients who were treated with paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasties.
CONCLUSION: The paclitaxel-coated balloon proved to be safe and effective, and improved the patency of failing vascular access. Results are comparable with previous studies.
