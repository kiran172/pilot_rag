Title: Percutaneous stone removal using cobra-shaped sheath and cholangioscopy for multiple hepatolithiasis with choledochoduodenal anastomotic stenosis.

Abstract: Management of multiple hepatolithiasis with choledochoenteral anastomotic stenosis remains difficult and time-consuming. We report a case of a 77-year-old man with severe right hypochondoralgia, treated with percutaneous transhepatic balloon dilatation of choledocoduodenal anastomotic stenosis and percutaneous stone removal using 8Fr. cobra-shaped sheath and cholangioscopy. Hilar hepatic stones were pushed out into the duodenum through the dilated anastomosis using 5Fr. balloon catheter covered with the sheath and cholangioscopy. For stones located in the left, right anterior and aberrant right posterior hepatic ducts, a guidewire and a removal balloon catheter were inserted by using the cobra-shaped sheath. Stones pulled from the intrahepatic bile ducts to the common hepatic duct were pushed out into the duodenum. Clearance of intrahepatic bile duct stones was confirmed by balloon-occluded cholangiography using the cobra-shaped sheath and 6Fr. balloon catheter. The use of cobra-shaped sheath improved percutaneous stone removal, but the procedure needs further improvement.
