Title: Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging cardiac motion-based quantitative evaluation of global longitudinal strain among patients with coronary Heart Disease and functions of left ventricular ischemic myocardial segment.

Abstract: To investigate two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging (2D-STI)-based quantitative evaluation of the influences of different levels of coronary artery stenosis on left ventricular functions and its clinical diagnostic values, 120 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) were divided into control group (30 cases), mild stenosis group (30 cases), moderate stenosis group (30 cases), and severe stenosis group (30 cases) according to coronary angiography (CAG) results. They underwent routine ultrasound examination and 2D-STI examination. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of different levels of coronary artery stenosis. Global longitudinal strain (GLS) of left ventricular myocardium among patients in moderate and severe stenosis groups remarkably declined (P < 0.05). Global radial strain (GRS) and global circular strain (GCS) among patients in severe stenosis group dramatically reduced (P < 0.05). ROC curves revealed that available GLS=-17.2 was the cut-off value for screening moderate coronary stenosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) amounted to 57.3%, 58.4%, and 0.573, respectively. GLS, GRS, and GCS could be used to screen severe coronary stenosis. When GLS=-16.5 was the cut-off value for screening severe coronary stenosis, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC amounted to 84.3%, 82.5%, and 0.893, respectively. With the aggravation of stenosis, left ventricular systolic function of CHD patients was impaired more significantly. 2D-STI technique could be adopted for the quantitative evaluation of left ventricular strain of patients with coronary stenosis and provided a new method for early clinical diagnosis of CHD.
