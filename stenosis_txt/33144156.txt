Title: Usefulness of Thoracic Aortic Calcium to Predict 1-Year Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: In patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), vascular disease is associated with increased risk of mortality. Thoracic aortic calcification (TAC), an objective surrogate of vascular disease, could be a predictor of mortality after TAVI. We aimed to analyze the association between TAC burden and 1-year all-cause mortality in patients who underwent TAVI in a US population. From July 2015 through July 2017, a retrospective review of TAVI procedures was performed at Baylor Scott &amp; White-The Heart Hospital, Plano, Texas. Patients were analyzed for comorbidities, cardiac risk factors, and 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Restricted cubic splines analysis was used to define low, moderate, and high TAC categories. The association between TAC and survival was evaluated using unadjusted and adjusted Cox models. A total of 431 TAVI procedures were performed, of which TAC was measured in 374 (81%) patients. Median (interquartile range) age was 82 (77, 87) years, and 51% were male. Median (interquartile range) STS PROM was 5.6 (4.1, 8.2) %. Overall 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality was 1% and 10%, respectively. TAC was categorized as low (&lt;1.6 cm3), moderate (1.6 to 2.9 cm3), and high (&gt;2.9 cm3). At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 16% in patients with high TAC compared with 6% in the low and moderate TAC categories (p = 0.008). Unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression analysis showed a significant increase in mortality for patients with high TAC compared with low TAC (hazard ratio 2.98, 95% confidence interval [1.34-6.63]), but not significant compared with moderate TAC group. TAC is a predictor of late mortality after TAVI. In conclusion, adding TAC to preoperative evaluation may provide an objective, reproducible, and potentially widely available tool that can help in shared decision-making.
