Title: Incidence and Outcomes of Posterior Circulation Involvement in Moyamoya Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a progressive, occlusive disease of the internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches, with the subsequent development of an abnormal vascular network that is rupture-prone. Steno-occlusive changes in the posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) may contribute to worsened outcomes in patients with MMD; however, there is little information on the incidence and natural history of posterior circulation MMD (PCMMD). We describe clinical PCMMD characteristics in a large cohort of patients with MMD.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with MMD treated between 1991 and 2019 at a large academic medical center. Demographics, perioperative outcomes, and radiological phenotypes were recorded for 770 patients. PCA disease was graded as either 0 (no disease), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe or occluded) based on cerebral angiography. Patients with angiographically confirmed MMD diagnosis with at least 6 months follow-up and completion of revascularization surgery were included; patients with intracranial atherosclerosis, intracranial dissection, vasculitis, and undefined inflammatory processes were excluded. The presence of stenosis/occlusion was graded radiographically to assess for disease progression and the prevalence of risk factors related to reduced progression-free survival.
RESULTS: In all, 686 patients met the inclusion criteria, with PCA disease identified in 282 (41.1%) patients. Of those 282 patients with PCMMD, disease severity ranged from 99 (35.1%) with mild, 72 (25.5%) with moderate, and 111 (39.4%) with severe. The total number of postoperative complications was significantly associated with PCMMD severity (P=0.0067). Additionally, PCMMD severity correlated with worse postoperative modified Rankin Scale scores (P&lt;0.0001). At a mean follow-up of 6.0Â±3.9 (range, 0.1-25.0) years, a total of 60 (12.6%) patients showed new/worsening PCMMD. The overall postoperative, progression-free survival in patients with PCMMD was 95.4% at 1 year, 82.4% at 3 years, 68.8% at 5 years, and 28.3% at 10 years, with prognostic factors for progression including preoperative PCMMD status, history of tobacco use, and hypertension (P&lt;0.0001, P&lt;0.001, and P&lt;0.0001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: PCA disease involvement in MMD is associated with higher rates of ischemic perioperative complications and worsened functional outcomes, likely due to reduced collateral flow. Ten-year progression of PCA disease is highly likely and should be monitored throughout follow-up; future studies will assess the impact of PCA disease progression on long-term outcomes.
