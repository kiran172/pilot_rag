Title: Uretero-enteric Strictures After Robot Assisted Radical Cystectomy: Prevalence and Management Over Two Decades.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the prevalence, predictors, management, and trends for ureteroenteric strictures (UES) after robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC).
METHODS: Retrospective review of our RARC database was performed (2005-2022). UES was described in terms of timing, laterality, and management. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to depict time to UES. Local regression was used to assess trend of UES over time and multivariable regression to identify variables associated with UES.
RESULTS: UES occurred in 109 patients (15%). UES occurred in 13%, 17%, and 19% at 1, 3, and 5 years after RARC, respectively. Incidence of UES decreased in 2017, coinciding with stentless uretero-enteric anastomosis. UES occurred on the right in 33%, on the left in 46%, and bilaterally in 21%. All patients were initially managed by nephrostomy/stent. Surgical revision was required in 45% of patients, of which 13% developed recurrent UES after revision. On MVA, UES formation was associated with ureteral stents (OR 2.27, 95%CI 1.01-5.10, P = .05) and receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR 2.01, 95%CI 1.24-3.25, P = .005).
CONCLUSION: UES occurred in 15% of patients after RARC, with 45% of patients requiring surgical reimplantation. Ureteral stents and the receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were associated with UES formation.
