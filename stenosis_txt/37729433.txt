Title: A bioengineered trachea-like structure improves survival in a rabbit tracheal defect model.

Abstract: A practical strategy for engineering a trachea-like structure that could be used to repair or replace a damaged or injured trachea is an unmet need. Here, we fabricated bioengineered cartilage (BC) rings from three-dimensionally printed fibers of poly(É›-caprolactone) (PCL) and rabbit chondrocytes. The extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by the chondrocytes combined with the PCL fibers formed a "concrete-rebar structure," with ECM deposited along the PCL fibers, forming a grid similar to that of native cartilage. PCL fiber-hydrogel rings were then fabricated and alternately stacked with BC rings on silicone tubes. This trachea-like structure underwent vascularization after heterotopic transplantation into rabbits for 4 weeks. The vascularized bioengineered trachea-like structure was then orthotopically transplanted by end-to-end anastomosis to native rabbit trachea after a segment of trachea had been resected. The bioengineered trachea-like structure displayed mechanical properties similar to native rabbit trachea and transmural angiogenesis between the rings. The 8-week survival rate in transplanted rabbits was 83.3%, and the respiratory rate of these animals was similar to preoperative levels. This bioengineered trachea-like structure may have potential for treating tracheal stenosis and other tracheal injuries.
