Title: How I do it? Posterior full-endoscopic cervical discectomy with retrocorporeal technique and hemilaminectomy for highly migrated cervical disk herniation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Given that highly migrated cervical disk herniation (CDH) is a rare condition, its treatment remains controversial as reported by Srinivasan (2011). When the primary pathology is located posterior or lateral to the lateral edge of the spinal cord that causes a foraminal or far lateral disk herniation, a posterior full-endoscopic cervical discectomy (pFECD) may be appropriate as reported by Ahn (2020).
METHODS: We introduced the pFECD with retrocorporeal technique and hemilaminectomy performed on a case of C4/C5 highly downward migrated CDH with left C5/C6 cervical neural foraminal stenosis (Fig.Â 1).
CONCLUSIONS: pFECD with retrocorporeal technique and hemilaminectomy could be an effective and minimally invasive option for highly migrated CDH.
