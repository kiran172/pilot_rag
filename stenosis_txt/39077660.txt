Title: Artificial Intelligence in the Screening, Diagnosis, and Management of Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical management of aortic stenosis (AS) has redefined our approach to the assessment and management of this heterogenous valvular heart disease (VHD). While the large-scale early detection of valvular conditions is limited by socioeconomic constraints, AI offers a cost-effective alternative solution for screening by utilizing conventional tools, including electrocardiograms and community-level auscultations, thereby facilitating early detection, prevention, and treatment of AS. Furthermore, AI sheds light on the varied nature of AS, once considered a uniform condition, allowing for more nuanced, data-driven risk assessments and treatment plans. This presents an opportunity to re-evaluate the complexity of AS and to refine treatment using data-driven risk stratification beyond traditional guidelines. AI can be used to support treatment decisions including device selection, procedural techniques, and follow-up surveillance of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in a reproducible manner. While recognizing notable AI achievements, it is important to remember that AI applications in AS still require collaboration with human expertise due to potential limitations such as its susceptibility to bias, and the critical nature of healthcare. This synergy underpins our optimistic view of AI's promising role in the AS clinical pathway.
