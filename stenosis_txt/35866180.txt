Title: Postinflammatory rupture of right coronary artery ostium complicating Behçet disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Behçet disease (BD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, characterized by variable clinical manifestations.
METHODS: A 28-year-old woman with BD Cardiovascular and Bipolar Disorder underwent emergency surgical treatment of ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm for ruptured right coronary ostium.A modified Bentall procedure with tricuspid annuloplasty, surgical thrombectomy, and a single coronary artery bypass using a saphenous vein graft was performed. A biological prosthesis was used initially but subsequently deteriorated. We then successfully performed a valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
RESULTS: The postoperative recovery was uneventful and at follow-up, two years post valve procedure, the patient was completely symptom-free. She remains under long-term medical surveillance.
CONCLUSION: The management of BD with cardiac involvement must be led by a multidisciplinary team.
