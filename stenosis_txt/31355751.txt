Title: Coronary stent implantation for acute basilar artery occlusion with underlying stenosis.

Abstract: AIMS: Our aim was to study the effectiveness of coronary stent implantation during the endovascular treatment (EVT) of acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) with occlusion-underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed 91 consecutive BAO patients who underwent EVT between February 2014 and January 2019 in a single, high-volume neurointerventional centre. We studied the effect of immediate coronary stent implantation on the clinical outcome of BAO with occlusion-underlying stenosis. BAO patients with underlying ICAS (n=41) were characterised by longer symptom-onset-to-reperfusion times (231 min vs 173 min, p=0.0020), lower TICI 2b-3 reperfusion rates (65.85% vs 90.00%, p=0.0084), and higher overall mortality (HR 2.021, p=0.0417) compared to the BAO cases without ICAS (n=50). The patients undergoing stenting (n=18) had lower residual basilar artery (BA) stenosis (14.7% vs 81.0%, p<0.0001), higher chance for functional recovery (OR 7.6, p=0.0250) and higher chance of survival (HR 4.163, p=0.0026) compared to the BAO-ICAS cases treated without coronary stents (n=21).
CONCLUSIONS: The immediate treatment of the occlusion-underlying stenosis with coronary stents and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in BAO was associated with improved overall survival and better functional outcomes.
