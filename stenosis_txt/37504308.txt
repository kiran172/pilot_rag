Title: Endoscopic Stenting for Malignant Dysphagia in Patients with Esophageal Cancer.

Abstract: Malignant dysphagia is a common problem in patients with esophageal cancer. Endoscopic stenting can resolve dysphagia caused by malignant stricture; however, controversy exists regarding the use of esophageal stenting for the treatment of malignant stricture, including whether stenting or radiotherapy is superior, whether stenting before or after radiotherapy is safe, whether stenting before or after chemotherapy is safe, and whether low-radial-force stents are safer than conventional stents. Among treatment options for malignant dysphagia, stenting may have some disadvantages in terms of pain relief and the risk of adverse events compared with radiotherapy and in terms of survival compared with gastrostomy. Additionally, the risk of stent-related adverse events is significantly associated with prior radiotherapy. The risk of perforation is especially high when a radiation dose of >40 Gy is delivered to the esophagus after stenting, whereas perforation is not associated with prior chemotherapy or additional chemotherapy after stenting. Nevertheless, stenting remains an important palliative option, especially for patients with a short life expectancy and a strong desire for oral intake, because stenting can facilitate a more rapid improvement in dysphagia than radiotherapy or gastrostomy. The application of a low-radial-force stent should be considered to reduce the risk of adverse events, especially in patients with prior radiotherapy.
