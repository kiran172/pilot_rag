Title: Imaging diagnosis and research progress of carotid plaque vulnerability.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke (IS) exhibits a high disability rate, mortality, and recurrence rate, imposing a serious threat to human survival and health. Its occurrence is affected by various factors. Although the previous research has demonstrated that the occurrence of IS is mainly associated with lumen stenosis caused by carotid atherosclerotic plaque (AP), recent studies have revealed that many patients will still suffer from IS even with mild carotid artery lumen stenosis. Blood supply disturbance causes 10% of IS to the corresponding cerebral blood supply area caused by carotid vulnerable plaque. Thrombus blockage of distal branch vessels caused by rupture of vulnerable carotid plaque is the main cause of ischemic stroke. Therefore, how to accurately evaluate vulnerable plaque and intervene as soon as possible is a problem that needs to be solved in clinic. The vulnerability of plaque is determined by its internal components, including thin and incomplete fibrous cap, necrotic lipid core, intra-plaque hemorrhage, intra-plaque neovascularization, and ulcerative plaque formation. The development of imaging technology enables the routine detection of AP vulnerability. By analyzing the pathological changes, characteristics, and formation mechanism of carotid plaque vulnerability, this article aims to explore the modern imaging methods which can be used to identify plaque composition and plaque vulnerability to provide a reference basis for disease diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
