Title: Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors of Periprocedural Myocardial Injury in Patients with Elective PCI in a TCM Hospital.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with unstable angina (UA) who received elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) hospital and to analyze the related risk factors of periprocedural myocardial injury (PMI).
METHODS: On the basis of cross-sectional investigation, the case-control method was adopted. We retrospectively collected clinical data of patients with UA who successfully received elective PCI in Beijing Hospital of TCM from February 2017 to February 2019. Based on the occurrence of PMI, the case-control was formed. The influence of related factors on PMI occurrence was analyzed using the logistic multiple regression equation based on the parameters between the comparison groups.
RESULTS: 1. Incidence of PMI and related clinical features: Of the 265 UA patients, the incidence of PMI was 26.4%, nearly one quarter (23.4%) had old myocardial infarction, nearly half (45.3%) had previously received coronary intervention. The prevalence of patients with previous hypertension (75.8%), type 2 diabetes (57%), and high-low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia (69.3%) exceeded 50%, more than 50% of the patients have triple-vessel disease (50.2%). 2. Features of TCM syndrome elements: The main TCM syndromes of the investigated patients are blood stasis syndrome (81.1%) and Qi deficiency syndrome (77.3%), the others include Phlegm turbidity syndrome (53.2%), Yang deficiency syndrome (50.9%), Yin deficiency syndrome (50.1%), Qi stagnation syndrome (30.1%), and coagulated cold syndrome (17.1%). 3. Factors of PMI occurrence: According to the occurrence of PMI, 265 patients were divided into PMI group (n = 70) and non-PMI group (n = 195). The comparison between groups shows that the preoperative SYNTAX score, the number of stents, and the total length of stents of the patients in the PMI group were higher than those in the non-PMI group (P &lt; 0.05); the patients in the PMI group treated by Shen-Yuan-Dan (SYD), a Chinese medicine prescription with Qi-supplementing and blood stasis-purging, were significantly lower than those in the non-PMI group (P &lt; 0.05). Brought these four factors (preoperative SYNTAX score, number of stents implanted, total length of implanted stents, and treated by SYD) into the binary logistic regression equation, those who were only treated by SYD have statistical significance in the equation as a protective factor (OR 0.327, 95% CI 0.117-0.916, P=0.033).
CONCLUSION: Patients with UA who received elective PCI in TCM institutions may have clinical characteristics including multiple accompanying diseases and high stenosis coronary artery, in which the incidence of poor blood glucose control and high rate of three-vessel coronary disease are particularly significant. The TCM syndromes are mainly Qi deficiency and blood stasis syndromes. The decrease of PMI may be attributed to the application of SYD in the real world. This trial is registered at ChiCTR2100043465.
