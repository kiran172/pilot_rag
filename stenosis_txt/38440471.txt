Title: Tracheostomy Complications: Insights from a Two-Year, 15-Case Analysis at a Tertiary Care Facility.

Abstract: The objective of this case series was to analyse the complications that arise from tracheostomy procedures conducted in a tertiary healthcare facility throughout a two-year timeframe. Fifteen occurrences of complications were observed out of the 100 tracheostomies that were studied, suggesting a prevalence rate of 15%. The detected complications included subcutaneous emphysema, misplacement of the tube, infection at the surgical site, and tracheal stenosis, among various others. Considerable indications of complication were identified, encompassing variables such as age and a history of head and neck cancer. The findings of this study highlight the significance of personalized patient care, vigilant monitoring, and proactive measures for individuals receiving tracheostomy. Further investigations are necessary to validate these findings and improve patient safety and outcomes in the realm of tracheostomy surgeries.
