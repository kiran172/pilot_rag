Title: Sheathless Apical-Femoral Rail Technique for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement - Case Report of a Difficult to Cross Stenosis.

Abstract: A severely stenosed and calcified prosthetic aortic valve may be difficult to cross, on occasion even with only a wire. In the majority of cases eventually the valve will be crossed, but at a cost of prolonged fluoroscopy time, resulting in excessive exposure to radiation. It is therefore important to consider alternative techniques. The apical-femoral rail technique has been previously described. However, this technique involved establishing apical access, either surgically or percutaneously with a sheath. In the current case we describe a modified apical-femoral rail technique, performed sheathless with removal of the apical wire, allowing for spontaneous sealing.
