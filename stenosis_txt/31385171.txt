Title: Usability of Inferior Vena Cava Interposition Graft During Living Donor Liver Transplantation: Is This Approach Always Necessary?

Abstract: PURPOSE: To share the outcome of caval reconstruction technique in patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) with inferior vena cava (IVC) interposition grafting.
METHODS: Between January 2009 and December 2018, an artificial or homologous interposition vascular graft was used for the continuity of resected native (IVC) due to various reasons in 29 of 1740 patients who underwent LDLT at our institute. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Sixteen female and 13 male patients ranging 6-67 years of age were included. Right, left, and left lobe lateral segments were used in 22, 5, and 2 patients, respectively. The three leading LDLT indications were primary or idiopathic Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) (n = 12), alveolar echinococcosis (n = 7), and secondary BCS (n = 5). The three leading indications for IVC interposition grafting were thrombosis, dense fibrosis, and IVC invasion caused by tumor or echinococcosis. Homologous IVC graft was used in 17, homologous aortic graft in 7, and Dacron graft in 5 patients. Throughout the follow-up period, ascites ± pleural effusion and elevated liver enzymes were detected in 12 and 4 patients, respectively. Stenosis and/or thrombosis requiring one or more procedures such as 1-6 sessions balloon angioplasty, stent, and thrombus aspiration were observed in half of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Retrohepatic IVC damages are not a contraindication for LDLT. The presence or absence of venous collateral circulation is an important indicator of the need for IVC interposition graft use.
