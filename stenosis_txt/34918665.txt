Title: Tracheal rupture after vocal cord polyp resection: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) is one of the most common operations performed for glottic lesions. Several protection measures are taken to prevent tracheal damage. However, some protection measures and common postoperative complications may still cause delayed tracheal rupture in certain situations. Cases of tracheal rupture after surgery are extremely rare, and there are no previous reports of TLM of the glottis causing tracheal rupture.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A middle-aged woman who underwent TLM for bilateral vocal cord polyps developed sudden neck pain, followed by cough and subcutaneous emphysema.
DIAGNOSIS: She underwent head, neck, and chest computed tomography (CT), which revealed a 4-cm membranous tracheal tear located 4.5â€Šcm distal to the glottis, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema extending from the base of skull to the chest.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent an emergency surgical surgical chest exploration and tracheal repair.
OUTCOMES: One month after the surgery, the patient fully recovered with no tracheal stenosis or respiratory dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Conventional protective measures and common postoperative complications of TLM may also cause tracheal rupture.
