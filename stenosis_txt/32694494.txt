Title: Facet Arthropathy Following Disc Replacement Versus Rehabilitation: A Prospective Study With 8-Year Follow-Up.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of patients originally randomized to total disc replacement (TDR) or multidisciplinary rehabilitation.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term development of facet arthropathy (FA) after TDR versus nonoperative treatment, and to analyze the association between FA and clinical outcome.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: FA may appear or increase following TDR, but the natural course of FA is unclear, and no previous study has evaluated the long-term development of FA following TDR compared with nonoperative treatment.
METHODS: The study included 126 patients with chronic low back pain and degenerative changes in the lumbar intervertebral discs. The patients underwent pretreatment and 8-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 8-year follow-up computed tomography (CT) of the lumbar spine. The primary outcome measure was FA development (yes/no) on MRI at index level L4/L5 or L5/S1, defined as increased FA grade value from pretreatment to follow-up according to Weishaupt grading system. Secondary outcomes included the association between FA (on MRI and CT) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) or back pain as well as reoperations.
RESULTS: Increased index level FA grade was more frequent after TDR versus nonoperative treatment (36%, 25/69 vs. 2%, 1/57 of patients, P < 0.001), but was not related to change in ODI or back pain. At follow-up, index level FA grades were higher after TDR versus nonoperative treatment (odds ratio 4.0 MRI and 5.9 CT), but were not related to ODI less than or equal to 22. Four patients (6%) treated with TDR and no patients treated nonoperatively were operated for lateral recess stenosis with posterior decompression at the index level during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Index level FA development was more likely after TDR compared with nonoperative treatment but was not associated with the 8-year clinical outcome. Index level FA may have contributed to reoperations in the TDR group.
