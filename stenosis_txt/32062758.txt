Title: Radioactive feeding tube in the palliation of esophageal malignant obstruction.

Abstract: PURPOSE: A radioactive feeding tube was used to achieve both nutrition and brachytherapy for the treatment for malignant esophageal obstruction. We report the safety and effectiveness of this technique.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 16 consecutive patients who employed this technique from January 2015 to March 2018. The radioactive feeding tube was made by binding the 125I seed chain on the feeding tube. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the tube was inserted into the obstructed esophagus, with the seed chain crossing over the segment of malignant esophageal obstruction. Technical success rate, dysphagia score, procedure time and complications were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the survival time.
RESULTS: The radioactive feeding tube was easy to prepare. The technical success rate was 100%, without serious complications such as bleeding or infection. The median procedure time of tube insertion was 44.0 min. The Kamofsky score and Neuhaus dysphagia grading were significantly improved after tube insertion (p < 0.01). On esophageal radiography, the contrast agent passed through the narrow area smoothly. Complete remission (n = 1) and partial remission (n = 13) of local tumor were obtained in 14 patients, and the local tumor control rate was 87.5% (14/16). During follow-up, four patients survived with no obvious clinical symptom and 10 patients died of cancer. The median survival was 12.0 months.
CONCLUSION: Preparation of the radioactive feeding tube is simple and easy. The insertion of this kind of tube achieves parenteral nutrition and brachytherapy simultaneously and is safe and effective in dysphagia palliation of malignant esophageal stricture. The radiological-radiotherapeutic procedure could be an alternative tool in the case of refusing other treatments by the patients.
