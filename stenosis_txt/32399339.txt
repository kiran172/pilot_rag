Title: Recurrent ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction from Norepinephrine-induced Coronary Vasospasm.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary atherosclerosis (MINOCA) is a distinct clinical syndrome characterized by evidence of myocardial infarctionÂ with normal or near-normal coronary arteries on angiography (stenosis severity < 50%). Coronary artery spasm, as seen in "variant angina," usually occurs at a localized segment of an epicardial artery. Here, we present a case of a 58-year-old male who had norepinephrine-induced coronary vasospasm which resulted in ST elevation myocardial infarction on two consecutive admissions.
