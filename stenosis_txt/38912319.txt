Title: Percutaneous Closure of an Iatrogenic Intracardiac Shunt in Treating Torrential Tricuspid Regurgitation.

Abstract: A patient presented with severe right heart failure due to a large LV-to-RA shunt with left-to-right shunting and torrential tricuspid regurgitation 6-weeks following surgical sub-aortic stenosis resection. Retrograde delivery of an Occlutech ventricular septal defect device produced instantaneous resolution of shunt, reduction in tricuspid regurgitation, and impressive diuresis of 28Â kg.
