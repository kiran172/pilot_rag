Title: Single-Port Robotic Removal of a Submucosal Foreign Body in the Distal Hypopharynx.

Abstract: In this report, we present a 55-year-old female with cervical stenosis that underwent C5-C7 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery complicated by hardware failure requiring removal. One screw remained after transcervical hardware removal due to operative difficulty with the risk of exposing the hypopharyngeal submucosal space. The retained screw caused the patient significant discomfort and dysphagia prompting a transoral attempt at removal. Using a hypopharynx blade on an oral retractor for access, the single-port surgical robot successfully removed the foreign body from the distal hypopharynx. In this case, a single-port surgical robot expanded access to the inferior hypopharynx. Laryngoscope, 134:588-591, 2024.
