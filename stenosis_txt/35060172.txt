Title: Thrombosis of native rheumatic mitral valve: A case report.

Abstract: Spontaneous native mitral valve leaflet thrombosis is an exceedingly rare phenomenon. Here, we describe the case of a 71-year-old woman with rheumatic mitral stenosis who presented with cardiogenic shock. She was found to have a thrombus on her native mitral valve despite being on anticoagulation and without a clear associated hypercoagulable comorbidity. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement with favorable outcomes. This case sheds light on the inflammatory and prothrombotic nature of rheumatic valvular disease.
