Title: Endobronchial metastasis of ovarian cancer rescued by tumor ablation and a self-expanding hybrid stent: A case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: Tracheal stenosis caused by malignancy is a life-threatening complication. Herein, we performed tumor ablation and airway stenting using a hybrid stent on a patient with upper tracheal stenosis caused by endobronchial metastasis of ovarian cancer. To date, only 9 cases of endobronchial metastasis of ovarian cancer have been reported. This is the first reported case of endobronchial metastasis in the upper part of the trachea, which had a favorable outcome after tumor ablation as a sequential treatment and use of a hybrid stent. In addition, 10 cases of endobronchial metastasis of ovarian cancer, including ours and other case reports, were reviewed.
