Title: Association between affective temperaments and the severity and the extent of coronary artery disease as obtained by coronary CT angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Affective temperaments are documented predictors of psychopathology, but cumulating data suggest their relationship with coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to evaluate their role in relation to surrogate semiquantitative markers of coronary plaque burden, as assessed by coronary CT angiography (CCTA).
METHODS: We included 351 patients who were referred for CCTA due to suspected CAD. All patients completed the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A). The severity and extent of CAD was evaluated by CCTA, applying semiquantitative plaque burden scores, notably Segment Involvement Score (SIS) and Segment Stenosis Score (SSS). Logistic regression analyses were performed to define the predictors of CAD severity and extent.
RESULTS: Regarding the scores evaluated by TEMPS-A that consists of 110 questions, in men, significant inverse association was found between hyperthymic temperament score and SSS (β = -0.143, (95%CI: -0.091 to -0.004), p = 0.034). Compared to the TEMPS-A form, applying the abbreviated version - containing 40 questions - significant relationship between affective temperaments and SSS or SIS was found in case of both sexes. Concerning men, hyperthymic temperament was demonstrated to be independent predictor of both SSS (β = -0.193, (95%CI: -0.224 to -0.048), p = 0.004) and SIS (β = -0.194, (95%CI: -0.202 to -0.038), p = 0.004). Additionally, we proved, that significant positive association between irritable temperament and SSS (β = 0.152, (95%CI: 0.002 to 0.269), p = 0.047) and SIS (β = 0.155, (95%CI: 0.004 to 0.221), p = 0.042) exists among women.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional analysis of a single center study with self-reported questionnaires.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of affective temperaments could offer added value in stratifying cardiovascular risk for patients beyond traditional risk factors.
