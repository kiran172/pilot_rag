Title: Efficacy of hydrocortisone sodium succinate and aluminum phosphate gel for stricture prevention after ≥3/4 circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely used in early-stage esophageal cancer, but the quality of life of patients with postoperative stricture is markedly reduced, requiring long-term repeat, periodic endoscopic balloon dilatation. We evaluated the combination of hydrocortisone sodium succinate and aluminum phosphate gel administered orally for stricture prevention.
METHODS: We retrospectively assigned 27 patients who underwent ≥3/4 circular ESD for esophageal superficial squamous cell cancer to one of two groups according to the preventative strategy: endoscopic intralesional steroid injection and systemic steroid (IT+ST group) and oral combination of hydrocortisone sodium succinate and aluminum phosphate gel (OHA group). Stricture rate was compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: There were six and seven complete and ≥3/4 circular ESD cases, respectively, in the IT+ST group and four and ten cases in the OHA group. Stricture rates in the IT+ST and OHA groups were 53.8% and 7.1%, respectively. Nine patients in each group developed hypokalemia after glucocorticoid administration.
CONCLUSIONS: OHA is a promising treatment strategy for stricture prevention following large-circumference ESD in patients with early stage esophageal carcinoma.
