Title: Evolution of the Flow Patterns After Endovascular Treatment in Patients with High-Grade Carotid Artery Stenosis - the Clinical Value of Insonation of the Supratrochlear Artery and Alternating Flow.

Abstract: AIM: We aimed to describe the evolution of flow pattern in the ophthalmic artery (OA) and supratrochlear artery (SA) by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ipsilateral to a severe proximal carotid artery stenosis before and after staged endovascular treatment (EVT).
METHODS: We insonated and recorded the flow patterns of OA and SA in 63 patients with â‰¥ 80% carotid artery stenosis before and after staged carotid angioplasty and stenting at 2-4 weeks apart. Based on the direction of OA and SA blood flow, we categorized patients into (1) reversed, (2) alternating, or (3) forward flow, groups. We evaluated the evolving sonographic flow patterns in OA and SA at the 3-time points and correlated them with the stenotic and flow velocity change.
RESULTS: Despite the disconcordance between OA and SA, the evolution of flow direction were evoluted from reversed to alternating or from alternating to forward in both OA and SA. OA and SA's disagreement rate at three-time points was 19.1%, 49.2%, and 28.6%, respectively. After angioplasty alone, we detected an alternating flow in 21 (33.3%) and 46 (73.0%) patients in OA and SA, respectively. Alternating flow patterns in SA persisted in 20 patients (31.7%) after stenting. The post-angioplasty residual stenosis did not differ between the three flow pattern groups (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: An alternating flow in OA or SA might mark the hemodynamic recovery after EVT. Insonation of SA may provide supporting evidence for hemodynamic change in patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing EVT.
