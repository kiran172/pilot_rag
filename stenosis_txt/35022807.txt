Title: Echocardiographic Predictors of Ductal Tissue-Related Branch Pulmonary Artery Stenosis in Pulmonary Atresia.

Abstract: Branch pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis due to ductus arteriosus (DA) tissue (DA-PS) contributes to the morbidity associated with pulmonary atresia (PAtr). We sought to identify preoperative echocardiographic features predictive of DA-PS. Patients consecutively encountered with PAtr and a DA-dependent pulmonary circulation at birth who underwent intervention in our program over a 5-year period were identified and records reviewed. Preoperative echocardiograms were reviewed to identify features that predicted postoperative DA-PS. Seventy patients with PAtr met inclusion criteria and 36 (51%) had DA-PS. At preoperative echocardiography, the proximal diameter of the PA ipsilateral to the DA was smaller in those with versus without DA-PS (Z-score - 4.8 ± 1.7 vs - 1.1 ± 1.7, respectively p < 0.001). PA origins could not be imaged on the same axial plane in 21/36 (58%) with versus 2/34 (6%) without DA-PS. Patients with DA-PS had an obtuse posterior angle of the PA bifurcation compared to those without (128 ± 17° and 87 ± 21°, p < 0.001), and a posterior angle of > 100° best predicted DA-PS with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 76%. An abnormal PA relationship and/or an obtuse posterior bifurcation angle had a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for DA-PS of 78%, 94%, 90% and 86%, respectively. Finally, DA insertion was into the ipsilateral PA in 26/36 (72%) of cases with DA-PS. A smaller proximal ipsilateral PA diameter, inability to image the PAs in the same plane, a posterior PA bifurcation angle of > 100°, and insertion of the DA in the ipsilateral PA demonstrated by echo are useful in identifying patients at risk for DA-PS.
