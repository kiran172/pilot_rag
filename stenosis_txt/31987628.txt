Title: Multifocal arterial wall contrast - enhancement in ischemic stroke: A mirror of systemic inflammatory response in acute stroke.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Intracranial plaque gadolinium enhancement revealed by high-resolution MRI imaging (HR MRI) is considered as a marker of plaque inflammation, a contributing factor of plaque unstability. The aim of the present study was to assess the distribution of gadolinium enhancement in intracranial atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Single center analysis of ischemic stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis of M1 or M2 segments of middle cerebral artery, or terminal internal carotid artery (ICA) based on CT-angio or MR-angio. High-resolution MRI imaging (HRMRI) was performed within 6 first weeks following the index event, with 3DT2 BB (black-blood) and 3D T1 BB MR sequences pre and post-contrast administration.
RESULTS: We identified 8 patients with 14 plaques, 4 were deemed non-culprit and 10 culprit. All culprit plaques (10/10 plaques) and 3 out of 4 non-culprit plaques showed a gadolinium enhancement.
CONCLUSION: At the acute/subacute stage of stroke, a gadolinium enhancement may affect multiple asymptomatic intracranial plaques and may reflect a global inflammatory state.
