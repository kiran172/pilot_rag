Title: Usefulness of selective percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using renal echo for a patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis and chronic renal failure.

Abstract: A man in his 70s visited the hospital for chronic kidney disease with hypertension. He had anuria for several days before visiting the hospital. His creatinine level rose to 8.97 mg/dL (from 3 mg/dL) and his systemic blood pressure increased to 183 mm Hg. Other uraemic symptoms were also observed, and he was therefore admitted to the hospital and started continuous haemodiafiltration. MRI and angiography showed a highly stenotic lesion with calcification at the origin of the renal artery; a CT scan showed atrophy of the left kidney. Renal Doppler ultrasonography was performed and renal resistive indexes were: 0.92 for the left kidney and 0.68 for the right kidney. The viability of the right kidney was thought to be maintained, and percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) for the right renal artery stenosis was performed; his creatinine level improved (3 mg/dL) and his systolic blood pressure decreased (120 mm Hg). We implanted a stent on the right stenotic lesion and the right renal artery blood flow improved. We experienced an effective PTRA for the right renal artery for bilateral renal artery stenosis. Although the indications of PTRA for renal artery stenosis are limited, the evaluation of renal function using ultrasonography could be a useful index for determining the culprit lesion.
