Title: Short-Term Results on Leaflet Mobility in Patients Undergoing Rheumatic Mitral Valve Repair With an Efficient 4-Step Commissuroplasty Technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mitral valve stenosis (MS) is the primary pathologic feature of rheumatic mitral valve disease, and the complex repair affects its clinical outcome. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of the 4-step commisuroplasty "SCORe" procedure by assessing changes in the mobility of mitral valve leaflets and its clinical effects.
METHODS: From September 1, 2018, to January 13, 2019, patients with MS who underwent mitral valve repair with the SCORe procedure in the study center were analyzed in this prospective study. Mitral valve structure was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography pre- and postoperatively as well as during follow-up.
RESULTS: In total, 60 consecutive patients were examined. In 56 patients (93.3%), mitral valve orifice area (MVOA) was less than 1.5 cm2, and mean (SD) MVOA for the whole cohort was 1.20 (0.34) cm2. The mobility of the anterior leaflet was improved (P < .001) during the cardiac cycle postsurgery, but that of the posterior leaflet was not (P = .591). The mean (SD) coaptation length was increased significantly from 6.69 (1.32) mm to 7.92 (1.24) mm (P < .001) postoperatively. Mean (SD) MVOAs increased to 2.24 (0.38) cm2 postoperatively (P < .001). During the 1-year follow-up, there were no deaths or reoperations. Follow-up echocardiography revealed minor or mild regurgitation in 98.3% of patients.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that the SCORe procedure can effectively improve the mobility of mitral leaflets and enlarge the valve orifice area in patients with rheumatic MS in China, with minimal complications and promising results.
