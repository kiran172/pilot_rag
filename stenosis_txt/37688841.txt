Title: Electrocardiographic manifestations of pulmonary stenosis versus pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Right ventricular hypertrophy can be caused by conditions such as pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary hypertension. ECG is a readily available and affordable test, the aim of this study was the evaluation of the electrocardiographic aspects of pulmonary stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension.
METHODS: A list of patients diagnosed with isolated pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary hypertension patients hospitalized and treated between 2019 and 2021 were extracted from the hospital archives. Furthermore, the ECG of the patients was analyzed in terms of the prevalence of the variables in the study using FECG Caliper software. Finally, the data of 93 patients (in both groups) were analyzed.
RESULTS: In this study, 46 patients were in the severe pulmonary stenosis group, and 49 were in the severe or moderate-to-severe pulmonary hypertension group. The heart rate in the pulmonary hypertension group was significantly higher. R/S > 1 in precordial leads differs between the two groups and higher amplitude R wave in V1(p-value = 0.05). in the pulmonary stenosis group. While in the pulmonary hypertension group, R wave growth occurs later, and this ratio is greater than one after V4. Bundle block in the form of RBBB(p-value <0.001) and maximum QRS duration is more in the pulmonary stenosis group(p-value = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings show the different strains of the right ventricle in two groups. It can be concluded that the effects of severe pulmonary stenosis on the ECG are more on the QRS wave and in the form of a block, while severe pulmonary hypertension affects the ST segment and T wave.
