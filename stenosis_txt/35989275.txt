Title: Importance of the Multimodality Evaluation of a Double-chambered Right Ventricle for Surgical Indications on Admission for Acute Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: We treated a female patient known to have a double-chambered right ventricle (DCRV) who presented with symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Emergent coronary artery catheterization revealed acute right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion and proximal left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis. We performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the RCA occlusion. Right heart catheterization revealed a pressure gradient across the mid-RV of 58 mmHg. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no other congenital cardiac abnormalities. She underwent surgical repair of the RV stenosis and coronary artery bypass surgery for LAD stenosis.
