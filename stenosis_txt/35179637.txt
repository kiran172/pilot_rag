Title: Analysis of complications in intraventricular neuroendoscopy in children: proposal for a standardization system.

Abstract: Although intraventricular neuroendoscopy is considered a minimally invasive technique with good results, there is nevertheless a risk of developing certain complications. As no agreement apparently exists concerning the classification of these complications, we aim to propose a form of classification based on the results of our series, comparing them with recent publications. We undertook a retrospective study of 170 children who underwent intraventricular neuroendoscopy between 2003 and September 2020 at our center. Data were recorded on demographic and clinical variables: age, gender, presenting symptoms, etiology, number of procedures, type of procedure, and complications. Complications were divided into two main groups, intraoperative and postoperative, and in subgroups. The intraoperative complications included one group of systemic alterations and another group of surgical problems. The postoperative complications were divided into six groups: systemic, neurologic, hormone, fluid, hemorrhagic and death. A total of 202 neuroendoscopic procedures were performed in 170 children. The mean age at first surgery was 71Â months (22-122). The most common etiology of the hydrocephalus was intraventricular tumors (32.9%), followed by aqueductal stenosis (13.5%). The most usual presenting sign was intracranial hypertension. The procedure most used was third ventriculostomy (62.9%). During the procedures, we experienced 5 surgical intraoperative complications (2.47% per procedure). In the postoperative period, there were 23.7% systemic complications per procedure, 12.87% neurologic, 8.41% hormone, 10.9% fluid, 0.5% hemorrhagic, and 0.99% for postoperative death. The rate of complications associated with intraventricular neuroendoscopy was similar in our series to those already published. Comparative studies require standardization for the analysis of neuroendoscopic complications.
