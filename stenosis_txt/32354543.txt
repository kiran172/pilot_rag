Title: Pulmonary Valve-Sparing Techniques for Tetralogy of Fallot: A Systematic Approach for Maximizing Success and Minimizing Risk.

Abstract: Valve-sparing techniques for the treatment of Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis have evolved over the past few decades. This article will discuss the rationale for a more aggressive approach to sparing the pulmonary valve, the various techniques available (including commissurotomy, leaflet thinning and debridement, balloon dilation, and finally modified monocusp repair), as well as a systematic approach for employing these techniques based on individual patient anatomy in a manner that takes full advantages of the benefits of the valve-sparing approach while mitigating the risks involved.
