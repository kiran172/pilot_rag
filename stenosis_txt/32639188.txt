Title: Biodegradable Stents in the Management of Refractory Esophageal Strictures in Children.

Abstract: Background: Management of refractory esophageal strictures in children is challenging and mostly involves frequent and prolonged dilatations that are associated with significant physical and psychological complications. Biodegradable stents (BDS) have recently been used and it is particularly attractive in children as stent removal is avoided due to their dissolution. Report of Cases: We report our experience with BDS use in 3 children with severe refractory esophageal strictures. Two of the patients had strictures as a result of caustic ingestion and 1 after long-gap esophageal atresia repair. Median number of dilatations prestent is 5 per year. Custom-made uncovered BDS were inserted under general anesthesia. Median follow-up period was 23 months. Results: Minor postprocedure complications occurred in 1 patient. Stent insertion led to temporary improvement in swallowing in all cases. However, all of the patients developed recurrent symptoms as severe as before stenting and need for dilatations remained unchanged. They also experienced mucosal hyperplasia that contributed to their recurrent symptoms. Conclusion: All of the cases in our series did not have a favorable outcome with BDS use. BDS is yet to be proven as an effective management option for refractory esophageal strictures in children from our experience as well as most other published reports.
