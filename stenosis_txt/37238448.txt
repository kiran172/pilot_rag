Title: Pediatric Pancreatic Endocrine Tumor Presenting as Acute Pancreatitis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are relatively rare, especially in the pediatric age group. This report describes a pediatric case of acute pancreatitis secondary to stenosis of the main pancreatic duct due to a PNET. The patient was a boy, thirteen and a half years old, who presented with persistent low-grade fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis based on the elevation of serum pancreatic enzyme levels and abdominal ultrasonography findings of enlargement of the pancreas and dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a 5.5 mm, contrast-enhanced mass in the head of the pancreas. His symptoms resolved with conservative treatment, although the pancreatic tumor grew slowly. At fifteen years and four months, since the tumor had enlarged to 8.0 mm, the patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Based on the pathological evaluation, he was diagnosed with PNET (grade: G1). The patient has been free of tumor recurrence for 10 years and requires no additional therapy. In this report, the clinical characteristics of PNETs are also discussed, comparing the clinical features of adult-onset and pediatric-onset cases that initially present as acute pancreatitis.
