Title: Transcervical Vertebral Artery Origin Endarterectomy for Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency.

Abstract: Vertebral artery (VA) stenosis is a cause of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) and disabling posterior circulation stroke,1 accounting for up to 30% of all strokes.2 Although the natural history of VBI is not as well delineated as that of carotid stenosis, strokes in the basilar circulation can be more disabling than their anterior circulation counterparts. Stenosis exceeding 30% at the origin of the vertebral artery is associated with increased risk of stroke.3 The authors present a case of a female patient with significant peripheral vascular disease who presented with concerns for VBI. The patient was on antiplatelet and anticoagulative medications and a statin at the time of her presentation. Angiography demonstrated bilateral vertebral artery origin stenosis. The left VA was diminutive and arose directly from the arch (Video 1). The right VA demonstrated critical stenosis at its origin. Attempts at endovascular access of the right VA for placement of a balloon-mounted stent were unsuccessful. The patient underwent a transcervical approach for endarterectomy of the VA origin. The VA can be readily accessed using a small supraclavicular incision to isolate the V1 segment of the vessel. The procedure was performed with the patient heparinized and on antiplatelet medications. Alternatives to this strategy include patch grafting in addition to the endarterectomy or use of a short vein graft to bypass the stenosis of the VA beyond the stenotic segment.
