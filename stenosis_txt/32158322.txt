Title: Multidetector Computed Tomography (MDCT) Angiography in the Pre-Procedural Assessment of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) initially emerged as an alternative option to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis who were considered either inoperable or high-risk for surgery. However, since its advent the role of TAVR has been continuously evolving on the basis of clinical trials which showed that TAVR is non-inferior to SAVR in patients with moderate as well as low-risk for surgery. Because of recent technological advances, multidetector computer tomography (MDCT) is inherently suitable for the pre-procedural assessment of patients being considered for TAVR within a very short imaging time, MDCT can measure the diameter of the aortic annulus, provide detailed information regarding the status of the entire thoracoabdominal aorta, and assess the caliber of the peripheral vasculature used for transcatheter heart valve delivery. This information helps interventionists make optimal pre-procedural decisions and avoid complications. To familiarize non-imaging specialists with the role of MDCT in TAVR, we provide a concise overview of our approach to using this modality for the pre-procedural assessment of TAVR candidates.
