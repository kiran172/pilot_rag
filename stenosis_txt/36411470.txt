Title: A novel NF1 mutation in a pediatric patient with renal artery aneurysm.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous syndrome, due to heterozygous pathogenic variants in NF1 gene. The main clinical manifestations are multiple caf√© au lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas, optic glioma, Lisch nodules and osseous lesions, such as sphenoid and tibial dysplasia. Vasculopathy is another feature of NF1; it consists of stenosis, aneurysms, and arteriovenous malformations, frequently involving renal arteries.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a 9-year-old girl with a novel mutation in NF1 gene and renal artery aneurysm, treated by coil embolization and complicated with hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Vasculopathy is a complication of NF1, affecting from 0.4 to 6.4% of patients with NF1. Among the vascular abnormalities, renal artery aneurysm is a rare manifestation, with only a few cases regarding adult patients and no pediatric reports described in current literature. The finding of a vascular abnormality in a specific site requires the evaluation of the entire vascular system because multiple vessels could be involved at the same time.
