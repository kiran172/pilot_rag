Title: Innovative ultrasound-guided one-stop surgery for complex cardiovascular cases: a case report.

Abstract: Elderly patients with multiple comorbidities often face complex cardiac challenges, including aortic valve issues and atrial septal defects. Traditional open-heart surgery may not be viable for this demographic. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) emerges as a preferred alternative. In this case, a frail patient with multiple comorbidities, atrial septal defect, and significant aortic stenosis and regurgitation underwent a one-stop procedure, combining TAVI and atrial septal defect closure, guided by advanced imaging, including three-dimensional ultrasound. Ultrasound played a pivotal role in the perioperative phase, offering precise screening and guidance. This innovative technique, minimizing surgical trauma and recovery time, significantly improved the patient's quality of life.
