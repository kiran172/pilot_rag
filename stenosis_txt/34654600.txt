Title: 8-Day-old male infant with bilious emesis and hematochezia.

Abstract: The differential diagnosis for bilious emesis and hematochezia in newborns is broad and includes structural abnormalities (malrotation with volvulus, atresia, pyloric stenosis, intussusception), infectious colitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, milk protein intolerance, vascular malformations, and other bleeding disorders. Here we report a case of bilious emesis and hematochezia in an 8-day-old male infant who was ultimately found to have goat's milk protein intolerance after an extensive workup ruling out other pathology. There have been limited studies that examine goat's milk protein intolerance in pediatric patients, and to our knowledge, our paper presents the youngest patient presenting with bilious emesis related to goat's milk intake.
