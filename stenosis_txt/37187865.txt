Title: No Increase in Complications With Intravenous Tranexamic Acid Use in Vaginoplasty: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Across surgical specialties, tranexamic acid (TXA) is applied to reduce intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Within plastic surgery, both topical and intravenous routes are used. The application of TXA has yet to be examined in vaginoplasties.
METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective chart review of Mayo Clinic patients receiving penile inversion vaginoplasty from January 2017 through July 2021. Incidence of hematoma formation was assessed as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included perioperative hemoglobin, vaginoplasty complications, and possible TXA complications. These outcomes were compared across topical only (t-TXA), any intravenous (IV- TXA), and no TXA groups.
RESULTS: Of the 124 vaginoplasties, 21 patients received t-TXA only and 43 received any IV-TXA. Only 4 patients developed a hematoma; 2 were from the no TXA group and 2 were from the any IV-TXA group. There was no significant change in perioperative hemoglobin across groups. Analysis showed lower incidence of divergent urine stream (odds ratio [OR], 0.499 [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.316-0.789], P = .003) and neovaginal stenosis (OR, 0.435 [95% CI, 0.259-0.731], P = .002) within the any IV-TXA group and no increased incidence of other complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of either t-TXA or IV-TXA in vaginoplasty cases did not result in an increased rate of complications. There was no significant reduction in hematoma formation or postoperative hemoglobin decrease across groups.
