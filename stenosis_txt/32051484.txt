Title: A Highly-sensitized Response of B-type Natriuretic Peptide to Cardiac Ischaemia Quantified by Intracoronary Pressure Measurements.

Abstract: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) secretion is stimulated by cardiac dysfunction. However, it is unclear how finely myocardial ischaemia contributes to BNP secretion and whether increases in BNP secretion contribute to coronary vasodilation. This study investigated the direct interaction between plasma BNP levels and cardiac ischaemia using the baseline distal-to-aortic pressure ratio (Pd/Pa). We examined the baseline Pd/Pa and fractional flow reserve (FFR) in 167 patients with intermediate coronary stenosis. The plasma BNP level appeared to be associated with the baseline Pd/Pa in the study population, and this association appeared to become clear only in patients with an FFR ≤ 0.80. To examine the effect of the baseline Pd/Pa on the BNP level in these patients, structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed. The baseline Pd/Pa significantly affected the BNP level (β: -0.37, p = 0.003) and the left ventricular ejection fraction (β: 0.43, p = 0.001). To examine the role of BNP in coronary vasodilation, we proposed another path model using a novel value obtained by dividing the FFR by the baseline Pd/Pa (FFR/baseline Pd/Pa) as an index of the hyperaemic response. The BNP level significantly affected the FFR/baseline Pd/Pa (β: 0.48, p = 0.037). This study demonstrated that BNP finely responded to an exacerbation of cardiac ischaemia and that increases in BNP secretion effectively ameliorated coronary vasoconstriction.
