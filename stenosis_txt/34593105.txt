Title: Choosing Between Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Surgery in the Low-Risk Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Era.

Abstract: The landmark results of the low surgical risk pivotal transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) trials fueled speculation that the role of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) would be limited in the future. Instead, the field has pivoted away from reductive surgical risk stratification toward understanding the complex interplay of anatomy, timing, and surgical risk to optimize the lifetime management of aortic stenosis. In this review, we systematically explore the subtleties that influence the choice between TAVR and surgery in the low-risk TAVR era.
