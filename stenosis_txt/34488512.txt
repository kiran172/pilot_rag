Title: Ascending Aortoiliac Bypass for One-Stage Repair of Adult Aortic Coarctation With Concomitant Cardiac Lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ascending aortoiliac bypass surgery for one-stage repair of adult coarctation of the aorta (CoA) and concomitant cardiac disease.
METHODS: From March 2012 to October 2018, 51 consecutive CoA patients were treated with ascending aorta to bilateral iliac artery bypass concomitant with and cardiac surgerical procedures performed for a variety of reasons. A Y-shaped graft was used for the bypass procedure. We evaluated early outcomes, including postoperative death, systolic blood pressure and differences between upper and lower limb blood pressure.
RESULTS: The average age was 41 years and 64.7% of patients were men. Simultaneous cardiac procedures included aortic valve replacement, ventricular septal defect repair, Bentall procedures and Wheat procedures. No deaths occurred in the early postoperative period. Three patients had delayed healing at the site of the abdominal lower quadrant incisions. The average systolic pressure in the upper limb and the average difference between the upper- and lower-limb blood pressure decreased significantly after surgery (162.7 ± 13.4 mmHg vs 128.4 ± 6.7 mmHg, P = .000; 69.6 ± 15.6 mmHg vs 8.7 ± 7.6 mmHg, P = .000, respectively); The systolic blood pressure in the lower limb increased after bypass surgery (93.1 ± 6.2 mmHg vs 119.6 ± 7.7 mmHg, P = .000). The follow-up rate was 100%, with an average follow-up time of 61 months. Six patients (11.8%) had graft stenosis or occlusion. Three patients (5.9%) underwent endovascular embolectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: In our small series, ascending aortoiliac bypass for one-stage repair of CoA with concomitant cardiac lesions appears safe and efficacious in effectively reduceing differences between upper and lower limb systolic blood pressure. Further study with larger sample size and longer follow-up is needed.
