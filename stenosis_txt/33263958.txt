Title: [Urethral strictures: a variety of treatments requiring regular practice].

Abstract: Urethral stricture is defined by a decrease in the caliber of the urethral lumen which can cause a decrease or an interruption of the urine flow. This disease is much more common in men than in women, and several causes can be identified. The diagnosis depends on a careful patient history focusing on obstructive and/or irritative lower urinary tract symptoms and is confirmed by a specific work-up. Treatment ranges from conservative management to open surgery and requires specialized surgeons, so as an adequate technical platform. The evolution of surgical techniques has fortunately significantly increased long term success rates. Hence, the classical saying heard about the outcome of urethral stenosis treatment : « once a stricture, always a stricture » is no longer the rule.
