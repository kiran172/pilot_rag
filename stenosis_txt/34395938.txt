Title: Linear Pinched Hemorrhoidectomy: A Retrospective Observational Study (An Innovative, Simplified Hemorrhoidectomy).

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: There was an urgent need to create a simple, reliable hemorrhoidectomy procedure for high-risk cases in our university hospital. We performed linear pinched hemorrhoidectomy (LPH) and evaluated its effectiveness compared to conventional hemorrhoidectomy (CH).
METHODS: We included 215 Goligher grade 3 and 4 hemorrhoid cases in this study. Of these cases, 167 were in the CH group, and 48 patients were in the LPH group. We retrospectively compared the lengths of hospital stay, operative times, blood loss, and complications.
RESULTS: The age tended to be higher in the LPH group (mean: CH 60 years, LPH 68 years). In the univariate analysis, LPH had more resections, shorter operative times, and less blood loss. LPH had shorter operative times in the multivariate analysis, less blood loss, and more anticoagulant use. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of complications. Five and two patients in the CH and LPH groups, respectively, had postoperative hemorrhage requiring hemostasis. Only the CH group had three and four cases of anal stenosis and wound edema, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We studied simplified hemorrhoidectomy using an ultrasonic scalpel and cylindrical proctoscope in a university hospital. We found that it a useful procedure with few complications and was easy for residents to learn. We believe that advances in surgical devices will make it possible to perform safer and simpler hemorrhoidectomy in the future.
