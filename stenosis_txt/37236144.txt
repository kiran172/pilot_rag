Title: Effect of Statin on Radiographic and Clinical Outcomes of Intracranial Aneurysms Treated With Pipeline Embolization: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Studies have shown that use of statin can improve radiographic and clinical outcomes in patients receiving treatment for coronary artery or peripheral vascular stenosis. Statins are thought to be effective by reducing arterial wall inflammation. The same mechanism may have an influence on the efficacy of pipeline embolization device (PED) for intracranial aneurysm treatment. Although this question has been of interest, there is a lack of well-controlled data in the literature. The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of statins on outcomes of aneurysms treated with pipeline embolization through propensity score matching.
METHODS: Patients who underwent PED for unruptured intracranial aneurysms at our institution between 2013 and 2020 were identified. Patients on statin treatment vs those who were not were matched through propensity score by controlling for confounding factors including age, sex, current smoking status, diabetes, aneurysm morphology, volume, neck size, location of aneurysm, history of treatment for the same aneurysm, type of antiplatelet therapy, and elapsed time at last follow-up. Occlusion status at first follow up and last follow-up, and incidence of in-stent stenosis and ischemic complications during the follow-up period were extracted for comparison.
RESULTS: In total, 492 patients with PED were identified, of whom 146 were on statin therapy and 346 were not. After one-to-one nearest neighbor matching, 49 cases in each group were compared. At last follow-up, 79.6%, 10.2%, and 10.2% of cases in the statin therapy group and 67.4%, 16.3%, and 16.3% in the nonstatin group were noted to have Raymond-Roy 1, 2, and 3 occlusions, respectively ( P = .45). No significant difference was observed in immediate procedural thrombosis ( P > .99), long-term in-stent stenosis ( P > .99), ischemic stroke ( P = .62), or retreatment ( P = .49).
CONCLUSION: Statin use does not affect occlusion rate or clinical outcomes in patients treated with PED treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
