Title: The use of deformation imaging in the assessment of patients pre and post transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Deformation imaging represents a method of measuring myocardial function, including global longitudinal strain (GLS), peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) and radial strain. This study aimed to assess subclinical improvements in left ventricular function in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) by comparing GLS, PALS and radial strain pre and post procedure.
METHODS: We conducted a single site prospective observational study of 25 patients undergoing TAVI, comparing baseline and post-TAVI echocardiograms. Individual participants were assessed for differences in GLS, PALS and radial strain in addition to changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (%).
RESULTS: Our results revealed a significant improvement in GLS (mean change pre-post of 2.14% [95% CI 1.08, 3.20] p = 0.0003) with no significant change in LVEF (0.96% [95% CI - 2.30, 4.22], p = 0.55). There was a statistically significant improvement in radial strain pre and post TAVI (mean 9.68% [95% CI 3.10, 16.25] p = 0.0058). There was positive trend towards improvements in PALS pre and post TAVI (mean change of 2.30% [95% CI - 0.19, 4.80] p = 0.068).
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TAVI, measuring GLS and radial strain provided statistically significant information regarding subclinical improvements in LV function, which may have prognostic implications. The incorporation of deformation imaging in addition to standard echocardiographic measurements may have an important role in guiding future management in patients undergoing TAVI and assessing response.
