Title: Clinical characteristics and factors influencing the prognosis of Behçet's disease complicated with vascular involvement.

Abstract: Background: Vascular Behçet's disease (VBD) might involve all sizes of arterial and venous vessels. Major vascular involvement caused the primary death in Behçet's syndrome (BS). We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and factors influencing the prognosis of VBD. Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected data of the Shanghai BS database from October 2012 to October 2018 was conducted. Patients who were diagnosed with BS and merged with venous thrombosis, arterial aneurysms, and arterial stenosis/occlusions were enrolled. Results: There were 47 patients with vascular involvement among 836 BS patients, 38 males and 9 females. The numbers of patients with venous thrombosis, arterial aneurysm, and arterial stenosis/occlusion were 25 (53.2 %), 21 (44.7 %), and 12 (25.5 %), respectively. Nearly half of the venous thromboses were located in limbs (n = 22, 46.8 %). Arterial aneurysm was the main form of arterial lesion. Most of the patients (93.6 %) were treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Late onset of BS or with arterial involvement had lower treatment response. Therapy with biological agents had significantly better results than that in the group without biological treatment (94.1 % vs. 80 %, P = 0.005). Conclusions: VBD showed a male preponderance and more than half of the patients presented with venous thrombosis. Late onset and arterial involvement were associated with poor prognosis. Therapy with biological agents is a viable alternative treatment to improve the prognosis.
