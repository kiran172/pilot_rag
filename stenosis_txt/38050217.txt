Title: Dual outflow upper arm arteriovenous fistula: An effective technique to prevent cephalic arch stenosis.

Abstract: Cephalic arch stenosis (CAS) is critical point to maintain functional arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in patients undergoing hemodialysis with brachio-cephalic AVFs. In this study, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of dual outflow (cephalic and basilic veins) as a surgical method to prevent CAS. Between July 2016 and December 2019, 369 patients underwent upper arm AVF creation. Among them the 251 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Two hundred seven underwent brachio-cephalic arteriovenous fistula (BCAVF) and 44 underwent brachio-cephalicbasilic arteriovenous fistula (BCBAVF). From the 251 patients, diabetes mellitus (66.7% vs 36.4%, P < .001) and hypertension (91.3% vs 75%, P = .002) were more common in the patient group who underwent BCAVF surgery; however, the difference in volume flow to the fistula did not differ between the 2 groups. CAS (30.4% vs 9.1%, P = .004) and fistula occlusion (15.9% vs 4.5%, P = .048) were likely to occur in the BCAVF group. The primary patency rates at 12 months were 74.3% and 86.4% for the BCAVFs and BCBAVFs, respectively (P = .075). The primary-assisted patency rates at 12 months were 87.0% for BCAVFs and 93.2% for BCBAVFs, respectively (P = .145). Secondary patency rates at 12 months were 92.2% for BCAVFs and 93.2% for BCBAVFs, respectively (P = .023). Compared to BCAVF, traditional upper arm AVF, upper arm AVF with cephalic and basilic vein dual drainage can be optimal surgical method to preventing CAS.
