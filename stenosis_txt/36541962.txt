Title: Coronary Intravascular Lithotripsy.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification is strongly associated with adverse cardiac events and can impede the success of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to challenges with delivery of equipment and expansion of stents. Current treatment modalities for mitigation of coronary calcification have limitations and inherent risk of complications. Coronary intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel technique to modify coronary artery calcification via acoustic pressure waves. IVL utilizes an easy-to-use device, which does not require a steep learning curve. Prospective studies have shown this technique to be safe and effective and can be used to adequately modify calcified coronary stenoses in preparation for PCI and stent deployment and optimization. IVL has unique features that can be used alone or as an adjunctive therapy to other available calcium modification tools. As compared to the currently established modalities of calcium modification, IVL has the potential to facilitate successful PCI with fewer serious procedural complications. In this review article, we discuss the importance of coronary artery calcification, the role of IVL, its mechanism, the current clinical data behind its use and future directions. Overall, coronary IVL is a promising technology for the treatment of severely calcified coronary stenoses, with a need for, long-term clinical outcome data of IVL-facilitated PCI.
