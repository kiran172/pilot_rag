Title: Cerebral monitoring during carotid endarterectomy using transcranial cerebral oximetry.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of carotid endarterectomies (CEA) performed using transcranial cerebral oximetry as cerebral monitoringMETHODS: This single-center study included patients treated surgically for significant stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) from January 2012 to December 2017RESULTS: Of the 654 patients, 267 were asymptomatic, and 387 were symptomatic. Eversion CEA was performed in 64.8 %, and patched conventional CEA in 35.2 % of all patients. Totally 11.4 % of all patients had a shunt inserted; all patients with the inserted shunt had the conventional pathed CEA. Severe postoperative complications occurred in 1.5 % of asymptomatic patients and 2.6 % of symptomatic patients. The stroke and death ratio in the shunted group was 2.7 %, and in the non-shunted group, 2.1 % (p = 0.7). We found no significant difference in severe postoperative complications between the shunted and non-shunted group. Further, we found the male gender (p = 0.005), coronary artery disease (p = 0.01), and ongoing smoking (p = 0.003) to be significantly associated with neurological symptoms of the ICA stenosis. We also confirmed current tobacco smoking to be significantly associated with the occurrence of postoperative stroke and death (p = 0.005)CONCLUSION: We found transcranial cerebral oximetry to be reliable in the determination of shunt insertion (Tab. 6, Ref. 26).
