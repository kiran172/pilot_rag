Title: Assessment of myocardial bridging and the pericoronary fat attenuation index on coronary computed tomography angiography: predicting coronary artery disease risk.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The fat attenuation index (FAI) is a radiological parameter that represents pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) inflammation, along with myocardial bridging (MB), which leads to pathological shear stress in the coronary vessels; both are associated with coronary atherosclerosis. In the present study, we assessed the predictive value of FAI values and MB parameters through coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for predicting the risk of coronary atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaque in patients with MB.
METHODS: We included 428 patients who underwent CCTA and were diagnosed with MB. FAI values, MB parameters, and high-risk coronary plaque (HRP) characteristics were recorded. The subjects were classified into two groups (A and B) according to the absence or presence of coronary plaque in the segment proximal to the MB. Group B was further divided into Groups B<sub>1</sub> (HRP-positive) and B<sub>2</sub> (HRP-negative) according to the HRP characteristic classification method. The differences among the groups were analysed. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent correlation between FAI values and MB parameters and coronary atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaque risk.
RESULTS: Compared to the subjects in Group A, those in Group B presented greater MB lengths, MB depths and muscle index values, more severe MB systolic stenosis and higher FAI<sub>lesion</sub> values (all P &lt; 0.05). In multivariate logistic analysis, age (OR 1.076, P &lt; 0.001), MB systolic stenosis (OR 1.102, P &lt; 0.001) and FAI<sub>lesion</sub> values (OR 1.502, P &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for the occurrence of coronary atherosclerosis. Compared to subjects in Group B<sub>2</sub>, those in Group B<sub>1</sub> presented greater MB lengths and higher FAI values (both P &lt; 0.05). However, only the FAI<sub>lesion</sub> value was an independent factor for predicting HRP (OR 1.641, P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In patients with MB, MB systolic stenosis was associated with coronary plaque occurrence in the segment proximal to the MB. The FAI value was not only closely related to coronary atherosclerosis occurrence but also associated with plaque vulnerability. FAI values may provide more significant value in the prediction of coronary atherosclerosis than MB parameters in CCTA.
