Title: Transcarotid Revascularization Timing and Early Postoperative Outcomes in Symptomatic Patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) performed several days after onset of symptoms has been shown to be optimal in preventing procedure-related stroke. Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is an alternative hybrid procedure to treat high-risk for CEA patients. In this investigation, our aim is to determine the effect of timing of TCAR in symptomatic patients.
METHODS: Procedures were captured prospectively at 2 independent health systems from 2016-2022 within a carotid intervention database. A retrospective analysis of this database was performed to generate cohorts by time to revascularization from onset of symptoms, with the short-interval revascularization (SIR) group defined as having a time to revascularization between 2-5 days; and long-interval revascularization (LIR) group having a time to revascularization of 6-180 days. Univariate analysis was performed comparing the cohorts at an α of .05.
RESULTS: During the study period, 875 TCARs were captured, including 321 procedures performed in symptomatic patients. Of these, 84 had revascularization performed within 6 days after onset of symptoms (SIR) while 237 additional cases were completed 6 or more days after onset of symptoms (LIR). Baseline comorbidities were grossly similar between cohorts. Intraoperatively, SIR patients were less likely to develop bradycardia (4.8% vs 22.2%, P = .01) and experienced a shorter operative time (58 minutes vs 65 minutes, P = .02). Estimated blood loss, flow reversal time, radiation exposure, fluoroscopic time and contrast volume were identical between the groups. Length of stay in SIR patients was longer (1, IQR [1-3] vs 1, IQR [1-2] days, P &lt; .01). Additionally, SIR patients seemed to trend toward a higher rate of reinterventions (3.6% vs .4%, P = .06). The incidence of ipsilateral or contralateral stroke, cranial nerve palsy, myocardial infarction, hematoma, stent thrombosis and death were statistically identical between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: Like the previous results established for CEA, symptomatic patients undergoing TCAR demonstrate similar outcomes if the procedure is performed 48 hours after the neurologic event.
