Title: Right posterior bile duct stricture after laparoscopic anterior sectionectomy with long right bile duct: A case report.

Abstract: Right anterior liver sectionectomy (RAS) is a complicated procedure with high incidences of postoperative complications. We report a case of right posterior bile duct (RPBD) stricture after laparoscopic RAS with discussion of the anatomical aspects. A 69-year-old Japanese man had solitary colorectal liver metastasis. A tumor was located near the root of the right anterior Glissonean pedicle. On postoperative day 6, he had cholangitis and imaging studies showed RPBD stricture. Symptoms disappeared following a course of antibiotics and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 21. The RBPD anatomy type of this patient was a supra-portal pattern with a long (18â€‰mm) right biliary duct, which would be close to the right anterior Glissonean bifurcation. A stapling device might have caused its deformation and resulted in its stricture. As the RPBD has variant anatomy, we had to notice that there may be hazardous types for postoperative RPBD stricture.
