Title: A novel technique for stenting in cases of refractory intracranial stenosis.

Abstract: Endovascular management of intracranial stenosis is one of the most controversial subjects in neurointervention. Previous level 1 evidence shows superiority of medical management but more recent studies have shown improved outcomes in selective patients. We describe a case demonstrating a new method for stenting of intracranial stenosis using a single system with Coyote angioplasty balloon (Boston Scientific) and the Atlas stent (Stryker).
