Title: Dynamic assessment of coronary artery during different cardiac cycle in patients with coronary artery disease using coronary CT angiography.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the effect of the cardiac cycle for the coronary artery opening and coronary stenosis at the plaque to determine the phase of measuring maximum diameters required for coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: This retrospective study assessed data for 208 consecutive patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). The cross-sectional area and diameters of the opening of the left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending branch (LAD), left circumflex branch (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA), the stenosis rate of involved vessels were measured in 10 cardiac cycles. And all their dynamic changes were estimated by the linear mixed model. The relationship between stenosis rate and opening orifice were analyzed by monofactorial variance.
RESULTS: The opening parameters and stenosis rate of the four main coronary arteries varied within the cardiac cycle (p &lt; .05). The maximum opening area occurred at the 45%-55% phase; The range of stenosis rate varied approximately 11%-14% and the maximum stenosis rate was at the 65% phase. The degree of vascular stenosis for LM, LAD and LCX were not associated with their corresponding opening diameters, but were positively intercorrelation with each other.
CONCLUSION: For patients with CAD, the maximum coronary artery stenosis rate were at 65% phase and the maximum value of coronary artery opening were at 45%-55% phase, which were chosen for the appropriate measurement and evaluation by CTA.
