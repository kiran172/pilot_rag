Title: Efficacy of cap-assisted forward-viewing endoscopy as a method for the evaluation of the ampulla of Vater.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: endoscopic evaluation of the ampulla of Vater (AV), although routinely recommended, is not always possible due to its anatomic configuration, which can hide it from the visual field of the forward-viewing endoscope. Cap-assisted forward-viewing endoscopy has been proposed as a useful alternative to facilitate the examination of this structure.
OBJECTIVES: to assess the efficacy of cap-assisted forward-viewing endoscopy for the complete evaluation of the AV. Secondary outcomes were to assess AV morphology, search and total procedure times and technique safety.
METHODS: a prospective, single-arm study. Patients who were selected for elective upper endoscopy were included. Patients with advanced neoplasia, modified anatomy, upper gastrointestinal stenosis or obstructions were excluded.
OUTCOMES: ninety patients were included, 36 males (40 %) and 54 females (60 %). Fifteen percent had a history of hereditary colon cancer syndrome. Technical success of cap-assisted, forward-viewing endoscopy was 98.8 %. AV was classified as type 1 (classic) in 49.4 %, type 2 (small) in 16.8 %, type 3 (protruding) in 11.2 % and type 4 (ridged) in 22.4 %. The mean search time was 37.7 seconds (s) (SD ± 31.6) and the total procedure time was 487.4 s (SD ± 206.2). No adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: cap-assisted forward-viewing endoscopy is an effective and safe technique for the complete visualization and morphologic characterization of the ampulla of Vater.
