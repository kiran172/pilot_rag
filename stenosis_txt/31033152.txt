Title: Aortic valve replacement in patients with preexisting liver disease: Transfemoral approach with favorable survival.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The treatment of aortic stenosis has been revolutionized by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but the experience in patients with liver disease is limited. To address this open question, we report the outcome of patients with liver disease undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), transapical (TA), and transfemoral (TF) TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2004 and August 2016, 4,394 patients received aortic valve replacement at our institution. We identified 85 patients (mean follow-up 504 ± 733 days, age 73.4 ± 9.2 years, 44.7% female) with preexisting liver disease (median model of end-stage liver disease score 11, MELD-Na), who underwent TF-TAVR (n = 30), TA-TAVR (n = 13), or SAVR (n = 42). Baseline Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) and of Mortality and Morbidity (STS-PROMM) were the lowest in SAVR patients (related to TF- and TA-TAVR, both p < 0.01). Operative mortality (18.8%) was high, but no procedure showed superior short-term outcome. Need for renal replacement therapy (31.5% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.046) and reoperation occurred more frequently after SAVR than after TF-TAVR (26.6% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.021). Moreover, TF-TAVR patients had superior long-term survival compared to SAVR (log-rank test p = 0.048 and Cox regression adjusted for MELD and STS-PROM, p = 0.01, HR 0.25, CI95 0.09-0.71). Baseline MELD-Na (p = 0.013) and STS PROMM (p = 0.01) were predictors for operative mortality (ROC-analysis).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate increased perioperative risks for patients with liver disease undergoing AVR, but favorable long-term survival after TF-TAVR compared to SAVR. For baseline risk, stratification in patients with liver disease undergoing AVR, MELD-Na and STS-PROMM are valuable predictors.
