Title: Emerging Hybrid Intracoronary Imaging Technologies and Their Applications in Clinical Practice and Research.

Abstract: Intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography are used with increasing frequency for the care of coronary patients and in research studies. These imaging tools can identify culprit lesions in acute coronary syndromes, assess coronary stenosis severity, guide percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and detect vulnerable plaques and patients. However, they have significant limitations that have stimulated the development of multimodality intracoronary imaging catheters, which provide improvements in assessing vessel wall pathology and guiding PCI. Prototypes combining 2 or even 3 imaging probes with complementary attributes have been developed, and several multimodality systems have already been used in patients, with near-infrared spectroscopy intravascular ultrasound-based studies showing promising results for the identification of high-risk plaques. Moreover, postmortem histology studies have documented that hybrid imaging catheters can enable more accurate characterization of plaque morphology than standalone imaging. This review describes the evolution in the field of hybrid intracoronary imaging; presents the available multimodality catheters; and discusses their potential role in PCI guidance, vulnerable plaque detection, and the assessment of endovascular devices and emerging pharmacotherapies targeting atherosclerosis.
