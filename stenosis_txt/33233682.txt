Title: Functional Recovery after Surgery for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis in Patients with Hypertension.

Abstract: Hypertension is a prevalent condition that is associated with lower health status in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. The study determined whether hypertension is a prognostic factor associated with functional recovery after spine surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis. This was a secondary analysis of the Alberta Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Study in which patients were identified as participants at the time of lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to examine hypertension as a prognostic factor of functional recovery after surgery (Oswestry Disability Index, the Swiss Spinal Stenosis (SSS)-Symptom Severity and SSS-Physical Function scales). Of the 97 surgical participants, 49 who were hypertensive were older (76.8, SD 11.4 years) than the 48 non-hypertensive participants (66.7, SD 12.4 years) (p &lt; 0.001). No significant associations between hypertension and post-operative function in any of the three multivariable models were seen. The Oswestry Disability Index mean score improved after surgery (effect size: 1.73; 95%CI: 1.39, 2.06), with no differences seen between those with and without hypertension (p = 0.699). Large changes were seen after surgery for the SSS-Symptom Severity (effect size: 1.0, 95%CI 0.7, 1.3) and SSS-Physical Function (effect size: 0.9, 95%CI 0.6, 1.2) scales. Hypertension alone does not negatively impact functional recovery following surgery.
