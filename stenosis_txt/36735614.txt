Title: Same-Day Carotid Artery Stenting and Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment strategy for patients with severe carotid artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting is still problematic. The important question is whether it is necessary to treat significant carotid disease in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. This study analyzed short- and midterm results after same-day carotid artery stenting and coronary artery bypass grafting.
METHODS: From 2013 to 2020, a total of 69 patients were enrolled in the study. Same-day carotid artery stenting and coronary artery bypass grafting were performed in all patients. The study's primary end points were the evaluation rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death within short- and midterm periods after the procedures.
RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was 0%. The occurrences of perioperative adverse events, namely stroke, myocardial infarction, and transient ischemic attack, were 1 (1.4%), 1 (1.4%), and 4 (5.8%), respectively. Mean (IQR) follow-up time was 28 (IQR, 17-43) months. Six (8.8%) patients died during this period. Fatal stroke was registered in 2 cases, and 1 patient experienced a disabling stroke with a fatal outcome. The other 3 patients died because of chronic renal disease, a traffic accident, and for an unknown reason, respectively. Midterm survival in the group was 91.2%.
CONCLUSION: The study showed that same-day carotid artery stenting and coronary artery bypass grafting for concomitant carotid and coronary disease treatment could be a promising and feasible therapeutic strategy.
