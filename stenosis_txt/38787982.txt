Title: Analysis of correlative factors of female coronary slow-flow phenomenon: A retrospective study.

Abstract: The coronary slow-flow phenomenon (CSFP) is a manifestation of coronary artery disease wherein coronary angiography reveals no apparent stenosis; however, there is a delay in blood flow perfusion. Given its increased occurrence in male patients, with the majority of subjects in previous studies being male, this study aimed to explore whether distinct risk factors are present in female patients with CSFP. This single-center retrospective study focused on female patients diagnosed with CSFP by using coronary angiography. Eligible patients meeting the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into the study group (presenting with CSFP) and control group (displaying normal epicardial coronary arteries). Comparative analyses of clinical and diagnostic data were performed. Ninety-two patients with CSFP and an equal number of controls were enrolled in this study. Patients with CSFP exhibited a higher prevalence of smokers (P = .017) and a heightened incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) (P = .007). Significantly elevated levels of total cholesterol (TC) (P = .034) and free fatty acids (FFA) (P = .016) were observed in the CSFP group compared to those in the control group. Additionally, patients with CSFP displayed lower levels of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) (P = .092), free thyroxine (FT4) (P = .001), and total thyroxine (TT4) (P = .025). Logistic regression analysis indicated that smoking (P = .019), FFA (P < .001), ApoE (P = .015), and FT4 (P < .001) were independent risk factors for CSFP, accounting for confounding factors. Additionally, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the combined effect of smoking, ApoE, FT4, and FFA on CSFP was 0.793 (95% CI: 0.729-0.857, P < .01). In addition to the established risk factors for smoking, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, female patients with CSFP exhibited significant differences in apoE, FFA, FT4, and TT4 levels compared to the control group. Smoking, FFA, and FT4 levels emerged as independent risk factors for CSFP.
