Title: Investigation of perfusion impairment in degenerative cervical myelopathy beyond the site of cord compression.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine tissue-specific blood perfusion impairment of the cervical cord above the compression site in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging. A quantitative MRI protocol, including structural and IVIM imaging, was conducted in healthy controls and patients. In patients, T2-weighted scans were acquired to quantify intramedullary signal changes, the maximal canal compromise, and the maximal cord compression. T2*-weighted MRI and IVIM were applied in all participants in the cervical cord (covering C1-C3 levels) to determine white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) cross-sectional areas (as a marker of atrophy), and tissue-specific perfusion indices, respectively. IVIM imaging resulted in microvascular volume fraction ([Formula: see text]), blood velocity ([Formula: see text]), and blood flow ([Formula: see text]) indices. DCM patients additionally underwent a standard neurological clinical assessment. Regression analysis assessed associations between perfusion parameters, clinical outcome measures, and remote spinal cord atrophy. Twenty-nine DCM patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. At the level of stenosis, 11 patients showed focal radiological evidence of cervical myelopathy. Above the stenosis level, cord atrophy was observed in the WM (- 9.3%; p = 0.005) and GM (- 6.3%; p = 0.008) in patients compared to healthy controls. Blood velocity (BV) and blood flow (BF) indices were decreased in the ventral horns of the GM (BV: - 20.1%, p = 0.0009; BF: - 28.2%, p = 0.0008), in the ventral funiculi (BV: - 18.2%, p = 0.01; BF: - 21.5%, p = 0.04) and lateral funiculi (BV: - 8.5%, p = 0.03; BF: - 16.5%, p = 0.03) of the WM, across C1-C3 levels. A decrease in microvascular volume fraction was associated with GM atrophy (R = 0.46, p = 0.02). This study demonstrates tissue-specific cervical perfusion impairment rostral to the compression site in DCM patients. IVIM indices are sensitive to remote perfusion changes in the cervical cord in DCM and may serve as neuroimaging biomarkers of hemodynamic impairment in future studies. The association between perfusion impairment and cervical cord atrophy indicates that changes in hemodynamics caused by compression may contribute to the neurodegenerative processes in DCM.
