Title: Short-term outcome of stenting with Enterprise stents for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease at a single center.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of stenting for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic severe stenosis or occlusion with Enterprise stents.
METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic severe (70%-99%) stenosis or occlusion who underwent endovascular treatment with Enterprise stents between September 2019 and March 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcomes included technical stenting success rates, the incidence of complications within 30 days of the procedure, and the in-stent restenosis rates during the follow-up period. These outcomes were further categorized based on lesion location and operation time.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven lesions in 53 patients aged 61.0 ± 10.0 years were treated with Enterprise stents with a technical success rate of 100%. Seven patients (12.3%) had severe complications within 30 days of the procedure: five had a symptomatic ischemic stroke, one had a symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and one had a subarachnoid hemorrhage related to the procedure. No deaths were observed. The rate of in-stent restenosis was 18.2%, with a mean vascular imaging follow-up period of 6.7 months. The 30-day complication and in-stent restenosis rates did not differ significantly between patients with different lesion locations and operation times (P &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This retrospective study suggests that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting with Enterprise stents is an effective treatment for symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis or occlusion with a high technical success rate. It also indicates that stenting during the early nonacute stage after stroke may not increase the incidence of perioperative complications for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis when following strict inclusion criteria.
