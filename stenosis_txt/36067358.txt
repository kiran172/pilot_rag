Title: Statins and Mortality of Patients After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: While TAVI is widely used, optimal medical therapy to reduce the mortality rate after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is still unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of statins on mortality following TAVI. Present systematic review of the literature was performed using Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science; all studies reported all-cause mortality in patients who underwent TAVI and received or did not receive statin therapy. Data were analyzed using random-effects models. Seventeen articles (21Â 380 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Statin therapy was associated with a reduction of all-cause mortality (Hazard ratio [HR] = .78, 95% Confidence interval [CI] .68-.89, P &lt; .001). Moderate between-study heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 45.2). High-intensity statin therapy was more effective than low or moderate intensity statin therapy in reduction of all-cause mortality (Risk ratio [RR] = .62, 95% CI 0.45-.85, P = .003, I2 = .0). Statin therapy could reduce the mid-term all-cause mortality rate following TAVI. However, all included studies were observational and, therefore, randomized controlled trials are still needed to assess the effect of statin therapy on mortality after TAVI.
