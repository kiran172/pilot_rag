Title: Prenatal screening and diagnosis of pulmonary artery anomalies.

Abstract: Congenital pulmonary artery anomalies are rare. Their antenatal diagnosis requires good knowledge of fetal cardiac anatomy because their clinical presentation varies depending on the type and severity of the underlying lesion. Screening of these vascular anomalies can be straightforward in some cases because of significant associated consequences that are detected easily on ultrasound, while other anomalies have considerably less obvious features. There may be an associated genetic syndrome. The aim of this review was to define anomalies of the main pulmonary artery and its branches and to propose, through the identification of suspicious findings during routine antenatal heart examination, an optimal screening method for the pulmonary artery pathway. We propose that pulmonary artery anomalies can be classified antenatally into four types of disorder. Herein we describe 14 cases subgrouped accordingly as: anomalies of the pulmonary valvular region, with stenosis or atresia of the valve (n = 4); conotruncal abnormalities (n = 4); anomalies associated with abnormal origin or course of the pulmonary artery (n = 4); and anomalies associated with abnormal growth of the pulmonary artery and its branches (n = 2). We highlight the need to differentiate the three-vessel view from the three-vessel-and-trachea view when assessing a fetus with a congenital pulmonary artery anomaly. © 2022 The Authors.
