Title: Multiple Valvular Heart Disease in the Transcatheter Era: A State-of-the-Art Review.

Abstract: Although existing guidelines offer strong recommendations for single valvular dysfunction, the growing prevalence of multiple valvular heart disease (MVHD) in our aging population is challenging the clarity of clinical guidance. Traditional diagnostic modalities, such as echocardiography, face inherent constraints in precisely quantifying valvular dysfunction due to the hemodynamic interactions that occur with multiple valve involvement. Therefore, many patients with MVHD present at a later stage in their disease course and with an elevated surgical risk. The expansion of transcatheter therapy for the treatment of valvular heart disease has added new opportunities for higher-risk patients. However, the impact of isolated valve therapies on patients with MVHD is still not well understood. This review focuses on the etiology, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic considerations for some of the most common concomitant valvular abnormalities that occur in our daily clinic population.
