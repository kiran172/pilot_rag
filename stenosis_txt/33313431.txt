Title: A patient with ossification of the yellow ligament and ventriculomegaly with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome undiagnosed until adulthood.

Abstract: A 44-year-old female developed mild gait disturbance. She had a history of a ventricular septum defect, deafness, epilepsy, schizophrenia and cataracts. Magnetic resonance imaging showed ventriculomegaly of the brain and lower thoracic spinal stenosis due to ossification of the yellow ligament (OYL). She was diagnosed as having 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) by chromosome analysis, and OYL was suspected to be a secondary symptom due to hypoparathyroidism. This is the first report of 22q11.2DS with OYL and ventriculomegaly. Since the present patient was not diagnosed until adulthood, we emphasize that we should keep this common but heterogeneous congenital disease in mind.
