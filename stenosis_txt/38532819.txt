Title: The Relationship between Amount of Air Supplied to Radial Artery Compression Device Used after Transradial Procedure and Radial Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transradial access (TRA) is accepted as the safest route for coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention. Radial artery stenosis (RAS) prevents use of the radial artery in various clinical situations, even in cases without hand ischemia. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the amount of air supplied to the radial artery compression device [transradial (TR) band] and RAS.
METHODS: The population in this single-center retrospective study consisted of patients who underwent CAG via TRA under elective conditions between March 1st, 2020 and May 1st, 2022. Of these patients, 111 who met the study inclusion criteria were included in the study.
RESULTS: The rate of RAS was significantly higher among the patients with a TR band inflated with 18 ml of air compared to those with a TR band inflated with 12 ml of air (19.6%-3.6%; p = 0.009). Univariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and amount of air supplied to the TR band were significantly associated with RAS. Further analysis of these variables with multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that both MCV and the amount of air supplied to the TR band were independent predictors of RAS (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study revealed that the amount of air supplied to the TR band after CAG via TRA was an independent predictor for the development of RAS.
