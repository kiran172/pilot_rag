Title: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension and Vascular Anomalies in Chiari I Malformation.

Abstract: Mounting evidence has suggested a relationship between Chiari I malformation and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, with some studies implicating anomalies of the cerebral venous system in the development of these conditions. However, precise mechanisms explaining these associations are not well described. There is a clear need to clarify the interplay between these conditions to guide further study in this area. In tandem with these efforts, it is necessary to review proper diagnosis and management to improve outcomes in patients suffering from these diseases.
