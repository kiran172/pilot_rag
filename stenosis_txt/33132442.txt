Title: Fulminant myocarditis with myositis of ocular and respiratory muscles.

Abstract: A 46-year-old Japanese woman visited a nearby hospital because of diplopia after flu-like symptoms. One month later, she presented with blepharoptosis and external ophthalmoplegia. Laboratory tests showed a high creatine kinase concentration (3146 U/L). She underwent intravenous immunoglobulin therapy; however, her symptoms did not improve, prompting transfer to our institute. On admission, transthoracic echocardiography revealed 30% of left ventricular ejection fraction and edema of the left ventricular wall. Coronary angiography showed no significant coronary stenosis. An endomyocardial biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of acute myocarditis. On the following day, she needed a temporary pacemaker because she had complete atrioventricular block and intra-aortic balloon pump because of cardiogenic shock. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was again administered and her cardiac function gradually recovered. She was successfully weaned off her temporary pacemaker and intra-aortic balloon pump on Day 5 after improvement in her complete atrioventricular block. Steroid therapy administered from Day 9 was effective in reducing her creatine kinase concentrations. However, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed inflammation of the scalene, semispinalis cervicis, sternocleidomastoid, and intercostal muscles. On Day 25, her cardiac function had recovered to a left ventricular ejection fraction of 59%. Finally, she was successfully discharged on Day 45 after undergoing rehabilitation.
