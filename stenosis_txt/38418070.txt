Title: [Percutaneous aortic valve replacement: outcome of patients evaluated by EMG at Toulouse University Hospital preprocedure].

Abstract: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation has become the preferred method of aortic valve replacement in the elderly. Preoperative standardized geriatric assessment (SGA) helps guide the decision to proceed, taking into account geriatric parameters not targeted by surgical risk scores. This is a descriptive, retrospective study of patients who underwent EGS at the Toulouse University Hospital, analyzing their length of stay and postoperative care pathway.
