Title: Effect of PEGylation on the Drug Release Performance and Hemocompatibility of Photoresponsive Drug-Loading Platform.

Abstract: Coronary stenosis has been one of the most common heart diseases that drastically increases the risk of fatal disorders such as heart attack. Angioplasty using drug coated balloons (DCB) has been one of the most safe and promising treatments. To minimize the risk of thrombosis of such DCBs during intervention, a different approach that can secure high hemocompatibility under blood flow is necessary. Here we report a method of improving the photoresponsive platform's hemocompatibility by conjugating polyethylene glycol (PEG), onto the functional groups located at the balloon surface. In this study, latex microbeads were used as models for balloons to enable precise observation of its surface under microscopy. These beads were decorated with PEG polymers of a variety of lengths and grafting densities, along with the Cy5-Photoclevable (PC) linker conjugate to mimic drugs to be loaded onto the platform. Results showed that PEG length and grafting density are both critical factors that alter not only its hemocompatibility, but also the drug load and release efficiency of such platform. Thus, although further investigation is necessary to optimize the tradeoff between hemocompatibility, drug load, and release efficiency, it is safe to conclude that PEGylation of DCB surface is an effective method of enhancing and maintaining high hemocompatibility to minimize the risk of thrombosis during angioplasty.
