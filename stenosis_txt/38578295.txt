Title: Successful valve-in-valve transcatheter intervention to treat severe stenosis of a 38-year-old tricuspid bioprosthesis.

Abstract: A 60-year-old man presented with breathlessness. Nearly four decades previously, he had required three operations for Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve and had received a bioprosthetic valve. He had critical tricuspid bioprosthesis stenosis which was treated successfully by valve-in-valve transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement using a balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve. One year after intervention, the patient is well with no tricuspid valve stenosis or regurgitation.
