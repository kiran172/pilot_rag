Title: Pulmonary hypertension due to silicosis and right upper pulmonary artery occlusion with bronchial anthracofibrosis.

Abstract: Bronchial anthracofibrosis is a rare disease defined as bronchial stenosis with black pigmentation and usually not associated with artery occlusion. The patient was an 81-year-old man with silicosis. He presented with dyspnea on exertion, and pulmonary hypertension due to right upper pulmonary artery occlusion without thromboembolism was diagnosed on the basis of the results of right heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography. Bronchoscopy demonstrated bronchial anthracofibrosis in the right upper lobe. These findings suggested that the cause of PH was silicosis and pulmonary artery occlusion with bronchial anthracofibrosis. He has been treated with home oxygen therapy and tadalafil, and his symptom and 6MWD remain stable.
