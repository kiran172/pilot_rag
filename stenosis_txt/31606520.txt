Title: Caseous Calcification of the Mitral Annulus: A Role for Surgery.

Abstract: An 80-year-old man followed for aortic stenosis was found to have an intracardiac mass. Multiple imaging modalities were inconclusive in characterizing the mass but raised concerns about the potential malignancy of the mass. Fear of operating on an elderly patient with a potential for cardiac neoplasia led to a percutaneous transseptal biopsy that failed to provide a clear diagnosis. Cardiac valvular surgery was performed in addition to excisional biopsy of the mass that turned out to be caseous necrosis of mitral annular calcifications.
