Title: [Retrospective Study of Preoperative Serial Pancreatic Juice Aspiration Cytological Examination(SPACE)for Early Preoperative Detection of Pancreatic Cancer].

Abstract: Serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytological examination(SPACE)has been reported as a reliable preoperative diagnostic method for early pancreatic cancer, when combined with imaging findings suspecting early pancreatic cancer. Among 259 patients with suspected pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreatic resection at our hospital, SPACE was preoperatively performed in 14 cases(5.4%). Of these 14 cases, final pathological diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 12 patients (86%), including 5 patients with Stage ⅠA pancreatic cancer(35.7%), all of whom had a mass on preoperative CT or EUS. On the other hand, in the other 2 cases(14.3%), CT/EUS detected no mass but focal pancreatic parenchymal atrophy and main pancreatic duct stenosis which were the imaging findings suspecting very early pancreatic cancer such as cancer in situ. Although preoperative SPACE results of these 2 cases were class Ⅳ, final pathological results of resected specimen were low-grade PanIN in both cases. SPACE was considered useful for preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in our study, however further study is needed to examine its diagnostic accuracy for early pancreatic cancer which does not appear as a mass in any imaging modality.
