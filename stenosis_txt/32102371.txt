Title: Fractional Flow Reserve Derived from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography Safely Defers Invasive Coronary Angiography in Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In the United States, the real-world feasibility and outcome of using fractional flow reserve from coronary computed tomography angiography (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) is unknown. We sought to determine whether a strategy that combined coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) and FFR<sub>CT</sub> could safely reduce the need for invasive coronary angiography (ICA), as compared to coronary CTA alone.
METHODS: The study included 387 consecutive patients with suspected CAD referred for coronary CTA with selective FFR<sub>CT</sub> and 44 control patients who underwent CTA alone. Lesions with 30-90% diameter stenoses were considered of indeterminate hemodynamic significance and underwent FFR<sub>CT</sub>. Nadir FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 was positive. The rate of patients having ICA, revascularization and major adverse cardiac events were recorded.
RESULTS: Using coronary CTA and selective FFR<sub>CT</sub>, 121 patients (32%) had at least one vessel with ≥50% diameter stenosis; 67/121 (55%) patients had at least one vessel with FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80; 55/121 (45%) underwent ICA; and 34 were revascularized. The proportion of ICA patients undergoing revascularization was 62% (34 of 55). The number of patients with vessels with 30-50% diameter of stenosis was 90 (23%); 28/90 (31%) patients had at least one vessel with FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80; 8/90 (9%) underwent ICA; and five were revascularized. In our institutional practice, compared to coronary CTA alone, coronary CTA with selective FFR<sub>CT</sub> reduced the rates of ICA (45% vs. 80%) for those with obstructive CAD. Using coronary CTA with selective FFR<sub>CT</sub>, no major adverse cardiac events occurred over a mean follow-up of 440 days.
CONCLUSION: FFR<sub>CT</sub> safely deferred ICA in patients with CAD of indeterminate hemodynamic significance. A high proportion of those who underwent ICA were revascularized.
