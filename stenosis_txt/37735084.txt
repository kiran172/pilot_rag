Title: [Clinical significance and risk factors of redundant nerve root in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical significance and screen the risk factors of redundant nerve roots(RNRs) in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
METHODS: The clinical data of 196 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis in the department of Spinal Surgery, Yijishan Hospital, Wannan Medical College from April 1, 2015 to November 30, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were divided into RNRs positive group and RNRs negative group according to the presence of RNRs. The differences in general clinical data, imaging parameters, visual analogue scale(VAS), Oswestry disability index(ODI), and other indicators between the two groups were compared. The risk factors which are highly correlated with RNRs were screened by binary Logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: There were 59 cases in the RNRs positive group, with an occurrence rate of 29.95% (59/137), and 137 cases in the RNRs negative group. The incidence rate of RNRs in 196 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis was 30.10% (59/196). VAS and ODI scores of patients in the two groups were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05), and clinical symptoms of patients in the RNRs positive group were more severe than those in the RNRs negative group. There were significant differences in age, number of stenosis segments, average area of lumbar dural sac, area of the narrowest segment and the narrowest segment(P&lt;0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the number of stenosis segments, the average median sagittal diameter of spinal canal, and the average area of dural sac in lumbar intervertebral space were correlated with the generation of RNRs (P&lt;0.05). The regression coefficient of the number of stenosis segments was -1.115, the regression coefficient of the median sagittal diameter of the spinal canal was -1.707, and the regression coefficient of the mean dural sac area of the lumbar intervertebral space was 7.556.
CONCLUSION: The clinical symptoms of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis accompanied by RNRs are more severe than those without them. The number of narrow segments, median sagittal diameter of the spinal canal, and the area of the lumbar intervertebral dural sac are the high-risk factors for RNRs, with the area of the lumbar intervertebral dural sac has the highest correlation.
