Title: Epicardial Fat Volume as a Good Predictor for Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Epicardial adipose tissue may have an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD).
AIM: We aimed to study the association between epicardial fat volume (EFV) and presence of obstructive as well as multivessel CAD.
METHODS: A total of 87 adult subjects with suspected CAD who underwent both quantified by multidetector computerized tomography (MDCT) and Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA) were enrolled in this observational study. EVF was measured by MDCT by calculating the sum of cross- sectional areas of fat multiplied by slice thickness. EFV measurement and its association with the presence of obstructive CAD (defined as coronary artery stenosis > 70%) was evaluated.
RESULTS: Overall, 89.6% patients had obstructive CAD with higher EFV as compared to 10.3% patients with non-obstructive CAD (57 ± 20.14 cm3 vs. 44 ± 7.4 cm3; P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, EFV was significantly increased in group II as compared with group I (74 ± 24.3 ml vs. 53 ± 16.2 ml; P &lt; 0.003). On the hand, the coronary calcium score (CAC) was insignificantly increased in group II as compared with group I (486.1 vs. 211.2; P = 0.10). Multivariate analysis revealed that, EFV might be an independent risk factor for not only the presence of obstructive CAD (odds ratio [OR], 1.062; 95% CI 1.018- 1.108; P &lt; 0.005) but also in predicting multivessel disease affection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that, EFV was significantly increased not only with obstructive CAD, independent of other traditional risk factors and CAC score, but also it can be considered a good predictor of multivessel disease occurrence.
