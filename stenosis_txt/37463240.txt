Title: Diagnostic Performance and Safety of a Novel Ferumoxytol-Enhanced Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Currently, noninvasive arteriography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease is clinically limited to the computed tomography scanning, where patients have to be exposed to the radiation and risks associated with iodinated contrast. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance and safety of a novel ferumoxytol-enhanced coronary magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.
METHODS: Thirty patients, 19 males, with a median age of 63 years old, and 17 with renal insufficiency, who were scheduled for invasive coronary angiography, were enrolled. Ferumoxytol was administered intravenously with a dose of 3 mg/kg during CMRA. Images were acquired with an ECG-triggered, navigator-gated, inversion recovery-prepared 3D fast low-angle shot sequence, and the image quality was assessed by a 4-point scale. Eighteen-segment coronary artery model was adopted to evaluate the visibility of the coronary arteries, and the image quality and stenosis were evaluated in nine segments. The diagnostic performance of CMRA is described as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy with the invasive coronary angiography results as reference. The patients' vital signs were monitored during CMRA, and their hepatic and renal functions were followed up for 3 months to evaluate the safety of ferumoxytol.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-two of the 270 study segments were identified by CMRA, and their quality score reached 3.6Â±0.7. Referring to the invasive coronary angiography results, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced CMRA reached 100.0%, 66.7%, 92.3%, 100.0%, and 93.3% respectively in patient-based analysis; 91.4%, 90.9%, 86.5%, 94.3%, and 91.1%, respectively in vessel-based analysis; and 92.3%, 96.7%, 83.7%, 98.6%, and 96.0%, respectively in segment-based analysis. No ferumoxytol-related adverse event was observed during the 3-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Ferumoxytol-enhanced CMRA demonstrated good diagnostic performance and excellent safety in the diagnosis of significant coronary stenosis, providing an alternative to coronary computed tomography angiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
