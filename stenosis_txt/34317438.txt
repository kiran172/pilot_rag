Title: Early Progression of Aortic Stenosis Associated With Iatrogenic Variant Transthyretin Amyloidosis After Domino Liver Transplantation.

Abstract: We report a 65-year-old man who underwent aortic valve replacement because of severe aortic stenosis associated with de novo iatrogenic variant transthyretin amyloidosis derived from a liver graft extracted from a patient with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis 9 years after the domino liver transplantation. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
