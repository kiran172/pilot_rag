Title: Neoadjuvant S-1 and oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab therapy for high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer: A prospective multicenter phase II study.

Abstract: AIM: We report the short/mid-term results of surgery for high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC, four courses of S-1 + oxaliplatin+ bevacizumab) without radiotherapy with the primary aim of ypT0-2.
METHODS: High-risk LARC was defined as cT4b, mesorectal fascia (MRF) ≤1 mm (MRF+), or lateral lymph node metastasis (cLLN+) on high-resolution MRI. The planned 32 cases from April 2018 to December 2021 were all included.
RESULTS: There were 10 patients at cT4b (31.2%), 26 MRF+ (81.3%), and 22 cLLN+ (68.8%). Thirteen (40.6%) underwent NAC after a colostomy for stenosis. NAC was completed in 26 (81.2%) cases. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in six (18.7%). One patient developed progressive disease (3.2%). Eleven were ycT0-3MRF-LLN- (34.3%). Curative-intent surgery was performed on 31, with sphincter-preserving surgery in 20, abdominoperineal resection in nine, total pelvic exenteration in two, and lateral lymph node dissection in 24. Two had R1/2 resection (6.4%). A Grade 3 or higher postoperative complication rate occurred in 3.2%. Pathological complete response and ypT0-2 rates were 12.9% and 45.1%. Three-year disease-free survival rates (3yDFS) for ypT0-2 and ypT ≥3 were 81.2%, 46.6% (p = 0.061), and 3-year local recurrence rates (3yLR) were 0%, 48.8% (p = 0.015). 3yDFS for ycT0-3MRF-LLN- and ycT4/MRF+/LLN+ were 87.5%, 48.0% (p = 0.031) and 3yLR were 0%, 42.8% (p = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: NAC yielded a clinically significant effect in about half of high-risk LARC patients. If NAC alone is ineffective, radiotherapy should be added, even if extended surgery is intended.
