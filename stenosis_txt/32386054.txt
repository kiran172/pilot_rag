Title: Double Biologic Therapy for Refractory Stricturing Crohn's Disease: A Successful Case of Deep Remission with Ustekinumab and Vedolizumab.

Abstract: Stricturing Crohn's disease (CD) is a severe phenotype that presents unique challenges to therapeutic management. Emerging literature suggests that anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies are inadequate for preventing progression to stricture. We hereby present a case of a patient with refractory CD who required multiple surgical resections despite several anti-TNF treatment regimens. Subsequent surgical complications were avoided after changing to combination vedolizumab and ustekinumab therapies every 4 weeks. This case argues for a tailored approach to CD therapy based on disease phenotype and demonstrates that combination therapy with ustekinumab and vedolizumab is a viable option for patients with stricturing disease.
