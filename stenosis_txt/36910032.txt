Title: Papillary fibroelastoma causing severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Herein, we present a rare case of papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve, which caused severe aortic stenosis. The papillary fibroelastoma developed on the left ventricular side of the non-coronary cusp, immobilizing the cusp motion and obstructing the left ventricular outflow tract, resulting in severe aortic stenosis that brought on acute heart failure. The patient underwent an urgent surgical treatment, which resulted in a successful outcome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of papillary fibroelastoma in which aortic stenosis was so severe as to cause congestive heart failure.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Papillary fibroelastoma (PFE) is the most commonly observed primary cardiac tumor in adults that commonly involves left heart chambers. While PFEs often cause embolisms, they rarely cause valvular dysfunction. In a case presented herein, a PFE developed on the left ventricular side of the non-coronary cusp, immobilizing the cusp motion and obstructing the left ventricular outflow tract, resulting in severe aortic stenosis that brought on acute heart failure.
