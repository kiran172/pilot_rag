Title: The Maintained Glycemic Target Goal and Renal Function Are Associated with Cardiovascular and Renal Outcomes in Diabetic Patients Following Stent-Supported Angioplasty for Renovascular Atherosclerotic Disease.

Abstract: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) constitute a large proportion of patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS). However, the mechanism of impaired renal function and hypertension in this subset of patients is multifactorial. We aimed to investigate whether, in diabetic patients, renal function (RF), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values following stent-supported angioplasty (PTA) for ARAS have an impact on cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Methods: The study group included 93 patients with T2DM and resistant hypertension who underwent PTA for ARAS. The pre- and post-procedure (6 to 12, and 24 months) values of SBP, DBP, eGFR and glycaemia were obtained. The prospective follow-up of median 44 months was performed for combined outcome: major cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE) and progression to renal replacement therapy (RRT). Results: MACCE-RRT occurred in 46 (49.5%) patients, with higher incidence in patients with higher values of SBP (147.8 ± 25.8 vs. 136.7 ± 15.8 mmHg, p = 0.006), DBP (80.8 ± 13.3 vs. 74.4 ± 12.3 mmHg, p = 0.009), chronic kidney disease in stages 3B to 5 (p = 0.029) and those who have not obtained target glycemic goals compared to well-maintained T2DM (p = 0.007) at 24-months. On multivariate Cox analysis, well-maintained T2DM targets [Hazard Ratio (HR):0.27; 95% Confidence Interval (CI):0.13−0.57; p < 0.001], eGFR below 45 mL/min/m2 (HR: 2.20; 95%CI: 1.20−4.04; p = 0.011), previous stroke (HR:2.52; 95%CI:1.19−5.34; p = 0.015) retained their associations with MACCE-RRT, while BP values were not associated with the outcome. Conclusions: The post-procedural RF, maintained glycemic target goal and previous stroke are vital for the outcome in patients undergoing PTA for renovascular disease in diabetic patients.
