Title: Long-Term Outcomes of Stenting on Non-Acute Phase Extracranial Supra-Aortic Dissections.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Extracranial supra-aortic dissections (ESADs) with severe stenosis, occlusion and/or pseudoaneurysm presents potential risk of stroke. Endovascular stenting to reconstruct non acute phase ESADs (NAP-ESADs) is an alternative to anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. However, its feasibility, safety and efficacy of stenting in NAP-ESADs is unclear. This study aims to investigate the long-term outcomes of the feasibility, safety and efficacy of stenting in NAP-ESADs.
METHODS: Seventy-four patients with 91 NAP-ESAD vessels with severe stenosis, occlusion and/or pseudoaneurysm presents potential risk of stroke who underwent stent remodeling were enrolled into this respective study from December 2008 to March 2020. Technical success rate, complications, clinical and angiographic results were harvested and analyzed.
RESULTS: Success rate of stent deployment was 99% (90/91) with no procedural mortality or morbidity. Transient ischemic attack occurred in three patients during operation (4.1%, 3/74). Asymptomatic embolisms of distal intracranial vessels were found in two patients (2.7%, 2/74). One hundred and forty-two stents deployed at 85 carotid (135 stents) and six vertebral (seven stents) vessels. Six stent types (Wingspan, 28/135, 20.7%; Solitaire, 10/135, 7.4%; Neuroform, 8/135, 5.9%; LVIS, 2/135, 1.5%; Precise, 75/135, 55.6%; Acculink, 12/135, 8.9%) were deployed at carotid arterial dissection while two types (Wingspan, 5/7, 71.4%; Solitaire 2/7, 28.6%) at vertebral arterial dissection. Digital subtracted angiography (56%, 51/91), computational tomography angiography (41.8%, 38/91) and high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (2.2%, 2/91) were adopted for follow up, with a mean time of 17.2Â±15.4 months (5-77). All patient modified Rankin Scale scores showed no increase at discharge or follow-up. Angiographically, dissections in 86 vessels in 69 patients (94.5%, 86/91) were completely reconstructed with only minor remnant dissections in four vessels in four patients (4.4%, 4/91). Severe re-stenosis in the stented segment required re-stenting in one patient (1.1%, 1/91).
CONCLUSION: Stent remodeling technique provides feasible, safe and efficacious treatment of ESADs patients with severe stenosis, occlusion and/or pseudoaneurysm.
