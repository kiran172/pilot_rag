Title: Perioperative Evaluation and Follow-Up Analysis of Carotid Body Tumor by Color Doppler Ultrasound.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The value of color doppler ultrasound (CDU) for perioperative evaluation and follow-up outcomes of carotid body tumor (CBT) remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the role of CDU in CBT in our center.
METHODS: From January 2015 to December 2020, 75, patients with CBT were included in the study. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and CDU data of patients were collected and analyzed. The postoperative recovery and follow-up outcomes were summarized.
RESULTS: A total of 91 CBTs in 75 patients were included in the study. 73.3% of the patients had unilateral lesions, while 26.7% had bilateral lesions. Lesions were categorized as Shamblin I (4.4%), Shamblin II (52.7%), and Shamblin III (42.9%). 79.5% lesions were treated by surgical resection, 12.3% were treated by surgical resection with internal carotid artery reconstructed by artificial vessel, while 8.2% were treated by surgical resection with internal carotid artery reconstructed by autogenous great saphenous vein. Compared with CTA, the sensitivity of CDU for the detection of CBT was 96.7%, the sensitivity and specificity of CDU for the detection of Shamblin I lesions were both 100%, the sensitivity and specificity for Shamblin II were 100% and 72.1%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity for Shamblin III were 69.2% and 100%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between CTA and CDU for the detection of the maximal diameter, volume of CBT, distance between the end of the tumor, and the mastoid process. 79.7% of the patients were followed up with CDU. The eecurrence of CBT occurred in 1 patient. CDU showed that stenosis and occlusion of artificial vessel occurred in 1 and 6 patients, respectively. The occlusion of autogenous great saphenous vein was found in 2 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: CDU can accurately diagnose Shamblin I CBT, have high sensitivity for Shamblin II, and high specificity for Shamblin III CBT. It plays an important role in diagnosis, perioperative evaluation, and follow-up analysis of CBT.
