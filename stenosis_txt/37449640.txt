Title: A novel mouse model of central cord syndrome.

Abstract: Patients with potential spinal stenosis are susceptible to central cord syndrome induced by blunt trauma. Suitable animal models are helpful for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of such injuries. In this study, we established a mouse model of acute blunt traumatic spinal cord injury by compressing the C6 spinal cord with 5 and 10 g/mm2 compression weights to simulate cervical central cord syndrome. Behavioral testing confirmed that this model exhibited the characteristics of central cord syndrome because motor function in the front paws was impaired, whereas basic motor and sensory functions of the lower extremities were retained. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed that the diseased region of the spinal cord in this mouse model was restricted to the gray matter of the central cord, whereas the white matter was rarely affected. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a hypointense signal in the lesion after mild and severe injury. In addition, immunofluorescence staining showed that the degree of nerve tract injury in the spinal cord white matter was mild, and that there was a chronic inflammation reaction. These findings suggest that this mouse model of central cord syndrome can be used as a model for preclinical research, and that gray matter is most vulnerable to injury in central cord syndrome, leading to impaired motor function.
