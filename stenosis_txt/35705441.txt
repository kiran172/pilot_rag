Title: Successful Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Approached Via a Simultaneously Implanted Y-graft Vascular Prosthesis.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is mainly performed using the transfemoral (TF) approach. If the TF approach is difficult, the transapical (TA) or transaortic (TAo) approach is used; however, the complication rate is higher in such cases. In this case, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) replacement and TAVR via artificial vessels were performed simultaneously because of anatomical difficulties in stent graft implantation and TF-TAVR for severe aortic stenosis (AS) associated with AAA. Performing TAVR simultaneously with AAA replacement avoids TA- or TAo-TAVR and allows for postoperative management in the absence of AS. Additionally, there is no need to create a new access for TAVR using artificial vessels. Since the long-term results of AAA are better with open surgery than with endovascular aneurysm repair and the age of indication for TAVR is expected to decrease due to valve-in-valve and other factors, simultaneous surgical AAA replacement and TAVR using a Y-graft vascular prosthesis is an effective treatment option when TF-TAVR is difficult to perform.
