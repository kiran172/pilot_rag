Title: Not all pseudoaneurysms are femoral-A transcaval transcatheter aortic valve replacement rare complication.

Abstract: We report a case of a 73-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including postpoliomyelitis severe scoliosis, referred to our tertiary center due to a severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, considered high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Due to unsuitable femoral and subclavian accesses, the patient underwent a transcaval transcatheter AVR (TAVR) procedure, complicated by the development of an iatrogenic infrarenal aortic pseudoaneurysm with aortocaval fistula. Scoliosis can cause varying anatomic relationships between retroperitoneal vessels and intervertebral disk spaces, which increase the difficulty of the procedure and consequently lead to this vascular complication. Although most aortocaval fistulas close spontaneously after 1 year, the risk of pseudoaneurysm rupture in this critical area was crucial in the decision of a new successful percutaneous aortic stent intervention.
