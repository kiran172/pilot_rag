Title: Effectiveness of a Gelatin-Thrombin Matrix Sealant (Floseal®) for Reducing Blood Loss During Microendoscopic Decompression Surgery for Lumbar Spinal Canal Stenosis: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness and safety of a gelatin-thrombin matrix sealant (GTMS) during microendoscopic laminectomy (MEL) for lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS).
METHODS: This study included 158 LSCS cases on hemostasis-affecting medication who underwent MEL by a single surgeon between September 2016 and August 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether GTMS was used (37 cases, Group A) or not (121 cases, Group B). Perioperative data related to bleeding or postoperative spinal epidural hematoma (PSEH) was investigated. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score for low back pain.
RESULTS: The mean intraoperative blood loss per level was greater in Group A (26.0 ± 20.3 g) than in Group B (13.6 ± 9.0 g), whereas the postoperative drainage volume was smaller in Group A (79.1 ± 42.5 g) than in Group B (97.3 ± 55.6 g). No revision surgeries for PSEH were required in Group A, while 2 (1.7%) revisions were required in Group B (P = .957). The median JOA score improved significantly from the preoperative period to 1-year postoperatively in both Group A and B (total score, 16.0-23.5 and 17.0-25.0 points, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of GTMS during MEL for LSCS may be associated with a reduction in postoperative drainage volume. The revision rate for PSEH was not affected significantly by the use of GTMS. Clinical outcomes (represented by the JOA score) were significantly improved after the surgery, regardless of GTMS use during MEL.
