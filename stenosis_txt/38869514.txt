Title: Laparoscopic Sigmoid Vaginoplasty for the Treatment of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome in a Single Center: 20 years' Experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: We investigate the feasibility, safety, and clinical therapeutic effect of laparoscopic sigmoid vaginoplasty in women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective case review cohort study of 56 patients with MRKHs undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid vaginoplasty in Wuhan Union Hospital between 2000 and 2020, and all patients were followed up.
RESULTS: The median operating time was 165 min (120-420 min). The median hospital stay was 10 days (rang 7-15 days). A functional neovagina was created 11-15 cm in length and two fingers in breadth in all patients. No introitus stenosis was observed. No intra- or post-operative complications occurred. Two patients were lost to follow-up after 3 months of outpatient visits. Six patients had no intercourse and were required to wear a vaginal mold occasionally. None of the patients had complained of local irritation or dyspareunia. Patients who had post-surgery sexual intercourse were satisfied with their sexual life and the mean total Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score was 25.17 ± 0.63. The cosmetic results were excellent.
CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic sigmoid vaginoplasty can achieve the goal of making a functional neovagina. The main advantage of this surgical technique is that it is minimally invasive and that there are fewer complications post-operation. It is an acceptable procedure for patients with MRKH syndrome.
