Title: Nonstented Tubularized Incised Plate Distal Hypospadias Repair: A Single Center 5 Years' Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To report our immediate and delayed outcomes of nonstented tubularized incised plate (TIP) distal hypospadias repair.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all charts of children who underwent distal hypospadias repair in a single children's hospital from 2013 to 2018. Patients' demographics, hypospadias characteristics, operative technique, and immediate and delayed outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: Of 280 consecutive distal hypospadias repairs that were identified, 74 were excluded due to the use of a repair other than TIP. Eleven stented TIP repairs were excluded as well. Of 195 nonstented repairs, immediate postoperative voiding complications were recorded in 11 (5.6%) and included multiple/split stream in 6 (3%), dysuria and voiding difficulty in 2 (1%), urinary retention in 2 (1%), and gross hematuria that spontaneously resolved in 1 (0.5%). Late follow up was recorded in 142 of 195 (72.8%) repairs. Delayed urethroplasty/glansplasty complications were recorded in 12 (8.5%) and included urethrocutaneous fistula in 10 (7.0%), meatal stenosis in 6 (4.2%) and glans/urethroplasty dehiscence in 2 (1.4%).
CONCLUSION: Avoiding postoperative urethral stents in distal hypospadias TIP repair reduces the morbidity associated with the stent and is a feasible option that carries acceptable immediate and delayed complication rates. Avoiding the stent eliminates stent-related bladder spasms, the need for other medications, and the short-term office visit for stent removal, therefore reducing parental anxiety, patient discomfort, and reducing cost.
