Title: [A Case Report of Gastric Cancer with Long-Term Prognosis by Multidisciplinary Treatment].

Abstract: The patient was a 55-year-old man. For gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination and pyloric stenosis, gastrojejunostomy was performed and S-1 plus paclitaxel combination therapy was started. After confirming tumor shrinkage and negative peritoneal dissemination, pyloric gastrectomy was performed. Paclitaxel therapy was performed for 1 year after surgery, and the patient was followed up without systemic chemotherapy. Since the CA19-9 level increased 1 year and 8 months after gastrectomy, ramucirumab plus paclitaxel therapy and followed S-1 plus oxaliplatin therapy were performed. Two years and 6 months after gastrectomy, solitary metastasis of the paraportal lymph nodes was observed, and radiation therapy was introduced. One year later after radiation, lymph node metastasis of near the left common iliac artery was detected, and nivolumab therapy was performed. Although nivolumab was discontinued due to hepatic dysfunction, he is alive without recurrence, 7 years after gastrectomy. It could be important to judge treatment decision based on the evaluation of radiographic assessment, tumor markers and clinical symptoms.
