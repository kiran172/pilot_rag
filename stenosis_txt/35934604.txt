Title: Malignant arterial hypertension in a 2-month-old girl: Etiological diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: A 2-month-old girl presented with malignant arterial hypertension revealing bilateral renal artery stenosis secondary to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Life-supporting care was initiated immediately. High-dose peripheral vasodilator therapy induced life-threatening toxicity; vascular surgery was therefore performed. Technical difficulties due to the young age and low body weight of the patient resulted in fatal bleeding. Renovascular disease is an important cause of pediatric hypertension. NF1-associated renovascular hypertension in young pediatric patients is rare, and its highly specialized management is best delivered via a multidisciplinary approach. The long-term prognosis remains poor.
