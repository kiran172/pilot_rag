Title: Prevailing treatment methods for lumbar spondylolysis: A systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND:: Aim of this study was to systematically review the prevailing treatment methods for lumbar spondylolysis.
METHODS:: Manuscripts published between 1951 and 2020 were searched by using PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Springer, Web of Science databases. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020218651). The inclusion criteria for all articles of prevailing treatment methods for spondylolysis were: 1. English language; 2. at least 1 relevant treatment method for spondylolysis; 3. Randomized controlled trial (RCT), systematic review, comparative study, cross-sectional, cohort, and/or case control study. 4. pre-diagnosed cases of spondylolysis whereas article was excluded if. 5. any spinal deformity. 6. any neurological condition. Standards have been independently applied by using 2 reviewers and another author resolved disagreements.
RESULTS:: Data extraction screened 12 full-length articles. Description, treatment, outcome, and findings were individually extracted and cross-referenced.
DISCUSSION:: Current review has suggested that the noninvasive treatment method specifically low intensity pulsed ultrasound, electro acupuncture and pulsed electromagnetic filed is effective for bone union while operative treatment specifically pedicle screw fixation +/- interbody fusion depending the extent of disk degeneration and craniocaudal foraminal stenosis is effective for minimizing pain and functional disability in patients with spondylolysis. This review concluded that the noninvasive treatment method specifically low intensity pulsed ultrasound is effective for bone union.
