Title: Cardiac tamponade-mediated generalized coronary vasospasm presenting as an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary vasospasm is a rare cause of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and can be precipitated by numerous inciting factors including endogenous catecholamines. Differentiating coronary vasospasm from an acute atherothrombotic event is diagnostically challenging and requires a careful clinical history combined with electrocardiographic and angiographic abnormalities to make the diagnosis and guide therapy.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac tamponade leading to an endogenous catecholamine surge resulting in profound arterial vasospasm and STEMI. The patient presented with chest pain and inferior ST segment elevations prompting emergent coronary angiography, demonstrating subtotal occlusion of the right coronary artery, severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, and diffusely stenosed aortoiliac vessels. Emergent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion and hemodynamics consistent with cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis resulted in dramatic hemodynamic improvement with immediate normalization of ST segments. Repeat coronary angiography performed one day later showed no angiographically significant coronary or peripheral arterial stenosis.
DISCUSSION: This is the first reported case of simultaneous coronary and peripheral arterial vasospasm presenting as inferior STEMI caused by endogenous catecholamines from cardiac tamponade. Several clues suggest coronary vasospasm including the discordant electrocardiography (ECG) and coronary angiographic findings as well as diffusely stenosed aortoiliac vessels. Diffuse vasospasm was confirmed when repeat angiography performed after pericardiocentesis demonstrated angiographic resolution of coronary and peripheral arterial stenosis. Though rare, circulating endogenous catecholamines resulting in diffuse coronary vasospasm may present as STEMI and should be considered based on the clinical history, ECG findings, and coronary angiography.
