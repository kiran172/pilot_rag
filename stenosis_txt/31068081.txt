Title: Classifying intracranial stenosis disease severity from functional MRI data using machine learning.

Abstract: Translation of many non-invasive hemodynamic MRI methods to cerebrovascular disease patients has been hampered by well-known artifacts associated with delayed blood arrival times and reduced microvascular compliance. Using machine learning and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, we investigated whether arrival time-related artifacts in these methods could be exploited as novel contrast sources to discriminate angiographically confirmed stenotic flow territories. Intracranial steno-occlusive moyamoya patients (n = 53; age = 45 ± 14.2 years; sex = 43 F) underwent (i) catheter angiography, (ii) anatomical MRI, (iii) cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted arterial spin labeling, and (iv) cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)-weighted hypercapnic blood-oxygenation-level-dependent MRI. Mean, standard deviation (std), and 99th percentile of CBF, CVR, CVR<sub>Delay</sub>, and CVR<sub>Max</sub> were calculated in major anterior and posterior flow territories perfused by vessels with vs. without stenosis (≥70%) confirmed by catheter angiography. These and demographic variables were input into SVMs to evaluate discriminatory capacity for stenotic flow territories using k-fold cross-validation and receiver-operating-characteristic-area-under-the-curve to quantify variable combination relevance. Anterior circulation CBF-std, attributable to heterogeneous endovascular signal and prolonged arterial transit times, was the best performing single variable and CVR<sub>Delay</sub>-mean and CBF-std, both reflective of delayed vascular compliance, were a high-performing two-variable combination (specificity = 0.67; sensitivity = 0.75). Findings highlight the relevance of hemodynamic imaging and machine learning for identifying cerebrovascular impairment.
