Title: The effect of homocysteine-lowering therapy on the formation of carotid atherosclerosis: A follow-up study in the rural areas of northwest China.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in the rural areas of Northwest China, and to assess whether reducing serum homocysteine can prevent carotid atherosclerosis in subjects with hyperhomocysteinemia.
METHOD: This observational study with 767 participants aged 40 years or older was conducted over 3 years. Color Doppler ultrasonography was performed to measure carotid atherosclerosis. We recorded biochemical indexes and carotid ultrasound results in the first and fourth years.
RESULT: A total of 767 individuals (48.5 % men) were analyzed. Older age, hypertension, and higher levels of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were risk factors for increased carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), carotid plaque, and carotid stenosis (All P < 0.05). No association was found between decreased serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels and CIMT, carotid plaque, or carotid stenosis in individuals with hyperhomocysteinemia.
CONCLUSION: Older age, hypertension, and higher baseline levels of LDL-C were independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis. Reducing serum Hcy levels may not prevent carotid atherosclerosis in the general population with hyperhomocysteinemia.
