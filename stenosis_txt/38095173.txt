Title: Endoscopic submucosal dissection using a novel thin-therapeutic endoscope for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with severe stricture at the pharyngoesophageal junction.

Abstract: When performing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) beyond stenoses, there have only been two choices: balloon dilation until a conventional therapeutic endoscope passes through or the use of an ultrathin endoscope. However, balloon dilation has a risk of perforation and an ultrathin endoscope limits the devices that may be used. The novel thin-therapeutic endoscope has an outer diameter of 7.9 mm and instrument channel diameter of 3.2 mm; therefore, there are no restrictions on the ESD device that may be used, and the procedure may be performed in the same manner as regular ESD. We herein report a case in which the thin-therapeutic endoscope was useful for esophageal ESD beyond a stenosis.
