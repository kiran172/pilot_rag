Title: [The somewhat different cause of an obturation in stenosing terminal ileitis : Case report of a 39-year-old male patient with Crohn's disease].

Abstract: A possible classical complication of Crohn's disease is the formation of a stenosis, which can occur throughout the course of the disease and can present differently depending on the narrowing of the lumen. This article reports the case of a 39-year-old male patient with a stenosing terminal ileitis, which was ultimately only manifested after obstruction by a foreign body.
