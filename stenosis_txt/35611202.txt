Title: Echocardiography in the diagnosis of Shone's complex and analysis of the causes for missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Shone's complex is a rare syndrome characterized by congenital left heart defects that can differ among the patients.
AIM: To use echocardiography in the diagnosis of Shone's complex and analyze the causes of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent echocardiography and repair surgery from February 14, 2008, to November 22, 2019. The patients were followed once a year at the outpatient clinic after surgery.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were included. The patients were 2.7 (0.8-5.6) years of age, and 54.5% were male. Ten (15.2%) had a history of heart surgery. The most common heart defect was the Annulo-Leaflet mitral ring (ALMR) (50/66, 75.8%), followed by coarctation of the aorta (CoA) (43/66, 65.2%). The patients had a variety of combinations of defects. Only two (3.0%) patients had all four defects. None of the patients had a family history of congenital heart disease. The preoperative echocardiographic findings were examined against the intraoperative findings. Echocardiography missed an ALMR in 31 patients (47.0%), a parachute mitral valve (PMV) in one patient (1.5%), subaortic stenosis in one patient (1.5%), and CoA in two patients (3.0%).
CONCLUSION: Echocardiography is an effective method to diagnose the Shone's complex. Due to this disease's complexity and interindividual variability, Improving the understanding of the disease can reduce misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
