Title: Evaluation of a rapid deployment prosthesis strategy for the treatment of aortic valve endocarditis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcome of patients suffering from native aortic valve (NVE) or prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis (PVE) treated with the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite rapid-deployment valve prosthesis.
METHODS: Between February 2019 and June 2020, 25 patients suffering from NVE (n = 9; 36%) and PVE (n = 16; 64%) of the aortic valve received an INTUITY valve at our institution. Preoperative, operative and follow-up data were collected.
RESULTS: In our cohort, the mean EuroSCORE II was 13.4%. Eleven patients (44%) received concomitant aortic root patch plasty. Four patients (16%) received coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 3 patients (12%) received mitral valve repair and 2 patients (8%) underwent replacement of the ascending aorta. The cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 124 ± 56 and 75 ± 39 min, respectively. The mean intensive care unit stay was 5 days. The mean size of the implanted prostheses was 25 ± 2 mm and the mean prosthesis transvalvular gradient 3 months after surgery was 9 ± 4 mmHg. During follow-up, no case of recurrent endocarditis occurred, 1 patient died of multisystem organ failure which had already been present preoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for NVE and PVE of the aortic valve may be safely performed using the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system. This procedure could be well implemented in cases with extensive infection, fragile root tissue and root abscesses requiring root reconstruction. In our institution, the rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement strategy has become an important tool in the armamentarium of the surgical endocarditis treatment.
