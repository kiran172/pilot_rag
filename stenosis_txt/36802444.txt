Title: Pericoronary Adipose Tissue Attenuation in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome Versus Stable Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) attenuation has been associated with coronary inflammation and can be evaluated with coronary computed tomography angiography. The aims of this study were to compare the PCAT attenuation across precursors of culprit and nonculprit lesions of patients with acute coronary syndrome versus stable coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: In this case-control study, patients with suspected CAD who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography were included. Patients who developed an acute coronary syndrome within 2 years after the coronary computed tomography angiography scan were identified, and patients with stable CAD (defined as any coronary plaque ≥30% luminal diameter stenosis) were 1:2 propensity score matched for age, sex, and cardiac risk factors. The mean PCAT attenuation was analyzed at lesion level and compared between precursors of culprit lesions, nonculprit lesions, and stable coronary plaques.
RESULTS: In total, 198 patients (age 62±10 years, 65% male) were selected, including 66 patients who developed an acute coronary syndrome and 132 propensity matched patients with stable CAD. Overall, 765 coronary lesions were analyzed (culprit lesion precursors: n=66; nonculprit lesion precursors: n=207; and stable lesions: n=492). Culprit lesion precursors had larger total plaque volume, fibro-fatty plaque volume, and low-attenuation plaque volume compared to nonculprit and stable lesions. The mean PCAT attenuation was significantly higher across culprit lesion precursors compared to nonculprit and stable lesions (-63.8±9.7 Hounsfield units versus -68.8±10.6 Hounsfield units versus -69.6±10.6 Hounsfield units, respectively; P&lt;0.001), whereas the mean PCAT attenuation around nonculprit and stable lesions was not significantly different (P=0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: The mean PCAT attenuation is significantly increased across culprit lesion precursors in patients with acute coronary syndrome, compared to nonculprit lesions of these patients and to lesions of patients with stable CAD, which may suggest a higher intensity of inflammation. PCAT attenuation on coronary computed tomography angiography may be a novel marker to identify high-risk plaques.
