Title: Identification of recurrent variants implicated in disease in bicuspid aortic valve patients through whole-exome sequencing.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect in human beings, with an estimated prevalence in the general population of between 0.5 and 2%. Moreover, BAV is the most common cause of aortic stenosis in the pediatric population. Patients with BAV may have no symptoms for life, and some of them may progress to aortic stenosis. Genetic factors increase the susceptibility and development of BAV. However, the pathogenesis and BAV are still unclear, and more genetic variants are still needed for elucidating the molecular mechanism and stratification of patients. The present study carried out screening of variants implicated in disease in BAV patients. The whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in 20 BAV patients and identified 40 different heterozygous missense mutations in 36 genes (MIB2, FAAH, S100A1, RGS16, MAP3K19, NEB, TTN, TNS1, CAND2, CCK, KALRN, ATP10D, SLIT3, ROS1, FABP7, NUP205, IL11RA, NPR2, COL5A1, CUBN, JMJD1C, ANXA7, TRIM8, LGR4, TPCN2, APOA5, GPR84, LRP1, NCOR2, AKAP11, ESRRB, NGB, AKAP13, WWOX, KCNJ12, ARHGEF1). The mutations in these genes were identified as recurrent variants implicated in disease by in silico prediction tool analysis. Nine genes (MIB2, S100A1, TTN, CCK, NUP205, LGR4, NCOR2, ESRRB, and WWOX) among the 36 genes were identified as variants implicated in disease via unanimous agreement of in silico prediction tool analysis and sequenced in an independent cohort of 137 BAV patients to validate the results of WES. BAV patients carrying these variants demonstrated reduced left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) (63.8 ± 7.5% vs. 58.4 ± 5.2%, P &lt; 0.001) and larger calcification volume [(1129.3 ± 154) mm3 vs. (1261.8 ± 123) mm3, P &lt; 0.001]. The variants in TTN, NUP205 and NCOR2 genes are significantly associated with reduced LVEF, and the variants in S100A1, LGR4, ESRRB, and WWOX genes are significantly associated with larger calcification volume. We identified a panel of recurrent variants implicated in disease in genes related to the pathogenesis of BAV. Our data speculate that these variants are promising markers for risk stratification of BAV patients with increased susceptibility to aortic stenosis.
