Title: Update on Diagnosis and Management of Kawasaki Disease: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease (KD), an acute self-limited febrile illness that primarily affects children <5 years old, is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in developed countries, with the potential of leading to coronary artery dilation and coronary artery aneurysms in 25% of untreated patients. This update summarizes relevant clinical data published since the 2017 American Heart Association scientific statement on KD related to diagnosis, cardiac imaging in acute KD treatment, and long-term management. Criteria defining North American patients at high risk for developing coronary artery aneurysms who may benefit from more intensive initial treatment have been published. Advances in cardiovascular imaging have improved the ability to identify coronary artery stenosis in patients with KD, yet knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal frequency of serial imaging and the best imaging modality to identify those at risk for inducible myocardial ischemia. Recent data have advanced the understanding of safety and dosing for several anti-inflammatory therapies in KD. New anticoagulation medication, myocardial infarction management, transition of health care for patients with KD, and future directions in research are discussed.
