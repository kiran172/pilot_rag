Title: The Complementary Value of Proximal Isovelocity Surface Area in Large Left-to-Right Lesions With Pulmonary Vein Stenosis.

Abstract: • A continuous antegrade wave is seen in both PVS and large left-to-right shunts. • Color turbulence in pulmonary veins is overlooked in large left-to-right shunts. • PISA can be used to diagnose PVS.
