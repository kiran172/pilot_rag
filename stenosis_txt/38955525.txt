Title: Artificial Intelligence in Spinal Imaging and Patient Care: A Review of Recent Advances.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming spinal imaging and patient care through automated analysis and enhanced decision-making. This review presents a clinical task-based evaluation, highlighting the specific impact of AI techniques on different aspects of spinal imaging and patient care. We first discuss how AI can potentially improve image quality through techniques like denoising or artifact reduction. We then explore how AI enables efficient quantification of anatomical measurements, spinal curvature parameters, vertebral segmentation, and disc grading. This facilitates objective, accurate interpretation and diagnosis. AI models now reliably detect key spinal pathologies, achieving expert-level performance in tasks like identifying fractures, stenosis, infections, and tumors. Beyond diagnosis, AI also assists surgical planning via synthetic computed tomography generation, augmented reality systems, and robotic guidance. Furthermore, AI image analysis combined with clinical data enables personalized predictions to guide treatment decisions, such as forecasting spine surgery outcomes. However, challenges still need to be addressed in implementing AI clinically, including model interpretability, generalizability, and data limitations. Multicenter collaboration using large, diverse datasets is critical to advance the field further. While adoption barriers persist, AI presents a transformative opportunity to revolutionize spinal imaging workflows, empowering clinicians to translate data into actionable insights for improved patient care.
