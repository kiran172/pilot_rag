Title: Does Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis Length and Location Change with Serial Endoscopic Interventions?

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The aim was to assess changes in physical parameters of subglottic stenosis (SGS) following serial endoscopic surgical intervention.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 52 idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) patients undergoing multiple endoscopic (excision/dilation) procedures between 2014 and 2022 was completed. Parameters including proximal stenosis distance from the vocal process and total stenosis length collected intraoperatively were compared over serial treatments. Differences between patient variables affecting distances from the vocal process and mean stenosis length were statistically analyzed utilizing nonparametric estimators including the Mann Whitney U, Fisher exact, and linear regression models.
RESULTS: For the cohort of iSGS patients (N = 52), the mean age was 55.1 (±15.1). The patients were predominantly female (96.2%) and Caucasian (84.6%). Patients underwent an average of 3.4 (±1.3) endoscopic procedures for long-term treatment of iSGS (range: 1 to 5 procedures). Patients undergoing a total of two (2) total procedures within the data collection window demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in mean stenosis length between the first and second procedures (p = 0.014). Changes in distance of the stenosis from the glottis was not found to be statistically significant (p = 0.833). There was a statistically significant decrease in mean length of stenosis from the 1st to the 2nd procedure by approximately 0.11 cm (p = 0.0003). No additional statistically significant differences in stenosis length or location were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Serial endoscopic excision/dilation procedures (the mainstay of iSGS surgical management) do not appear to significantly lengthen intraluminal stenosis nor change the distance of the stenosis from the glottis.
