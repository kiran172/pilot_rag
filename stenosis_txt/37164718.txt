Title: Intestinal hypomotility due to longitudinal enterotomy can be alleviated by transverse closure.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Heineke-Mikulicz (HM) strictureplasty is commonly used to treat short stenoses in Crohn's disease. However, the degree to which intestinal motility is maintained remains unclear. We compared the peristalsis and transport capacity of the sutured intestines with HM configuration and transverse (TS) and longitudinal (LS) incisions.
METHODS: The intestinal diameter, intraluminal pressure, and bead transit time of each sutured group were compared with that of the non-treatment (NT) group in the isolated proximal colon of rats. Propulsive contractions were induced using hydroxy-?-sanshool (HAS), a constituent of Japanese pepper.
RESULTS: There was no change in the intestinal diameter between HM, TS, and NT groups ; however, it was significantly narrowed at the suture site and its distal side in the LS group. After HAS administration, the intestinal diameter at the suture site in the HM group was higher than that in the LS group. The intraluminal pressure was higher and the transit time was shorter in the HM group compared to those in the LS group.
CONCLUSIONS: The HM configuration, which widens the incision site and distal diameter and shortens the cut surface of the circular muscle in the longitudinal direction, may help maintain basal and HAS-induced intestinal peristalsis and motility. J. Med. Invest. 70 : 180-188, February, 2023.
