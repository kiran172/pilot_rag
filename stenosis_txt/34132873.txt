Title: DEtection of ProxImal Coronary stenosis in the work-up for Transcatheter aortic valve implantation using CTA (from the DEPICT CTA collaboration).

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is performed routinely in the work-up for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and could potentially replace invasive coronary angiography (ICA) to rule out left main (LM) and proximal coronary stenosis. The objectives were to assess the diagnostic yield and accuracy of pre-TAVI CTA to detect LM and proximal coronary stenosis of ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% diameter stenosis (DS).
METHODS: The DEPICT CTA database consists of individual patient data from four studies with a retrospective design that analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of pre-TAVI CTA to detect coronary stenosis, as compared with ICA. Pooled data were used to assess diagnostic accuracy to detect coronary stenosis in the left main and the three proximal coronary segments on a per-patient and a per-segment level. We included 1060 patients (mean age: 81.5 years, 42.7% male).
RESULTS: On ICA, the prevalence of proximal stenosis was 29.0% (≥ 50% DS) and 15.7% (≥ 70% DS). Pre-TAVI CTA ruled out ≥ 50% DS in 51.6% of patients with a sensitivity of 96.4%, specificity of 71.2%, PPV of 57.7%, and NPV of 98.0%. For ≥ 70% DS, pre-TAVI CTA ruled out stenosis in 70.0% of patients with a sensitivity of 96.7%, specificity of 87.5%, PPV of 66.9%, and NPV of 99.0%.
CONCLUSION: CTA provides high diagnostic accuracy to rule out LM and proximal coronary stenosis in patients undergoing work-up for TAVI. Clinical application of CTA as a gatekeeper for ICA would reduce the need for ICA in 52% or 70% of patients, using a threshold of ≥ 50% or ≥ 70% DS, respectively.
KEY POINTS: • Clinical application of CTA as a gatekeeper for ICA would reduce the need for ICA in 52% or 70% of TAVI patients, using a threshold of ≥ 50% or ≥ 70% diameter stenosis. • The diagnostic accuracy of CTA to exclude proximal coronary stenosis in these patients is high, with a sensitivity of 96.4% and NPV of 98.0% for a threshold of ≥ 50%, and a sensitivity of 96.7% and NPV of 99.0% for a threshold of ≥ 70% diameter stenosis. • Atrial fibrillation and heart rate did not significantly affect sensitivity and NPV. However, a heart rate of < 70 b/min during CTA was associated with a significantly improved specificity and PPV.
