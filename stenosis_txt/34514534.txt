Title: First Clinical Results of the Merit WRAPSODY™ Cell-Impermeable Endoprosthesis for Treatment of Access Circuit Stenosis in Haemodialysis Patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This prospective, observational first in human study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of WRAPSODYTM Cell-impermeable Endoprosthesis (Merit Medical Systems, Inc.) in the treatment of arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous graft access circuit stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Investigators conducted a prospective analysis of 46 patients with access circuit stenosis from three centres. Treatment sites included the peripheral outflow veins (e.g. cephalic arch, basilic vein swing point; 16 fistula and 10 graft patients); the graft-vein anastomosis (9 patients); and the central veins (up to, but not including the SVC; 11 patients). Primary outcome measures included 30-day freedom from access circuit-related safety events and 30-day target lesion primary patency. Secondary outcome measures included procedural success; device- and procedure-related adverse events; target lesion primary patency; access circuit primary patency; and secondary patency. In-person follow-up was scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. An independent data monitoring/clinical event committee adjudicated all reinterventions and device/procedure-relatedness for adverse events.
RESULTS: All initial procedures were successful. All but one patient was free from safety events through the first 30 days (97.8% (45/46)). This event was not device-related. Over the remainder of the study, one adverse event was adjudicated as possibly device-related. Six- and 12-month target lesion primary patency rates were 97.7% (42/43) and 84.6.% (33/39), respectively. Six- and 12-month access circuit primary patency rates were 84.4% (38/45) and 65.9% (29/44), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the study device is safe and effective for treatment of stenoses in the peripheral and central veins of arteriovenous access circuits.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2b, cohort study.
