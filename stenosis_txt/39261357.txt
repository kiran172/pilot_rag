Title: A calcification subtraction method for postmortem coronary computed tomography angiography.

Abstract: Although coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography is a useful tool for evaluating coronary artery lesions both ante- and postmortem, accurate evaluation of the lumen is difficult when highly calcified lesions are present, owing to overestimation of stenosis caused by blooming and partial volume artifacts. In clinical practice, to overcome this diagnostic problem, a subtraction method has been devised to remove calcification by subtracting the precontrast image from the contrast image. In this report, we describe a calcification subtraction method using image analysis software for postmortem coronary CT angiography. This method was devised based on preliminary experimental results showing that the most accurate subtraction was achieved using images reconstructed with a narrower field of view and bone kernel, resulting in higher spatial resolution. This subtraction method allowed evaluation of lumen patency and the degree of stenosis on contrast-enhanced images in a verification using actual specimens where evaluation of the lumen had been difficult because of high calcification. The results were morphologically similar to the macroscopic findings. This method allows more rapid and reliable lesion retrieval and is expected to be useful for postmortem coronary angiography in forensic practice.
