Title: Relationship between mild renal dysfunction and coronary artery disease in young patients with stable angina pectoris.

Abstract: Aim: We investigated the relationship between mild renal dysfunction (MRD) and the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in people under 60 years of age. Materials &amp; methods: A total of 634 (317 patients with vessel stenosis ≥50% and 317 with normal angiography) individuals diagnosed with stable angina pectoris and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 were included in the present study. Results: The mean eGFR was lower (95.3 ± 23.7 vs 109.7 ± 22.3, respectively, p = 0.002) and the number of patients with MRD was higher in patients with CAD (137, 43.2%) than in the control group (52, 16.4%, p &lt; 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that lower eGFR is an independent risk factor for presence of CAD in people under 60 years of age with stable angina pectoris. Conclusion: According to our retrospective study, the risk of developing CAD appears to be slightly increased in individuals under 60 years of age with MRD.
