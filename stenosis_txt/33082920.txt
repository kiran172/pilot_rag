Title: Improvements in Cervical Spinal Canal Diameter and Neck Disability Following Correction of Cervical Lordosis and Cervical Spondylolistheses Using Chiropractic BioPhysics Technique: A Case Series.

Abstract: Cervical spondylolisthesis indicates instability of the spine and can lead to pain, radiculopathy, myelopathy and vertebral artery stenosis. Currently degenerative cervical spondylolisthesis is a wait-and-watch condition with no treatment guidelines. A literature review and discussion will be provided. 8 females presented with neck pain, disability, and history of motor vehicle collision. Radiographs revealed abnormal cervical alignment, spinal canal narrowing, and spondylolistheses. After 30 sessions of Chiropractic BioPhysicsÂ® care over 12 weeks, patients reported improved symptoms and disabilities. Radiographs revealed improvements in cervical alignment, spondylolistheses, and spinal canal diameter. Motor vehicle collision may cause instability and abnormal alignment of the cervical spine leading to cervical spondylolisthesis. Improving spinal alignment may be an effective treatment to reduce vertebral subluxation and cervical spondylolistheses and improve neck disability as a result of improved spinal alignment.
