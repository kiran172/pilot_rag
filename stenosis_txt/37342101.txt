Title: Dural sinus narrowing in patients with spontaneous anterior skull base cerebrospinal fluid leak.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Current evidence suggests a link between idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (sCSF) leak, as well as between IIH and dural venous sinus (DVS) narrowing. However, there are limited data linking DVS narrowing and sCSF leak. This study aims to determine the prevalence of DVS narrowing in patients with sCSF leak.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients with sCSF leak that presented to a tertiary academic center from 2008 to 2019. Preoperative imaging was independently reviewed by two neuroradiologists to evaluate for DVS narrowing. Available literature was used to estimate the prevalence of DVS narrowing in the general population to allow for comparison. Data were analyzed using Exact binomial test.
RESULTS: Analysis of 25 patients with appropriate imaging revealed the majority were women (21/25, 84%) with a mean age of 51.89 years (SD 13.96). The majority of these patients were found to have narrowing of the DVS (20/25, 80%). In patient with sCSF leaks, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients with DVS narrowing compared with published literature examining this condition in the general population (80% vs. 40%, CI 0.59-0.93, p &lt; .001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of DVS narrowing in patients with sCSF leaks is substantial and likely greater than the general population. Moreover, there appears to be narrowing in most patients with sCSF leak. Preoperative radiological evaluation of the DVS using MR venography may be useful in patients with sCSF leaks as DVS stenosis may be an underdiagnosed etiology. Further study is needed to evaluate this.
