Title: A rare coexistence: Hammock mitral valve and aortopulmonary window.

Abstract: Congenital mitral stenosis is a broad-spectrum pathology in which blood flow to the left ventricle is obstructed both functionally and anatomically. Hammock mitral valve, also known as anomalous mitral arcade, is a rare congenital anomaly particularly in infants and children. Hammock mitral valve may not be suitable for repair regarding the advanced dysplastic mitral valve structure. Aortopulmonary window is an unusual cardiac anomaly which is defined as a communication between the main pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta. As a result of the excessive left-to-right shunt, early intervention and surgical closure deemed mandatory to avoid development of severe pulmonary hypertension and its consequences. All patients with an aortopulmonary window necessitates prompt repair immediately. In this brief report, mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve and repair of aortopulmonary window with a Dacron patch were performed simultaneously in a 5-month-old patient with a hammock mitral valve and accompanying aortopulmonary window.
