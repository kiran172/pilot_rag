Title: Efficacy and Safety of an Upfront RotaTripsy Strategy in the Treatment of De Novo and In-Stent Restenosis Cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Use of both rotational atherectomy (RA) and intravascular lithotripsy (IVL)-the "RotaTripsy" technique-offers a potentially synergistic calcium-modification strategy that can treat both luminal and abluminal calcification. An upfront RotaTripsy strategy using an undersized burr in large-caliber coronaries also offers the advantage of facilitating IVL catheter passage while being able to undertake the procedure with a 6-Fr system.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with heavily calcified lesions on angiographic or intravascular imaging and large target-vessel caliber (≥3 mm) who underwent an upfront RA followed by IVL between July 2021 and January 2022 were included in this study. Study aims were to evaluate periprocedural efficacy and safety.
RESULTS: Of the 21 patients included, RotaTripsy was used for treatment of de novo lesions in 12 patients (57%) and for in-stent-restenosis in 9 patients (43%). Seven cases of in-stent restenosis (ISR) involved 2 layers of stents. Mean reference vessel diameter was 3.67 ± 0.46 mm and baseline diameter stenosis was 77.4 ± 11.3%. Average RA burr-to-artery ratio was 0.43 ± 0.05 and IVL balloon-to-artery ratio was 0.93 ± 0.06, with IVL balloon crossing the lesion in all cases following RA. Procedural success was attained in 20 of 21 cases; 1 periprocedural complication (a death related to coronary perforation following stent postdilation) was recorded.
CONCLUSIONS: An upfront RotaTripsy strategy is associated with a high degree of procedural success in de novo lesions and ISR cases by facilitating the use of a smaller burr-to-artery ratio and smaller-bore vascular access. Larger studies are required to further evaluate the potential benefits of an upfront RotaTripsy strategy from a safety and cost-benefit perspective.
