Title: Changes of plasma Rap1A levels in patients with in-stent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention and the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is one of the most important treatments for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, in-stent restenosis (ISR) after PCI is a serious complication without effective measures for prevention and treatment. This study aims to investigate the Ras-related protein 1A (Rap1A) level in ISR patients and in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced inflammatory injury model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), to explore the role of Rap1A in regulating TNF-α-induced inflammation in HUVECs and to provide a new potential target for ISR prevention and treatment.
METHODS: A total of 60 CAD patients, who underwent PCI between December 2020 and July 2022 from the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and re-examined coronary angiography (CAG) 1 year after the operation, were included. After admission, 27 patients were diagnosed with ISR and 33 patients were diagnosed with non-in-stent restenosis (non-ISR) according to the CAG. Clinical data were collected, and the plasma Rap1A level was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In cell experiments, an inflammatory injury model was established with TNF-α treatment (10 ng/mL, 24 h) in HUVECs. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Rap1A, interlukin-6 (IL-6), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were measured by real-time reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to explore the role of Rap1A in regulating TNF-α-induced inflammation in HUVECs.
RESULTS: Compared with the non-ISR patients, a higher proportion of ISR patients had a history of smoking (P=0.005) and diabetes (P=0.028), and higher levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (P=0.012), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (P=0.014), and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (P=0.027). The remaining projects did not show significant differences (all P&gt;0.05). The plasma level of Rap1A in the ISR group was significantly higher than that in the non-ISR group [942.14 (873.28 to 1 133.81) μg/mL vs 886.93 (812.61 to 930.98) μg/mL; P=0.004]. Diabetes, LDL-c, and Rap1A were risk factors for ISR by univariate logistic regression analysis (all P&lt;0.05). The mRNA and protein expression levels of inflammatory factors IL-6 and VCAM-1 were increased in HUVECs after 10 ng/mL TNF-α treatment for 24 h compared with the control group (all P&lt;0.05), while the mRNA and protein levels of Rap1A were increased (both P&lt;0.05). After inhibition of Rap1A in HUVECs, the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-6 and VCAM-1 were significantly decreased (all P&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The plasma Rap1A level was significantly elevated in patients with ISR, suggesting that Rap1A may be a potential biomarker for predicting ISR. In the TNF-α- induced HUVECs inflammatory injury model, the expression level of Rap1A was increased. The level of TNF-α-induced endothelial cell inflammation was decreased after inhibition of Rap1A expression, suggesting that Rap1A may be a potential target for the treatment of endothelial cell inflammation in ISR.
