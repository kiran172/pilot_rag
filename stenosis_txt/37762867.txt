Title: A Novel Frailty Score Based on Laboratory Parameters (FIMS Score) for the Management of Older Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: This study aimed to develop a novel score based on common laboratory parameters able to identify frail and sarcopenic patients as well as predict mortality in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) for tailored clinical decision-making. A total of 109 patients (83 ± 5 years; females, 68%) with AS underwent a multidisciplinary pre-operative assessment and finalized a "frailty-based management" for the AS interventional treatment. Laboratory parameters of statistically significant differences between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic individuals were tested in the structural equation model (SEM) to build a Frailty Inflammation Malnutrition and Sarcopenia score (FIMS score). Mortality at 20 months of follow-up was considered an outcome. FIMS score, in particular, the cut-off value ≥ 1.28 was able to identify "frail" and "early frail" patients and predict mortality with a sensitivity of 83.3% and 82.6%, respectively (p = 0.001) and was an independent determinant associated with a higher risk of mortality (HR 5.382; p-value = 0.002). The FIMS score, easily achievable and usable in clinical practice, was able to identify frail and sarcopenic patients as well as predict their adverse clinical outcomes. This score could provide appropriate guidance during decision-making regarding elderly patients with severe AS.
