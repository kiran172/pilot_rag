Title: Causes, Diagnosis, Risk Stratification and Treatment of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease: An Updated Review.

Abstract: The most common congenital heart disease is the bicuspid aortic valve. Understanding the pathophysiology and the altered hemodynamics is a key component for the diagnosis, risk stratification and treatment. Among others, aortic valve stenosis is the most common complication. Treatment strategies vary depending on the severity of the disease, particularly the dilation of the aorta playing a major role. Together with valve replacement, transcatheter aortic valve implantation is now considered as an alternative option with good results. With this review we would like to discuss the causes, diagnostic methods, risk stratification and treatment strategies of the bicuspid aortic valve.
