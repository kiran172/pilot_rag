Title: Anesthetic Management of a Patient With Subglottic Stenosis: The Crucial Role of Communication Between Teams.

Abstract: Subglottic stenosis is characterized by the narrowing of the airway at the inferior edge of the cricoid cartilage level. It is either congenital or acquired, the latter being more commonly secondary to internal iatrogenic trauma. Airway management of these cases is challenging and requires multidisciplinary discussion. We present a case of a 17-year-old boy scheduled for tracheostomy in the context of subglottic stenosis probably caused by prolonged endotracheal intubation. On the day of surgery, it was decided to perform an asleep fiberoptic visualization of the lesion through a supraglottic device, which revealed a narrow circumferential fibrous membrane just below the vocal cords. Given the findings, a suspension laryngoscopy accompanied by supraglottic manual jet ventilation was performed. Balloon dilatation with the application of mitomycin C was the elected otorhinolaryngologic technique. At the end of the procedure, a fiberoptic exam was performed and only a minimal portion of the membrane remained. The patient was asymptomatic on follow-up visits. We aim to raise awareness of how the anesthetic management of patients with subglottic stenosis may prove challenging. Communication between anesthetic and surgical teams is essential for the achievement of the main goal, which is the acquisition of an adequate airway that allows normal patient activity associated with minimal postoperative morbidity.
