Title: Anterior cervical discectomy fusion versus posterior decompression and fusion in octogenarians with cervical myelopathy: Clinical outcomes and complications with a 3-year follow-up.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cervical stenosis and concurrent Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM) are prevalent in the elderly. Treatment options include Anterior Cervical Discectomy Fusion (ACDF) and Posterior Decompression and Fusion (PDF).
RESEARCH QUESTION: This study aims to compare clinical outcomes and complications between ACDF and PDF in patients aged 80 and above.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from electronic medical records between 2005 and 2021Â at a single institution were analyzed. Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to explore risk factors and the relationship between comorbidities and neurological conditions.
RESULTS: 21 patients with ACDF and 26 with PDF were studied over 16 years. PDF patients had more operated levels, higher blood loss, and longer hospital stays, but mortality rates and mJOA improvements were similar in both groups. The presence of comorbidities was a unique risk factor for postoperative complications.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: ACDF and PDF led to neurological improvements in elderly CSM patients. However, the decision of surgical procedure should carefully consider the potential for postoperative complications, particularly in patients with comorbidities.
