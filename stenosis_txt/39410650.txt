Title: Angioinvasive Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis in a Patient with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Complex and Lethal Cause of Stroke.

Abstract: Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is a rapidly progressive and often fatal fungal infection caused by molds of the order Mucorales, particularly affecting immunocompromised individuals. This infection is notorious for its angioinvasive properties, enabling the fungi to invade blood vessels and leading to tissue necrosis. We report the clinical course of a 59-year-old Caucasian man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 16.8%) who presented with unilateral headache, left-sided facial numbness, and incomplete left ocular motor paresis. Initial presentation raised suspicion of orbital phlegmon, leading to antibiotic and later corticosteroid pulse therapy, which worsened the patient's condition. Subsequent imaging demonstrated extensive inflammatory changes, including wall irregularities of the left intracranial internal carotid artery, accompanied by ocular protrusion and periorbital enhancement. New palatal lesions indicated mucormycosis, which was confirmed by molecular analysis of a palatal biopsy, leading to Amphotericin B treatment. Pre-surgery imaging revealed a malignant middle cerebral artery infarction, and the patient died 16 days after symptom onset and 12 days after initial presentation under palliative care due to a poor prognosis. This case of angioinvasive mucormycosis underscores the severe and often fatal course of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis in an immunocompromised individual. The rapid progression from initially vague and unspecific symptoms to extensive vascular involvement and stroke highlights the critical need for early and accurate diagnosis, as well as prompt intervention to prevent further disease progression. Additionally, this case also illustrates the potential risks associated with corticosteroid therapy in the presence of undiagnosed fungal infections, which can exacerbate the condition and lead to serious complications. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for mucormycosis in similar clinical scenarios, prioritizing adequate antifungal treatment and careful monitoring to improve patient outcomes. Early interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for the effective management of such complex cases.
