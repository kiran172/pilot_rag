Title: Application of endoscopic submucosal dissection in duodenal space-occupying lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been advocated by digestive endoscopists because of its comparable therapeutic effect to surgery, reduced trauma, faster recovery, and fewer complications. However, ESD for lesions of the duodenum is more challenging than those occurring at other levels of the gastrointestinal tract due to the thin intestinal wall of the duodenum, narrow intestinal space, rich peripheral blood flow, proximity to vital organs, and high risks of critical adverse events including intraoperative and delayed bleeding and perforation. Because of the low prevalence of the disease and the high risks of severe adverse events, successful ESD for lesions of the duodenum has rarely been reported in recent years.
AIM: To investigate the efficacy and safety of ESD in the treatment of duodenal space-occupying lesions.
METHODS: Clinical data of 24 cases of duodenal lesions treated by ESD at the Digestive Endoscopy Center of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from January 2016 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: All of the 24 cases from 23 patients underwent ESD treatment for duodenal space-occupying lesions under general anesthesia, including 15 male and 8 female patients, with a mean age of 58.5Â (32.0-74.0) years. There were 12 lesions (50%) in the duodenal bulb, 9 (37.5%) in the descending part, and 3 (12.5%) in the ball-descending junction. The mean diameter of the lesion was 12.75 (range, 11-22) mm. Thirteen lesions originated from the mucosa, of which 4 were low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, 3 were hyperplastic polyps, 2 were chronic mucositis, 2 were adenomatous hyperplasia, 1 was high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and 1 was tubular adenoma. Eleven lesions were in the submucosa, including 5 neuroendocrine neoplasms, 2 cases of ectopic pancreas, 1 stromal tumor, 1 leiomyoma, 1 submucosal duodenal adenoma, and 1 case of submucosal lymph follicular hyperplasia. The intraoperative perforation rate was 20.8% (5/24), including 4 submucosal protuberant lesions and 1 depressed lesion. The mean length of hospital stay was 5.7 (range, 3-10) d, and the average follow-up time was 25.8 (range, 3.0-50.0) mo. No residual disease or recurrence was found in all patients, and no complications, such as infection and stenosis, were found during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: ESD is safe and effective in the treatment of duodenal lesions; however, the endoscopists should pay more attention to the preoperative preparation, intraoperative skills, and postoperative treatment.
