Title: Massive Calcification of the Ascending Aorta Secondary to Irradiation for Hodgkin's Disease Decades Earlier in Association with Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Described herein are findings in 2 men who developed massively calcified non-dilated ascending aortas decades after receiving mediastinal irradiation for treatment of Hodgkin's disease associated with aortic valve stenosis. The quantity of the intimal aortic calcium was remarkable and much greater than in other aortic conditions. The ascending aorta had to be excised in one patient in order to replace the stenotic aortic valve. The other patient underwent percutaneous transluminal aortic valve implantation.
