Title: Unplanned Hospital Readmissions After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Era of New-Generation Devices.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Unplanned hospital readmissions after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are frequent and have been associated with a poor prognosis. We sought to determine the trends in the incidence and causes of unplanned hospital readmission after TAVR in patients receiving new-generation devices (NGDs) vs early-generation devices (EGDs).
METHODS: The study population consisted of 1802 consecutive TAVR recipients (863 EGDs and 939 NGDs). Early and late readmissions were defined as those occurring â‰¤30 days and >30 days to 1-year post TAVR, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 986 unplanned hospital readmissions (cardiac cause, 38.4%; non-cardiac cause, 61.6%) were recorded at a median time of 110 days (interquartile range [IQR], 37-217) post TAVR. The rates of early (12.3% vs 9.4%; P=.046) and late (39.1% vs 31.6%; P<.01) readmission were lower in the NGD population. In the NGD group, major/life-threatening periprocedural bleeding (hazard ratio [HR], 2.40, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-5.42; P=.04) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min at hospital discharge (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.15-2.83; P=.01) were associated with an increased risk of early readmission post TAVR. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07-1.88; P=.02), eGFR <60 mL/min (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.11-1.84; P<.01), and combining antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.85; P=.04) determined an increased risk of late readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR recipients receiving NGDs exhibited a significant but modest reduction in unplanned hospital readmissions, with about one-third of patients still requiring rehospitalization at 1-year follow-up in the contemporary TAVR era. Non-cardiac comorbidities, periprocedural bleeding events, and intensive antithrombotic therapy determined an increased risk.
