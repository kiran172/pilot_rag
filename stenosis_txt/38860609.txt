Title: A novel method to manage a dislodged self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve.

Abstract: Despite advancements in technology, operator experience, and procedural planning, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures are complex, and complications remain inevitable. Valve embolization may prove to be fatal and conventional rescue techniques are dependent on the anatomy of the aorta. We describe a case of postimplant embolization of a self-expanding valve during valve-in-valve application where the valve could not be stabilized due to the anatomy of the aorta and a novel technique was utilized to stabilize the valve in the aortic arch using a wire fixed to the left axillary artery.
