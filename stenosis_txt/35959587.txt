Title: [Cochlear nerve canal stenosis: a review of recent research].

Abstract: Some patients with severe-profound sensorineural hearing loss （SNHL） with normal cochlear anatomical structure received cochlear implantation （CI） and the hearing and speech rehabilitation effect was not ideal. Through retrospective analysis, it was found that some of these patients had cochlear never canal （CNC） stenosis, or atresia in severe cases.This article reviews the development of the CNC, the diagnostic criteria of CNC stenosis and the results of hearing and speech rehabilitation in these patients after CI.
