Title: Mitral facies-a classic feature of chronic mitral stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Mitral facies is a classical feature of chronic mitral stenosis (MS) that commonly associated with low cardiac output and pulmonary hypertension. A 44-year-old woman presented with 10-year history of refractory right heart failure. We noted distinctive malar rash appearance on her face known as "mitral facies." An echocardiogram revealed severe MS and other significant valve involvement with typical characteristics of rheumatic valvular heart disease. Doppler measurement showed decreased cardiac output and severe pulmonary hypertension in this patient. The mitral facies could be an alarming sign of a more severe and advanced form of MS. It also can be a marker of impaired cardiac output and concomitant severe pulmonary hypertension.
