Title: "Dual Internal Shunts Technique" for Carotid Endarterectomy with Carotid Vertebral Anastomosis: Technical Note.

Abstract: In revascularization of internal carotid stenosis with carotid vertebrobasilar anastomoses, attention should be paid not only to the anterior circulation but also to the posterior circulation cerebral infarction. A 74-year-old man was referred for treatment of carotid artery stenosis; NASCET 75% stenosis in the right internal carotid artery and acute cerebral infarction were confirmed. Occlusion of the left subclavian artery and vascular anastomosis between the right external carotid artery and the vertebral artery were indicated, such that the right external carotid artery may maintain blood flow to the vertebrobasilar artery. Therefore, dual shunts were used for the common and internal carotid arteries and the common and external carotid arteries to maintain blood flow during carotid endarterectomy. Management of the dual shunts is difficult due to the instable parallel placement of the common carotid artery shunt balloons. To solve this problem, the "dual internal shunts technique" was performed. The first shunt was inserted into the external and common carotid arteries, and the second into the internal and common carotid arteries. The shunt balloon on the common carotid artery side was placed distal to the first shunt balloon so that the dual balloons were placed in a tandem position. The proximal balloon was subsequently deflated gradually to improve flow in both shunts. The procedure is technically easy and safe.
