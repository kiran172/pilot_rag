Title: And don't forget your anti in-stent stenosis pill! Commentary on 'Factors associated with in-stent stenosis after cerebral aneurysm embolization using a Pipeline embolization device' by Flores-Milan et al.

Abstract: In their INR study, Flores-Milan et al. present a retrospective single-centre study that aimed to investigate and determine some of the factors associated with in-stent stenosis (ISS) after intracranial aneurysm (IA) embolization using a commercially available flow diverter stent (FD). The retrospective analyses included ruptured and unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with standalone flow diverter stent implantation or initial coil obliteration with the FD device placed subsequently two weeks after initial treatment. The article's methodology was carefully tailored to demystify the unknown pathophysiological mechanism behind the entity of interest called in-stent stenosis. Study outcomes also included angiographic evaluation of aneurysm occlusion thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The authors reported excellent technical and clinical results altogether. The achieved angiographic occlusion rates resonate with the current obliteration results reported in the literature. Mortality and morbidity are congruent with previously published results and were 5.3% and 1.1%, respectively.
