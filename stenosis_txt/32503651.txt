Title: Clinical application and observation of single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for radical esophagectomy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transthoracic esophagectomy is a crucial independent risk factor for the incidence of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications in elderly or comorbid patients. To reduce postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and promote postoperative recovery. We made an attempt to adopt the single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for radical esophagectomy in esophageal cancer to observe the clinical application and effect.
METHOD: Data of patients with esophageal carcinoma were collected in the Hebei General Hospital from May 2018 to November 2019. The operation time, surgical blood loss, the number of dissected lymph nodes, duration of drainage tube, duration of time on the ventilator, the length of stay in ICU, postoperative complications, the length of postoperative hospital stay were collected to assess the safety and feasibility of the single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for radical esophagectomy in esophageal cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 22 patients with esophageal cancer were analyzed in our research. There were no cases of conversion to thoracotomy、perioperative death or postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. The average operation time of all enrolled patients was 4.26 ± 0.52 h、The surgical blood loss was 142 ± 36.50 ml、The amount of dissected lymph nodes were 21.6 ± 4.2、The duration of drainage tube was 5.8 ± 2.5 days、The duration of time on the ventilator was 6.5 ± 3.4 h、The length of stay in ICU was 1.2 ± 0.4 days、The postoperative hospital stay was 12.6 ± 2.5 days. Among all the enrolled patients, one patient (4.5%) developed anastomotic fistula on the third day after surgery. Anastomotic stricture was found in 5 patients (22.7%). Pleural effusion was found in 4 cases (18.2%). Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury caused hoarseness or cough after drinking water in 3 cases (13.6%).There was one patient (4.5%) of conversion to laparotomy as the patient had serious peritoneal adhesion. All of the patients were discharged successfully.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that this surgery of single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy combined with laparoscopy for radical esophagectomy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is safe and feasible. The feasibility and safety could be further and better investigated with a RCT to achieve more conclusive results.
