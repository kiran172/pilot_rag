Title: Long-term outcome of bicuspid aortic valve disease.

Abstract: AIMS: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital condition that is frequently associated with aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR), as well as aortic aneurysms, but specific outcome data are scarce. The present study sought to assess outcomes in a large cohort of consecutive patients with BAV.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 581 consecutive patients (median age 29 years, 157 female) with BAV were included in the study and followed prospectively in a heart valve clinic follow-up programme. The overall survival rate after 10 years was 94.5%. During follow-up, 158 patients developed an indication for surgery. Event-free survival rates were 97%, 94%, 87%, and 73% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, event rates were independently predicted by AS [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 2.3 per degree of severity], AR (SHR 1.5 per degree of severity), baseline aortic dilatation ≥ 40 mm (SHR 1.9), and age (SHR 1.3) (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: BAV disease is associated with a high rate of cardiac events, but state-of-the-art care results in good survival with low rates of infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, and sudden death. Incremental degrees of AS and regurgitation, the presence of aortic dilatation, and age are predictive of cardiac events.
