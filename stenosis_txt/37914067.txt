Title: Neddylation in the chronically hypoperfused corpus callosum: MLN4924 reduces blood-brain barrier injury via ERK5/KLF2 signaling.

Abstract: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and cerebrovascular dysfunction may contribute to the pathology in white matter lesions and consequent cognitive decline caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. Neddylation is the process of attaching a ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8 (neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8) to specific targets. By modifying protein substrates, neddylation plays critical roles in various important biological processes. However, whether neddylation influences the pathogenesis of hypoperfused brain remains unclear. In the present study, cerebral hypoperfusion-induced white matter lesions were produced by bilateral common carotid artery stenosis in mice. The function of the neddylation pathway, BBB integrity, cerebrovascular dysfunction, myelin density in the corpus callosum and cognitive function were determined. We show that NEDD8 conjugation aberrantly amplified in microvascular endothelium in the corpus callosum following cerebral hypoperfusion. MLN4924, a small-molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme currently in clinical trials, preserved BBB integrity, attenuated glial activation and enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation, and reduced hypoperfusion-induced white matter lesions in the corpus callosum and thus improved cognitive performance via inactivating cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL). Administration of MLN4924 caused the accumulation of ERK5 and KLF2. The ERK5 inhibitor BIX 02189, down-regulated MLN4924-induced activation of KLF2 and reversed MLN4924-mediated increase in pericyte coverage and junctional proteins. Furthermore, BIX 02189 blocked MLN4924-afforded protection against BBB disruption and white matter lesions in the corpus callosum. Collectively, our results revealed that neddylation impairs vascular function and thus exacerbated the pathology of hypoperfused brain and that inhibition of neddylation with MLN4924 may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for cerebral hypoperfusion-associated cognitive impairment.
