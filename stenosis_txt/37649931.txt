Title: Isolated Dextrocardia With Situs Solitus Diagnosed in a Centenarian Patient: A Case Report.

Abstract: This case report presents a rare instance of dextrocardia with situs solitus in a centenarian patient, where the heart is abnormally positioned on the right side of the chest due to embryological development anomalies. The patient, a 102-year-old male with no significant medical history, sought medical attention for cataract surgery and was incidentally found to have a systolic murmur over the left upper sternal border, prompting further evaluation. Echocardiographic assessments revealed moderate aortic stenosis. Further imaging with an upright chest X-ray confirmed the presence of dextrocardia with situs solitus. This intriguing case exemplifies the complexities of diagnosing rare congenital anomalies and underscores the importance of comprehensive evaluations even in elderly patients.
