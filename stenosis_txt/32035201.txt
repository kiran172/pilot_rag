Title: Development of Primary Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Around an Internal Fixation Implant After Lumbar Fusion Surgery: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most commonly diagnosed primary non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the spine and can induce spinal compression. Reports of lymphoma arising in bone adjacent to metallic prostheses are increasing. However, to our knowledge, DLBCL arising from a scar after lumbar fusion surgery has not been reported previously.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man complained of a 2-month history of severe pain in the back and both legs, radiating down to the ankle, similar to sciatica with a past history of L2-S1 decompression and fusion 7 years ago. Imaging revealed an irregular mass in the epidural space and around the internal fixation surgical site, which was initially diagnosed as an epidural infectious abscess. Most of the lesion was completely excised and a detailed immunohistopathologic analysis was performed revealing the diagnosis of a DLBCL. After surgery and chemotherapy, he was discharged without complications. Unfortunately, he died 2 years later because of brain metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need to consider malignancy in the differential diagnosis and carefully examine surgical specimens in revision surgery. Further understanding of the role of metal implants in the development of lymphoma is required.
