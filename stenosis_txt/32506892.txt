Title: Management of Post-Transplant Anastomotic Stricture Using Self-Expandable Metal Stent.

Abstract: Anastomotic stricture (AS) is one of the complications of liver transplantation (LT) and can occur in up to 40% of living-donor LTs. Endoscopic management has become the first-line treatment of AS, and multiple plastic stents insertion has been mainly used in the past. Recently, many treatments utilizing fully covered self-expandable metal stents (cSEMSs) have been attempted, and results showing adequate treatment outcome have been reported. In this review, we look into the treatment performance and cautionary steps needed when using cSEMS as a treatment for AS.
