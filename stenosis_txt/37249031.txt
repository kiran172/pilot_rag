Title: Effect of anterior communicating artery patency on the flow velocity in bilateral carotid artery stenosis after carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effect of anterior communicating artery (ACoA) patency on the flow velocity of the extracranial carotid arteries is unclear.
METHODS: A total of 285 patients with carotid artery stenosis were included between January 2019 and January 2021. All patients received unilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The patients were classified into ACoA-patent (161) and ACoA-nonpatent (124) groups using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and/or computed tomography angiography (CTA). The peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) measured by carotid duplex ultrasonography (CDU) were compared between both groups, pre- and post-CEA.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the risk factors for cerebrovascular disease between the two groups. Within 1 week after CEA, the PSV and EDV on operative and nonoperative carotid (contralateral carotid in the same patient) arteries decreased significantly (both p &lt; 0.01). Comparison of nonoperative carotid artery pre- and post-CEA between the two groups showed that post-CEA PSV and EDV in the ACoA-patent group were significantly lower than that of pre-CEA (PSV and EDV, t = 11.507 and 6.716, respectively, both p &lt; 0.001) (according to the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Conference [SRUCC] PSV standard). There was no significant difference in the ACoA-nonpatent group (PSV: t = 1.924, p = 0.057; EDV: t = 1.237, p = 0.218). In the nonoperative carotid artery of the ACoA-patent group, the degree of stenosis assessed by CDU was inconsistent with that of DSA/CTA (κ = 0.294), whereas that in the ACoA-nonpatent group had a high consistency (κ = 0.982). Among 161 ACoA-patent cases, 68 showed overestimated stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The patent ACoA increases PSV and EDV, causing an overestimation of carotid artery stenosis.
