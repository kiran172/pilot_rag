Title: Simulation analysis of different types of balloon dilatation catheters for the treatment of intracranial arterial stenosis.

Abstract: The application of balloon dilation catheters in the management of intracranial arterial stenosis has been gradually increasing. However, studies on the feasibility and effectiveness of different types of balloons remain relatively scarce. In this study, catheter models of three different materials were designed to simulate balloon crimping,splitting, and dilatation processes. A compliant balloon produces large deformations with poor dilatation and a stress concentration phenomenon. During dilatation, the shear stress generated in the intima and lesion area by the semi-compliant balloon was smaller than that generated by the non-compliant balloon. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using semi-compatible balloons.
