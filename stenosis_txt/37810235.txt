Title: Age-associated spinal stenosis in the turquoise killifish.

Abstract: Aging triggers spinal degeneration, including common spinal stenosis, which causes back and leg pain in older individuals, significantly impacting their quality of life. Here, we explored aging traits in turquoise killifish spines, potentially offering a model for age-linked spinal stenosis in humans. Aged turquoise killifish exhibited body shape deformation and increased vertebral collapse, which was further accelerated by spawning. High-resolution CT scans revealed suppressed cortical bone thickness and hemal arch area in vertebrae due to spawning, and osteophyte formation was observed in both aged and breeding fish populations. Scale mineralization mirrored these changes, increasing with age but being suppressed by spawning. The expression of sp7, sox9b, axin1, and wnt4a/b genes can be utilized to monitor age- and reproduction-dependent spine deformation. This study demonstrates that turquoise killifish and humans share certain phenotypes of age-related vertebral abnormalities, suggesting that turquoise killifish could serve as a potential model for studying human spinal stenosis.
