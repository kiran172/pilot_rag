Title: Endocarditis by Streptococcus pasteurianus.

Abstract: The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is challenging because it has a variable clinical presentation and nonspecific symptoms and can present in different forms, especially when an unusual etiological agent is involved. We present the case of a female in her 70s admitted to the hospital with a medical history of bicytopenia, severe aortic stenosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. She had several consultations during which she presented with asthenia and general malaise. A septic screen test was performed that would determine that Streptococcus pasteurianus was present in a blood culture (BC), which was not valued. About three months later, she was hospitalized. In the first 24 hours of admission, the septic screen test was repeated and Streptococcus pasteurianus was isolated in BC. Splenic infarctions and transthoracic echocardiography suggested probable endocarditis, which was confirmed with transesophageal echocardiography. She underwent surgical intervention to remove the perivalvular abscess and replace the aortic prosthesis.
