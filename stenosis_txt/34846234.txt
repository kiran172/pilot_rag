Title: Long-term outcomes of angioplasty for pediatric renovascular hypertension: A single-center experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We used single-center data to evaluate the long-term outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for pediatric renovascular hypertension (RVH) and to analyze the factors that influence effectiveness.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 33 pediatric RVH patients (18 boys; mean age: 9.1 ± 4 years, range: 2-16) who underwent PTA from January 2007 to December 2019. 15 patients had Takayasu arteritis (TA) and 18 were non-TA. The median follow-up from the initial PTA was 69 months (range: 12-157; IQR: 25.5-89).
RESULTS: The technical success rate of 52 PTA procedures was 90.4% in 33 children. Renal artery stents were implanted in two patients, external guidewires were used in two patients, and a drug-coated balloon was used in only one patient. The overall effective rate of PTA was 63.6%, including cured 39.4% and improved 24.2%, at the end of follow-up. Overall clinical outcomes were not statistically different between the TA and non-TA groups (p = 0.316), nor were cure rates (p = 0.072). 15 patients received reintervention due to restenosis after the first successful PTA; the interval was 2-56 months (median: 12 months). Four patients received reintervention due to a failed PTA. A total of four patients received open surgery. Binary logistics regression analysis showed that stenosis length and residual stenosis rate were strongly correlated with effective PTA (p = 0.045, p = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: As a primary treatment for pediatric RVH, PTA can achieve satisfactory results, which are influenced by lesion length and residual stenosis rate.
