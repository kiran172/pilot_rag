Title: Defining carotid near-occlusion with full collapse: a pooled analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Create a new definition of near-occlusion with full collapse to predicting recurrent stroke.
METHODS: Pooled analysis of two studies. Patients with symptomatic ≥ 50% carotid stenoses were included. Outcome was preoperative recurrent ipsilateral ischemic stroke or retinal artery occlusion within 28 days of presenting event. We analyzed several artery diameters on computed tomography angiography and stenosis velocity on ultrasound.
RESULTS: A total of 430 patients with symptomatic ≥ 50% carotid stenosis were included, 27% had near-occlusion. By traditional definition, 27% with full collapse and 11% without full collapse reached the outcome (p = 0.047). Distal internal carotid artery (ICA) diameter, ICA ratio, and ICA-to-external carotid artery ratio were associated with the outcome. Best new definition of full collapse was distal ICA diameter ≤ 2.0 mm and/or ICA ratio ≤ 0.42. With this new definition, 36% with full collapse and 4% without full collapse reached the outcome (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Defining near-occlusion with full collapse as distal ICA diameter ≤ 2.0 mm and/or ICA ratio ≤ 0.42 seems to yield better prognostic discrimination than the traditional appearance-based definition. This novel definition can be used in prognostic and treatment studies of near-occlusion with full collapse.
