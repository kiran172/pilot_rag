Title: Limits and pitfalls of indirect revascularization in moyamoya disease and syndrome.

Abstract: Moyamoya vasculopathy is a rare chronic cerebrovascular disorder characterized by the stenosis of the terminal branches of the internal carotid arteries and the proximal tracts of anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Although surgical revascularization does not significantly change the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, it plays a pivotal role in the management of affected individuals, allowing to decrease the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications. Surgical approaches may be direct (extracranial-intracranial bypass), indirect, or a combination of the two. Several indirect techniques classifiable according to the tissue (muscle, periosteum, galea, dura mater, and extracranial tissues) or vessel (artery) used as a source of blood supply are currently available. In this study, we reviewed the pertinent literature and analyzed the advantages, disadvantages, and pitfalls of the most relevant indirect revascularization techniques. We discussed the technical aspects and the therapeutical implications of each procedure, providing a current state-of-the-art overview on the limits and pitfalls of indirect revascularization in the treatment of moyamoya vasculopathy.
