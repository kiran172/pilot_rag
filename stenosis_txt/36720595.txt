Title: [Outcomes of different types of pulmonary atresia in neonates treated by ductus arteriosus stenting].

Abstract: Objective: To summarize the outcomes of different types of pulmonary atresia in neonates treated by ductus arteriosus stenting. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study. A total of 19 neonates who had pulmonary atresia treated by ductus arteriosus stenting in Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine from April 2014 to June 2021 were included. They were divided into the intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) group and the ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) group. Ductus arteriosus stents were implanted by different approaches. These children were followed up regularly at the 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery and annually since then to evaluate the outcome. Independent sample t-test was used for the statistical analysis. Results: There were 12 children in PA-IVS group and 7 in PA-VSD group. All of them were full term in fants. The gestational age of the PA-IVS group and the PA-VSD group was (38.8±1.1) and (37.7±1.8) weeks, the birth weights were (3.2±0.4) and (3.4±1.1) kg, and the age at operation was (10±9) and (12±7) days, respectively, without significant difference (all P&gt;0.05). Among the 12 children with PA-IVS, 9 had stents successfully implanted through the femoral artery and 3 through the femoral vein. Of the 7 children with PA-VSD, 2 had the stents successfully implanted via the femoral artery and 2 failed, and the remaining 3 had stents successfully implanted via the left carotid artery. There was no postoperative thromboembolism, arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm or other vascular complications. Five children with PA-VSD who had successful operations were followed up at 6 months of age. They all had the operation for pulmonary atresia, repair of the ventricular septal defect, removal of arterial duct stents, and ligation of the arterial duct. All children survived without any stent displacement or stenosis and biventricular circulation was achieved during the follow-up. Conclusions: Ductus arteriosous stenting can be the first-stage treatment for children with PA-IVS and PA-VSD. In addition to the traditional femoral vein and femoral artery approach, the carotid artery can be used as a route for stent placement.
