Title: Endoscopic Image-guided treatment of Upper Gastrointestinal foreign body and nursing care of complications.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study used phased array imaging algorithm to explore the epidemiological characteristics of endoscopic treatment of upper gastrointestinal foreign bodies to provide a basis for nursing intervention.
METHODS: We collected data on the age, sex, cause, type of foreign body, success rate of removal, retention location, time and complications of patients with foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract who were treated in the emergency department of the Digestive Endoscopy Center in our hospital. The study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2020 and we also performed statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The high incidence of foreign bodies in the upper digestive tract was in 45 years old to 74 years old patients. The foreign body types were mostly food balls and sharp foreign bodies, accounting for 37.0% and 44.2%, respectively. The cause was misuse and the most accounted for 52.1%, followed by oesophageal pathological stenosis which accounted for 45.5%. The oesophagus in the retention site accounted for up to 80.0%, and the success rate of foreign body extraction was 96.4%. The complications of patients with foreign body retention within twenty four our retention were mainly esophageal scratches and traumatic esophagitis, accounting for 48.5%. 39.6%.
CONCLUSION: There are high risks in the treatment of foreign bodies in the upper digestive tract. Targeted, prospective, and streamlined nursing interventions can provide patients with fast and professional medical care services and minimize patient pain.
