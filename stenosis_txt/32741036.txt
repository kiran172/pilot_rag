Title: Endovascular treatment of an anastomotic outflow graft pseudoaneurysm of the descending aorta after implantation of a left ventricular assist device.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Outflow graft (OG) obstruction is a dangerous complication that may occur for various reasons after the implantation of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD).
CASE REPORT: In this study, we describe the case of a 67-year-old patient on LVAD support who developed a late pseudoaneurysm of the OG anastomosis (to the descending aorta) causing OG stenosis at the level of the anastomosis. The patient was treated with a customized fenestrated endovascular stent graft placed into the descending aorta and stent implantation into the OG.
