Title: Long-term results after the réparation à l'étage ventriculaire procedure for transposition of the great arteries and double-outlet right ventricle with pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to describe the long-term results of the 'réparation à l'étage ventriculaire' (REV) technique for double-outlet right ventricle and transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with pulmonary stenosis (PS).
METHODS: Between 1980 and 2021, 157 patients underwent a REV procedure (median age and weight: 20.8 months and 7.7 kg). The most frequent anatomical presentation was the association between TGA, ventricular septal defect and PS (n = 116, 73.9%).
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (42.7%) underwent a Rashkind procedure, and 67 patients (42.7%) a prior surgical palliation (including 62 systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunts). Resection of the conal septum and/or ventricular septal defect enlargement was performed in 109 patients (69.4%). Thirteen patients (8.3%) died, including 4 during the first postoperative month and 2 after heart transplant. Overall survival at 40 years was 89.3%. Thirty-seven patients (23.6%) required 68 reinterventions on the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), including 49 reoperations, with a median delay of 9 years after the REV (8 months to 27 years). Twenty patients (12.7%) underwent RVOT valvulation (16 surgical and 4 interventional). Freedom from RVOT reintervention and reoperation at 40 years were 60.3% and 62.6%, respectively. Four patients (2.5%) required reoperation for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, with a median delay of 4.8 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The REV procedure is a good alternative for TGA and double-outlet right ventricle with PS patients. Only a quarter of the patients required redo surgery on the RVOT. Reoperations for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction are scarce.
