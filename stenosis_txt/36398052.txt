Title: Successful emergency transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the setting of hemodynamically unstable prosthetic aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: FDA approved transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for the treatment of symptomatic aortic valve (AV) stenosis. Recent evidence reveals that TAVR is the treatment of choice in most patients with AV stenosis who are at high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Per AHA guidelines, repeat valve replacement has been recommended for bio-prosthetic AV stenosis. Urgent TAVR for hemodynamically unstable patients with prosthetic AV stenosis is not supported by significant scientific data. However, there have been a few cases reported on emergency TAVR procedures in hemodynamically unstable patients with severe native AV stenosis. We are reporting a unique case of successful emergency TAVR in a hemodynamically unstable patient, who had severe symptomatic bio-prosthetic AV stenosis at the time of presentation.
