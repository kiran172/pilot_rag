Title: Prognostic value of myocardial flow reserve measured with CZT cardiac-dedicated SPECT low-dose dynamic myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with INOCA.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical use of dynamic myocardial perfusion imaging (D-MPI) of cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) cardiac-dedicated SPECT is growing, showing a higher application value than conventional SPECT. The prognostic value of ischemia in patients with non-obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) remains an important challenge for investigation. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of myocardial flow reserve (MFR) measured with low-dose D-MPI of CZT cardiac-dedicated SPECT in the assessment of patients with INOCA.
METHODS: Consecutive screening of patients with INOCA and obstructive coronary artery disease (OCAD) who had coronary angiography (CAG) data was performed within three months before or after D-MPI imaging. The patients who met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively analyzed and follow-up by telephone was performed. The enrolled patients were then divided into the INOCA and OCAD groups. INOCA was defined as signs and/or symptoms of myocardial ischemia but with < 50% epicardial stenosis. OCAD was defined as obstructive stenosis (≥ 50% stenosis) of epicardial coronary arteries or their major branches on the CAG. Medical treatments, Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) scores, and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were studied. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve, Log-rank test, and univariable COX regression analysis were used to evaluate the prognosis of patients and associated predictors, with P < 0.05 being considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A total of 303 patients (159 males and 144 females) were enrolled for the final analysis after excluding 24 patients who were lost to follow-up. The mean age of the included cases was 61.94 ± 8.59 years, of which 203 (67.0%) cases were OCAD and 100 (33.0%) cases were INOCA, respectively. The median follow-up was 16 months (14-21 months). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the incidence of MACE was similar in the INOCA and OCAD groups (log-rank P = 0.2645), while those with reduced MFR showed a higher incidence of MACE than those with normal MFR (log-rank P = 0.0019). The subgroup analysis in the OCAD group revealed that 105 patients with reduced MFR had a higher incidence of MACE than those with normal MFR (log-rank P = 0.0226). The subgroup analysis in the INOCA group showed that 37 patients with reduced MFR had a higher incidence of MACE than those with normal MFR in the INOCA group (log-rank P = 0.0186). Univariable Cox regression analysis showed for every 1 unit increase in MFR, the risk of MACE for INOCA was reduced by 66.1% and that for OCAD by 64.2%. For each 1 mL·g-1·min-1 increase in LV-sMBF, the risk of MACE was reduced by 72.4% in INOCA patients and 63.6% in OCAD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: MFR measured with low-dose D-MPI CZT SPECT provides incremental prognostic value in patients with INOCA. Patients with reduced MFR show an increased risk of MACE, increased symptom burdens, and impaired quality of life. INOCA patients with reduced MFR experienced higher rate of MACE than OCAD patients with normal MFR.
