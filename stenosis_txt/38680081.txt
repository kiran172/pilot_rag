Title: Acute Mitral Valve Regurgitation Caused by Left Ventricular Pacing Wire During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is quickly becoming the standard of care for patients with severe aortic stenosis thanks to its minimally invasive nature and favorable outcomes. Recently, left ventricular pacing has been proposed as a safer alternative to traditional right heart pacing, which could simplify the transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure overall, although procedural complications may still occur. This report describes a rare case of left ventricular pacing wire-induced acute severe mitral valve regurgitation during transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
