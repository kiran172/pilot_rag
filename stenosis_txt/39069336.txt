Title: Pediatric Lung Transplantation for Pulmonary Vascular Diseases: Recent Advances and Challenges.

Abstract: Pediatric lung transplantation for pulmonary vascular diseases has seen notable advancements and trends. Medical therapies, surgical options, and bridging techniques like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and different forms of transplants have expanded treatment possibilities. Current challenges include ensuring patient adherence to post-transplant therapies, addressing complications like primary graft dysfunction and rejection, and conducting further research in less common conditions like pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary vein stenosis. In this review article, the authors will explore the advancements, emerging trends, and persistent challenges in pediatric lung transplantation for pulmonary vascular diseases.
