Title: Novel self-expanding ALLEGRA transcatheter aortic valve for native aortic stenosis and degenerated bioprosthesis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the ALLEGRA valve in routine use.
BACKGROUND: The ALLEGRA aortic valve is a self-expanding transcatheter heart valve (THV) with bovine pericardial tissue and was CE approved in March 2017. Its unique design was developed to provide low prosthesis gradients.
METHODS: We analyzed patients receiving an ALLEGRA THV between May 2017 and March 2021 at our center for treatment of aortic valve stenosis or degenerated valve prosthesis. Hemodynamic results and clinical outcome according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 consensus criteria were evaluated at discharge and three months post transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure. 93 patients with a mean age of 82.5 ± 4.8 years and a median EuroScore II of 4.7 ± 3.4 were treated, 15 of them were valve-in-valve procedures.
RESULTS: Implantation was successful in 97.8% (91/93) and VARC-2 defined device success was achieved in 94.6% (88/93). In-hospital all-cause mortality was 2.2% (2/93). Life-threatening bleeding, major vascular complications and strokes were 3.2% (3/93), 2.2% (2/93) and 3.2% (3/93), respectively. Paravalvular leakage was none to trace in 60.4%, mild in 38.5% and moderate in 1.1%. Permanent pacemaker implantation in pacemaker naive patients was necessary in 9.5% (8/84). Mean gradient at discharge was 8.2 ± 4.3 mmHg for all patients; 7.1 ± 2.6 mmHg in patients treated for stenosis of the native aortic valve and 13.8 ± 6.3 mmHg in patients treated valve-in-valve.
CONCLUSIONS: The ALLEGRA THV provides excellent hemodynamic results and a good safety profile with a low complication rate.
