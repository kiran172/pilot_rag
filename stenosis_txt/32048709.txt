Title: Computed tomography-based surgical strategy for total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We used computed tomographic angiography (CTA)-based surgical planning to clarify the anatomical indications of sutureless repair technique for total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. The mid-term impact of the current surgical strategies was evaluated.
METHODS: One hundred twelve patients underwent repair for total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. The study period was divided into era 1 (1996-2010, n = 56) and era 2 (2011-2018, n = 56). Patients with single ventricular heart (SVH) were included. In era 2, the indications for primary sutureless repair and branch pulmonary vein incision were based on CTA findings.
RESULTS: For patients with biventricular heart, the 5-year survival was 69% and 97% in eras 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.0024). For patients with SVH, the 5-year survival was 21% and 70% in eras 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.0007). During the follow-up period, the evidence of post-repair pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) was observed in 12 patients with biventricular heart [era 1, 8 patients (23%); era 2, 4 patients (13%)], and 14 patients with SVH [era 1, 6 patients (60%); era 2, 8 patients (36%)]. Using multivariable analysis, preoperative CTA was associated with improved survival in both biventricular heart and SVH and associated with post-repair PVS-free survival in SVH. Since 2011, 12 patients with post-repair PVS underwent multiple reintervention with 1 recorded death (5-year survival: 88%).
CONCLUSIONS: CTA-based surgical strategy for total anomalous pulmonary venous connection provided significant survival benefit. Although post-repair PVS could occur in era 2, aggressive reintervention appeared to be associated with improved survival and vein patency.
