Title: A 3D Quantitative MRC Modeling Images Detected Case of Intrahepatic Biliary Stricture Diseases.

Abstract: In the future, the application of quantitative imaging and computational analysis will reduce the burden on radiologists. We herein report 8 pilot cases both with and without intrahepatic biliary stricture (IHBS) diseases which have been analyzed with the novel analytical system MRCP+ (Perspectum Ltd., Oxford, UK). The colored and well-visualized 3D models of the entire biliary trees could be obtained in all 8 cases. Three representative cases did not show dilated regions in the intrahepatic bile ducts. Cases diagnosed as a pancreatico-biliary maljunction showed slightly increased dilated visualization in the extrahepatic duct. Except in a case with severe stenosis resulting from hepatolithiasis, the number of visualized intrahepatic bile ducts tended to be decreased and the volume of biliary tree and the total length of stricture and dilatation were also decreased. However, the number of IHBS or dilatation was unchanged. The number of strictures obtained by MRCP+ and the subjective counts of stenosis from a radiologist was not found to be correlated. In a case of severe stenosis at the left lateral bile duct, the number of intrahepatic biliary dilatations was increased. The latest computerized 3D modeling technology was found to be useful in visualizing the alteration of intraluminal diameter of the entire biliary trees at a glance, which can provide the automatic diagnosis of IHBS diseases at an earlier phase.
