Title: Progressive Left Ventricular Hypertrophy After Ozaki Procedure: A Case Report.

Abstract: We describe a 57-year-old man with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent aortic valve reconstruction with glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium with the Ozaki technique (Ozaki procedure). Seven months later, he rapidly developed progressive left ventricular hypertrophy with a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This required a reoperation for septal myectomy.
