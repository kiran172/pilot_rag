Title: [Clinical Significance of Palliative Esophageal Stent Placement for Esophageal Cancer].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal carcinoma in 2007, the indication for placing an esophageal stent has changed, especially with respect to the treatment of esophageal stricture after chemoradiotherapy(CRT). For CRT cases, irradiation after stent placement and stent placement after CRT are not recommended due to the risk of perforation.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients who underwent esophageal stenting in our department between January 2007 and December 2018 and who were diagnosed with thoracic esophageal cancer were included in this study. We retrospectively examined the safety and treatment effect of esophageal stent placement.
RESULTS: Prior cancer therapy was observed in 16 cases(8 cases of chemotherapy and 8 cases of CRT). In the no prior therapy group, 13 cases were treated with BSC and 9 cases with chemotherapy. Esophageal stent placement after CRT was performed in 8 cases. Esophageal stent was placed 9(6-14)months after CRT. The stent patency period was 5(1-11)months, and the survival period after stent placement was 6(1-12)months. There was no difference in the frequency of complications and treatment outcomes of the CRT group compared with the non-CRT group.
CONCLUSION: Cases undergoing esophageal stent placement after CRT can expect therapeutic effects similar to those of other cases. However, complications such as perforation can be fatal; thus, careful consideration should be given to each individual case for esophageal stent placement after CRT.
