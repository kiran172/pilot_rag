Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Complicated by Aorto-Right Ventricular Fistula Repaired Via Valve-in-Valve Replacement.

Abstract: A 59-year-old man with a history of severe aortic stenosis with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) presented with worsening heart failure. Echocardiography showed a fistula between the aorta and the right ventricle with mild to moderate paravalvular regurgitation. He underwent a valve-in-valve TAVR with symptomatic improvement and decreased flow through the fistula.
