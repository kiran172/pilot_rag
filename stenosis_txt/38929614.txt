Title: Inflammatory Biomarkers to Predict Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Inflammatory proteins and their prognostic value in patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) have not been adequately studied. Herein, we identified CAS-specific biomarkers from a large pool of inflammatory proteins and assessed the ability of these biomarkers to predict adverse events in individuals with CAS. Materials and Methods: Samples of blood were prospectively obtained from 336 individuals (290 with CAS and 46 without CAS). Plasma concentrations of 29 inflammatory proteins were determined at recruitment, and the patients were followed for 24 months. The outcome of interest was a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death). The differences in plasma protein concentrations between patients with vs. without a 2-year MACE were determined using the independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to identify CAS-specific prognostic biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses with adjustment for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were performed to assess the prognostic value of differentially expressed inflammatory proteins in predicting a 2-year MACE in patients with CAS. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 68.8 (SD 10.2) years and 39% were female. The plasma concentrations of two inflammatory proteins were significantly higher in individuals with a 2-year MACE relative to those without a 2-year MACE: IL-6 (5.07 (SD 4.66) vs. 3.36 (SD 4.04) pg/mL, p = 0.03) and CD163 (233.825 (SD 230.306) vs. 159.673 (SD 175.669) pg/mL, p = 0.033). Over a follow-up period of 2 years, individuals with elevated levels of IL-6 were more likely to develop MACE (HR 1.269 (95% CI 1.122-1.639), p = 0.042). Similarly, over a 2-year period, patients with high levels of CD163 were more likely to develop MACE (HR 1.413 (95% CI 1.022-1.954), p = 0.036). Conclusions: The plasma levels of inflammatory proteins IL-6 and CD163 are independently associated with adverse outcomes in individuals with CAS. These CAS-specific prognostic biomarkers may assist in the risk stratification of patients at an elevated risk of a MACE and subsequently guide further vascular evaluation, specialist referrals, and aggressive medical/surgical management, thereby improving outcomes for patients with CAS.
