Title: Simulation to Success: Treatment of a 3D Printed Heart Before Complex Systemic Venous Baffle Intervention.

Abstract: Three-dimensional imaging and printed heart models have become increasingly valuable in the management of patients with complex congenital heart disease. We successfully simulated a stenting procedure on a 3-dimensional printed model of a patient with d-transposition of the great arteries status post-Mustard operation with caval baffle atresia and stenosis. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
