Title: Flow Diverters with Surface Modification in Patients with Intracranial Aneurysms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Flow diverters with surface modification (FDSM) are increasingly being used in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms (ANs). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety across different devices and antiplatelet therapies using a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify original studies of ≥10 patients with intracranial ANs treated with FDSM from database inception through August 2023. Primary effectiveness outcome was the rate of complete AN occlusion at follow-up ≥6 months. Safety outcomes included ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, and in-stent thrombosis, and were stratified by FDSM devices and antiplatelet therapies. Certainty of evidence was evaluated following the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included, yielding 2161 patients with 2373 ANs. A total of 70.5% of the ANs were located on the internal carotid artery (ICA). Total 10.3% were acutely ruptured. The complete AN occlusion rate was 72.3% at follow-up ≥6 months. Sensitivity analysis in the ICA AN cohort yielded comparable occlusion rates between Pipeline Flex Embolization Device-Shield (80.4%) and Phenox-hydrophilic polymer-coated (77.5%, P = 0.54), but a lower 66.2% rate for Flow Redirection Endoluminal Device-X (P = 0.02). The rate of in-stent thrombosis and stenosis tended to be higher in Phenox-hydrophilic polymer-coated (3.4%) and Flow Redirection Endoluminal Device-X (4.3%) versus Pipeline Flex Embolization Device-Shield (0.8%, P = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: FDSM were safe with satisfactory effectiveness for intracranial ANs. More specific investigations are warranted to explore their performance in ANs beyond the ICA and optimal antiplatelet therapy.
