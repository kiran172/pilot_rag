Title: Strategies for the Surgical Management of Highly Aggressive Williams Syndrome Aortopathy: A Three Case Report.

Abstract: Severe aortopathy in Williams syndrome can sometimes present with an initial ascending aortic pathology, followed in short order by more distal multilevel obstruction and recurrence requiring reintervention. In this series, an early, comprehensive surgical approach using a combination of various access and perfusion strategies yielded excellent long-term results.
