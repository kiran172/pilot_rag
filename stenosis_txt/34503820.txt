Title: Comparison of Diagnostic Performance of Fractional Flow Reserve Derived from Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography Versus Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomographic Myocardial Perfusion Imaging.

Abstract: Fraction flow reserve (FFR) derived from computed tomography (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) has been proposed to be an effective gatekeeper for invasive angiographic referral. The purpose of the present study is to examine the real-world diagnostic performance of FFR<sub>CT</sub> and myocardial perfusion imaging as well as to assess the utility of FFR<sub>CT</sub> as a gatekeeper for invasive coronary angiography in patients suspected of having obstructive coronary artery disease. Total of 146 consecutive patients underwent both single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and invasive FFR were evaluated. An FFR<sub>CT</sub> value 1 to 2 cm distal to a stenosis ≤0.80 was defined as positive for ischemia and a summed stress score ≥2 or transient ischemic dilatation ≥1.2 were positive for ischemia with the invasive FFR value of &lt;0.80 serving as the gold standard. The patient-based sensitivity of FFR<sub>CT</sub> was significantly higher than SPECT (91 vs 52%, p &lt;0.001) and exhibited similar positive predictive value (82 vs 82%, p = 0.91). These trends were observed even in patients with multivessel and left main trunk disease and those with severe coronary calcification. In conclusion, our data suggest that FFR<sub>CT</sub> has higher diagnostic performance characteristics than SPECT and details the superior FFR<sub>CT</sub> analysis in detecting patients with hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease. Our results support the clinical utility of FFR<sub>CT</sub> analysis as a gatekeeper for invasive coronary angiography in clinical practice.
