Title: Slide tracheoplasty for congenital tracheal stenosis with involvement of the carina and bronchi: a case report.

Abstract: A female newborn presented with respiratory distress at birth and was diagnosed with congenital tracheal stenosis. The stenosis was positioned at the distal trachea and compromised the carina and the right and left bronchi. She underwent surgical treatment using circulatory life support with veno-arterial peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and the airway was reconstructed using the slide tracheoplasty technique to build a neocarina. The patient had an excellent postoperative course, was successfully weaned from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and invasive ventilation, and was discharged.
