Title: [Characteristics of SPECT/CT-derived pulmonary perfusion imaging in chronic pulmonary vascular stenosis with different etiologies].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the characteristics of pulmonary blood flow perfusion imaging of single photo emission computer tomography/computer tomography (SPECT/CT) in chronic pulmonary vascular Stenosis (CPVS) caused by different etiological factors. Methods: This is a retropective study. Present study screened 50 consecutive cases diagnosed with chronic pulmonary vascular stenosis from January 2019 to January 2020 in the department of cardiology of Gansu Provincial Hospital and underwent SPECT/CT pulmonary blood flow perfusion examination. Thirteen patients were excluded because of pulmonary vascular lesions with a disease course of less than 3 months and poor image quality. According to the etiology, patients were divided into fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) group, Takyasu's arteritis (PTA) group, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension/chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPH/CTED) group. The severity of pulmonary blood flow perfusion was evaluated in accordance with the Begic scoring principle in the three groups. The overall Begic score, lung lobe scores among three groups were compared. CT signs of lung SPECT/CT, such as enlargement of hilar lymph node, atelectasis, bronchial stenosis, were also analyzed in three groups. Results: A total of 37 patients with chronic pulmonary vascular stenosis were finally enrolled (18 in the FM group, 5 in the PTA group, and 14 in the CTEPH/CTED group). The total Begic score of pulmonary perfusions was similar among the three groups (F=0.657,P&gt;0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the left upper lobe Begic score among the three groups (H=4.081, P&lt;0.05). The left upper lobe Begic score was higher in the FM group than in the PTA group (3.44±2.50 vs. 1.60±0.55, P&lt;0.05). As compared to other two groups, patients in FM group were featured with CT signs of higher percent of hilar enlargement (FM group vs. PTA group: 16/18 vs. 1/5, P=0.008; FM group vs. CTEPH/CTED group: 16/18 vs. 3/14, P=0.000 2), enlargement of the pulmonary hilum lymph nodes (FM group vs. PTA group: 14/18 vs. 1/5, P=0.033; FM group vs. CTEPH/CTED group: 14/18 vs. 2/14, P=0.001), and calcification of mediastinal soft tissue (FM group vs. PTA group: 11/18 to 0/5, P=0.037; FM group vs. CTEPH/CTED group: 11/18 vs. 1/14, P=0.003). The proportion of CT signs of bronchial stenosis (9/18 vs. 0/14, P=0.002) and atelectasis (9/18 vs. 1/14, P=0.002) was also higher in the FM group than in the CTEPH/CTED group. In case of abnormal pulmonary blood flow perfusion, the diagnostic accuracy of CT signs hilar enlargement, hilar lymph node enlargement, mediastinal soft tissue calcification, bronchial stenosis, and atelectasis for the diagnosis of FM were 81.1%, 83.8%, 78.4%, 75.7%, and 73.0%, respectively. Conclusion: There is no significant difference in the Begic score of SPECT/CT pulmonary blood flow perfusion imagines among the three groups of patients. Impaired pulmonary blood flow perfusion combined with typical CT signs is useful for identifying patients with FM.
