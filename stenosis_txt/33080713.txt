Title: Management of button batteries in the upper gastrointestinal tract of children: A case-series study.

Abstract: Button batteries are the second most frequently-ingested foreign bodies and can lead to serious clinical complications within hours of ingestion. The purpose of this study was to analyze the outcomes of 14 children with button batteries lodged in the upper gastrointestinal tract.Totally 14 children with button batteries lodged in the upper gastrointestinal tract were included. The diagnosis was made primarily by the history of button battery ingestion, physical examination and chest-abdomen X-ray examination.The button batteries lodged in the esophagus were removed by esophagoscope, and those in the gastrointestinal tract were under observation. Among 10 children with batteries in the first esophageal stenosis, 9 were cured and 1 suffered from tracheoesophageal fistula. One case of battery in the second esophageal stenosis was dead due to intercurrent aortoesophageal fistula. Two cases of batteries in the third esophageal stenosis were cured after removal, and 1 case of the battery in the gastrointestinal tract discharged spontaneously.Ingested button batteries are mainly lodged in the esophageal stenoses and are easy to cause esophageal injury and severe complications. Early detection, prompt treatment, strengthening observation and regular follow-up after discharge may help to decrease the incidence of complications and improve the outcomes.
