Title: Changes in treatment of aortic valve diseases for acute and elective indications during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective single-center analysis from 2019 to 2020.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had an impact on the quality of healthcare services and led to many changes in the treatment of cardiac pathologies.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the differences in the clinical manifestations, management and outcomes of patients with aortic valve diseases (AVDs) treated invasively before and during the pandemic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective single-center study involved patients with AVDs treated by means of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in 2019 and 2020. They were divided into groups with respect to the year of intervention (2019 compared to 2020) and the priority of admission (urgent compared to elective). Preoperative characteristics, early outcomes and probability of annual survival were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: The number of patients admitted urgently increased from 37 in 2019 to 54 in 2020, with a higher prevalence of men in 2020 (83.3% compared to 56.8%, respectively). Elective cases, on the other hand, declined from 279 in 2019 to 256 in 2020. Among the latter, more subjects had manifestations of heart failure (p < 0.001), coronary artery disease (CAD; p = 0.002), hypertension (p = 0.006), as well as had a history of a stroke (p = 0.002). In the meantime, more TAVI and fewer SAVR procedures were performed in 2020 (86 compared to 127 and 192 compared to 125, respectively; p < 0.001). In 2020, TAVI individuals had risk of death (according to the EuroSCORE scale) than in 2019 (p < 0.001). The probability of annual survival was comparable (p = 0.769) among AVD patients treated before and during the coronavirus pandemic (91.3% compared to 88.3%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Although during the COVID-19 pandemic more nonelective and higher-risk AVD individuals received interventional treatment, the outcomes were comparable to the pre-pandemic era (2019). Our findings support highly valuable, less invasive therapeutic methods for treating aortic pathologies during the pandemic.
