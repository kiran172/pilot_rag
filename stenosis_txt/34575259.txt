Title: Comparative Analysis of the Kinetic Behavior of Systemic Inflammatory Markers in Patients with Depressed versus Preserved Left Ventricular Function Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prior studies have proven the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) function. This study's aim was to investigate periprocedural inflammatory responses after TAVI.
METHODS: Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and reduced LV function who underwent transfemoral TAVI were enrolled. A paired-matched analysis (1:2 ratio) was performed using patients with preserved LV function. Whole white blood cells (WBC) and subpopulation dynamics as well as the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were evaluated at different times.
RESULTS: A total of 156 patients were enrolled, including 52 patients with LVEF &lt; 40% 35.00 [30.00, 39.25] and 104 with LVEF &gt; 50% 55.00 [53.75, 60.0], p &lt; 0.001. Baseline NLR in the reduced LV function group was significantly higher compared to the preserved LV function group, 2.85 [2.07, 4.78] vs. 3.90 [2.67, 5.26], p &lt; 0.04. After a six-month follow-up, the inflammatory profile was found to be similar in the two groups, NLR 2.94 [2.01, 388] vs. 3.30 [2.06, 5.35], p = 0.288. No significant mortality differences between the two groups were observed in the long-term outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, with reduced LV function, was associated with an improvement in the inflammatory profile that may account for some of the observable benefits of the procedure in this subset of patients.
