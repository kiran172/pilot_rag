Title: Incremental Value of Global Longitudinal Strain for Confirming Heart Failure-Related Symptoms in Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: The indications or timing of aortic valve replacement for symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) are based on a patient's life expectancy and symptoms. However, clinical decision-making may be difficult because symptoms are subjective and cannot be quantitatively assessed and confirmed. This study aimed to evaluate the association between heart failure (HF)-related symptoms and cardiac hemodynamic left ventricular deformations in patients with severe AS using transthoracic echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS). The medical records of patients hospitalized for AS between February 2017 and September 2019 were retrospectively screened. Independent cardiologists analyzed the transthoracic echocardiographic images of a digital echocardiography database. The cohort comprised 177 hospitalized patients with severe AS and no history of HF. The subgroup with HF-related symptoms included 87 patients, whereas that without HF-related symptoms included 90 patients. In 145 patients without atrial fibrillation, the left atrial volume index (LAVI) and LV-GLS were significantly associated with HF-related symptoms (odds ratio 1.033, 95% confidence interval 1.008 to 1.059, p = 0.011 and odds ratio 1.224, 95% confidence interval 1.118 to 1.340, p <0.0001, respectively). Moreover, the combination of brain natriuretic peptide level, LAVI, and LV-GLS showed better diagnostic accuracy than the combination of brain natriuretic peptide level and LAVI (p = 0.005). However, there were no such tendencies in 32 patients with atrial fibrillation. The HF-related symptoms in patients with severe AS were strongly linked to LV-GLS. LV-GLS showed incremental value for confirming HF-related symptoms.
