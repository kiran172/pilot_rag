Title: Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of eosinophilic esophagitis.

Abstract: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a rare immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus. The main symptoms are dysphagia, retrosternal pain, and repeated food impaction. Esophageal eosinophilic infiltration is seen on histopathological examination. Progressive esophageal stenosis and other complications may occur if not detected and treated. We report a patient with pathologically confirmed EoE whose disease was detected on fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT). This case demonstrates the important role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis.
