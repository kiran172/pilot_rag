Title: Prognostic value of coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with aortic stenosis and nonobstructed coronary arteries.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with aortic valve stenosis have been postulated to have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) contributing to the clinical symptoms and adverse outcomes. The coronary angiography (CAG)-derived index of microcirculatory resistance (caIMR) is proposed as a novel, less invasive and pressure-wire-free index to assess CMD. This study aimed to quantify CMD assessed by caIMR and investigate its prognostic impact in patients with aortic valve stenosis.
METHODS: This study included 77 moderate or severe aortic valve stenosis patients with no obstructive coronary disease (defined as having no stenosis more than 50% in diameter) who underwent caIMR measurement. CMD was defined by caIMR at least 25. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were the clinical outcomes during the median 40 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: The incidence of CMD was 47.7%. Seventeen MACE occurred during the follow-up duration. CMD was associated with an increased risk of MACE (log-rank P < 0.001) and an independent predictor of clinical outcomes [hazard ratio 5.467, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.393-21.458; P = 0.015]. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that caIMR could provide a significant predictive value for MACE in aortic valve stenosis patients (AUC 0.785, 95% CI 0.609-0.961, P < 0.001). In addition, the risk of MACE was higher in CMD patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (log-rank P < 0.001) and no aortic valve replacement (log-rank P = 0.003) than in other groups.
CONCLUSION: Aortic valve stenosis patients demonstrated markedly impaired caIMR. CMD assessed by caIMR increases the risk of MACE and is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in aortic valve stenosis patients. This finding suggests that using caIMR in the clinical assessment may help identify high-risk groups and stimulate earlier intervention.
