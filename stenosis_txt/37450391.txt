Title: [Surgical treatment of postintubation stenosis of the larynx in children].

Abstract: Post-intubation laryngeal stenosis is the most common cause of upper respiratory obstruction in children. According to published data, the incidence of post-intubation stenosis ranges from 0.1 to 20%. Treatment of children with chronic laryngeal stenosis is a special branch of respiratory surgery. It remains one of the most complex and urgent problems in pediatrics, pediatric otorhinolaryngology, and pediatric surgery. Although numerous studies have described various methods for treating stenosis of the infraglottic space, there is no standard management approach. Currently, there are two main treatment methods: endoscopic interventions and open reconstructive surgery. Each method has its benefits and drawbacks. Despite the use of various techniques, the effectiveness of cicatricial laryngeal stenosis repair and decannulation in children is 63-64%, according to published data. With combined lesions of infraglottic and vocal cord parts of the larynx, especially with their cicatricial obliteration, reconstructive surgery is successful only in 50% of cases. Thus, treating children with post-intubation respiratory stenosis remains a complex problem and is a relevant direction for further research.
