Title: Direct transmesenteric venous interventions in the acute post liver transplant setting.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Portal venous thrombosis and stenosis are uncommon but serious causes of liver transplant graft failure. While surgical thrombectomy can be utilized for the treatment of portal steno-occlusive disease, venous interventions with IR have been performed with encouraging results.
CASE DESCRIPTION: 69-year-old female with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis who received a liver transplant complicated by portal vein thrombus. Efforts between transplant surgery and IR allowed for successful thrombus removal via direct SMV access.
RESULTS: The advantages of direct SMV access with the surgery team include direct approach to accessing thrombus, sparing of liver parenchyma, and significant hemostatic control.
