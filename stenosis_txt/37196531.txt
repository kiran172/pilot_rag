Title: Contemporary Trends, Characteristics, and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Among Extreme Elderly Patients.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been increasingly performed among extreme elderly patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. We aimed to study the trends, characteristics, and outcomes of TAVI among extreme elderly. The National Readmission Database for the years 2016 to 2019 was queried for extreme elderly who underwent TAVI. Linear regression analysis was used to calculate the temporal trends in outcomes. A total of 23,507 TAVI extreme elderly admissions (50.3% women and 95.9% Medicare insurance) were included. The in-hospital mortality and all-cause 30-day readmissions were 2% and 15% and have been stable over years of analysis (p trend = 0.79 and 0.06, respectively). We evaluated complications, such as permanent pacemaker implantation (12%) and stroke (3.2%). Stroke rates did not decrease (3.4% vs 2.9% in 2016 and 2019 [p trend = 0.24]). The mean length of stay improved from 5.5 days in 2016 to 4.3 days in 2019 (p trend <0.01). The rates of early discharge (day ≤3) has improved from 49% in 2016 to 69% in 2019 (p trend <0.01). In conclusion, this nationwide contemporary observational analysis showed that TAVI was associated with low rates of complications in the extreme elderly.
