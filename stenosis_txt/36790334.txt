Title: Pulmonary artery sling: An overview.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery sling is a rare childhood vascular tracheobronchial compression syndrome that is frequently associated with tracheal stenosis. Consequently, neonates or infants may present with critical airway obstruction if there is long segment airway narrowing and complete rings. Rapid diagnosis of this cardiac vascular malformation and evaluation of the extent and severity of airway involvement is essential to plan surgery, typically a slide tracheoplasty to relieve critical airway obstruction. Long term outcome can be excellent following surgical repair of the stenosed airway and reimplantation of the left pulmonary artery. In this review we focus on the embryology, diagnostic workup, airway investigations and management for this rare but challenging congenital condition.
