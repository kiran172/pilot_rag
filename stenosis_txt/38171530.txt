Title: [A case of two-stage orthodontic treatment of skeletal ClassⅡmalocclusion with mandibular retrusion and maxillary dental arch stenosis].

Abstract: This article reviewed two-stage orthodontic treatment of a patient with skeletal ClassⅡmalocclusion with mandibular retrusion and maxillary dental arch stenosis. The patient was also accompanied by premature loss of bilateral mandibular deciduous canines and mesialization of mandibular posterior teeth. The first-stage treatment mainly corrected the maxillary dental arch stenosis, maxillary anterior teeth protrusion, mandibular retrusion and skeletal ClassⅡmalocclusion, while the second-stage treatment mainly corrected the mesialization of mandibular posterior teeth and alignment of maxillary and mandibular dentition. The two-stage orthodontic treatment finally enabled the patient to achieve good dental arch shape, tooth alignment, skeletal face pattern and soft tissue profile.
