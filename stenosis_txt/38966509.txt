Title: Streptococcus canis Native Aortic Valve Endocarditis Linked to Cat Exposure: A Case Report and Review.

Abstract: Streptococcus canis is an uncommon human pathogen, but documented infections have been mostly associated with exposure to dogs. There are only five documented cases of endocarditis secondary to streptococcus canis, with all cases except one documenting exposure to a canine. We present a 74-year-old male with a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD 3, moderate aortic stenosis and remote exposure to agent orange, who was found to have Streptococcus canis native valve endocarditis without exposure to a dog. To the best of our knowledge this case is the first case of endocarditis linked to feline exposure.
