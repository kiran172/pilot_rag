Title: Correlation IMA with TIMI frame count in slow coronary flow: can it be a guide for treatment?

Abstract: AIM: Coronary slow flow (CSF) is defined as late opacification in epicardial coronary arteries with no significant stenosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) by using Spectrophotometer in CSF.
METHODS: Level of IMA was measured by spectrophotometer. CSF patients were chosen for the determination of IMA level. All obtained data were compared with control groups.
RESULTS: Serum IMA levels increased in the CSF group. It was observed that there was a significant increase in IMA levels in patients with CSF when compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: IMA may play a role in the pathogenesis of CSF. IMA levels in the serum can be considered as a marker to predict coronary slow flow. IMA level can be used as a guide for coronary slow flow. Also, as increases number square frame, value IMA Increases similarly. It was found that the severity of impotence was correlated with CSF. Therefore, the IMA level may be predictive of the course of treatment. This study is the first one to show the relationships of IMA in CSF. In addition, further studies should be performed on IMA in CSF patients.
