Title: Usefulness of basic renal function tests in the management of hydronephrosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, the algorithms for the study of hydronephrosis in children include voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and diuretic renogram (DR) in all patients. Both are invasive, distressing, and associated with radiation risk. However, basic renal function tests (bRFTs) are not included. This study was designed to determine whether bRFTs may help avoid VCUG and/or DR in some children.
METHODS: Retrospective review of hydronephrosis (≥20 mm renal pelvis) patient records over one year (n = 38) (pyeloureteral stenosis (PUS) n = 12; high-grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) n = 8; non-obstructive hydronephrosis (NOH) n = 18. Data from the three protocolized bRFTs (maximum urine osmolality after DDAVP (UOsm), albumin/creatinine ratio (Alb/Cr), and NAG/creatinine ratio (NAG/Cr), together with VCUG and DR, were analyzed.
RESULTS: 38 hydronephrosis patients (pyeloureteral stenosis (PUS) n = 12; high grade vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) n = 8; non-obstructive hydronephrosis (NOH) n = 18. UOsm was decreased in 100% of VUR patients, 75% of PUS patients, and 16.7% of NOH patients. Alb/Cr ratio was increased in 62.5% of VUR patients, 8.3% of PUS patients, and 11.1% of NOH patients. NAG/Cr ratio was increased in 42.8% of VUR patients, 25% of PUS patients, and 6.7% of NOH patients. UOsm was decreased in most patients who required surgery (100% of VUR patients and 74% of PUS patients), but only in 11.1% of patients who did not (NOH group).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bRFTs may be useful in delaying or avoiding VCUG in some hydronephrosis cases. UOsm is the most sensitive test. No child with (high grade) VUR had a normal UOsm. VCUG could have been avoided in 43% of our patients -with a normal UOsm- without missing any high grade VUR.
