Title: Predicting vulnerable carotid plaques by detecting wall shear stress based on ultrasonic vector flow imaging.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid plaque vulnerability is a significant factor in the risk of cardiocerebrovascular events, with intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) being a crucial characteristic of plaque vulnerability. This study investigates the value of ultrasound vector flow imaging (V-flow) for measuring carotid plaque wall shear stress (WSS) in predicting the extent of IPN.
METHODS: We enrolled 140 patients into three groups: 53 in the plaque group (72 plaques), 23 in the stenosis group (27 plaques), and 64 in the control group. V-flow was used to measure WSS parameters, including the average WSS (WSS mean) and the maximum WSS (WSS max), across three plaque locations: mid-upstream, maximum thickness, and mid-downstream. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination was used in 76 patients to analyze IPN and its correlation with WSS parameters.
RESULTS: WSS max in the stenosis group was significantly higher than that in the control and plaque groups at the maximum thickness part (P < .05) and WSS mean in the stenosis group was significantly lower than that in the control group at the mid-upstream and mid-downstream segments (P < .05). WSS mean in the plaque group was significantly lower than that of the control group at all three locations (P < .05). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination revealed that plaques with neovascularization enhancement exhibited significantly higher WSS values (P < .05), with a positive correlation between WSS parameters and IPN enhancement grades, particularly WSS max at the thickest part (r = 0.508). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of WSS parameters for evaluating IPN showed that the efficacy of WSS max in evaluating IPN was better than that of WSS mean (P < .05), with an area under the curve of 0.7762 and 0.6973 (95% confidence intervals, 0.725-0.822 and 0.642-0.749, respectively). The cut-offs were 4.57 Pa and 1.12 Pa, sensitivities were 74.03% and 63.64%, and specificities were 75.00% and 68.18%.
CONCLUSIONS: V-flow effectively measures WSS in carotid plaques. WSS max provides a promising metric for assessing IPN, offering potential insights into plaque characteristics and showing some potential in predicting plaque vulnerability.
