Title: Impact of increased serum 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels on extent of coronary artery lesions in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are prone to cardiovascular disease, and both conditions are linked to oxidative DNA damage, which produces 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). We investigated the impact of 8-OHdG on coronary heart disease (CHD) in elderly patients with T2DM.
METHODS: We assessed the demographic, clinical, and biochemical characteristics of 147 patients with T2DM (mean age 73.29 ± 8.19 years) with or without CHD. Serum 8-OHdG was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CHD was diagnosed as ≥50% stenosis in at least one main branch of the coronary arteries determined by coronarography, evaluated by Gensini score.
RESULTS: Serum 8-OHdG, number of stenotic branches, and Gensini score were all significantly increased in the CHD group. After adjustment for various factors, the number of stenotic branches and Gensini score remained positively correlated with 8-OHdG levels in the CHD group. Coronary artery lesions were significantly more severe in the CHD compared with the non-CHD group when 8-OHdG levels were >0.523 ng/mL. The number of stenotic branches and Gensini score were significantly independently associated with 8-OHdG levels in patients with T2DM.
CONCLUSIONS: 8-OHdG is a marker of oxidative DNA damage, and is highly associated with the extent of coronary artery lesions in ageing patients with T2DM.Trial registration: Registration number: 1.0/20170720; date of registration 26/07/2016 (retrospectively registered).
