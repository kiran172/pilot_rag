Title: Patient Outcomes After Unsuccessful Endoscopic Sialolith Extraction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate clinical outcomes following failed endoscopic extraction of salivary calculi and to assess any relation between clinical outcome and calculi location, number, size, and mobility. If sialendoscopy fails to extract the calculus, subsequent spontaneous passage of the calculus out of the ductoglandular system or secondary effects of sialendoscopy could mitigate the clinical impact of a residual sialolithiasis.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
METHODS: Prospective comparative study of endoscopic procedures for sialolithiasis performed in the Manukau Surgery Center, in Auckland, New Zealand, from 2010 to 2020. The recurrent symptoms and the variables related to the need for additional surgical intervention for salivary calculi were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the 465 sialendoscopy procedures, 154 (33.1%) were for obstructive sialolithiasis. Among these, there were 30 (19.4%) with unsuccessful stone extraction with re-operation for these failures performed in 14 of the 27 failed submandibular cases (52%) and 2 of the 3 parotids (66.7%). Location of calculi was a significant factor in predicting the need of further surgery. Patients with perihilar stones were 5 times more likely to have a failed procedure (P = .001). If the stone was intraglandular, the likelihood increased to 8.5 times (P = .005). The likelihood for a revision procedure increased almost 11 times if the stone was intraglandular (P = .004). Calculi size, mobility, multiple calculi, and presence of concurrent stenosis did not correlate with need for further surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of "failed" sialendoscopy did not require further intervention. Stone location was a significant factor in predicting a failed procedure and the need for re-intervention. Laryngoscope, 132:1029-1033, 2022.
