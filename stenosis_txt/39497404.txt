Title: [Clinical efficacy and its influencing factors of ustekinumab in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease].

Abstract: To analyze the clinical efficacy and its influencing factors of ustekinumab (UST) in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). From January 2021 to January 2024, CD patients who received UST treatment were retrospectively collected from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Harvey-Bradshaw index were applied to assess clinical activity of CD patients, C-reactive protein was used to evaluate biochemical remission rate, and simplified Crohn's disease endoscopy score was used to evaluate the degree of intestinal inflammation. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors for the clinical response rate at week 8, as well as the clinical remission rate and endoscopic remission rate at week 32. A total of 138 CD patients were included, including 93 males and 45 females. The age of diagnosis [M (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>)] was 24 (19, 32) years old. At week 8, the clinical response rate and biochemical remission rate was 58.0% and 49.3%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression model analysis showed that disease behavior (stenosis or penetration) was the risk factor of the clinical response rate at week 8 (OR=0.46, 95%CI: 0.23-0.95). The clinical remission rate and endoscopic remission rate at week 32 were 56.5% and 37.7%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression model analysis showed that disease behavior (stenosis or penetration) was the risk factor of the clinical remission rates (OR=0.18, 95%CI: 0.08-0.42) and endoscopic remission rates (OR=0.25, 95%CI: 0.11-0.55) at week 32. Failure to achieve clinical response at week 8 was the risk factor of the clinical remission rates (OR=0.21, 95%CI: 0.09-0.52) and endoscopic remission rates (OR=0.19, 95%CI: 0.07-0.50) at week 32. UST treatment has good clinical efficacy in CD patients. CD patients with intestinal stenosis or penetrating lesions can decrease the efficacy of UST treatment. Failure to achieve clinical response at week 8 can decrease the efficacy at week 32.
