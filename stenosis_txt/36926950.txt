Title: Duodenal stenosis surgical treatment in Crohn's disease.

Abstract: We present the case of a 34-year-old man with daily vomiting and 20% weight loss in a year. A gastroduodenoscopy was performed, noticing 2nd and 3rd duodenal portion dilatation and inflammatory involvement of the 3rd and 4th portion, causing luminal stenosis. These findings are the same than in the magnetic resonance . The biopsy proves the histological diagnosis of Crohn's disease. At the beginning the patient was treated with Prednisone, Adalimumab and Ustekinumab. After 9 months, surgery was decided because the disease was refractory to treatment and there was corticosteroid dependence. A partial resection of 3rd and 4th portion of the duodenum and the first loop of jejunum was performed, with duodenojejunal anastomosis. The patient presents good postoperative evolution and after 1 year he remained asymptomatic under treatment with Ustekinumab.
