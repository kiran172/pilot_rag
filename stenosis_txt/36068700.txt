Title: Economics of drug-coated balloons for arteriovenous fistula stenosis in Japan and Korea based on the IN.PACT AV access trial.

Abstract: AIM: The recent IN.PACT AV Access study found drug-coated balloon therapy to be associated with reduced reinterventions compared to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using standard balloons in the management of arteriovenous fistula stenosis. The economic implications of drug-coated balloon use in Asia, including Japan and Korea, remain unknown.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to calculate strategy-specific costs for Korea and Japan through 5-year follow-up. The analysis assumed maintained therapy benefit beyond current trial follow-up of 1 year in the base case, with several alternative scenarios explored in sensitivity analysis. Costs were derived from claims and reimbursement data, and projections were evaluated at 3 and 5 years post-index procedure.
RESULTS: Model-projected access circuit reintervention events for drug-coated versus standard balloons were 1.70 versus 2.76 (-1.06) and 2.53 versus 4.10 (-1.57) at 3 and 5 years in the base case. Corresponding 3- and 5-year costs were ₩6 211 103 versus ₩7 605 553 (-₩1 394 451) and ₩7 766 051 versus ₩10 124 954 (-₩2 358 904) in Korea, and ¥1 469 824 versus ¥1 504 161 (-¥34 337) and ¥1 956 931 versus ¥2 106 632 (-¥149 701) in Japan. In scenario analyses, drug-coated balloons remained cost saving at 3- and 5-year follow-up in Korea, but required up to 5 years to reach cost-savings in Japan. Drug-coated balloon use in reinterventions increased projected savings, as did younger treatment age.
CONCLUSION: Treatment of arteriovenous fistulas with the IN.PACT AV drug-coated balloon, based on preliminary data, may lead to meaningful reductions in reintervention costs that would render it cost-saving at timeframes of around 1 year in Korea and between 3 and 5 years in Japan.
