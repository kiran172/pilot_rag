Title: Importance of etiology in canalicular obstruction surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The treatment options for canalicular obstruction remain controversial, and there are different approaches. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the success of balloon dilatation and silicon tube intubation according to the etiology in patients with canalicular obstruction.
METHODS: The files of 91 patients with isolated monocanalicular obstruction were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped according to surgical methods (Group A: both balloon dilatation and silicon tube intubation; Group B: Only balloon dilatation) and etiologies (topical anti-glaucomatous usage-related, inflammatory, chemotherapy-related, radiotherapy-related, trauma-related, idiopathic). Preoperative and postoperative Munk scores and lacrimal irrigation results were noted in all cases.
RESULTS: Munk score was found to be statistically significantly lower in the 1st year in both groups. The patency rate with lacrimal syringing was found to be statistically significantly higher in group A. Success rates both in the munk score and lacrimal passage patency were found to be statistically significantly lower in inflammatory etiology than other etiologies.
CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques can be used as first-line therapies for canalicular obstruction. It should be considered that recurrence may develop in stenosis of inflammatory origin and more invasive surgery may be required.
