Title: Effect of body mass index on initial presentation and outcomes after stenting for quality of life-impairing chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The incidence of obesity has been increasing, with recent data indicating that the age-adjusted mean body mass index (BMI) is close to 30 kg/m2 in the United States. Prior studies have raised concerns for an increased incidence of chronic venous insufficiency in the obese population. We aimed to build on current knowledge by assessing the effects of BMI on the initial presentation and outcomes after intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) luminal area-guided stenting in patients presenting with quality of life (QOL)-impairing chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction (CIVO).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of contemporaneously entered electronic medical record data on 464 continuous patients (464 limbs) with initial iliofemoral stents (2014-2017) for QOL-impairing CIVO was performed. The characteristics evaluated and compared included the degree of iliofemoral compression, CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) clinical class, venous clinical severity score (VCSS), grade of swelling (GOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain score, ulcer healing, reflux (venous segmental disease score; venous filling index-90), calf pump function (ejection fraction; residual volume fraction), and quality of life (CIVIQ-20 [chronic lower limb venous insufficiency 20-item questionnaire]) for those with a BMI &lt;30 kg/m2 (group I) and a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (group II). Paired and unpaired t tests were used for comparisons of the clinical variables and a Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate stent patency.
RESULTS: Of the 464 limbs in the study cohort, 122 were in group I and 342 in group II. The median BMI was 26.3 kg/m2 (interquartile range, 19.6-29.9 kg/m2) in group I and 38.9 kg/m2 (interquartile range, 30.0-66.9 kg/m2) in group II. The IVUS luminal area-determined degree of compression was higher in group I than in group II across the common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral segments (P &lt; .01). The supine foot venous and femoral venous pressures were higher in group II than in group I (P &lt; .001). The ejection fraction was higher (57.4% vs 45.6%; P = .0008) and residual volume fraction was lower (27.5% vs 40.5%; P = .0008) in group II than in group I. Although the baseline VCSS and GOS were lower in group I than in group II (P &lt; .05), no differences were found in the VAS for pain scores or ulcer prevalence. The median follow-up was 22 months. At 24 months after stenting, improvement was found in the VCSS, GOS, and VAS for pain score in both groups. The CIVIQ-20 QOL score had improved from 58.1 to 18.8 in group I (P = .0002) and from 60 to 37.5 in group II (P &lt; .0001). At 5 years, primary patency was 70% in group I and 73% in group II (P = .6) and primary assisted patency was 100% in both groups (P = .99) without a significant difference in the reintervention rate (P = .5).
CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients with CIVO-impairing QOL have a lesser degree of iliofemoral venous stenosis, more severe venous hypertension, and better calf pump function than their nonobese counterparts. After stenting, no differences were found in the clinical, stent patency, or QOL-related outcomes between the two groups.
