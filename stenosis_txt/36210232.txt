Title: Recovery of gland function after endoscopy-assisted removal of impacted hilo-parenchymal stones in the Wharton's duct.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the gland function of patients following endoscopy-assisted removal of impacted hilo-parenchymal stones in the Wharton's duct. The study cohort comprised 115 patients who had undergone successful endoscopy-assisted lithotomy for hilo-parenchymal stones (mean diameter 7.7 mm). Gland function was evaluated at a mean 12 months after surgery using ultrasonography, sialography, and/or sialometry. Postoperative ultrasonography of 51 affected glands revealed a regular gland size in 58.8%, normal parenchyma density in 51.0%, and ductal ectasia in 80.4%. Postoperative sialograms of 109 affected glands were scored as type I (approximately normal) in 13 cases, type II (saccular ectasia of the hilo-parenchymal duct with/without stenosis, and no contrast retention) in 64, type III (saccular ectasia of the hilo-parenchymal duct with/without stenosis, and mild contrast retention) in 23, and type IV (poor shape of the main duct with evident contrast retention) in nine cases. The existence of ductal ectasia corresponded well to larger stone cases (P = 0.002). In the postoperative sialometry of 35 patients with unilateral stones, differences between the two sides were insignificant (P > 0.05). For patients with hilo-parenchymal submandibular gland stones, endoscopy-assisted surgery and extended postoperative follow-up help preserve the gland with good function.
