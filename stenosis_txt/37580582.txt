Title: Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy for benign and malignant biliary disease using a novel short single-operator cholangioscope.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The length of conventional single-use cholangioscopes poses a challenge for percutaneous or laparoscopic approaches for direct visualization of the biliary tract. The aim of this retrospective observational clinical study was to assess the use of a dedicated percutaneous short single-operator cholangioscope (PSSOC) for diagnosis and treatment of benign or malignant biliary diseases.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database including all consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy with the PSSOC between 06/2021 and 01/2023.
RESULTS: Forty patients were included (22F/18 M, age 58.7 ± 16.7 years). The diagnostic and therapeutic management plan was based on procedural findings. Indications were bile duct obstruction associated with complex anatomy (n = 13), choledocholithiasis (n = 11), suspected malignant stenosis of the biliary tract (n = 11), biliary stent placement (n = 2) and removal (n = 1), and failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (n = 2). The cholangioscopies were diagnostic (n = 5), therapeutic (n = 20) or both simultaneously (n = 15). The most frequent procedures were electrohydraulic lithotripsy (n = 25) and biopsy sampling (n = 12). Complications occurred in 7 cases (17.5%), including cholangitis (n = 4, B2), pleural perforation (n = 1, B2), portal bleeding (n = 1, B3), and Tako-Tsubo syndrome (n = 1, B3), classified according to the Society of Interventional Radiology classification. Intraprocedural visual diagnosis was confirmed by the histopathologic result in 11/12 patients in which biopsies were performed (91.7%). PSSOC was relevant to avoid surgery in 2 patients (5%) with indeterminate strictures, allowing to rule out malignancy and treat the lithiasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct visualization of the biliary tract enabled targeted biopsies for histopathological diagnosis. The visual and histopathological diagnoses were concordant in all but one case. Percutaneous cholangioscopy with a dedicated PSSOC allows to optimize identification and treatment of complex biliary disease including biliary lithiasis while assessing bile duct patency. The clinical use of the novel PSSOC system was safe and effective and could prevent surgical exploration in select patients.
