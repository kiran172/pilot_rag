Title: Biventricular Repair Conversion After Temporary One and a Half Ventricular Repair for Hypoplastic Right Ventricle.

Abstract: This case was an infant with critical pulmonary stenosis at birth. A temporary one and a half ventricular repair was performed to increase right ventricular end-diastolic volume and the size of the tricuspid valve annulus before biventricular repair conversion. The one and a half ventricular repair was performed using a unidirectional bicaval Glenn anastomosis. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume at 3 years was 73.2% of normal value but with a 64/36 right/left lung perfusion ratio. An anatomic biventricular correction included removal of the bicaval Glenn shunt and reconstruction of the continuity between the right and main pulmonary arteries. The one and a half ventricular repair made the reconstruction feasible.
