Title: Validation of angiography-derived Murray law-based quantitative flow reserve (μQFR) against pressure-derived instantaneous wave-free ratio for assessing coronary lesions, a single-center study in Egypt.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Instantaneous wave-free ratio (iwFR) is a well-validated method for functional evaluation of intermediate coronary lesions. A recently developed Murray law-based QFR (µQFR) allows wire-free FFR estimation using a high-quality single angiographic projection. We aim to determine the diagnostic accuracy of µQFR as compared to wire-based iwFR for physiological assessment of coronary lesions in a sample of Egyptian patients.
RESULTS: Over a one-year period, patients who previously underwent iwFR assessment of an intermediate coronary stenosis (40-90%) were retrospectively included. μQFR analysis was then performed offline using a dedicated artificial intelligence (AI)-aided computation software. All the measurements were performed blinded to iwFR results, and the agreement between iwFR and μQFR values was tested. Forty-nine patients (mean age 57.9 ± 9 years, 72.9% males) were included. Mean value of iwFR and μQFR was 0.90 ± 0.075 and 0.79 ± 0.129, respectively. There was a significant moderate positive linear correlation between μQFR and iwFR (r = 0.47, p = 0.001; 95% CI 0.22-0.68) with moderate-to-substantial agreement between the two methods (Kappa 0.6). In assessing the diagnostic accuracy of μQFR, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% CI 0.717-0.962) for predicting functionally significant lesions defined as iwFR < 0.89. The sensitivity and specificity of μQFR < 0.8 for detecting physiological significance of coronary lesions were 89% and 74% with positive and negative predictive values of 70 and 91%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: µQFR has good diagnostic accuracy for predicting functionally significant coronary lesions with moderate correlation and agreement with the gold standard iwFR. Angiography-derived µQFR could be a promising tool for improving the utilization of physiology-guided revascularization.
