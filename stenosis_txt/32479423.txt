Title: Rotatripsy: A Hybrid "Drill and Disrupt" Approach for Treating Heavily Calcified Coronary Lesions.

Abstract: In balloon-uncrossable calcified lesions, rotational atherectomy (RA) is the first-line modality to enable operators to advance balloons and stents over the stenosis. If the lesion is undilatable after RA, a hybrid approach with additional intracoronary lithotripsy (rotatripsy) can be an effective approach that further modifies the calcified plaque and enables stent delivery.
