Title: Argon plasma coagulation for Barrett's esophagus with low-grade dysplasia: a randomized trial with long-term follow-up on the impact of power setting and proton pump inhibitor dose.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the impact of power setting and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) dose on efficacy and safety of argon plasma coagulation (APC) of Barrett's esophagus (BE) with low-grade dysplasia (LGD). METHODS : 71 patients were randomized to APC with power set at 90 W or 60 W followed by 120 mg or 40 mg omeprazole. The primary outcome was the rate of complete (endoscopic and histologic) ablation of BE at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included safety and long-term efficacy. RESULTS : Complete ablation rate in the 90 W/120 mg, 90 W/40 mg, and 60 W/120 mg groups was 78 % (18/23; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 61-95), 60 % (15/25; 95 %CI 41-79), 74 % (17/23; 95 %CI 56-92), respectively, at 6 weeks and 70 % (16/23; 95 %CI 51-88), 52 % (13/25; 95 %CI 32-72), and 65 % (15/23; 95 %CI 46-85) at 2 years post-treatment (differences not significant). Additional APC was required in 28 patients (23 residual and 5 recurrent BE). At median follow-up of 108 months, 66/71 patients (93 %; 95 %CI 87-99) maintained complete ablation. No high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma developed. Overall, adverse events (97 % mild) did not differ significantly between groups. Chest pain/discomfort was more frequent in patients receiving 90 W vs. 60 W power (P &lt; 0.001). One patient had esophageal perforation and two developed stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: APC power setting and PPI dose did not impact efficacy and safety of BE ablation. Complete ablation of BE with LGD was durable in > 90 % of patients, without any evidence of neoplasia progression in the long term.
