Title: Ortner's Syndrome Due to Giant Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm.

Abstract: Ortner's syndrome is hoarseness of the voice caused by enlarged cardiac structures compressing the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (LRLN). The LRLN is vulnerable for impingement by cardiac structures due to its anatomical course. LRLN is longer and it hooks below the arch of the aorta, posterior to the ligamentum arteriosum before ascending toward the tracheo- esophageal groove. Ortner's syndrome has been commonly described with left atrial enlargement due to mitral stenosis; however, other causes like aortic aneurysm, pulmonary artery aneurysm, and aortic dissection have been described. Although rare, hoarseness of the voice could be the only presenting complaint in aortic aneurysms as in the case described herein.
