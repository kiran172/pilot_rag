Title: Predictive value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio for primary patency of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the potential association of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) with the primary patency of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula (AVF) stenosis.
METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective review of patients with end-stage renal disease referred for hemodialysis AVF stenosis in one center. The study consisted of 114 patients with significant (significant stenosis was defined as a reduction in the caliber of the fistula vein of &gt; 50% with respect to the non-aneurysmal venous segment). AVF stenosis patients were treated with PTA, with conventional balloon angioplasty. The NLR and PLR were calculated from the pre-interventional blood samples. The patients were classified into two groups: group A, primary patency &lt; 12 months (n = 35) and group B, and primary patency ≥ 12 months (n = 79). Comparisons between the groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare the factors, NLR and PLR, for association with primary patency AVFs. A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify the sensitivity and specificity of the NLR and PLR cut-off values in the prediction of primary patency time.
RESULTS: There was no difference in gender; age; side of AVF; AVF type; comorbid diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension; or blood parameters such as white cell count, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, C-reactive protein, NLR, or PLR between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). There was also no significant difference in the patency rate between the NLR &lt; 4.13 and NLR ≥ 4.13 groups at 12 months (NLR cut-off point = 4.13, p = 0.273). There were statistically significant differences between the primary patency rates of the PLR &lt; 187.86 and PLR ≥ 187.86 groups at 12 months (PLR cut-off point = 187.86, p = 0.023). The cut-off value for PLR for the determination of primary patency was 187.86, with a sensitivity of 57.0% and specificity of 34.4%.
CONCLUSION: An increased level of PLR may be a risk factor for the development of early AVF restenosis after successful PTA. However, more studies are needed to validate this finding.
