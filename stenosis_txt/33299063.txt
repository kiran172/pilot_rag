Title: Carotid imaging changes and serum IL-1β, sICAM-1, and sVAP-1 levels in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

Abstract: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo. This study was performed to evaluate serum levels of inflammatory factors and changes in B-mode carotid ultrasound findings in patients with BPPV. The study population consisted of 90 BPPV patients and 90 age- and sex-matched controls. ELISA was used to compare the levels of inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), prostaglandin-E2 (PG-E2), and soluble vascular adhesion protein-1 (sVAP-1), between BPPV patients and controls. In addition, the results of ultrasonographic imaging to determine carotid intima-media thickness (C-IMT), carotid atheromatous plaque, and vertebral artery stenosis were also compared between the BPPV and control groups. Serum levels of IL-1β, sICAM-1, and sVAP-1 were significantly higher in BPPV patients than controls (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, and P < 0.001, respectively). C-IMT and vertebral artery stenosis were significantly different in BPPV patients compared to controls (both P < 0.05). There were no significant relations between other parameters and BPPV. IL-1β, sICAM-1, and sVAP-1 are potentially associated with the pathogenesis of BPPV, and C-ITM and carotid vertebral stenosis may be useful reference imaging findings for the diagnosis of BPPV.
