Title: Risk factors for migration of retrievable covered expandable metallic stent in patients with persistent benign ureter strictures.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and salvage management of retrievable covered expandable metallic stent (RCEMS) migration in patients with persistent benign ureter strictures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 117 consecutive patients who underwent implantation of RCEMS. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify prognostic factors for stent migration, including stricture location and length, hydronephrosis-cortex ratio, ureteral dilation, and the diameter of the narrowest portion of the stricture.
RESULTS: Stent migration occurred in 22 (19.5%) of 113 patients who met inclusion criteria. Of the 22 patients, 16 (72.7%) had ordinary ureteral stricture, 3 (13.6%) had stricture in transplanted kidneys, and 3 patients (13.6%) had ureter stricture in orthotopic neobladders. The mean creatinine for the entire cohorts showed significant improvement (p = 0.038). Multivariate analysis identified the following prognostic factors for migration: distal ureteral stricture (p = 0.006), patients who underwent balloon dilation (p = 0.003), hydronephrosis-cortex ratio ≧10 (p = 0.017), larger diameter of wasting of RCEMS (p < 0.001), and patients with a shorter stricture length (p = 0.006). Salvage management was required in 4 of the 22 patients. The strictures in the remaining 18 patients improved with observation.
CONCLUSIONS: Stent migration is more likely to occur in patients with the five prognostic factors mentioned above. Our study developed a nomogram to predict stent migration in patients with ureteral strictures treated using RCEMS.
