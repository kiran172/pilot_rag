Title: Cerebral Air Embolism and Vasospasm after Carotid Revascularization: A Case Report.

Abstract: Cerebral air embolism can be of venous and arterial origin and cause severe medical complication. Vasospasm is a severe complication of carotid artery stenting. We report a 63-year-old male with severe carotid artery stenosis who suddenly died due to acute myocardial infarction during carotid artery stenting. His brain computed tomogram showed a remarkable amount of air in the gyriform spaces, and the cerebral angiogram showed vasospasm in the internal carotid artery resulting from stent manipulation. Presence of gyriform air could be caused by air entering the catheter due to sudden collapse after acute myocardial infarction and severe carotid vasospasm.
