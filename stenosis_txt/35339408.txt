Title: Prognostic value of computed tomography derived fractional flow reserve for predicting cardiac events and mortality in kidney transplant candidates.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac screening using coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in kidney transplant candidates before transplantation yields both diagnostic and prognostic information. Whether CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) analysis provides prognostic information is unknown. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of FFR<sub>CT</sub> for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and all-cause mortality in kidney transplant candidates.
METHODS: Among 553 consecutive kidney transplant candidates, 340 CCTA scans (61%) were evaluated with FFR<sub>CT</sub> analysis. Patients were categorized into groups based on lowest distal FFR<sub>CT</sub>; normal &gt;0.80, intermediate 0.80-0.76, and low ≤0.75. In patients with ≥50% stenosis, a lesion-specific FFR<sub>CT</sub> was defined as; normal &gt;0.80 and abnormal ≤0.80. The primary endpoint was MACE (cardiac death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction or revascularization). The secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 3.3 years [2.0-5.1]. MACE occurred in 28 patients (8.2%), 29 patients (8.5%) died. When adjusting for risk factors and transplantation during follow-up, MACE occurred more frequently in patients with distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤0.75 compared to patients with distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt;0.80: Hazard Ratio (HR): 3.8 (95%CI: 1.5-9.7), p ​&lt; ​0.01. In the lesion-specific analysis with &lt;50% stenosis as reference, patients with lesion-specific FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt;0.80 had a HR for MACE of 1.5 (95%CI: 0.4-4.8), p ​= ​0.55 while patients with lesion-specific FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤0.80 had a HR of 6.0 (95%CI: 2.5-14.4), p ​&lt; ​0.01. Abnormal FFR<sub>CT</sub> values were not associated with increased mortality.
CONCLUSION: In kidney transplant candidates, abnormal FFR<sub>CT</sub> values were associated with increased MACE but not mortality. Use of FFR<sub>CT</sub> may improve cardiac evaluation prior to transplantation.
