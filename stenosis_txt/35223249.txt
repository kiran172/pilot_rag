Title: Outcomes of Endovascular Stenting in Symptomatic Vertebral Artery Ostial Stenosis.

Abstract: Vertebral artery ostial stenosis is implicated in one-fifth of all posterior circulation cerebrovascular accidents. However, uniform treatment guidelines and data on the different treatment modalities are still lacking. Endovascular stenting is an emerging therapy for symptomatic vertebral artery ostial stenosis when medical management fails. This manuscript will examine the safety and efficacy of endovascular revascularization with drug-eluting stents in a series of ten consecutive patients that had failed medical management. We also report the rate of complications and in-stent restenosis, as well as the rate of recurrent cerebrovascular accidents.
