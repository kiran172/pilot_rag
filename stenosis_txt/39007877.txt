Title: Application of apical myocardial perfusion quantitative analysis by contrast-enhanced ultrasound utilizing high-frequency linear probe.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Due to insufficient near-field resolution and artifacts, it is challenging to evaluate the left ventricular apical perfusion with phased-array probes. By combining high-frequency linear probe and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), imaging of apical myocardial perfusion could be improved. The study aims to evaluate the preliminary application of CEUS by high-frequency linear probes to assess the apical perfusion.
METHODS: The study enrolled retrospectively 91 patients to test the feasibility of the novel method. In protocol 1, patients were stratified into a group with left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis (N = 40) and a group without LAD stenosis or coronary artery disease (N = 41) based on the degree of coronary artery narrowing, quantified by >50% stenosis in coronary angiography. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to test the diagnostic value of perfusion parameters. In protocol 2, the reproducibility of high-frequency linear probe in apical perfusion analysis was compared with the conventional phased-array probe in 30 patients.
RESULTS: (1) The novel method is feasible in 81(89.01%) patients. (2) In protocol 1, to detect LAD stenosis, the best cut-off of β, T, A, and MBF were 10.32, 3.28, 9.39, and 4.99, respectively. Area under the curve of β, T, A, and MBF were .880, .881, .761, and .880, respectively. (3) In protocol 2, compared with phased-array probe, the quantitative analysis of high-frequency linear probe is of high reproducibility and could get good curve fitting (R2 = .29 vs. R2 = .71, P &lt; .01).
CONCLUSION: Observation of apical perfusion using this method is feasible and quantitative analysis allows an accurate and convenient identification of LAD stenosis. This method provides an alternative for patients who have difficulties in visualizing the apical region with a phased-array probe.
