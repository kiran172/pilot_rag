Title: Minimally Invasive Surgery for Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome and Celiac Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a pathology commonly reported in educational literature, although in reality it is scarcely seen. Herein, we present the case of a 48-year-old female patient who presented with nausea, vomiting, and unintentional weight loss. After thorough work up of her symptoms through a variety of different modalities, MALS was confirmed and she underwent surgical release via a minimally invasive approach. The authors of this article feel that this case is important to present due to paucity of reported cases in the literature. In addition, this patient was exceptionally unique to report as we selected to perform a slight adaptation of a minimally invasive approach, while there are multiple different treatment techniques and management plans that have previously been described in a variety of different literatures and require further discussion.
