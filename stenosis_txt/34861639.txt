Title: Acute pulmonary edema in a dog with severe pulmonary valve stenosis: A rare complication after balloon valvuloplasty.

Abstract: Pulmonic stenosis is a frequent congenital heart disease in dogs, and the treatment of choice is balloon valvuloplasty which is usually safe and successful. The authors describe for the first time a severe complication after balloon valvuloplasty in a five-month-old dog. After effective treatment, with a considerable drop in right ventricular pressures, the dog developed hypoxemia and dyspnea due to pulmonary edema. The dog underwent intensive care and symptoms improved after a few hours of oxygen therapy, continuous positive airway pressure, and furosemide. Although this event is rare, it could have a large impact on patient survival and should be considered in the treatment of severe pulmonary valve stenosis in the future.
