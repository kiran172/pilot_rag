Title: Relationship between valvular structure and biochemical indices of non-valvular atrial fibrillation and senile degenerative valvular heart disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a common clinical condition in geriatric-related cardiovascular diseases that is connected to heart dysfunction. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia. Considering these two common clinical conditions, so far no sufficient data on the relationship between degenerative VHD and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). We aimed to explore the relationship between valvular structure and biochemistry of nonvalvular AF and degenerative valvular heart disease in the elderly.
METHODS: In our study, 234 VHD patients who were diagnosis evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography were enrolled in this retrospective study from January 2015 and December 2018. Significant valvular diseases were defined according to ACC/AHA Classification as any moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR), aortic regurgitation (AR), tricuspid stenosis, regurgitation, or aortic stenosis (AS). Data on relevant laboratory indicators were also collected.
RESULTS: A total of 234 patients with degenerative VHD were enrolled, of whom 81 had NVAF and 153 had sinus rhythm. Gender, smoking history, and some comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, and renal dysfunction, did not differ significantly between the two groups, but there were significant differences in age and hypertension {79 [74-83] vs. 70 [65-79] years} After propensity-score matching (PSM), we identified 68 VHD patients with NVAF and 68 VHD patients without NVAF. The NVAF + VHD had higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (2.94±0.84 vs. 2.26±1.33 mmol/L, P=0.001), lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [1.03 (0.89-1.34) vs. 1.56 (0.99-2.71) mmol/L, P&lt;0.001], and higher uric acid (UA) (438.18±145.83 vs. 376.67±148.03 µmol/L, P=0.02) than the VHD group. The ejection fraction (EF) of the NVAF + VHD group was lower than that of the VHD group {63 [51-68] vs. 66 [62-69], P=0.013}. In addition, the left atrial size, MR, and calcification of the NVAF + VHD group were higher than those of the VHD group.
CONCLUSIONS: Pronounced MR, valve calcification and hyperlipidemia were more likely in VHD patients with NVAF. These structures and biomarkers changes maybe important clinical parameters for disease prevention and management, which indicate early drug intervention to AF and hyperlipidemia is necessary.
