Title: [Endovascular aortic replacement in a patient with bicuspid aortic valve disease].

Abstract: A 49-year-old male with a history of left ventricular systolic function dilated cardiomyopathy and severe symptomatic bicuspid aortic stenosis recently diagnosed (syncope, chest pain and dyspnea) was admitted to the coronary care unit. During hospitalization, he developed cardiogenic shock requiring double inotropic support. High surgical risk and an elevated chance of graft rejection contraindicated surgical replacement or heart transplant. We performed a transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a favorable evolution.
