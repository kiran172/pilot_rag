Title: Predictors for all-cause mortality in men after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A report from the LAPLACE-TAVI registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Information regarding the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in men is limited. This study aimed to investigate short- to mid-term outcomes and prognostic predictors in this population.
METHOD AND RESULTS: The data of 519 men were analyzed from 1,693 consecutive patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR at six hospitals between April 2010 and July 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 days after TAVR. The mean age and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score were 83.7 ± 5.9 years and 6.3 ± 4.7%, respectively. Overall, 23.5% of patients consumed alcohol with a frequency of > 1 drinks/week, and 12.1% consumed alcohol with a frequency of > 8 drinks/week, while 66.1% were former smokers and 4.2% were current smokers. Mortality at 30 days was 0.8%. During the median follow-up period of 448 days, the estimated survival rates at 1 year post-TAVR was 90.7 ± 1.4%. In multivariate analysis, the serum albumin level [hazard ratio (HR): 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.36-3.62, p = 0.001], atrial fibrillation (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.13-2.82, p = 0.012), and STS score (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.06-1.67, p = 0.015) were independently associated with all-cause mortality following TAVR. Adjusted hazard ratios of current smoking, heavy drinking, and presence of cancer were 1.05 (95% CI: 0.36-2.98),1.37 (95% CI: 0.75-2.48), and 1.13 (95% CI: 0.75-2.48), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that serum albumin levels, atrial fibrillation, and STS score were independently associated with all-cause mortality following TAVR in men.
