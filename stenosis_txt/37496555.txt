Title: Malignant Airway Obstruction and Endobronchial Stent Placement: A Systematic Review on the Efficacy and Safety.

Abstract: The systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endobronchial stent placement for malignant airway obstruction.  A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases to identify relevant studies. Cohort studies, randomized controlled trials, and case-control studies examining the outcomes of endobronchial stent placement in patients with malignant airway obstruction were included. Data on pre-treatment evaluation, such as pulmonary function testing, dyspnea severity scoring systems, arterial blood gas parameters, imaging, and degree of obstruction, were also collected. Primary outcomes of interest included post-procedure stenosis, pulmonary function testing evaluation, blood gas parameters, and survival outcomes. Secondary outcomes encompassed improvements in clinical status, dyspnea grade, and procedure-related complications. A total of 27 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. The included studies demonstrated promising outcomes of endobronchial stent placement in managing malignant airway obstruction. Post-procedure airway diameters, pulmonary function testing, and blood gas parameters improved significantly. Survival outcomes varied among studies. Furthermore, endobronchial stent placement was associated with improvements in clinical status and dyspnea grade. Procedure-related complications ranged from pain, hemoptysis and mucus plugging to stent obstruction, migration and pneumothorax.  This systematic review suggests that endobronchial stent placement is an effective and safe intervention for managing malignant airway obstruction. It offers significant improvements in post-procedure stenosis, pulmonary function testing, blood gas parameters, and clinical outcomes. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and standardized reporting are warranted to better evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of endobronchial stent placement for malignant airway obstruction.
