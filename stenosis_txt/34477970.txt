Title: The diagnostic value of Doppler ultrasonography after pediatric kidney transplantation.

Abstract: Ultrasonography (US) plays a major diagnostic role in the pre- and post-transplant evaluation of recipient and donor. In most cases, US remains the only necessary imaging modality. After pediatric kidney transplantation, US can ensure immediate bedside diagnosis of vessel patency and possible postoperative non-vascular complications. Criteria for US diagnosis of kidney vessel thrombosis and stenosis in the transplant will be presented. Non-vascular complications after kidney transplantation include hydronephrosis, hematoma, lymphocele, and abscess. US can detect suggestive, but nevertheless non-specific, acute signs (sudden increase in volume and elevated resistive index), and chronic rejection, which therefore remains a histological diagnosis. US is of little or no help in detection of tubular necrosis or drug toxicity, but it can exclude other differential diagnoses. This educational review provides a practical and systematic approach to a multimodal US investigation of the kidney transplant. It includes a short overview on possible indications for contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in children after kidney transplantation.
