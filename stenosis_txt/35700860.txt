Title: A Comparison of Different Endovascular Treatment for Vertebral Artery Origin Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of stenting with drug-eluting stent (DES), stenting with bare mental stent (BMS), and angioplasty alone with drug-coated balloon (DCB) in patients with symptomatic vertebral artery origin stenosis (VAOS) who did not respond to aggressive medical management.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with symptomatic VAOS who underwent endovascular treatment between December 2018 and November 2021 at our institution. The main outcome compared were technical success, perioperative complications, residual stenosis, stroke recurrence, progression of residual stenosis, and restenosis.
RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were included: 29 were stented with DES, 12 were stented with BMS, and 5 received angioplasty alone with DCB. Technical success was achieved in 100%, 100%, and 60%, respectively (P = 0.008). Residual stenosis was 10.8%, 20.2%, and 51.2%, respectively (P < 0.001). Perioperative complications occurred only in 1 case in the DES group (P = 1.00). During a mean follow-up of 14.1 months, stroke recurrence rate was 6.9%, 16.7%, and 0% respectively (P = 0.73). Absolute progression of residual stenosis was 10.1%, 34.9%, and -8.0%, respectively (P < 0.001). Restenosis rate was 6.9%, 50.0%, and 20.0%, respectively (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic VAOS who did not respond to aggressive medical management, stenting with DES shows superiority in the lowering the restenosis rate compared with stenting with BMS. Angioplasty alone with DCB is associated with the slowest progression of stenosis in spite of moderate residual stenosis.
