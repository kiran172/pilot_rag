Title: [Chronic respiratory failure correction in cicatricial laryngeal and tracheal stenosis using helium-oxygen mixture].

Abstract: The article provides a review of the literature on the development of chronic respiratory failure in patients with chronic cicatricial stenosis of the larynx and cervical trachea. The authors provide data on the etiology, pathogenetic features of the course of cicatricial stenosis of the larynx and trachea, the reasons for the development of chronic respiratory failure, the effect of hypoxemia on general metabolic processes in the body and on regeneration processes, as well as on methods of their correction and improvement of the postoperative period. The methods of respiratory impact on chronic respiratory failure in these patients are considered, based on the experience of a number of researchers and technical advances in recent years.
