Title: Comparison of different pulmonary valve reconstruction techniques during transannular repair of tetralogy of fallot.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transannular patch, which results in pulmonary insufficiency (PI), is usually required during repair of tetralogy of fallot (TOF). In this study, we compared three types of pulmonary valve reconstruction techniques during transannular repair of TOF.
METHODS: Between February 2014 and January 2018, 50 patients with TOF underwent primary repair with transannular patch. These patients were divided into three groups. In Group 1, (n = 15), a single gluteraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch (standard method) was reconstructed as monocusp. In Group 2, (n = 16) Nunn's bileaflet pulmonary valve reconstruction technique was used with pericardial patch. In Group 3, (n = 19), Nunn's bileaflet technique was performed with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. The outcomes of the patients and early and midterm competency of the pulmonary valves were analyzed.
RESULTS: These techniques were significantly effective in early postoperative period. Freedom from moderate to severe PI were 73.3%; 100% and 89.4%, respectively. Mortality, duration of intensive care unit and hospital stay were similar between the groups. The mean follow-up period was 17.5 ± 13.0 (3-57) months. Freedom from moderate to severe PI decreased to 40%; 81.2% and 73.7%, respectively at the end of the follow-up period. Presence of moderate to severe PI was significantly higher in Group 1 (p = .018 between Groups 1 and 2, p = .048 between Groups 1 and 3).
CONCLUSION: All three pulmonary valve reconstruction techniques provided competent pulmonary valves. Nunn's bileaflet technique had better outcome at midterm. It has a potential to delay right ventricular dysfunction at long-term.
