Title: Diagnostic value of nocturnal trend changes in a dynamic electrocardiogram for coronary heart disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnostic value of intermittent changes in the nocturnal ST segment trend graph in a dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) for coronary heart disease (CHD).
METHODS: A total of 205 patients who underwent coronary angiography were included in this retrospective study. The study sample was determined through a power analysis aimed at achieving power of 80% with a significance level of 0.05. The participants were divided into the CHD (n = 101) and the non-CHD (n = 104) group, based on the degree of coronary artery diameter stenosis. The morphological changes in the ST segment trend graph were observed and divided into two categories: 'wall-shaped' and 'peak-shaped' changes.
RESULTS: Among the 205 patients, 94 had nocturnal ST segment dynamic changes and 111 did not. The detection rate of CHD without nocturnal ST segment dynamic changes was 21.59%, significantly lower than the detection rate of 93.18% in those with nocturnal ST segment changes, reflecting a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The positive rate of ST segment in patients with single-vessel disease (71.88%) was lower than in patients with multi-vessel disease (78.57%), and both differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The duration of ST segment trend graph changes in 94 cases in the CHD group with intermittent changes in the nocturnal ST segment trend graph was higher than in the non-CHD group, but no significant difference was observed (P > 0.05). The detection rate of CHD in the peak-shaped dynamic change group of the nocturnal ST segment trend graph was significantly higher (76/82) than in the wall-shaped (6/82) dynamic change group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Peak-shaped changes in the nocturnal ST segment trend graph indicate coronary artery lesions. Nocturnal ST segment changes observed through dynamic ECG monitoring can serve as a valuable non-invasive predictor for CHD, providing a feasible method for early diagnosis and intervention in clinical practice.
