Title: The Fate of Homograft Versus Polytetrafluoroethylene Conduits After Neonatal Truncus Arteriosus Repair.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite significant improvement in outcomes with truncus arteriosus (TA) repair, right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction with a right ventricular to pulmonary artery (RV-to-PA) conduit remains a source of long-term reintervention and reoperation. This study evaluated our experience with reintervention in homograft and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) RV-to-PA conduits in neonates.
METHODS: Primary TA repairs from 2004 to 2016 at a single institution were included. Stratification was based on RVOT reconstruction with PTFE or homograft conduit. Primary outcome was operative conduit replacement. Secondary outcomes included the rates and types of catheter-based conduit interventions.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients underwent primary TA repair and 89.3% (n = 25) of them had RVOT reconstruction with a homograft (28.0%, n = 7) or PTFE (72.0%, n = 18) conduit. Rates of reoperation for conduit replacement and catheter-based interventions were similar between those with PTFE and homograft conduits (85.7% vs 72.2%, P = .49 and 57.1% vs 83.3%, P = .11, respectively). Additionally, the median time to conduit replacement and catheter-based conduit interventions were comparable. In multivariable analysis, conduit size, but not conduit type, was a predictor of conduit revision (hazard ratio: 1.66, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-2.49, P = .02). At five-year and ten-year follow-up, patients with PTFE conduits had better survival than those with homograft conduits (100.0% vs 71.4%, P = .02); however, no mortalities were associated with conduit reoperations or catheter-based reinterventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Polytetrafluoroethylene and homograft RVOT reconstruction in neonatal TA repair demonstrate similar durability as defined by reoperation and reintervention rates. The validation of the durability of PTFE conduits in neonatal TA repair requires confirmatory studies in larger cohorts.
