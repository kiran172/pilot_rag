Title: Association between remnant cholesterol and progression of bioprosthetic valve degeneration.

Abstract: AIMS: Remnant cholesterol (RC) seems associated with native aortic stenosis. Bioprosthetic valve degeneration may share similar lipid-mediated pathways with aortic stenosis. We aimed to investigate the association of RC with the progression of bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration and ensuing clinical outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 203 patients with a median of 7.0 years (interquartile range: 5.1-9.2) after surgical aortic valve replacement. RC concentration was dichotomized by the top RC tertile (23.7 mg/dL). At 3-year follow-up, 121 patients underwent follow-up visit for the assessment of annualized change in aortic valve calcium density (AVCd). RC levels showed a curvilinear relationship with an annualized progression rate of AVCd, with increased progression rates when RC >23.7 mg/dL (P = 0.008). There were 99 deaths and 46 aortic valve re-interventions in 133 patients during a median clinical follow-up of 8.8 (8.7-9.6) years. RC >23.7 mg/dL was independently associated with mortality or re-intervention (hazard ratio: 1.98; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-2.99; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elevated RC is independently associated with faster progression of bioprosthetic valve degeneration and increased risk of all-cause mortality or aortic valve re-intervention.
