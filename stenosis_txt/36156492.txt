Title: Endovascular therapy for steno-occlusive subclavian artery disease early and long-term outcomes in a multicentric Tunisian study.

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the outcomes of endovascular therapy in patients with subclavian steno-occlusive disease over the short and long term in a Tunisian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent endovascular treatment of subclavian artery (SCA) steno-occlusive disease between 2013 and 2019 in three Tunisian centers were evaluated retrospectively. After treatment, patients were follow-up was scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively and annually afterwards by Doppler ultrasound and clinical findings. Primary outcomes included technical, clinical procedural success rates and limb salvage rate. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of periprocedural complications and primary patency rates.
RESULTS: 56 patients (33 males, 58.9%) were evaluated. Patients' mean age was 61.5 + years. Technical success rate was 94.6 %, being 100% in case of stenosis and 78.5% in case of occlusion. The technical success rate was 94.6%. The clinical success rate was 100% and the upper limb salvage rate was 100%. Minor amputations were performed on 5 patients. Perioperative mortality and morbidity rates were 0% and 8.9% respectively. Mean follow-up was 26.7Â±16.4 months (range 12-86 months). Two in-stent restenosis occurred (at 12 and 15 months) and one case of thrombosis at the 16th month. The primary patency rates were 88.7%+4.3% at the end of the first year and 78.7%+6.1% at 3 years.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment can be considered as a safe and effective treatment of SCA steno-occlusive disease, with low perioperative complication rates and a good patency rates over long term.
