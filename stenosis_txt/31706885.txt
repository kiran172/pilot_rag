Title: Treatment of Arm Swelling in Hemodialysis Patients with Ipsilateral Arteriovenous Access and Central Vein Stenosis: Conversion to the Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow Graft versus Stent Deployment.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare outcomes after conversion of arteriovenous (AV) access to Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) graft vs stent deployment in patients with arm swelling owing to ipsilateral central vein stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective study comprised 48 patients (19 men, mean age 58 y) with arm swelling ipsilateral to AV access and central vein stenosis over a 13-year period who had clinical follow-up and without prior central stents. Twenty-one patients underwent placement of a HeRO graft with anastomosis of the HeRO graft to the existing graft or fistula, and 27 patients underwent central venous stent deployment. Symptomatic improvement in arm swelling and access patency rates after intervention were ascertained from medical records.
RESULTS: Improvement in swelling within 1 month after HeRO conversion and stent deployment was found in 95% and 89%, respectively (P = .62). Swelling eventually recurred in 16 patients (59%) treated with stents compared with 1 patient (5%) who underwent HeRO conversion (P < .001). Primary access patency was statistically significantly longer after HeRO conversions than stent deployments, with 6- and 12-month primary patency rates of 89% and 72% vs 47% and 11% (P < .001). HeRO conversions also resulted in longer 6- and 12-month secondary access patency rates (95% and 95% vs 79% and 58%, P = .006). Mean number of interventions per 1,000 access days to maintain secondary patency was 2.7 for the HeRO group vs 6.3 for the stent group.
CONCLUSIONS: Although stent deployment and HeRO graft conversion are effective for alleviating arm swelling in the short term in patients receiving hemodialysis with clinically significant arm swelling and functioning AV access, the HeRO graft has more durable results.
