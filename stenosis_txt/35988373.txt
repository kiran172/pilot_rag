Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To outline an expert-based consensus of recommendations for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with congenital tracheal stenosis.
METHODS: Expert opinions were sought from members of the International Pediatric Otolaryngology Group (IPOG) via completion of an 18-item survey utilizing an iterative Delphi method and review of the literature.
RESULTS: Forty-three members completed the survey providing recommendations regarding the initial history, clinical evaluation, diagnostic evaluation, temporizing measures, definitive repair, and post-repair care of children with congenital tracheal stenosis.
CONCLUSION: These recommendations are intended to be used to support clinical decision-making regarding the evaluation and management of children with congenital tracheal stenosis. Responses highlight the diverse management strategies and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to care of these patients.
