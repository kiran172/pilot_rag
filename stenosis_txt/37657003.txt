Title: Bevacizumab-induced arrhythmia in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma: A case report.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Cardiotoxicity is an important side effect of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors therapy in the treatment of cancer. Massive studies have shown bevacizumab-related hypertension, venous, and arterial thrombosis.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year-old female patient was treated with bevacizumab monotherapy for lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was detected a poor R-wave increase with slight ST segment elevation in V1-V3 leads, and ventricular arrhythmia.
DIAGNOSIS: The incidental arrhythmia caused by bevacizumab was considered.
INTERVENTIONS: The patients received aspirin and amiodarone (0.2â€‰g tid) to treat arrhythmia. After consultation with the cardiology department, the patient received a diagnostic coronary angiography. Coronary angiography showed 30% of the right coronary artery stenoses and no obvious organic stenosis in the left main artery, left anterior ascending, or left circumflex.
OUTCOMES: The patient exhibited disappearance of chest tightness and rapid heartbeat after the treatment of amiodarone. Electrocardiogram monitoring results returning to normal.
LESSONS: This is the first reported case of bevacizumab-associated arrhythmia. It is advisable to consider the risk of arrhythmia in bevacizumab monotherapy or combines treatment.
