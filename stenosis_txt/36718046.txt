Title: Long-term outcomes of carotid artery stenting in patients with carotid artery stenosis: A single-center 14-year retrospective analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is currently widely used for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. The objective of this study was to analyze the outcomes of CAS performed in a single institution.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 313 CAS cases from January 2007 to December 2020, including 206 (66%) symptomatic and 107 (34%) asymptomatic cases. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were assessed. Rates of periprocedural (≤30 days after CAS) and postprocedural ipsilateral strokes (>30 days after CAS) were also assessed. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for the periprocedural complication, in-stent restenosis (ISR), and ipsilateral stroke.
RESULTS: The success rate of CAS was 98%. Among 313 cases, 1 patient died due to hyperperfusion-related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The CAS-related mortality rate was 0.31%. The overall incidence of periprocedural complications is 5.1%. A risk factor for periprocedural complication was a symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (7.3% vs. 0.9%, p=0.016). Twenty cases of ISR occurred during 63.7±42.1 months of follow-up. The overall incidence of ISR was 10.2% (20/196). A risk factors for ISR were diabetes mellitus (17.6% vs. 5.7%, p=0.008) and patients who used Open-cell stents (19.6% vs. 6.9%, p=0.010). The overall incidence of ipsilateral stroke is 5.6%. A risk factors for ipsilateral stroke was ISR (95% CI, p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: CAS is a safe and effective procedure for carotid artery stenosis. Although the incidence of complications is low, fatal complication such as hyperperfusion- related ICH can occur. To prevent hyperperfusion-related ICH, several methods such as strict blood pressure (BP) control, intentional less widening of stenotic segment should be used. To prevent ISR or stroke occurrence, special attention should be paid to patients who have ISR or ipsilateral stroke risk factors.
