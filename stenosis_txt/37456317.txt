Title: Calcification circumference, area, and location are associated with carotid stent expansion rate: high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The plaque imaging findings associated with the stent expansion rate (SER) of the carotid artery are not well known. The purpose of this study was to investigate the imaging findings associated with SER.
METHODS: It was a retrospective investigation. Based on the kind of carotid stents used, retrospective data from 89 patients who had carotid artery stenting (CAS) for atherosclerotic carotid stenosis were gathered and divided into two groups: open-cell stents and closed-cell stents. Patients underwent preoperative carotid high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (HR-VWI). Use HR-VWI to quantitatively evaluate carotid wall thickness and plaque components. Calculate SER using digital subtraction angiography (DSA). All patients' baseline and HR-VWI imaging features were retrospectively analyzed. Simple and multivariable linear regression analysis was used to determine the imaging findings associated with SER of open-cell and closed-cell stents.
RESULTS: A total of 89 patients (mean age, 70±8 years; 69 men) were included in the final analysis. Among 89 patients, 35 patients were treated with open-cell stents. Fifty-four patients were treated with closed-cell stents. In the open-cell stents group, the Maximum single-slice calcification circumference score, maximum wall thickness (WT<sub>max</sub>), and total calcification location score with P&lt;0.10 in the simple linear regression analysis were included in the multivariable linear regression analysis. The results of the multivariable linear regression revealed that only the Maximum single-slice calcification circumference score (β=-9.35; 95% CI: -18.15 to -0.56; P=0.03) was associated with SER of open-cell stents. In the closed-cell stents group, the Maximum single-slice calcification circumference score, WT<sub>max</sub>, maximum area percentage of calcification, calcification volume, and total calcification location score with P&lt;0.10 in the simple linear regression analysis were included in the multivariable linear regression analysis. The results of the multivariable linear regression revealed that the Maximum area percentage of calcification (β=-0.67; 95% CI: -1.29 to -0.05; P=0.03), Maximum single-slice calcification circumference score (β=-8.43; 95% CI: -13.36 to -3.49; P=0.001) and total calcification location score (β=-0.37; 95% CI: -1.08 to 0.09; P=0.02) were associated with SER of closed-cell stents.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcified plaques are associated with SER of the carotid artery. Calcification circumference correlates with SER of open-cell stents. Calcification circumference, calcification area, and calcification location are related to SER of closed-cell stents, which may provide a new consideration for clinicians when choosing carotid artery stents.
