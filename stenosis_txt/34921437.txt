Title: Assessment of diastolic function in aortic stenosis: A comparison between 2009 and 2016 guidelines.

Abstract: AIMS: New diastolic dysfunction (DD) guidelines were introduced in 2016 to replace the 2009 guidelines, but have not yet been evaluated in aortic stenosis (AS). We aimed to compare the 2009 and 2016 DD guidelines in severe AS patients in terms of association with left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) remodeling, with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) at rest and exercise, and with prognosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 212 patients with severe AS (112 undergoing AVR, 100 asymptomatic). Echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) were performed/measured. Thirty-nine asymptomatic patients had PCWP measured during rest and maximal exertion. Asymptomatic patients were followed for 3.1 years for the combined endpoint of death, AVR or admission with heart failure. The 2009 and 2016 DD guidelines agreed poorly with each other (Cohens' κ = .15). 2009 guidelines showed many ambiguous DD findings. With the 2016 guidelines, 20% of patients had indeterminate DD. DD grade 2 according to 2016 guidelines showed stronger association with symptom status, BNP, global longitudinal strain (GLS) and peak exercise PCWP than 2009 guidelines. For indeterminate DD patients according to 2009 guidelines, GLS above the median was associated with event-free survival (HR .11 (95% CI .02-.53)). For neither guideline was DD associated with the combined endpoint in asymptomatic patients.
CONCLUSION: The 2016 guidelines show a stronger association with BNP, GLS, and exercise PCWP than the 2009 guidelines. The 2016 guidelines result in 20% of patients with indeterminate DD; however, these patients may possibly be stratified according to GLS.
