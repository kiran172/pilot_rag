Title: Infigratinib, a Selective Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor, Suppresses Stent-Induced Tissue Hyperplasia in a Rat Esophageal Model.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Stent-induced tissue hyperplasia remains a challenge for the application of self-expanding metal stents in the management of esophageal stricture. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of infigratinib, which is a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor, in the prevention of stent-induced tissue hyperplasia in a rat esophageal model.
METHODS: Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent esophageal stent placement and were randomized to receive 1 ml of vehicle, 5 mg/kg infigratinib in 1 ml of vehicle, or 10 mg/kg infigratinib in 1 ml of vehicle via naso-gastric tube once daily for 28 days. Follow-up fluoroscopy was performed on postoperative day 28, and the stented esophageal tissues were harvested for histological and immunofluorescence examinations.
RESULTS: All rats survived until euthanasia on postoperative day 28 without procedure-related adverse events. The incidence of stent migration was 12.5%, 12.5% and 25% in the control group, the 5 mg/kg infigratinib group and, the 10 mg/kg infigratinib group, respectively. The percentage of granulation tissue area, the submucosal fibrosis thickness, the number of epithelial layers, the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration, the degree of collagen deposition, the number of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-expressing myofibroblasts, and the number of proliferating myofibroblasts were all significantly lower in both infigratinib groups than in the control group (P < 0.05) but were not significantly different between the two infigratinib groups (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Infigratinib significantly suppresses stent-induced tissue hyperplasia by inhibiting FGFR1-mediated myofibroblast proliferation and profibrotic activities in a rat esophageal model.
