Title: Functional disorders in non-culprit coronary arteries and their implications in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Abstract: Approximately 30-50% of patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction have multivessel disease. The physiology of the non-culprit artery (NCA) is complex and represents a challenge to physicians as, while these plaques are presumably stable, clinical data show that they frequently lead to major adverse cardiovascular events. In addition the presence of microvascular and endothelial dysfunction may have prognostic implications and interfere with current physiological indices for stenosis severity assessment. In this review we aim to summarize current methods to study the microcirculation, discuss the evidence available regarding the endothelium and the microvascular compartment of the NCA; the best strategies to perform a complete revascularization based on proven ischemia; real limitations associated to hyperemic stenosis indices; and the potential role of novel resting-indices in this specific acute context.
