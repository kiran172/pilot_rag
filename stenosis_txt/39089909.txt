Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement with corevalve self-expanding bioprosthesis: Clinical and durability data up to 12 years.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) determined a paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis but data on very long-term durability are lacking. We sought to evaluate the clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of the CoreValve porcine pericardial self-expanding bioprosthesis at 12-year follow-up.
METHODS: 882 inoperable or high-risk patients were treated with the CoreValve bioprosthesis in 8 Italian high-volume centers between 2007 and 2011. The endpoints were 12-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and Cumulative Incidence Functions (CIFs) for severe Structural Valve Deterioration (SVD), Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction (BVD), Bioprosthetic Valve Failure (BVF), and severe Hemodynamic Valve Deterioration (HVD). VARC-3 definitions were applied.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 83 ± 6 years, and NYHA class III or IV in 76.3 % of patients. The actuarial risk of death at 12 years after TAVR was 95.5 % (CI 93.5 %- 97.1 %). The actual risk of cardiovascular death, weighted against the risk of non-cardiac death at 12 years was 23.9 % (21.0 %-26.8 %). The 12-year actual risk of BVD was 7.0 % (5.3 %-8.9 %), of SVD was 3.6 % (2.5 %-5.2 %), of BVF was 3.12 % (2.02 %-4.57 %), and of severe HVD was 1.7 % (0.9 %-2.9 %). Mean transaortic gradient significantly decreased after the procedure (52 ± 15 mmHg vs 9 ± 5 mmHg, p < 0.001), and remained stable up to 12 years (12 ± 4 mmHg, P = 0.08 vs. discharge).
CONCLUSIONS: The first-generation CoreValve bioprosthesis showed reassuring clinical and hemodynamic performance at 12-year follow-up.
