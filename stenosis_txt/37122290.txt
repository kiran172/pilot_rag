Title: Ischemic stroke caused by large-artery atherosclerosis: a red flag for subclinical coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The coronary calcium score (CAC) measured on chest computerized tomography is a risk marker of cardiac events and mortality. We compared CAC scores in two multiethnic groups without symptomatic coronary artery disease: subjects in the chronic phase after stroke or transient ischemic attack and at least one symptomatic stenosis ≥50% in the carotid or vertebrobasilar territories (Group<sub>athero</sub>) and a control group (Group<sub>control</sub>).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, Group<sub>athero</sub> included two subgroups: Group<sub>ExtraorIntra</sub>, with stenoses in either cervical or intracranial arteries, and Group<sub>Extra&amp;Intra</sub>, with stenoses in at least one cervical and one intracranial artery. Group<sub>control</sub> had no history of prior stroke/transient ischemic attacks and no stenoses ≥50% in cervical or intracranial arteries. Age and sex were comparable in all groups. Frequencies of CAC ≥100 and CAC &gt; 0 were compared between Group<sub>athero</sub> and Group<sub>control</sub>, as well as between Group<sub>ExtraorIntr</sub>, Group<sub>Extra&amp;Intra</sub>, and Group<sub>control</sub>, with bivariate logistic regressions. Multivariate analyses were also performed.
RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included: 80 in Group<sub>athero</sub> and 40 in Group<sub>control.</sub> CAC &gt;0 was significantly more frequent in Group<sub>athero</sub> (85%) than Group<sub>control</sub> (OR, 4.19; 1.74-10.07; p = 0.001). Rates of CAC ≥100 were not significantly different between Group<sub>athero</sub> and Group<sub>control</sub> but were significantly greater in Group<sub>Extra&amp;Intra</sub> (n = 13) when compared to Group<sub>control</sub> (OR 4.67; 1.21-18.04; p = 0.025). In multivariate-adjusted analyses, "Group<sub>athero</sub>" and "Group<sub>Extra&amp;Intra</sub>" were significantly associated with CAC.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of coronary calcification was higher in subjects with stroke caused by large-artery atherosclerosis than in controls.
