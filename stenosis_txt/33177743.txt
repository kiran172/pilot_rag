Title: Diagnostic application of prenatal ultrasound in foetal heart complex malformation in twin pregnancy.

Abstract: To explore the value of prenatal ultrasound in the diagnosis of twin pregnancy with foetal heart malformation, 30 foetuses with congenital heart disease of twin pregnancy who were 19-37 weeks between July 2016 and January 2018 were selected for prenatal ultrasound examination. The prenatal ultrasound was carried out and the data were collected and analyzed statistically. The results showed that there were 11 cases of ventricular septal defect (VSD), 3 cases of endocardial cushion defect, 3 cases of left cardiac dysplasia, 4 cases of right ventricular double outlet, 5 cases of aortic stenosis, 2 cases of tetralogy of Fallot, and 2 cases of aortic disconnection. It was found that VSD had the highest detection rate amongst foetal congenital heart disease. Therefore, prenatal ultrasound is the most effective method to diagnose foetal congenital heart disease.
