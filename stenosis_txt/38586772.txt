Title: Intradural Abscess of the Thoracic and Lumbar Spine.

Abstract: Spinal abscesses are normally confined to the epidural space. Due to the anatomical seclusion of the intradural space, it is rare for the infection to spread to the area or for the cause to be idiopathic, iatrogenic in nature, or due to another phenomenon. We report a case of a 45-year-old male who was found to have a rare intradural spinal abscess two days post-laminectomy for severe central canal stenosis.
