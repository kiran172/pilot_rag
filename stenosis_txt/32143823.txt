Title: BRILMA block for costal cartilage excision: Case report.

Abstract: The block of the lateral branches of the intercostal nerves in the middle axillary line (BRILMA) is an interfascial ultrasound-guided block for analgesia in thoracic wall and upper abdominal surgery, presenting as an adequate alternative to neuraxial techniques. We present the case of a 49-year-old female scheduled for idiopathic subglottic stenosis repair with a costal cartilage graft from the 10th rib and tracheotomy. At the end of the surgery, unilateral ultrasound-guided BRILMA block with 20ml of ropivacaine 0.2% was performed at the level of the 6th rib, uneventfully. Postoperatively, the patient referred a maximum level of pain of 3/10. There was no opioid consumption after the 2nd postoperative day, although a subcostal incision may produce considerable pain. BRILMA is a superficial block, easily reproducible in most patients. It diminishes the number of punctures needed in the thoracic wall, as well as the risk for pneumothorax and local anesthetic toxicity.
