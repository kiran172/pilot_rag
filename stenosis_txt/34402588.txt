Title: Redo-aortic valve replacement in prior stentless prosthetic aortic valves: Transcatheter versus surgical approach.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The objective was to compare outcomes of redo-aortic valve replacement (AVR) via surgical or transcatheter approach in prior surgical AVR with large percentage of prior stentless surgical AVR.
BACKGROUND: With the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), patients with increased surgical risks now have an alternative to redo surgical AVR (SAVR), known as valve-in-valve (ViV) TAVR. Stentless prosthetic aortic valves present a more challenging implantation for ViV-TAVR given the lack of structural frame.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 173 subjects who have undergone SAVR (N = 100) or ViV-TAVR (N = 73) in patients with prior surgical AVR at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center from 2009 to 2019. Our study received the proper ethical oversight.
RESULTS: The average ages in redo-SAVR and ViV-TAVR groups were 58.03 ± 13.86 and 66.57 ± 13.44 years, respectively (p < 0.0001). The redo-SAVR had significantly lower STS (2.78 ± 2.09 and 4.68 ± 5.51, p < 0.01) and Euroscores (4.32 ± 2.98 and 7.51 ± 8.24, p < 0.05). The redo-SAVR group had higher percentage requiring mechanical support (8% vs. 0%, p < 0.05) and vasopressors (53% vs. 0%, p < 0.0001), longer length of stay (13.65 ± 11.23 vs. 5.68 ± 7.64 days, p < 0.0001), and inpatient mortality (16% vs. 2.78%, p < 0.005). At 30-day follow-up, redo-SAVR group had higher rates of acute kidney injury (10% vs. 0%, p < 0.01), however ViV-TAVR group had more new left bundle branch blocks (6.85% vs. 0%, p < 0.05). No significant differences regarding re-hospitalization rates, stroke, or death up to 1-year.
CONCLUSION: Although the ViV-TAVR group had higher risk patients, there were significantly fewer procedural complications, shorter length of stay, and similar mortality outcomes up to 1-year follow-up.
