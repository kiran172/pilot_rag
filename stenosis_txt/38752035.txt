Title: Microalbuminuria as a Predictor of Early Neurological Deterioration and Poor Functional Outcomes in Acute Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: Background Ischemic stroke is a major health crisis with significant consequences. Microalbuminuria, a sign of endothelial dysfunction, has been linked to adverse outcomes in ischemic stroke. Early neurological deterioration (END) is a critical factor influencing the patient's prognosis. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of microalbuminuria, its predictive value in assessing END, and its prognostic implications in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methodology This study conducted at Pradyumna Bal Memorial Hospital, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences Bhubaneswar (November 2020-April 2022) included 114 AIS patients over 18 years who presented within 24 hours of stroke onset. Demographics, vascular risk factors, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (admission and day three), modified Rankin scores (day 10), urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios, and carotid artery Doppler studies were collected. Results The mean age of the patients was 61.87 years, with males constituting 72.8% of the population. Hypertension (50.9%) and diabetes mellitus (28.9%) were the most common comorbid conditions. The mean NIHSS stroke severity at presentation was 11.30. END occurred in 38.6% of patients. Overall, 43.9% of cases showed carotid stenosis, and the mean carotid intimal media thickness was 1.08 mm. Notably, the presence of microalbuminuria significantly increased the chances of both END (39.45 times higher risk) and worse functional outcomes (odds ratio = 19.147, p = 0.001). Conclusions Microalbuminuria emerges as a robust independent predictor of END and a poor prognosis in AIS. These findings highlight the importance of early microalbuminuria identification and intervention to reduce END risk and potentially improve outcomes in AIS patients.
