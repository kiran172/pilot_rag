Title: Prognostic Value of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Predicting Long-Term Mortality After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Background Patient-reported outcome measures have been shown to have important prognostic value after various cardiac interventions. We assessed the association between the change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 12 (KCCQ-12) score after transcatheter aortic valve replacement and mortality. Methods and Results We included patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement at Mayo Clinic between February 2012 to June 2022 and who completed a KCCQ-12 before and 30 to 45 days after the procedure. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: those who experienced significant (&gt;+19 points; group 1), modest (1-19 points; group 2), and no (≤0 points; group 3) improvement. A total of 1124 patients were included: 60.8% men; 97.6% White. Mean age was 79.4±8.3 years, baseline KCCQ-12 score was 53.9±24.5, and median Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 4.9% (interquartile range, 3.1-8.0). At 45 days, the mean change in KCCQ-12 score was 19±24 points; 46.3% (n=520) of patients had a significant improvement in their KCCQ-12 score, while 33.4% (n=375) and 20.4% (n=229) had modest and no improvement, respectively. Median survival was higher in group 1 (5.7±0.2 years) compared with groups 2 and 3 (5.1±0.3 and 4.1±0.4 years, respectively; P&lt;0.001). Compared with patients in group 1, those in groups 2 and 3 had higher long-term risk-adjusted mortality (adjusted hazard ratios, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.20-1.96], and 2.30 [95% CI, 1.74-3.04], respectively). Conclusions Patients who experience modest or no improvement in KCCQ-12 score after transcatheter aortic valve replacement have substantially higher long-term mortality. Delta KCCQ-12 is a cost-effective, efficient tool that can identify patients at increased risk of death at long-term follow-up post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
