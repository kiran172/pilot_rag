Title: A novel treatment for supraglottic stenosis secondary to immunoglobulin G4-related disease.

Abstract: Although immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) has a predilection for the head and neck region, laryngeal pathology is rare. We report a case of supraglottic stenosis due to IgG4-RD together with a novel treatment strategy of employing a laryngeal stent. A 69-year-old man was referred with longstanding dyspnoea and worsening inspiratory stridor. Despite two supraglottic dilations over a 12-month period, his stenosis recurred and symptoms persisted. Serum investigations revealed elevated IgG4 levels (2.390g/l), with IgG4 infiltrate in laryngeal biopsies. The patient underwent endoscopic balloon dilation, intralesional Depo-MedroneÂ® injection, CO<sub>2</sub> laser therapy and insertion of a laryngeal stent to prevent re-stenosis. Rituximab and prednisolone were commenced postoperatively and the stent was removed at 6weeks. No stenosis recurrence was visualised over a further 12-month follow-up period. Sixteen cases of laryngeal lesions with confirmed IgG4 infiltrate in biopsies have been reported in the worldwide literature to date. Based on a literature review and our experience, we recommend that similar laryngeal pathologies undergo early IgG4 serological testing and biopsy immunohistochemistry. Prompt diagnostic confirmation may prevent unnecessary surgical interventions and optimise immunosuppression. Furthermore, the use of a laryngeal stent following laryngeal surgery may help reduce stenotic recurrence and promote healing.
