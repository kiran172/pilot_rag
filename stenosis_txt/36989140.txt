Title: Evaluation of cardiac chamber functions by speckle-tracking echocardiography in the presence of coronary artery flow disturbances other than stenosis: A review.

Abstract: Conditions other than stenosis also disturb the coronary flow. Such conditions include the coronary slow flow phenomenon, coronary artery ectasia, and coronary artery tortuosity. Evidence exists regarding myocardial dysfunction in these conditions. In this review, we present studies that have used speckle-tracking echocardiography to determine whether coronary flow disturbances are accompanied by myocardial dysfunction. Additionally, we seek to show the gaps in knowledge concerning this issue and the dimensions that future studies should consider.
