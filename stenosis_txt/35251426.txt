Title: Double outlet right ventricle presenting in an adult woman: a case report.

Abstract: Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a congenital cardiac malformation that occurs in 1%-3% of individuals with congenital heart defects. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may play an important role in the anatomy of the ventricular septal defect, functional status of both ventricles, and in identifying any residual stenosis or regurgitation or coexistent anomalies. Here, we present a case of a 28-years-old woman who came to our emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient felt shortness of breath on exertion and improved with rest. Clinical examination showed no abnormalities except low oxygen saturation of 65%. After echocardiography and cardiac MRI were done, it was concluded that she had a double outlet right ventricle with peri membranous ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusion. This study highlights the role of cardiac MRI in assessing DORV.
