Title: Gender Differences in the Impact of Coronary Artery Disease and Complete Revascularization on Long-Term Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: In this study, we compare gender-specific clinical outcomes. We show that outcomes among women after transcatheter aortic valve implantation are significantly influenced by co-existing coronary artery disease (CAD) and its complexity, whereas in men, this is less pronounced. Moreover, we identified a subgroup of women with complex CAD who are at particularly high risk for fatal cardiovascular events, even when compared with men with similar CAD.
