Title: Direct Percutaneous Thrombolysis (DPT): A novel method of salvaging Thrombosed Native Arteriovenous Fistula.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are either treated by thrombectomy or pharmaco-mechanical thrombolysis with or without percutaneous balloon angioplasty. In this study, we have described an effective and economical technique of salvaging these fistulae using a 20-22-gauge spinal needle and urokinase and have named it direct percutaneous thrombolysis (DPT).
MATERIALS AND METHOD: This prospective study comprised of 148 patients out of which 120 patients presented with AVF thrombosis and were divided into two groups; those with no obvious stenosis on ultrasound (n = 38) and second with venous stenosis (n = 82). Remaining 28 patients developed thrombosis post angioplasty for venous stenosis. Percutaneous injection of urokinase into the thrombus was done under ultrasound guidance, followed by balloon angioplasty if there was associated stenosis.
RESULTS: In 38 patients who didn't have any stenosis, 32 AVFs were successfully thrombolysed by DPT, with technical success of 84.2%. Remaining six patients required angioplasty because of chronic nature of clot. In 82 patients who had venous stenosis, 80 cases were treated successfully by DPT followed by angioplasty with technical success of 97.5%. In third group (n = 28), who developed thrombosis post angioplasty, 100% success rate was noted. The mean length of thrombus was 31.4 ± 4.6 mm and mean diameter of thrombosed vein was 10.5 ± 1.2 mm. There were no major complications encountered during the procedure. Minor complications were seen in 19 patients which included prolonged oozing from puncture site and local hematoma formation.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasound guided DPT with urokinase is a safe and economical option for salvaging thrombosed AVF without vascular stenosis that does not need angioplasty.
