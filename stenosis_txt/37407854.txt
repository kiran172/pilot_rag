Title: Biportal endoscopic paraspinal decompressive foraminotomy for lumbar foraminal stenosis: clinical outcomes and factors influencing unsatisfactory outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS) is an important pathologic entity that causes lumbar radiculopathies. Unrecognized LFS may be associated with surgical failure, and LFS remains challenging to treat surgically. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of decompressive foraminotomy performed using the biportal endoscopic paraspinal approach for LFS.
METHODS: A total of 102 consecutive patients with single-level unilateral LFS who underwent biportal endoscopic paraspinal decompressive foraminotomy were included. We evaluated the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) before and after surgery. Demographic, preoperative data, and radiologic parameters, including the coronal root angle (CRA), were investigated. The patients were divided into Group A (satisfaction group) and Group B (unsatisfaction group). Parameters were compared between these two groups to identify the factors influencing unsatisfactory outcomes.
RESULTS: In Group A (78.8% of patients), VAS and ODI scores significantly improved after biportal endoscopic paraspinal decompressive foraminotomy (p < 0.001). However, Group B (21.2% of patients) showed higher incidences of stenosis at the lower lumbar level (p = 0.009), wide segmental lordosis (p = 0.021), and narrow ipsilateral CRA (p = 0.009). In the logistic regression analysis, lower lumbar level (OR = 13.82, 95% CI: 1.33-143.48, p = 0.028) and narrow ipsilateral CRA (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-1.00, p = 0.047) were associated with unsatisfactory outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvement in clinical outcomes was observed for a year after biportal endoscopic paraspinal decompressive foraminotomy. However, clinical outcomes were unsatisfactory in 21.2% of patients, and lower lumbar level and narrow ipsilateral CRA were independent risk factors for unsatisfactory outcomes.
