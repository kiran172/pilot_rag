Title: Midaortic Syndrome due to Takayasu Arteritis in a Child with Acute Decompensated Cardiac Failure Managed by an Emergency Axillo-External Iliac Artery Bypass: A Follow-Up Case Report of Long-Term Outcomes.

Abstract: Midaortic syndrome (MAS) is characterized by a diffuse narrowing of the distal thoracic or abdominal aorta and is concomitant with various etiologies. The common symptoms of MAS include severe hypertension or arterial insufficiency distal to the stenosis. This includes lower extremity claudication and heart failure due to afterload mismatch. We present the case of an 8-year-old girl who developed acute decompensated cardiac, respiratory, and renal failures because of the occlusion of the descending aorta secondary to Takayasu arteritis (TA). Although thoracoabdominal-aortic bypass is usually performed for patients with MAS, the procedure was considered too invasive, given the patient's condition. Therefore, we performed an emergency axillo-external iliac artery bypass for revascularization. Subsequently, organ failure improved and she was discharged. At postoperative 10Â years, an asymptomatic pseudoaneurysm was detected at the distal anastomosis, for which revision surgery was performed. Overall, the long-term prognosis was satisfactory, suggesting that this procedure is less invasive and effective for treatment of MAS due to TA, in emergencies.
