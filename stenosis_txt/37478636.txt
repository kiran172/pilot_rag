Title: Financial Burden of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Given the increasing population eligible for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), resource utilization has become an important focus in this setting. We aimed to estimate the change in the financial burden of TAVI therapy over 2 different periods. A probabilistic Markov model was developed to estimate the cost consequences of increased center experience and the introduction of newer-generation TAVI devices compared with an earlier TAVI period in a cohort of 6,000 patients. The transition probabilities and hospitalization costs were retrieved from the OBSERVANT (Observational Study of Effectiveness of AVR-TAVI procedures for severe Aortic steNosis Treatment) and OBSERVANT II (Observational Study of Effectiveness of TAVI with new generation deVices for severe Aortic stenosis Treatment) studies, including 1,898 patients treated with old-generation devices and 1,417 patients treated with new-generation devices. The propensity score matching resulted in 853 pairs, with well-balanced baseline risk factors. The mean EuroSCORE II (6.6% vs 6.8%, p = 0.76) and the mean age (82.0 vs 82.1 y, p = 0.62) of the early TAVI period and new TAVI period were comparable. The new TAVI period was associated with a significant reduction in rehospitalizations (-30.5% reintervention, -25.2% rehospitalization for major events, and -30.8% rehospitalization for minor events) and a 20% reduction in 1-year mortality. These reductions resulted in significant cost savings over a 1-year period (-€4.1 million in terms of direct costs and -€19.7 million considering the additional cost of the devices). The main cost reduction was estimated for rehospitalization, accounting for 79% of the overall cost reduction (not considering the costs of the devices). In conclusion, the introduction of new-generation TAVI devices, along with increased center experience, led to significant cost savings at 1-year compared with an earlier TAVI period, mainly because of the reduction in rehospitalization costs.
