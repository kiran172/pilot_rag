Title: Effect of periprocedural furosemide-induced diuresis with matched isotonic intravenous hydration in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a serious complication which is associated with increased mortality. The RenalGuard system was developed to reduce the risk of AKI after contrast media exposition by furosemide-induced diuresis with matched isotonic intravenous hydration. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the RenalGuard system on the occurrence of AKI after TAVI in patients with chronic kidney disease.
METHODS: The present study is a single-center randomized trial including patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing TAVI. Overall, a total of 100 patients treated by TAVI between January 2017 and August 2018 were randomly assigned to a periprocedural treatment with the RenalGuard system or standard treatment by pre- and postprocedural intravenous hydration. Primary endpoint was the occurrence of AKI after TAVI, and secondary endpoints were assessed according to valve academic research consortium 2 criteria.
RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of AKI was 18.4% (n = 18). The majority of these patients developed mild AKI according to stage 1. Comparing RenalGuard to standard therapy, no significant differences were observed in the occurrence of AKI (RenalGuard: 21.3%; control group: 15.7%; p = 0.651). In addition, there were no differences between the groups with regard to 30-day and 12-month mortality and procedure-associated complication rates.
CONCLUSION: In this randomized trial, we did not detect a reduction in AKI after TAVI by using the RenalGuard system. A substantial number of patients with chronic kidney disease developed AKI after TAVI, whereas the majority presented with mild AKI according to stage 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04537325).
