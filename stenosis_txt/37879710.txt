Title: Subtotal pyloric obstruction by atypical hypertrophic pyloric muscle in a newborn.

Abstract: This is a case of a neonate with suspected duodenal atresia on prenatal imaging. However, distal bowel gas was identified postnatally on regular X-rays with a possible pyloric obstructing mass visualised on ultasound. No contrast was visualised passing through the stomach on fluoroscopic studies. Operative evaluation revealed an atypical asymmetric hypertrophic pylorus with exophytic lesions of ectopic glandular tissue. Longitudinal open pyloromyotomy was performed which relieved the gastric obstruction resulting in symptomatic relief without any anatomy altering procedure required.
