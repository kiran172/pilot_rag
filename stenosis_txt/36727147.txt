Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy in Calcified Peripheral Lesions: Single-Center JEN-Experience.

Abstract: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) shows increasing need for revascularization therapy. Interventional success in calcified lesions is limited. Here, intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), modifying intimal and medial calcium, is a promising treatment approach. A single-center, prospective all-comers registry for patients undergoing peripheral IVL was established to examine treatment success in PAD with severe vessel calcification. Periprocedural safety events as well as short-term and intermediate follow-up clinical data were evaluated. Between December 2018 and January 2021 all consecutive patients receiving peripheral lithotripsy at our center were analyzed. Clinical and angiographic data were evaluated. Angiographic images were analyzed using a semiautomatic software for quantitative vessel analysis. Eighty-five lesions in 61 limbs were treated with IVL in 51 patients presenting with Rutherford classes 2 to 5. Most lesions (68%) were localized in the superficial femoral artery. Mean calcified lesion length was 102.5 mm (10-390 mm), with a median peripheral arterial calcium score of 3, indicating a highly calcified status. In 58% of the patients, IVL was used as a stand-alone therapy. IVL resulted in a mean acute luminal gain of 2.6 ± 0.9 mm, resulting in stenosis reduction by 42.1 ± 15%. Mean ankle brachial index (ABI) improved significantly from 0.6 to 0.8 ( p  &lt; 0.0001) on day 1 after the intervention and remained stable at 6 months. This large real-world data of peripheral IVL reports compelling safety in a complex patient cohort. For the first time, clinical follow-up data demonstrated a sustained significant improvement in ABI after 6 months.
