Title: Novel endoscopic technique for trisegment drainage in patients with unresectable hilar malignant biliary strictures (with video).

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Three or more stents may be needed in patients with extensive stricturing in Bismuth type IIIa/IV hilar malignant strictures. Partial stent-in-stent (PSIS) deployment has been the primary intervention for hilar malignant biliary stricture (MBS). However, simultaneous side-by-side (SBS) stent placement has become feasible with the development of the <6F diameter stent delivery system. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new hybrid method combining PSIS and SBS stent placement for trisegment biliary drainage.
METHODS: This study included 17 consecutive patients with Bismuth IIIa or IV malignant strictures who underwent endoscopic drainage using the hybrid method. Diameters of the delivery stents were 5.4F (n = 10) and 5.7F (n = 7).
RESULTS: The technical success rate was 82% (14/17), and the median length of procedures was 54 minutes. Two patients required predilatation for deployment of the third self-expandable metallic stent through the mesh of the first deployed stent. Two patients (12%) developed cholecystitis as early adverse events, and 1 patient (6%) developed liver abscess as a late adverse event. The time to recurrent biliary obstruction among those with successful initial trisegmental drainage was 189 days (95% confidence interval, 124-254).
CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid method for unresectable hilar MBS is an effective endoscopic drainage method, and the ease of these procedures is partly attributed to the thinner stent delivery system.
