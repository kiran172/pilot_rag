Title: A case of proximal migration of a double-J ureteral stent in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer.

Abstract: Ureteral stenting is a common procedure to relieve ureteral obstructions. There are few reports regarding the proper migration of the proximal coil of a double-J ureteral stent into the ureter. Herein, we report a case of proximal stent migration after stent placement for ureteral stenosis caused by a malignant tumor in the gastrointestinal tract.
