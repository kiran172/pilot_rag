Title: Concomitant surgery for aortic valve and lung cancer patients in an elder.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment strategy for aortic valve and lung cancer patients includes concomitant or two-stage procedures. Conventional simultaneous operations are usually performed under the median sternotomy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old man was admitted to our hospital after experiencing chest tightness after activity for two months. Aortic valve regurgitation had been confirmed when squamous cell carcinoma of the lung was discovered. The therapeutic strategy for these patients is controversial. Considering the potential risk of tumour metastasis and the risk of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), we recommended concomitantÂ transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and a lobectomy. A trans-apical TAVI with left-sided intercostal thoracotomy was successfully performed, followed by an immediate video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and selective lymph node dissection.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that a one-stage surgery of pulmonary resection following TAVI is an acceptable and safe choice after careful evaluation and should be performed as soon as possible in response to lung cancer in elderly patients with aortic valve disease.
