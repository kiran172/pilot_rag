Title: Transient decrease in the depth of the negative T wave in apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a sign of left anterior descending artery stenosis: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), electrocardiography (ECG) often shows left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a negative T wave. A negative T wave often disappears over time due to degeneration of the apical myocardium. However, there are limited reports on the temporary change of a negative T wave in patients with HCM.
CASE SUMMARY: We report three apical HCM patients with LVH and T wave inversion on their previous ECG who showed a temporary decrease in the depth of the negative T wave. All of them had significant stenosis of coronary arteries including the left anterior descending artery (LAD). After revascularization for the LAD lesion, their ECG returned to the previous depth of the negative T wave.
DISCUSSION: The cases presented here suggested that a temporary decrease in the depth of the negative T wave in apical HCM patients may be one of the signs of ischaemia in the anterior-apical region caused by severe stenosis of the LAD.
