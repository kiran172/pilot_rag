Title: The Promise, Mystery, and Perils of Stenting for Symptomatic Internal Jugular Vein Stenosis: A Case Series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVDs) secondary to internal jugular vein (IJV) stenosis are becoming an increasingly recognized cause of significant cognitive and functional impairment in patients. There are little published data on IJV stenting for this condition. This study aims to report on procedural success.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was performed on patients with CVD that underwent IJV stenting procedures.
RESULTS: From 2019 to 2023, 29 patients with CVD underwent a total of 33 IJV stenting procedures. Most patients (20; 69%) had an underlying connective tissue disorder diagnosis. The mean age of the included patients was 36.3 years (SD 12.4), 24 were female (82.8%), and all were Caucasian except for 2 patients (27; 93.0%). Twenty-eight procedures (85%) involved isolated IJV stenting under conscious sedation, whereas 5 procedures (15%) involved IJV stenting and concomitant transverse sinus stenting under general anesthesia. Thirteen (39%) patients underwent IJV stenting after open IJV decompression and styloidectomy. Three patients had stents placed for stenosis below the C1 tubercle, one of which was for carotid compression. Periprocedural complications occurred in 11 (33%), including intracardiac stent migration in 1 patient, temporary shoulder pain/weakness in 5 (15%), and persistent and severe shoulder pain/weakness in 2 patients (6%). Approximately 75% of patients demonstrated improvement after stenting although only 12 patients (36%) had durable improvement over a mean follow-up of 4.5 months (range 6 weeks-3.5 years).
CONCLUSION: Our experience, along with early published studies, suggests that there is significant promise to IJV revascularization techniques in these patients; however, stenting carries a high complication rate, and symptom recurrence is common. Most neurointerventionalists should not be performing IJV stenting unless they have experience with these patients and understand technical nuances (stent sizing, anatomy, patient selection), which can maximize benefit and minimize risk.
