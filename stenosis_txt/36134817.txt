Title: BILIARY FISTULAS ASSOCIATED WITH LIVER TRANSPLANTATION VERSUS OTHER ETIOLOGIES: WHAT IS THE SUCCESS RATE OF THE ENDOSCOPIC TREATMENT?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Biliary fistulas typically occur as surgical complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, liver transplantation, or partial liver resection.
AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the endoscopic treatment of biliary fistulae secondary to liver transplantation compared to that of other etiologies.
METHODS: A retrospective study of 25 patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for biliary fistula from 2015 to 2021 was conducted at the Endoscospy Unit of Walter Cant√≠dio University Hospital. Clinical characteristics and endoscopic success rates of the post-liver transplantation group were analyzed in comparison with those of other etiologies.
RESULTS: The main causes of biliary fistula were liver transplantation (44%) and cholecystectomy complications (44%). The post-liver transplantation group had a significantly higher proportion of male sex (liver transplantation=81.8%, others=28.6%) and older age (liver transplantation=54.1 years, others=42.0 years) and a higher incidence of biliary stenosis (liver transplantation=90.9%, others=14.3%) than those of the group with other etiologies (p<0.05). The two groups received similar treatment types, among which sphincterotomy associated with biliary stent placement was most commonly used. Endoscopic therapeutic success rates showed no significant difference between the post-liver transplantation group (63.6%) and the group with other etiologies (71.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic treatment of biliary fistulae secondary to liver transplantation presented a recovery rate similar to that of other etiologies despite the patients older age and the presence of biliary stenosis.
