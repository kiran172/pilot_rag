Title: Progression and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in a mouse model of hypertension and concomitant cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myocardial fibrosis is observed in multiple cardiac conditions including hypertension and aortic stenosis. Excessive fibrosis is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, but longitudinal human data regarding changes in left ventricular remodelling and fibrosis over time are sparse because of the slow progression, thereby making longitudinal studies challenging. The purpose of this study was to establish and characterize a mouse model to study the development and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in response to increased blood pressure and to understand how these processes reverse remodel following normalisation of blood pressure.
METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study with serial cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging every 2 weeks in mice (n = 31) subjected to angiotensin II-induced hypertension for 6 weeks and investigated reverse remodelling following normalisation of afterload beyond 6 weeks (n = 9). Left ventricular (LV) volumes, mass, and function as well as myocardial fibrosis were measured using cine CMR and the extracellular volume fraction (ECV) s.
RESULTS: Increased blood pressure (65 ± 12 vs 85 ± 9 mmHg; p < 0.001) resulted in higher indices of LV hypertrophy (0.09 [0.08, 0.10] vs 0.12 [0.11, 0.14] g; p < 0.001) and myocardial fibrosis (ECV: 0.24 ± 0.03 vs 0.30 ± 0.02; p < 0.001) whilst LV ejection fraction fell (LVEF, 59.3 [57.6, 59.9] vs 46.9 [38.5, 49.6] %; p < 0.001). We found a strong correlation between ECV and histological myocardial fibrosis (r = 0.89, p < 0.001). Following cessation of angiotensin II and normalisation of blood pressure (69 ± 5 vs baseline 65 ± 12 mmHg; p = 0.42), LV mass (0.11 [0.10, 0.12] vs 0.09 [0.08, 0.11] g), ECV (0.30 ± 0.02 vs 0.27 ± 0.02) and LVEF (51.1 [42.9, 52.8] vs 59.3 [57.6, 59.9] %) improved but remained impaired compared to baseline (p < 0.05 for all). There was a strong inverse correlation between LVEF and %ECV during both systemic hypertension (r = - 0.88, p < 0.001) and the increases in ECV observed in the first two weeks of increased blood pressure predicted the reduction in LVEF after 6 weeks (r = - 0.77, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We have established and characterized angiotensin II infusion and repeated CMR imaging as a model of LV hypertrophy and reverse remodelling in response to systemic hypertension. Changes in myocardial fibrosis and alterations in cardiac function are only partially reversible following relief of hypertension.
