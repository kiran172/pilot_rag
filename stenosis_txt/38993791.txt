Title: Profibrotic role of the SOX9-MMP10-ECM biosynthesis axis in the tracheal fibrosis after injury and repair.

Abstract: Fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition play an important role in the tracheal abnormal repair process and fibrosis. As a transcription factor, SOX9 is involved in fibroblast activation and ECM deposition. However, the mechanism of how SOX9 regulates fibrosis after tracheal injury remains unclear. We investigated the role of SOX9 in TGF-β1-induced fibroblast activation and ECM deposition in rat tracheal fibroblast (RTF) cells. SOX9 overexpression adenovirus (Ad-SOX9) and siRNA were transfected into RTF cells. We found that SOX9 expression was up-regulated in RTF cells treated with TGF-β1. SOX9 overexpression activated fibroblasts and promoted ECM deposition. Silencing SOX9 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and ECM deposition, induced G2 arrest, and increased apoptosis in RTF cells. RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays identified MMP10, a matrix metalloproteinase involved in ECM deposition, as a direct target of SOX9, which promotes ECM degradation by increasing MMP10 expression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, in vivo, SOX9 knockdown ameliorated granulation proliferation and tracheal fibrosis, as manifested by reduced tracheal stenosis. In conclusion, our findings indicate that SOX9 can drive fibroblast activation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis resistance in tracheal fibrosis via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The SOX9-MMP10-ECM biosynthesis axis plays an important role in tracheal injury and repair. Targeting SOX9 and its downstream target MMP10 may represent a promising therapeutic approach for tracheal fibrosis.
