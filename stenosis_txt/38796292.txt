Title: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography for Management of Chronic Pancreatitis.

Abstract: Management of symptomatic chronic pancreatitis (CP) has shifted its approach from surgical procedures to minimally invasive endoscopic procedures. Increased experience and advanced technology have led to the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as a therapeutic tool to provide pain relief and treat CP complications including pancreatic stones, strictures, and distal biliary strictures, pseudocysts, and pancreatic duct fistulas. In this article the authors will discuss the use of ERCP for the management of CP, its complications, recent advancements, and techniques from the most up to date literature available.
