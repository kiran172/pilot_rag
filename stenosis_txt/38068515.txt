Title: The Fate of Pre-Existing L5-S1 Degeneration following Oblique Lumbar Interbody Fusion of L4-L5 and Above.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified various risk factors for adjacent segment disease (ASD) at the L5-S1 level after fusion surgery, including preoperative sagittal imbalance, longer fusion, and preoperative disc degeneration. However, only a few studies have explored the risk factors for ASD at the L5-S1 level after oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) at the L4-L5 level and above. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for symptomatic ASD at the L5-S1 level in patients with pre-existing degeneration after OLIF at L4-L5 and above.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent OLIF at L4-L5 and above, with a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. Patients with central stenosis or Lee grade 2 or 3 foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 preoperatively were excluded. Patients were divided into ASD and non-ASD groups based on the occurrence of new-onset L5 or S1 radicular pain requiring epidural steroid injection (ESI). The clinical and radiological factors were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors for ASD of L5-S1.
RESULTS: A total of 191 patients with a mean age ± standard deviation of 68.6 ± 8.3 years were included. Thirty-four (21.7%) patients underwent ESI at the L5 root after OLIF. In the logistic regression analyses, severe disc degeneration (OR (95% confidence interval (CI)): 2.65 (1.16-6.09)), the presence of facet effusion (OR (95% CI): 2.55 (1.05-6.23)), and severe paraspinal muscle fatty degeneration (OR (95% CI): 4.47 (1.53-13.05)) were significant risk factors for ASD in L5-S1.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the presence of facet effusion, severe disc degeneration, and severe paraspinal muscle fatty degeneration at the L5-S1 level were associated with the development of ASD at L5-S1 following OLIF at L4-L5 and above. For patients with these conditions, surgeons could consider including L5-S1 in the fusion when considering OLIF at the L4-L5 level and above.
