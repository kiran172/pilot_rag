Title: Definitive radiation for advanced cervix cancer is not associated with vaginal shortening-a prospective vaginal length and dose correlation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Prospectively measure change in vaginal length after definitive chemoradiation (C-EBRT) with Intracavitary Brachytherapy (ICBT) for locally advanced cervix cancer (LACC) and correlate with vaginal dose (VD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty one female patients with LACC receiving C-EBRT and ICBT underwent serial vaginal length (VL) measurements. An initial measurement was made at the time of the first ICBT procedure and subsequently at 3 month intervals up to 1 year post radiation. The vagina was contoured as a 3-dimensional structure for each brachytherapy plan. The difference in VL before and at least 6 months after the last fraction of brachytherapy was considered as an indicator of toxicity.
RESULTS: The mean initial VL was 8.7 cm (6.5-12) with median value of 8.5 cm. The mean VL after 6 months was 8.6 cm (6.5-12) and VL change was not found to be statistically significant. The median values (interquartile ranges) for vaginal D0.1cc, D1cc, and D2cc were 129.2 Gy (99.6-252.2), 96.9 Gy (84.2-114.9), and 89.6 Gy (82.4-102.2), respectively. No significant correlation was found between vaginal length change and the dosimetric parameters calculated for all patients.
CONCLUSION: Definitive C-EBRT and ICBT did not significantly impact VL in this prospective cohort probably related to acceptable doses per ICRU constraints. Estimate of vaginal stenosis and sexual function was not performed in this cohort which is a limitation of this study and which we hope to study prospectively going forward.
