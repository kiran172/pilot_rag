Title: Drug-Coated Balloon Treatment for ACS Induced by Myocardial Bridging: An Intravascular Ultrasound-Guided PCI.

Abstract: This report describes a case of a 35-year-old man who presented with acute coronary syndrome. An angiogram and intravascular ultrasound revealed atherosclerotic stenosis in the myocardial bridging segment of the mid-left anterior descending artery. The culprit lesion was treated using a drug-coated balloon, and no residual stenosis was observed, which was later confirmed by intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography at a 1-year coronary angiographic follow-up. This case provides evidence that drug-coated balloon could be a potential treatment strategy for atherosclerosis located in the myocardial bridging segment and suggests advantages of the "leave nothing behind" strategy in such clinical scenarios.
