Title: Feasibility of extended transforaminal approach (medial subchoroid) for resection of a benign aqueductal tumor in a patient with type 1 neurofibromatosis.

Abstract: The extended transforaminal endoscopic approach allows visualization and manipulation of the third ventricle posterior structures in a safe and comfortable manner. The medial subchoroidal approach has been described as a feasible alternative to the classical transchoroidal approach. In this video, the authors present the case of a 14-year-old male with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 who was referred to our department after presenting with headaches and diplopia for 2 weeks. Suspecting an aqueduct tumor, the authors performed an endoscopic surgical procedure through a single approach with third cisternostomy and resection of the tumor that produced the stenosis.
