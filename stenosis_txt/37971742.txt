Title: Mortality in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries and Mimickers.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: The clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with nonobstructive coronaries (MINOCA) are largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in 5-year mortality in patients presenting with STEMI due to MINOCA and MINOCA mimickers as compared with obstructive disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective analysis of a prospective registry-based cohort study of consecutive STEMI activations at 3 regional Midwest STEMI programs. STEMI without a culprit artery and elevated troponin levels were categorized as MINOCA (absence of coronary artery stenosis >50% and confirmed or suspected coronary artery plaque disruption, epicardial coronary spasm, or coronary embolism/thrombosis) or MINOCA mimickers (takotsubo cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or nonischemic cardiomyopathy). Data were analyzed from March 2003 to December 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted Cox regression analysis was used to assess 5-year mortality risk in STEMI presenting with MINOCA and MINOCA mimickers in comparison with obstructive disease.
RESULTS: Among 8560 consecutive patients with STEMI, mean (SD) age was 62 (14) years, 30% were female (2609 participants), and 94% were non-Hispanic White (4358 participants). The cohort included 8151 patients with STEMI due to obstructive disease (95.2%), 120 patients with MINOCA (1.4%), and 289 patients with MINOCA mimickers (3.8%). Patients were followed up for a median (IQR) of 7.1 (3.6-10.7) years. Patients with MINOCA and MINOCA mimickers were less likely to be discharged with cardiac medications compared with obstructive disease. At 5-year follow-up, mortality in STEMI presenting with obstructive disease (1228 participants [16%]) was similar to MINOCA (20 participants [18%]; χ21 = 1.1; log-rank P = .29) and MINOCA mimickers (52 participants [18%]; χ21 = 2.3; log-rank P = .13). In adjusted Cox regression analysis compared with obstructive disease, the 5-year mortality hazard risk was 1.93 times higher in MINOCA (95% CI, 1.06-3.53) and similar in MINOCA mimickers (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.79-1.49).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large multicenter cohort study of consecutive clinical patients with STEMI, presenting with MINOCA was associated with a higher risk of mortality than obstructive disease; the risk of mortality was similar in patients with MINOCA mimickers and obstructive disease. Further investigation is necessary to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in this high-risk STEMI population.
