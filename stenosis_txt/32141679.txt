Title: Intentional bioprosthetic tricuspid valve fracture to facilitate transcatheter valve-in-valve deployment.

Abstract: While transcatheter valve-in-valve (ViV) implantation may reduce the number of lifetime surgical reinterventions in some patients with congenital heart disease, in other patients the bioprosthetic valve ring can lead to patient-prosthesis mismatch due to reduction of internal diameter if a transcatheter valve is implanted. A 49-year-old woman with multiple prior cardiac surgeries presented with heart failure due to bioprosthetic tricuspid valve stenosis. Initial predilation valvuloplasty suggested conventional ViV implant would produce patient-prosthesis mismatch, therefore, we intentionally fractured the bioprosthetic valve ring to facilitate optimal hemodynamics with implantation of a 29â€‰mm transcatheter valve.
