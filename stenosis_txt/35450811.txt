Title: TAVR With the Novel Navitor Titan™ Transcatheter Heart Valve to Treat Aortic Stenosis Patients With Large Aortic Annuli.

Abstract: This case report describes the first transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the latest-generation Navitor Titan™ transcatheter heart valve (Abbott, USA) in a European patient with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AS). The Navitor Titan™ transcatheter heart valve has been developed to treat patients with large aortic annuli, namely aortic annulus perimeter 85 to 95 mm. In combination with the low profile FlexNav™ delivery system, the Navitor Titan™ valve offers the unique possibility to treat AS patients with large aortic annuli and suboptimal vascular access.
