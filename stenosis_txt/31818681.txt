Title: Reversible Cerebral Angiopathy after Viral Infection in a Pediatric Patient with Genetic Variant of RNF213.

Abstract: Ring finger protein (RNF) 213 is known as a susceptibility gene for moyamoya disease (MMD), which is characterized by bilateral carotid folk stenosis. Cerebral angiopathy after viral infection has been known to present angiographical appearance resembling MMD, however its pathogenesis and genetic background are not well known. We report a case of reversible cerebral angiopathy after viral infection in a pediatric patient with genetic variant of RNF213 mutation. The patient had developed a severe headache after hand, foot, and mouth disease. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) performed 2-3 weeks after disease onset revealed bilateral carotid folk stenosis and an old cerebral infarction in the left putamen. The patient's headache spontaneously resolved and the follow-up MRA showed a complete spontaneous resolution of the arterial stenosis after 9 months. We were able to determine genetic predisposition to angiopathy by identifying the RNF213 c.14576G>A (rs112735431, p.R4859K) mutation. Based on the present case, we hypothesize that an RNF213 variant might play an important role for the onset of postviral cerebral angiopathy.
