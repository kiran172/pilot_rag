Title: Achieving Low Radiation Dose in "One-Stop" Myocardial Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging in Coronary Artery Disease Using 16-cm Wide Detector CT.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of "one-stop" myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging (combined anatomy, perfusion, and function) in coronary artery disease using 16-cm wide detector CT, compared to conventional coronary CT angiography (CCTA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 442 patients with suspected coronary artery disease were randomly divided into two groups. Patients in group A underwent "one-stop" CTP, whereas group B underwent conventional CCTA. Image quality of CT images was assessed. Radiation and contrast medium doses and scan time of the two groups were recorded. Group A was further divided into four subgroups according to the degree of coronary artery stenosis, for which transmural perfusion ratio (TPR) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured.
RESULTS: Scan time was 73.1 ± 7.3 (s) longer in group A than in group B with 11.7% reduction of radiation dose (p &lt; 0.001) and no significant difference in image quality was noted. Significant differences regarding the minimum TPR (F = 24.657, p &lt; 0.001) and LVEF (χ2 =36.98, p &lt; 0.001) were observed among four subgroups. A negative correlation was found between the degree of coronary artery stenosis and TPR of the corresponding myocardial segments (r = -0.55, p &lt; 0.001). Patients with moderate to severe arterial stenosis exhibited a decreased LVEF compared to those with normal coronary arteries (48.0% vs 56.5%, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional CCTA, our new developed "one-stop" CTP may provide more comprehensive information on myocardial perfusion, coronary artery stenosis, and LV cardiac function with reduced radiation and contrast medium doses.
