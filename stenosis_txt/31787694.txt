Title: Ventricular Fibrillation Induced by Takotsubo Syndrome with Congenital Long QT Syndrome.

Abstract: We herein report a case of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) in which the QT interval was prolonged by Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), inducing ventricular fibrillation (VF). The patient was a 55-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with LQTS. Cardiopulmonary arrest occurred while coughing during sleep. VF was observed, and her heartbeat returned after two defibrillations. An electrocardiogram showed marked QT prolongation and large negative T waves. Echocardiography demonstrated hyperkinesis at the base of the left ventricle and akinesis at the apex. As there was no significant stenosis in the coronary artery, she was diagnosed with TTS.
