Title: ACUTE EMBOLISM OF THE SUPERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY AND SIGNIFICANT STENOSIS OF THE CELIAC TRUNK SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH PERCUTANEOUS ANGIOPLASTY AND STENT IMPLANTATION.

Abstract: Among patients presenting with acute abdominal symptoms, patients with acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) constitute 0.09% - 0.2% of cases. Unfortunately, due to the short period between the first symptoms and irreversible ischemic changes in the intestine, the mortality rate in this group is high - up to 60% - 100%. We present a case of a 75-yearold female with severe comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, poorly controlled arterial hypertension, and a history of colorectal carcinoma previously treated with radio- and chemotherapy). The patient was admitted due to severe abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac trunk embolism. Due to the relatively short time of symptoms onset as well as the soft abdomen, the patient was qualified for percutaneous treatment. Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed with stent implantation to SMA and celiac trunk (Neptun C, Balton, Poland). As a result, the patency of both arteries was fully restored. The patient's condition improved within 24 hours, and she was discharged home.
