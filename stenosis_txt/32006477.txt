Title: Development of Miniature Y Stent for Treatment of Postoperative Bronchial Stenosis.

Abstract: Bronchial stenosis after chest surgery is a rare event. In upper lobectomy it is likely due to the upward movement of the remaining lobes with torsion of the bronchus and edema. This case report describes the use of existing tools and prosthesis to create a novel miniature Y stent for a stenotic lobar bronchus that rapidly bifurcates, not allowing the insertion of a standard bronchial stent.
