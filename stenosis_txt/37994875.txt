Title: What are the benefits and drawbacks of statins in carotid artery disease? A perspective review.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of carotid artery stenosis in the general population is approximately 3%, but approximately 20% among people with acute ischemic stroke. Statins are recommended by multiple international guidelines as the drug of choice for lipid control in people with asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid artery stenosis due to their lipid-lowering and other pleiotropic effects.
AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the guidelines for statin usage as a cornerstone in the prevention and management of atherosclerotic carotid artery disease and the impact of statins on stroke incidence and mortality. Statin side effects, alternative therapy, and genetic polymorphisms are reviewed.
EXPERT OPINION: Statin therapy is associated with a decreased incidence of stroke and mortality as well as improved outcomes for patients treated with carotid revascularization. Statins are a safe and effective class of medications, but the initiation of therapy warrants close monitoring to avoid rare and potentially serious side effects. Lack of clinical efficacy or the presence of side effects suggests a need for treatment with an alternative therapy such as PCSK9 inhibitors. Understanding the interplay between the mechanisms of statins and PCSK9 inhibition therapies will allow optimal benefits while minimizing risks. Future research into genetic polymorphisms may improve patient selection for personalized therapy.
