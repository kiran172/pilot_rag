Title: Three's a Crowd-A Unique Combination of Coronary Artery Atresia, Fistula, and Stenosis: Multiple Congenital Coronary Artery Anomalies.

Abstract: The incidence of congenital coronary artery anomalies in the general population is low. The combination of various significant coronary artery anomalies in a single patient is not very common. We describe a case of a 20-month-old child with a unique combination of congenital coronary anomalies (atresia, stenosis, fistula) which were accurately delineated by multimodal imaging and successfully managed surgically.
