Title: [Safety and efficacy of transcatheter closure of Fontan fenestration with atrial septal occluder].

Abstract: Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of transcatheter fenestration closure following Fontan procedure with an atrial septal occluder. Methods: This is a retrospective study. The study sample consists of all consecutive patients who underwent closure of a fenestrated Fontan baffle at Shanghai Children's Medical Center Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine between June 2002 and December 2019. The indications of Fontan fenestration closure included that normal ventricular function, targeted drugs for pulmonary hypertension and positive inotropic drugs were not required prior the procedure; and the Fontan circuit pressure was less than 16 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) and no more than a 2 mmHg increase during test occlusion of the fenestration. Electrocardiogram and echocardiography were reviewed at 24 hours, 1, 3, 6 months and annually thereafter post procedure. Follow-up information including clinical events and complications related to Fontan procedure was recorded. Results: A total of 11 patients, including 6 males and 5 females, aged (8.9±3.7) years old were included. The types of Fontan were extracardiac conduits (7 cases) and intra-atrial duct (4 cases). The interval between percutaneous fenestration closure and the Fontan procedure was (5.1±2.9) years. One patient reported recurrent headache after Fontan procedure. Successful fenestration occlusion with atrial septal occluder was achieved in all patients. Compared with prior closure, Fontan circuit pressure ((12.72±1.90) mmHg vs. (12.36±1.63) mmHg, P&lt;0.05), and aortic oxygen saturation ((95.11±3.11)% vs. (86.35±7.26)%, P&lt;0.01) were increased. There were no procedural complications. At a median follow-up of (3.8±1.2) years, there was no residual leak and evidence of stenosis within the Fontan circuit in all patient. No complication was observed during follow-up. One patient with preoperative headache did not have recurrent headache after closure. Conclusions: If the Fontan pressure is acceptable by test occlusion during the catheterization procedure, Fontan fenestration could be occluded with the atrial septum defect device. It is a safe and effective procedure, and could be used for occlusion of Fontan fenestration with varying sizes and morphologies.
