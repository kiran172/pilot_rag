Title: A Case of Successful Endoscopic Extraction of Common Bile Duct Stones After Closing a Duodenal Perforation Using Over-The-Scope Clip.

Abstract: A 57-year-old man visited our hospital for acute cholangitis due to common bile duct (CBD) stones in March 2021. Biliary stenting was performed without any complications. The cholangitis improved rapidly. He was re-hospitalized to treat the CBD stones in May 2021. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed, endoscopy caused a perforation of the duodenal bulb. We successfully performed endoscopic closure of the duodenal defect using an over-the-scope clip (OTSC速). Considering that mild CBD dilatation of 10 mm can carry an increased risk of stenosis after surgery, we decided to avoid surgery and perform a follow-up endoscopic treatment. He was re-hospitalized in July 2021. The endoscopy revealed OTSC速 in the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb and complete healing of the perforation. We carefully advanced the scope to the second portion of the duodenum while avoiding OTSC速, and the ampulla of Vater was identified. We were then able to remove the stones without any complications. OTSC速 was effective in closing a duodenal perforation and enabled us to carry out the retreatment safely and successfully.
