Title: Chronic inflammatory pulmonary artery lesion causing right pulmonary artery stenosis 15 years post Blalock-Taussig shunt ligation.

Abstract: Discrete central endovascular pulmonary arterial lesions raise clinical concern for malignancy such as primary pulmonary artery sarcoma. We present a case of a female in her late teens who had an obstructive mid right pulmonary artery lesion found on follow-up imaging 15 years after Tetralogy of Fallot repair. The lesion was in the vicinity of a previously ligated Blalock-Taussig shunt and causing right PA stenosis with delayed perfusion to the right lung, and a flow-related distal left PA aneurysm. The lesion was excised and confirmed histologically to be inflammatory in nature. Intraoperative microbiology demonstrated growth of the Kytococcus species, and she was managed with 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, with a full recovery.
