Title: External ureteric stent versus internal double J stent in kidney transplantation: a retrospective analysis on the incidence of urological complications and urinary tract infections.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Urologic complications (UCs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common after kidney transplantation. Intraoperative stent placement at the vesicoureteric anastomosis reduces UC risk, but increases UTI risk.
METHODS: An ES was used in 403 patients (57.8%), in 294 (42.2%) a DJ. ES was removed 7-12 days and DJ 3-4 weeks post-operative. Induction immunosuppression was the same in both groups. Primary outcomes at 6 months follow-up were UC (urinary leakage/ureter stenosis) and UTI; they were related to stenting procedure and clinical and transplant characteristics. The incidence of UCs was similar for ES (8.4%) and DJ (6.8%), p=0.389. ES use was a significant risk factor for UTI (OR 1.69 (1.15-2.50), p=0.008). Post-transplant hospitalization was significantly shorter in the DJ group. Despite more acute rejection episodes with ES (ES/DJ: 16.4%/6.1%, p<0.001), no clinical relevant differences in graft outcomes existed.
DISCUSSION: A DJ is, compared to ES, associated with a lower incidence of UTIs and comparable occurrence of UCs and is therefore the preferred technique for stenting the vesicoureteric anastomosis.
