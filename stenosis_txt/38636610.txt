Title: miR-30a-5p mediates ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced cognitive dysfunction by modulating the SIRT1/NRF2 pathway.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a common cause of brain dysfunction. As a microRNA (also known as miRNAs or miRs), miR-30a-5p participates in neuronal damage and relates to ferroptosis. We explored the in vivo and in vitro effects and functional mechanism of miR-30a-5p in CCH-triggered cognitive impairment through the silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway.
METHODS: After 1 month of CCH modeling through bilateral common carotid artery stenosis, mice were injected with 2 μL antagomir (also known as anti-miRNAs) miR-30a-5p, with cognitive function evaluated by Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. In vitro HT-22 cell oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model was established, followed by miR-30a-5p inhibitor and/or si-SIRT1 transfections, with Fe2+ concentration, malonaldehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) contents, reactive oxygen species (ROS), miR-30a-5p and SIRT1 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protein levels, NRF2 nuclear translocation, and miR-30a-5p-SIRT1 targeting relationship assessed.
RESULTS: CCH-induced mice showed obvious cognitive impairment, up-regulated miR-30a-5p, and down-regulated SIRT1. Ferroptosis occurred in hippocampal neurons, manifested by elevated Fe2+ concentration and ROS and MDA levels, mitochondrial atrophy, and diminished GSH content. Antagomir miR-30a-5p or miR-30a-5p inhibitor promoted SIRT1 expression and NRF2 nuclear translocation, increased GPX4, cell viability and GSH content, and reduced Fe2+ concentration and ROS and MDA levels. miR-30a-5p negatively regulated SIRT1. In vitro, miR-30a-5p knockout increased NRF2 nuclear translocation by up-regulating SIRT1, inhibiting OGD-induced ferroptosis in HT-22 cells.
CONCLUSION: miR-30a-5p induces hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis and exacerbates post-CCH cognitive dysfunction by targeting SIRT1 and reducing NRF2 nuclear translocation.
