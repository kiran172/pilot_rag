Title: Axillary TAVR under locoregional anesthesia in a patient with peripheral artery disease.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now a relatively commonly performed procedure and the number of eligible patients is growing exponentially.  In candidates with peripheral arterial disease, the axillary artery approach is an option worth considering. Usually TAVR performed using this approach is done under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. At our center, however, we have developed a surgical approach to TAVR using the axillary artery under locoregional anesthesia.  This video tutorial demonstrates the technical details of our strategy. Because this procedure is extrathoracic, spares cerebral vessels, and is done under locoregional anesthesia, it is particularly suitable for fragile patients. This combination of both axillary access and locoregional anesthesia has the potential to become a primary main alternative for non-femoral TAVR patients and we hope it will be adopted also by other centers.
