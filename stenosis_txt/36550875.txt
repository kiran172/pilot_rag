Title: Significant improvement of procedural safety in stenting for basilar stenosis: A historically controlled study.

Abstract: The basilar artery has the most perioperative complications in stenting compared to the other intracranial arteries. We aim to study whether the procedural safety in stenting for basilar stenosis has improved. This study was a single-arm, non-randomized trial that included historically controlled patients for comparison. Between January 2012 and March 2019, 147 consecutive patients with symptomatic basilar stenoses receiving elective stenting treatment were included in current basilar artery stenting (BAS) group. The prospectively collected and registered 120 patients by the same interventional team from September 2001 to November 2011 were set as historical BAS group for control. A total of 267 individuals were included in this study, with a mean age of 59.5 ± 8.1 years. The proportion of patients with lesion length >15 mm was 26.5% (39/147) in the current BAS group versus 4.2% (5/120) in the historical BAS group. We found significant differences between these 2 groups in Mori A (17.7% vs 42.5%) and Mori C patients (42.9% vs 13.3%). The proportion of patients receiving preoperative high-resolution magnetic resonance (HRMRI) evaluation was 83.0% (122/147) in the current BAS group versus 20.8% (25/120) in the historical group (P < .05). Balloon-expendable stent (BES) (n = 1), Wingspan (n = 34), and Enterprise (n = 112) stents were placed in the current BAS group. In contrast, only balloon-expendable stent (BES) (n = 48) and Wingspan (n = 72) were deployed in the historical BAS group. The incidence of the safety endpoint (SE) was 4.1% (involving 6 patients) in the current BAS group versus 11.7% (involving 14 patients) in the historical BAS group (P < .05). In multivariate analysis, no risk factor was associated with the occurrence of the safety endpoint (SE). When BAS cases operated by the surgical team accumulated to 120 to 150, the incidence of complications decreased significantly. This is the largest sample size study to discuss the safety of BAS. The significantly decreased incidence of complications indicates that the improving technical measures and the accumulation of operation experience are necessary.
