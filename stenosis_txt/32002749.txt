Title: Surgical repair in a patient with Berry syndrome.

Abstract: Berry syndrome is a trilogy involving an aorto-pulmonary window, right pulmonary artery from ascending aorta and an interrupted aortic arch. Surgical repair for this anomaly is associated with a high mortality rate and incidence of right pulmonary arterial stenosis. Herein, we present the case of a patient with Berry syndrome, who underwent a rapid two-stage repair involving bilateral pulmonary arterial banding and complete repair. Postoperative computed tomography scan showed well-repaired great vessels free of obstruction.
