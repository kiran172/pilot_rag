Title: Lumbar interbody fusion with bilateral cages using a biportal endoscopic technique with a third portal.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Unilateral biportal endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion (ULIF) with one cage results in fewer definitive fusions (Park et al. in Neurosurg Rev 42(3):753-761, 2019). We succeeded in inserting bilateral cages during ULIF.
METHOD: We attempted posterior ULIF for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis with bilateral recess stenosis. With the help of a third portal, ULIF with bilateral cage insertion was performed under general anaesthesia.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully performed ULIF with bilateral cages with the help of a third portal. This procedure may be an alternative for treating lumbar stenosis with instability.
