Title: Clinical characteristics, endovascular choices, and surgical outcomes of intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms: a consecutive series of 196 patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to evaluate the clinical features, endovascular strategy selection, and outcomes of vertebral artery (VA) dissecting aneurysms (VADAs) near the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA).
METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from 196 patients with 202 VADAs who had been surgically treated at the authors' hospital between 2005 and 2021. The patients' medical records, imaging data, and follow-up outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: All 196 patients (148 male, 48 female; mean age 53 years) underwent endovascular therapy for VADA. The most common chief complaints were headache (56.6%), dizziness (40.8%), and other occasional symptoms (18.4%). Twenty-six patients experienced posterior circulation ischemia, and 25 patients experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). On DSA images, 37 aneurysms were found in the dominant VA, and 165 aneurysms were found on the nondominant side. Eighty-eight VADAs had stenosis. Regarding the VADA location, there were 59 distal, 51 proximal, 23 ventral, 64 PICA, and 5 obliteration types. Single-stent implantation (10.9%), overlapping stent implantation (23.8%), flow diverter (FD) implantation (11.9%), single stent-assisted coil (SAC) embolization (31.7%), overlapping SAC embolization (12.9%), parent artery occlusion (PAO) (8.4%), and FD-assisted coil embolization (0.5%) were chosen. The follow-up rate was 82.7%. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 0.5 Â± 1.1. Ninety-six patients underwent DSA. The complete occlusion rates were 100%, 81.4%, 56.7%, and 76.5% in the PAO group, SAC reconstruction group, stent implantation group, and FD implantation group, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Young patients showed a higher probability of SAH, and elderly patients showed a higher probability of posterior circulation infarction. The surgical plan selection should be based on the SAH history, VA dominant side, and PICA origin location.
