Title: Prevalence, risk factors, and clinical effect of coronary artery disease in patients with asymptomatic bilateral carotid stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In the present report, we have described the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical effects of coronary artery disease (CAD) for patients with asymptomatic bilateral carotid stenosis.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients referred for bilateral carotid stenosis >70% (2014-2021). All the patients had undergone systematic coronary angiography. Depending on the anatomic and clinical characteristics, the patients had undergone combined carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plus coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary percutaneous intervention followed by CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS), or staged bilateral CEA with cardiac best medical therapy. The cumulative 30-day stroke/myocardial infarction (MI) rate after cardiac and bilateral carotid interventions and long-term survival and freedom from cardiovascular mortality were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 167 patients with bilateral carotid stenosis >70% had undergone preoperative coronary angiography, identifying severe CAD in 108 patients (65.1%). Echocardiographic abnormalities (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-5.78; P = .04) and prior coronary intervention (OR, 11.94; 95% CI, 2.99-63.81; P = .001) were significantly associated with severe CAD. CAD was treatable in 91 patients (84%) and untreatable in 17 (16%). The cumulative MI rate was 4.8%; 5.6% for the patients with severe CAD and 1.7% for those without severe CAD (P = .262). The cumulative stroke rate was 1.8%; 1.8% for those with severe CAD and 1.7% for those without severe CAD (P = 1.00). The overall stroke/MI rate was 6.6%; 8.3% for those with severe CAD and 3.3% for patients without severe CAD (P = .33). Patients with severe CAD deemed untreatable for coronary bypass or percutaneous intervention had a higher risk of perioperative stroke/MI (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-2.83; P = .04). At 10 years, overall survival was 67.1% (95% CI, 57%-79%), and freedom from cardiovascular mortality was 78.5% (95% CI, 69%-89%). Patients with untreatable CAD maintained a higher risk of 10-year mortality (hazard ratio, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.6-19.9; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the prevalence of CAD in patients with bilateral carotid stenosis was high, especially for those with abnormal echocardiographic findings. CAD was potentially treatable in 80% of patients, and staged or simultaneous CAD treatment was performed with an acceptable stroke/MI complication rate for these patients. The presence of untreatable CAD was associated with worsened early and long-term outcomes, questioning the benefit of carotid interventions for this subset of patients.
