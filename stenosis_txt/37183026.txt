Title: Clinical Significance of Coronary Healed Plaques in Stable Angina Pectoris Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary healed plaques (HPs) reportedly have high vulnerability or show advanced atherosclerosis and a risk of rapid plaque progression. However, the prognosis of stable angina pectoris (SAP) patients with HPs undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains under-investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 417 consecutive lesions from SAP patients undergoing pre- and post-intervention optical coherence tomography (OCT) for which HPs were defined as having a layered appearance. We investigated the differences in clinical and lesion characteristics, and post-PCI outcomes between HPs and non-HPs. To account for differences in clinical characteristics, propensity score matching was performed between the groups. HPs were observed in 216 lesions (51.8%) in the total cohort. In the propensity-matched cohort (n=294), HPs had higher rates of angiographic-B2/C lesions (77.6% vs. 59.2%, P<0.001), OCT-lipid-rich plaques (40.8% vs. 25.9%, P=0.007), macrophages (78.2% vs. 44.2%, P<0.001), greater luminal area stenosis (73.5±11.0% vs. 71.5±10.3%, P=0.002), and a higher prevalence of post-stenting irregular tissue protrusion (45.1% vs. 14.7%, P<0.001) than non-HPs. In the total cohort, target lesion revascularization (TLR)-free survival was poorer for HPs (log-rank test 7.66; P=0.006), and Cox proportional hazards analysis showed HP as an independent predictor of TLR (hazard ratio, 5.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.72-20.82; P=0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: In SAP patients, HPs had greater complexity of lesions and higher vulnerability, which may have contributed to the poorer post-PCI outcomes.
