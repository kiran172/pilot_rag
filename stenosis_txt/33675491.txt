Title: Long Slimmer Metal Stent Is Feasible and Effective for Endoscopic Dual Stent-by-Stent Placement in Malignant Hilar Biliary Stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bilateral endoscopic biliary stenting remains technically challenging, which limits its wider clinical application.
AIMS: We have developed a novel long (10-12 cm) and slimmer (6 mm) self-expanded metal stent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of the new metal stent for palliative treatment of malignant hilar biliary strictures (MHBS).
METHODS: This retrospective study of prospectively collected data included 45 patients with unresectable malignant hilar biliary strictures of Bismuth type II or higher. A pair of long slimmer metal stents were sequentially placed into the intrahepatic duct using the stent-by-stent mode. The success rate and short- and long-term clinical outcomes were observed.
RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100%, with a mean procedure time of 43.7 ± 11.5 min. The clinical success was achieved in 44 patients (97.8%). Early adverse events included mild acute pancreatitis (n = 2) and cholangitis (n = 3). Later cholangitis occurred in 14 of the 45 patients due to stent occlusions. The median stent patency was 260 days (95% CI 228.3-291.7). Stent malfunctions occurred in 23 of the 45 patients, and 15 of them received bilateral endoscopic plastic stents placements. The technical success for the re-intervention was 100% with the mean procedure time of 24.3 ± 4.5 min. The median overall survival of the whole group was 229 days (95% CI 171.2-286.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The long slimmer metal stent for bilateral endoscopic stent-by-stent placement proved to be safe, feasible, and effective for MHBS and facilitates endoscopic re-intervention as well.
