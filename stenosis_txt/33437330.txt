Title: Experience using drug-coated balloon venoplasty for acquired pulmonary vein stenosis after radiofrequency ablation.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis is a rare but severe complication of catheter ablation for arterial fibrillation (AF). Symptoms include dyspnea, hemoptysis, recurrent pneumonia, and pulmonary hypertension. We herein discuss a 27-year-old male patient who presented with hemoptysis and dyspnea three months after catheter ablation for AF. Computed tomography demonstrated an occluded left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) and left lower lung edema secondary to severe stenosis of the LIPV. The patient underwent treatment, including drug-coated balloon (DCB) venoplasty. Treatment of pulmonary vein stenosis involving percutaneous interventions with balloon angioplasty and stenting carry a high risk of restenosis. DCB therapy may be used to prevent stenosis. &lt;Learning objective: The use of a drug-coated balloon is feasible and may provide good long-term outcomes in acquired pulmonary vein stenosis after radiofrequency ablation.&gt;.
