Title: A Neglected Open Laryngeal Wound: A Rare Presentation of Neck Trauma.

Abstract: Laryngotracheal trauma can be potentially lethal. Improper healing can have long term sequelae such as permanent voice change, laryngotracheal stenosis and impaired swallowing severely affecting an individual's quality of life. Thus early identification and prompt treatment is paramount to achieve good outcomes in laryngotracheal trauma. A 45 year old male presented with an open laryngeal wound 12 days after sustaining the injury. Surgical closure of the wound was done. A suprahyoid drop was done to achieve tension free repair of the laryngeal rent. Chin to chest sutures were used to maintain neck flexion in the post-operative period. We were able to achieve a good surgical outcome with regards to the patients voice, airway and swallowing in spite of the delayed presentation.
