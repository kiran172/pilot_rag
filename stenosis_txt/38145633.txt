Title: The interventional care for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Establishing indicators for optimal interventional care.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the quality of interventional care for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a set of quality indicators.
METHODS: We developed an initial list of quality indicators by incorporating current guidelines, observing practice discrepancies, and basing it on the Donabedian "structure, process, and outcome" three-dimensional quality evaluation model as the framework. The Delphi method was utilized in two rounds of consultation involving 31 experts to evaluate and revise indicators at all levels.
RESULTS: The response rate of expert questionnaires was 100% for both rounds, and the expert authority coefficients were 0.913 and 0.940, respectively. The Kendall harmony coefficients were 0.221 and 0.195, respectively, with P < 0.05. Eventually, a quality evaluation system of interventional care for patients undergoing TAVR was constructed, consisting of three structural indicators, nine process indicators, and 42 outcome indicators.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality evaluation system for interventional care of TAVR sought to establish specific, objective, and quantifiable criteria for assessing the quality of care. It is recommended to apply the set of quality indicators across hospitals to enhance the quality of care for TAVR.
