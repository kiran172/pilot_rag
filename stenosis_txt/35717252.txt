Title: Modified technique for robot-assisted laparoscopic infantile ureteral reimplantation for obstructive megaureter.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To describe a novel modification of technique to improve efficacy of robot-assisted laparoscopic extravesical ureteral reimplantation (RALUR-EV) in infants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2017 and July 2019, sixteen infants with primary obstructive megaureter (POM) (Age range: 4-12 months) underwent robot-assisted ureteral reimplantation were reviewed in this series. In addition to the conventional Lich-Gregoir technique, the detrusor tunnel has been extended to the mobilized anterior bladder wall to guarantee sufficient tunnel length/ureter diameter ratio and avoid ureteral angulation. All patients underwent repeated ultrasound, diuretic renal dynamic imaging and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) perioperatively and the outcomes were documented.
RESULTS: All operations were completed with robotic assisted approach without conversion. Bilateral and unilateral reimplantation were respectively performed in two and fourteen patients. The mean operative time was 115.0 ± 19.5 min and the mean blood loss was 10.0 ± 1.8 ml. There were no high-grade complications (III-IV on Clavien-Dindo classification) except for one patient. The distal ureteric diameter was reduced from pre operative 1.7 ± 0.5 to 0.6 ± 0.5 cm 6 months post operatively (p < 0.05). One child (6.3%) required the second reimplantation for stenosis. The overall operative success rate was 94.4% (17 of 18 ureters) with a mean follow-up of 15.9 ± 7.4 months with no flux detected.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience suggests that our modified robot-assisted laparoscopic extravesical ureteral reimplantation is feasible in infants with good results.
