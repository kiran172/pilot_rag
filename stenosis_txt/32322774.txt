Title: Progressive stenosis of a popliteal artery stent graft by laminated thrombus.

Abstract: We present a case of failed popliteal artery aneurysm repair using a Viabahn stent graft (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) due to laminated thrombus formation. A 75-year-old man presented with a symptomatic popliteal artery aneurysm. He was treated with a Viabahn stent graft. On follow-up, the patient complained of lower extremity claudication, and duplex ultrasound examination showed a focal intrastent stenosis. A computed tomography scan showed a significant stenosis within the stent graft, at the level of the knee joint creases. The patient underwent superficial femoral artery to distal popliteal surgery. This case report aims to expand on the mechanism of stent graft failure in popliteal aneurysms.
