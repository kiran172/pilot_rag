Title: Endovascular treatments of atherosclerotic renovascular disease: a narrative review and literature search.

Abstract: In recent years, endovascular treatments have become more common in patients with renal artery stenosis and aneurysm. Although the treatment algorithms are not universally accepted, endovascular therapy can be readily utilized for the appropriate indications in the context of surgical treatment for renovascular diseases. The most important factor to consider is that the correct indication is applied for such treatment. Although the applied procedures are believed to have minimal risk, any complications that occur may result in major problems. Moreover, the pathology that is being treated (e.g., hypertension, high serum creatinine concentration, or low glomerular filtration rate) must be well defined. As stent and balloon technologies continue to be developed, more positive results are expected in the coming years. In the present study, we reviewed the endovascular treatment algorithms for atherosclerotic renovascular disease and performed a narrative review of the current literature.
