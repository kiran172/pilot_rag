Title: Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with mobility and cognitive dysfunction and heightens falls in older adults.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis of the carotid bifurcation with plaque formation causes asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS), which may also be associated with cerebral hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion adversely affects multiple aspects of mobility and cognition. This study tests the hypothesis that community-dwelling older adults with a 50% or greater diameter-reducing ACAS will have mobility and cognitive impairments that heighten their risk for falls.
METHODS: Eighty community-dwelling adults completed a mobility assessment (Short Physical Performance Battery, Berg Balance Scale, Four Square Step Test, Dynamic Gait Index, Timed Up and Go, and gait speed), self-reported physical function (Activities-Specific Balance Confidence, SF-12 Physical Function Component), and cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State Examination). Falls were recorded for the past 6 months. Standardized carotid ultrasound examination classified participants into no stenosis (<50% diameter reduction) (n = 54), moderate stenosis (50%-69%) (n = 17), and high-grade stenosis (70%-99%) (n = 9) groups. Linear and logistic regression analyses determined the associations between these measures and the degree of stenosis (three groups).
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed their degree of stenosis was associated with reductions in mobility (Short Physical Performance Battery [P = .008], Berg Balance Scale [P = .0008], Four Square Step Test [P = .005], DGI [P = .0001], TUG [P = .0004], gait speed [P = .02]), perceived physical function (ABC [P < .0001], SF-12 Physical Function Component [P < .0001]), and cognition (MMSE [P = .003]). Adults with moderate- and high-grade stenosis had a greater incidence of falls compared with those without stenosis (relative risk, 2.86; P = .01). Results remained unchanged after adjustment for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: ACAS is associated with impaired mobility and cognition that are accompanied with increased fall risk. These impairments increased with worsening severity.
