Title: Infective endocarditis following percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty: A case report of a 25-year-old female from Jimma Medical Center of Ethiopia.

Abstract: Rheumatic mitral stenosis is a common rheumatic heart diseases in sub-Saharan Afrleading to increased morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty is the mainstay of less invasive therapy in those with moderate to severe valve stenosis, being symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy. Though generally save with experienced hand and setup, post procedural complications include development of mitral regurgitation, tear and thrombosis. Mitral leaflet tear and development of infective endocarditis are an uncommon but might lead to increased morbidity, rehospitalization and mortality.
