Title: [Long-term outcomes of lower extremity arteriovenous grafts].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the long-term outcomes of lower extremity arteriovenous graft (AVG) in hemodialysis patients. Methods: Hemodialysis patients with lower extremity AVG from August 2015 to July 2023 in the Department of Vascular Surgery, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were enrolled. Therapeutic effects and complications of AVG were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 83 cases aged (58.9Â±13.3) years were enrolled, including 25 males and 58 females. The success rate of the operation was 100% (83/83), and no perioperative complications occurred. The follow-up time [M (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>)] was 38.4 (22.6, 55.3) months, with a follow-up rate of 92.8% (77/83). There were 9 cases (11.7%) of puncture site infection, 5 cases (6.5%) of pseudoaneurysm, 2 cases (2.6%) of seroma, 3 cases (3.9%) of lower limb ischemia, 48 cases (62.3%) of stenosis and 24 cases (31.2%) of thrombosis during the follow-up period. The 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year and 5-year primary patency rates after surgery were 78.9%, 61.2%, 39.0%, 27.0% and 16.3%, respectively, assisted primary patency rates were 93.5%, 82.5%, 74.9%, 68.0% and 53.0%, respectively, and secondary patency rates were 96.1%, 94.7%, 93.1%, 91.3% and 75.3%, respectively. Conclusion: For patients whose vascular resources of upper limbs are exhausted, lower extremity AVG is a safe and effective hemodialysis vascular access.
