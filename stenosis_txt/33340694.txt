Title: Thoracofemoral bypass outcomes in the Vascular Quality Initiative.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Thoracofemoral bypass (TFB) has been used infrequently but is an alternative for select patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease. Limited data are available in the reported data regarding TFB, with all studies small, single-center series. We aimed to describe the perioperative and long-term survival, patency, and rate of major perioperative complications after TFB in a large national registry.
METHODS: The Vascular Quality Initiative suprainguinal bypass module was used to identify patients who had undergone TFB for occlusive disease from 2009 to 2019. A descriptive analysis was performed to provide the rates of survival, patency, major complications, and freedom from major amputation in the perioperative period and at 1 year of follow-up. Major complications were compared by procedure indication, with categorical variables analyzed using χ2 tests and continuous variables using analysis of variance. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was used to estimate survival at the 1- and 5-year follow-up intervals and freedom from major amputation at 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 154 TFB procedures were identified. Of the 154 patients, 59 (38.3%) had undergone previous inflow bypass and 22 (14.2%) had undergone previous leg bypass. The procedure indications included claudication (n = 66; 42.9%), rest pain (n = 59; 38.3%), tissue loss (n = 19; 12.3%), and acute limb ischemia (n = 10; 6.5%). Major complications (eg, wound infection, respiratory, major stroke, new dialysis, cardiac, embolic, major amputation, occlusion) occurred in 31.2% of the cohort. When examined by indication, the acute limb ischemia and claudication cohorts had an increased rate of major complications (acute limb ischemia, 60.0%; claudication, 34.8%; critical limb ischemia, 24.4%; P = .05). The survival rate at 30 days was 95.5%, with a Kaplan-Meier estimated 1-year survival rate of 92.7% ± 2.2%. Primary patency at discharge from the index hospitalization was 92.9% and 89.0% at 1 year. Postoperative major amputation was required for 1 patient during the index hospitalization, for a Kaplan-Meier estimated freedom from major amputation at 1 year of 97.1% ± 2.2%. Two patients developed in-hospital bypass occlusion and three patients developed occlusion within 1 year, for an overall freedom from occlusion rate of 96.8% at 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: TFB is associated with a high rate of perioperative major complications; however, the long-term survival and patency after TFB remained acceptable when performed for limb salvage. The high perioperative complication rates of TFB procedures performed for claudication suggest TFB should be used rarely in this population. These data can be used to counsel patients and aid in decision making before operative intervention.
