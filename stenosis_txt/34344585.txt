Title: Balloon Seal Separation Leading to SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve Deployment Failure: Complications and Management.

Abstract: We present two cases of failure of balloon inflation secondary to balloon separation from the delivery catheter when implanting the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Although very uncommon, this is a potentially disastrous complication of transcatheter intervention. Case 1 highlights the complexity of the problem when it occurs and subsequent complications. Case 2 highlights how to manage this issue successfully.
