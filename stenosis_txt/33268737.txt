Title: [Patient with Recurrent Breast Cancer Who Developed Radiation Esophagitis with Severe Esophageal Stenosis after Combined Bevacizumab and Paclitaxel Therapy-A Case Report].

Abstract: Severe stenosis rarely occurs with radiation esophagitis after irradiation. We report our recent experience of a case of recurrent breast cancer in which the patient developed severe esophageal stenosis after receiving combined bevacizumab (Bev)-paclitaxel(PTX)therapy following radiotherapy for a thoracic vertebral metastasis. A 59-year-old woman with Stage â…¢B left breast cancer had undergone total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection after receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels were observed 23 months postoperatively, and multiple bone metastases were detected on PET-CT. After 5 sessions of irradiation with 20 Gy at the Th8-L1 level, combined Bev and PTX plus zoledronic acid was administered. The patient developed dysphagia at the end of the 4 cycles of combined Bev and PTX therapy, and her condition exacerbated subsequently. Therefore, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, which revealed a circumferential stenosis 31-37 cm from the incisors. We decided to perform the endoscopic treatment. After 3 balloon dilatations, her condition improved, and oral ingestion was possible. The esophageal stenosis might have been caused by the exacerbation of esophagitis because of the delayed wound healing effect of Bev in addition to radiation.
