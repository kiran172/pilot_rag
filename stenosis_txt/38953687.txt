Abstract: This case report describes laryngeal oedema occurring in a 35-year-old woman with chronic bowel-associated dermatosis-arthritis syndrome, and stenosis of the left main bronchus. The oedema was attributed to persistent cough exacerbated by delayed treatment and intubation-related irritation. Evaluations ruled out inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant causes. Literature lacks on specific descriptions of cough-induced laryngeal oedema, emphasizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach and early intervention in complex cases to prevent severe hospitalizations in patients with known serious conditions and symptom exacerbation.
