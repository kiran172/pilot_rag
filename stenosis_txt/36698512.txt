Title: Double valve replacement in a case of Hedinger syndrome.

Abstract: Hedinger Syndrome or carcinoid heart disease is a rare cardiac complication of neuroendocrine tumors (NET) affecting the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Following is a case description of a patient undergoing treatment for a neuroendocrine tumor with liver metastasis, referred with symptomatic tricuspid valve regurgitation and pulmonary valve stenosis for surgical valve replacement. Planned surgical valve replacement was successfully performed before the onset of severe right ventricular failure or pulmonary hypertension in this case of carcinoid heart disease. An interdisciplinary approach and regular follow up is recommended in such cases.
