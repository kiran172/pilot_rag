Title: Successful staged repair of pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries in an extremely low birth weight infant.

Abstract: An extremely low birth weight infant (810 g) was born with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries accompanied by pulmonary overcirculation, which eventually resulted in intestinal hypoperfusion and focal intestinal perforation from the very early stage of life. Based on the echographic findings, we performed banding operations twice to regulate the pulmonary blood flow on day 2 and day 9. At 6 months of age, a definitive repair simultaneous with unifocalization of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries was performed. At 1 year of age, the right ventricle/left ventricle pressure ratio was 0.44 after balloon angioplasty was performed for the right-sided pulmonary artery stenosis. The patient is in a stable condition and was followed-up for more than 2 years after definitive repair. This is the first known successful repair of pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries in an extremely low birth weight infant.
