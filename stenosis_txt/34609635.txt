Title: Hemorrhoidal surgery in patients with IBD: caution is the parent of safety.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of hemorrhoidal surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergoing surgery at our center.
METHODS: All adult patients with IBD undergoing hemorrhoidal surgery in our department between November 1, 2013 and July 7, 2020 were included in the study. At the time of surgery, the patients' IBD was in clinical, biological and endoscopic remission, and none of the patients had specific primary anoperineal lesions.
RESULTS: We included 25 patients (48% female) with a mean age 48 years (± 13.1 years). There were 13 cases of CD (52%) and 12 of ulcerative colitis (UC). Pharmacological and instrumental hemorrhoidal treatment had failed in all patients. The CD lesions were exclusively ileal (77%) or ileocolic (23%). The surgical procedures performed for CD were mono-hemorrhoidectomy in three patients (21.4%), tripedicular hemorrhoidectomy in six patients (42.9%), and artery ligations with mucopexy in five patients (35.7%). UC was rectal (16.7%), rectosigmoid (66.7%), or pancolic (16.6%). The surgical procedures performed for UC were a tripedicular hemorrhoidectomy in ten patients (83.3%) and artery ligations with mucopexy in two patients (16.7%). The mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 15.1 months. None of the patients was lost to follow-up. The mean time to wound healing after resection was 71.1 days (± 21 days) for patients with CD and 56.9 days (± 6.7 days) for patients with UC (p = 0.05). Postoperative complications were reported for four patients with CD (28.8%) and two patients with UC (16.7%). There was no suppuration, stenosis, or anal incontinence sequelae.
CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhoidal surgery resulted in a non-negligible frequency of complications in our series of IBD patients, especially in those with CD. Caution is, therefore, still necessary in this patient population.
