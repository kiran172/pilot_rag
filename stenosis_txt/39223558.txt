Title: Role of unilateral partial facet joint preservation in postero-lateral approach lumbar interbody fusion for patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis presenting bilateral lower limb symptoms: a retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Posterolateral decompression and fusion with internal fixation is a commonly used surgical approach for treating degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS). This study aims to evaluate the impact of preserving a portion of the unilateral facet joint during decompression on surgical outcomes and long-term recovery in patients.
METHODS: This study analyzed 73 patients with DLSS accompanied by bilateral lower limb neurological symptoms who underwent single-level L4/5 posterolateral decompression and fusion surgery from January 2022 to March 2023. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the type of surgery received: Group A comprised 31 patients who underwent neural decompression without facet joint preservation, while Group B consisted of 42 patients who underwent neural decompression with preservation of partial facet joints on one side. Regular follow-up evaluations were conducted, including clinical and radiological assessments immediately postoperatively, and at 3 and 12 months thereafter. Key patient information was documented through retrospective chart reviews.
RESULTS: Most patients in both groups experienced favorable surgical outcomes. However, four cases encountered complications. Notably, during follow-up, Group B demonstrated superior 1-year postoperative interbody fusion outcomes (P < 0.05), along with a trend towards less interbody cage subsidence and slower postoperative intervertebral disc height loss. Additionally, Group B showed significantly reduced postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Under strict adherence to surgical indications, the posterior lateral lumbar fusion surgery, which preserves partial facet joint unilaterally during neural decompression, can offer greater benefits to patients.
