Title: Indications and complications of secondary tracheoesophageal puncture in Chinese laryngectomees.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although there are many literatures about secondary tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) for voice prosthesis. Most of the description of indications is not specific and the description of complications is not so vivid, which is not of great value for novice doctors.
OBJECTIVE: To show specific indications and vivid complications of secondary TEP with typical clinical pictures for novice doctors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical data of 20 patients undergoing secondary TEP for Provox Vega voice prosthesis in our hospital were analyzed. The surgical indications and the prevention and treatment of common perioperative complications were summarized.
RESULTS: The surgical indications included: no obvious stenosis of the stoma and the entrance of esophagus; no obvious scar constitution, mouth opening restriction and backward restraint of the neck, etc. The common postoperative complications included: TEP fistula infection (2 cases), bleeding of the fistula (1 case), deep neck abscess (1 case), granulation hyperplasia at the inner side of the fistula (1 case), invagination of the voice prosthesis (2 cases) and leakage (2 cases).
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The secondary TEP for Provox Vega voice prosthesis is clinically safe, but certain indications should be mastered. Common postoperative complications can be solved through preventive and remedial treatment schemes.
