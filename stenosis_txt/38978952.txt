Title: Takes Two to Tangle: A Rare Case of Type IV Dual Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) and Dual Ostia of the LAD and Left Circumflex (LCx) Artery.

Abstract: The dual left anterior descending (LAD) artery is a rare anatomic variant of the LAD artery that refers to the duplication of the LAD into a short and long LAD. These two vessels, differentiated based on their lengths, ultimately provide blood supply to the areas normally covered by the LAD. In this case report, we describe an unusual case of a type IV dual LAD system with an additional finding of a separate origin for the short LAD and left circumflex (LCx) artery. These two findings have not been reported together in the literature previously. During diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography or when interpreting cardiac imaging, awareness of these anomalies prevents confusion with pathological conditions such as coronary artery disease or stenosis. Additionally, it is crucial for cardiologists and surgeons to identify these aberrant vessels to avoid any wrongful interventions.
