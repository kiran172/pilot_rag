Abstract: Aortic-to-right ventricle fistula is a rare complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In this case report, an 87-year-old male was admitted with signs of congestion six weeks after TAVI. Two days later, he developed severe epigastric and back pain, elevated D-dimer, lactic acidosis and renal failure. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a progressing aortic-to-right ventricle fistula which in retrospect had been present since the TAVI-procedure. The patient died despite supportive treatment.
