Title: Outcomes of myocardial fibrosis in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIMS: We sought to investigate the relevance of myocardial fibrosis, assessed by mid-wall fibrosis risk (MFR) score, with respect to left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between January 2010 and March 2015, we enrolled 207 patients in whom baseline MFR, which includes age, sex, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, presence of strain pattern on electrocardiography, and peak aortic valve velocity, as well as one-year follow-up echocardiography was available. LV reverse remodelling was defined as a >10% reduction in LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi). A higher MFR score (â‰¥52) was associated with increased LVEDVi and with decreased LV ejection fraction as well as higher baseline NT-proBNP levels (p<0.05 for all). One year after the TAVR procedure, a higher MFR score was associated with a decreased probability of LV reverse remodelling (OR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23-0.87; p=0.03), which was independent of baseline echocardiographic parameters and comorbidities. In contrast, there was no significant difference in five-year mortality between patients with lower and higher MFR scores (57.9% vs 60.5%, p=0.66).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher MFR score is associated with reduced LV reverse remodelling at one-year follow-up, whereas the MFR score does not appear to correlate with long-term mortality after TAVR.
