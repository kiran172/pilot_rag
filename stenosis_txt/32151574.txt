Title: Decellularized Bovine Pericardial Mitral Valve in a Neonatal Marfan Patient.

Abstract: Mitral valve construction using decellularized bovine pericardium is a new procedure. A 10-month-old infant with neonatal Marfan syndrome underwent mitral valve replacement due to severe mitral regurgitation with a cylinder valve constructed from decellularized bovine pericardium. Nineteen months postoperatively the patient is clinically well with trivial mitral regurgitation, mild stenosis, and without need for anticoagulation.
