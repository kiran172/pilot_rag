Title: Clinical and radiographic performance of indirect foraminal decompression with anterior retroperitoneal lumbar approach for interbody fusion (ALIF).

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study BACKGROUND: Indirect decompression with ALIF allows the restoration of the disk and foraminal height with limited soft tissue damage. However, it does not offer a direct view of the neural structure and a direct intraoperative assessment of the results of the decompression is not possible. For this reason, ALIF is often accompanied by posterior, direct decompression. So far, there is no consensus on the effects of indirect decompression alone for L5-S1 foraminal stenosis.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the clinical and mechanical performance of indirect decompression with anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) in L5-S1 foraminal stenosis.
METHODS: All patients who underwent ALIF at our institution and had a minimum follow-up of six months were assessed for inclusion. Radiographic parameters (anterior and posterior disc height, foraminal height and surface, L5-S1 angle, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis) and clinical data (Oswestry Disability Index - ODI and Numeric Rating Scale - NRS) before ALIF and at the last follow-up were compared. A regression analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between radiographic and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were available for the study (55.9% female, mean age 53.4±11.5 years), mean follow-up was 26.4±11.1 months. At the last follow-up, a significant increase in foraminal height (14.6±4.0 vs. 17.9±3.9 mm, p<0.001), posterior disc height (6.5±2 vs. 9.1±2 mm, p<0.001) was observed. ODI and NRS back and leg improved significantly. The NRS leg correlated with foraminal height (r=-0.45), foraminal surface (r=-0.36) and anterior (r=-0.41) and posterior disc height (r=-0.43).
CONCLUSION: ALIF provided significant indirect foraminal decompression and improvement of radicular pain. The increase of foraminal height, surface, and posterior disc height is directly associated with radicular pain improvement.
