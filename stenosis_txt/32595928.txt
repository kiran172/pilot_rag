Title: Sleeve gastrectomy without bougie is safe and effective operation: case report.

Abstract: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an effective method for weight loss; it is done by laparoscopy or open approach; it is a restrictive procedure and involves removing part of the stomach by cutting over bougie, which ensures that stenosis doesn't occur. Bougie may cause esophageal perforation. There are studies that show the size of bougie used and weight loss are related. We show a case of open SG without using bougie at all. It is an effective and safe method and results in ~30% of weight loss 3Â months after the operation without complications; thus, we conclude that SG can be done without bougie.
