Title: Occlusion of a Vortex Vein After Treatment With Half-Fluence Photodynamic Therapy Combined With Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection for Pachychoroid Neovasculopathy.

Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment option for pachychoroid diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome (PPS). On the other hand, morphological changes of choroidal vessels in the irradiated field after PDT have also been discussed, with occlusion of choriocapillaris and stenosis of choroidal middle and large vessels being reported. Here, we report a case of vortex vein occlusion after half-fluence PDT (HF-PDT) combined with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent for PNV. In this case, HF-PDT achieved complete occlusion of PNV; in addition, a vortex vein that flowed in PNV but was located outside the PDT irradiation field was fully occluded three months post-treatment. At the occluded site of the vortex vein, indocyanine green video angiography revealed pulsation downstream of the vortex vein. Such occlusion of a large vessel by HF-PDT has not been reported previously. Occlusion could be induced by two factors: the potentiality of PDT and risk factors for thromboembolism, such as older age, smoking, and arrhythmia. Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms of these large vessel occlusions.
