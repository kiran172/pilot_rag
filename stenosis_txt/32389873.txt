Title: Clinical and Radiologic Features of Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy Depending on the Presence of Cord Signal Change.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cord signal change (CSC) on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an important radiologic feature of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Occasionally, DCMs correlate with clinical symptoms with no CSC. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiologic features, depending on the presence of CSC in DCM.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 73 patients who underwent cervical laminoplasty for DCM. They were divided into 2 groups based on the presence of CSC on static MR imaging (positive CSC in group A and negative CSC in group B). Preoperative radiologic parameters on lateral radiographs and the severity of canal stenosis on MR imaging were analyzed. The functional outcomes were evaluated using the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score and Nurick grade.
RESULTS: Group A showed more deteriorated canal stenosis (P < 0.001) and kyphotic change than did group B. C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (P = 0.003) of group A and C2-7 range of motion (C27ROM; P < 0.001) of group B were greater than in the opposite groups, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, greater width of the cervical canal (P = 0.002) and increased C27ROM (P = 0.002) were statistically significant radiologic parameters related to negative CSC. Group B showed better functional outcomes until 6 months postoperatively, with statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: DCM with negative CSC can be caused by a well-preserved cervical ROM, even with less deteriorated canal stenosis and kyphosis. C27ROM may be a helpful radiologic parameter in diagnosing DCM before CSC appears.
