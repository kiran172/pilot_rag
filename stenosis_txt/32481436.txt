Title: Endoscopic papillectomy of benign papillary tumors: A single-center experience.

Abstract: Endoscopic treatment of duodenal papillary tumors is well described. This study aims to provide new evidence for the treatment of benign papillary tumors through comparisons between endoscopic snare papillectomy (ESP) and endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR).Between May 2010 and December 2017, 72 patients were enrolled. Diagnosis and treatment procedures were ESP and EMR. Endoscopic follow-up evaluation was done periodically as a surveillance measurement for recurrence.Seventy-two patients with ampullary tumors were enrolled, of which 66 had adenomas including 9 high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias and 2 carcinomas in adenoma. Complete resections with tumor-free lateral and basal margins were achieved in all patients. Postoperative complications were bleeding (9.5% in EMR vs 10% in ESP) and pancreatitis (2.4% in EMR and 3.3% in ESP), with no occurrence of perforation, cholangitis or papillary stenosis. Adenoma recurrence was found in 7 patients (14.3% in EMR vs 3.3% in ESP) at 1 year.The ESP procedure is safe and effective for benign ampullary adenoma, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasias, and noninvasive cancer without intraductal tumor growth, which has a shorter procedural duration, as well as lower complication, recurrence rates and hospitalization costs.
