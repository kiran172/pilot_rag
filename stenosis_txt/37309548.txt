Title: Hybrid robot-assisted abdominoperineal resection supported by simultaneous trans-perineal approach for anal gland adenocarcinoma with vaginal invasion: a case report.

Abstract: Hybrid surgery (abdominal robotic approach with a trans-anal approach) has been reported to improve oncological outcomes in cases involving advanced cancer or technical difficulties. A 74-year-old woman presented with anal pain and stenosis. Examination revealed palpable sclerosis on the anterior wall at the anal verge with possible vaginal invasion. A biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma. We performed a two-team robot-assisted abdominoperineal resection combined with resection of the vagina supported by a simultaneous trans-perineal approach. After rendezvous at the posterior side, the abdominal team cut the posterior wall of the vaginal vault while the perineal team confirmed the surgical margin. Histopathological findings identified the tumour as an anal gland adenocarcinoma (pT4b [vagina] N0M0 pathological stage IIC) with a negative circumferential resection margin. Hybrid surgery combined with resection of the posterior wall of the vagina may be performed safely and is a valuable surgical option for multimodal treatment of anal adenocarcinomas.
