Title: Pyloric stent insertion in malignant gastric outlet obstruction: moving beyond palliation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Self-expandable metallic stents have not only largely replaced surgical gastrojejunostomy for unresectable gastric cancers, but their role as bridging therapy for resectable obstructing tumours is also evolving.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyloric stents in gastric outlet obstruction in patients with gastric cancer and assess survival in patients with resectable obstructing gastric tumours in whom stents were inserted as a bridge to surgery.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of patients who underwent self-expandable metallic stent insertion for gastric outlet obstruction due to gastric cancer from January 2014 to March 2019.
RESULTS: Out of 161 patients, clinical improvement was observed in 159 (99%) and 156 (97%) at 1 and 12 weeks of stent placement, respectively. None of these patients experienced serious complications, such as perforation or aspiration pneumonia. Of these 161 patients, enteral stents were placed as bridging therapy prior to surgery in 40 (24.8%). Among these, 35 (87.5%) of 40 underwent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative surgery. Of the 35 patients, 3 failed to follow-up. One-year survival following curative surgery was 87.5%. Stent helped to reduce vomiting and improve nutrition, measured by the body mass index (p = 0.36) and serum albumin (p = 0.05), over a 4-week period following stent insertion.
CONCLUSION: Pyloric stents are useful in relieving malignant gastric outlet obstruction, maintaining nutrition during neo-adjuvant treatment and improving survival without additional risk of postoperative complications. They have traditionally been used for palliation, but should also be considered as bridging therapy for obstructing resectable gastric tumours during neo-adjuvant treatment.
