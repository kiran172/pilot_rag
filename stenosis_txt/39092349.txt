Title: Post-infectious Moyamoya Syndrome: A Review of Existing Scientific Literature From 2000 to 2023.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is considered a primary disorder of an unknown etiology. In contrast, Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) refers to MMD associated with other underlying diseases, such as meningitis in childhood, neurofibromatosis type II, Down syndrome, cranial irradiation, and different types of anemias, particularly hemoglobinopathies. We aimed to provide a comprehensive clinicopathological overview of MMS. All case reports and case series published from 2000 to 2023 pertaining to MMD were included in the study. Case studies, original articles, editorials, letters to editors, and clinical images were excluded. The search was conducted using the Boolean operators ("AND" and "OR") on PubMed and Google Scholar. A total of 13 case reports and one case series study were included. The study suggests infection might be a trigger in susceptible individuals. The autoimmune antibody findings (anti-double stranded DNA IgG) suggest a potential autoimmune component in some cases. There were diverse presentations and outcomes of post-infectious MMS, with a striking predominance of pediatric cases (66.66%) and a possible female predominance. Both computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed evidence of restricted blood flow. CT showed that stenosis, occlusion, and collateral formation were frequent vascular findings, but often unspecified in severity. Infarction, hypodensities, and hematoma were the most common parenchymal findings (22.22% each). The findings on MRI were stenosis (50%) and collateral formation (44.44%). Infarction was the most common finding (66.66%) in parenchyma. Hydrocephalus, encephalomalacia, and atrophy were less frequent. Lesions were most frequent in the internal carotid artery (66.66%),Â middle cerebral artery (66.66%), and anterior cerebral artery (50%). Lesions were less frequent in the posterior cerebral, vertebral, and basilar arteries. The frontal lobe (38.89%) and basal ganglia (33.33%) were commonly affected parenchymal regions. The most common risk factor was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (50%), followed by trisomy 21, cryptococcal, and other types of meningitides. Aspirin (50%) and antiretroviral therapy (38.89%) were the cornerstones of treatment for MMS. This review accentuates the noteworthy obstacles presented by post-infectious MMS, especially its catastrophic effect on children and its correlation with HIV/AIDS. According to our elaborate literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar, this is the first narrative review in the existing scientific literature summarizing the literature on post-infectious MMS.
