Title: Impact of Economic Status on Utilization and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Mitraclip.

Abstract: Data on the impact of economic status on Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and MitraClip (MC) is lacking. Patients who underwent TAVI and/or MC during 2012 to 2017 were identified in the Nationwide Readmission Database and divided by zip code estimated income quartile into 4 groups (Q1 to Q4). The utilization of TAVI and/or MC was defined as the number of TAVIs and/or MCs over all admissions with an aortic and/or mitral valve disease (AVD and/or MVD) and represented per 1,000 admissions. A total of 168,853 patients underwent TAVI; 20.6% in Q1, 26.3% in Q2, 27.3% in Q3, and 25.8% in Q4, while 15,387 patients underwent MC; 22% in Q1, 26.2% in Q2, 26.3% in Q3, and 25.5% in Q4. The annual utilization of TAVIs and/or MCs increased over the study period and was generally lower with lower income. In 2012, TAVI was performed for 8.2, 8.8, 10.8, and 11.3 per 1,000 AVD admissions in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. In 2017, TAVI was performed for 54.1, 65.1, 68.6, and 71 per 1,000 AVD admissions in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. In 2014, MC was performed for 1.6, 2.1, 1.8, and 1.9 per 1,000 MVD admissions in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. In 2017, MC was performed for 5.6, 6.5, 8, and 8 per 1,000 MVD admissions in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. In-hospital mortality, stroke, and 30-day readmissions were generally comparable across groups. Lower-income patients may be underrepresented among patients undergoing TAVI and MC despite comparable outcomes. Further studies are needed to examine the etiologies behind these disparities and identify targeted strategies for its mitigation.
