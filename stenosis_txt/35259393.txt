Title: Endoscopic gastric plication for the treatment of weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (with video).

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gastric plication involves inverting the stomach with tissue anchor placement to achieve serosa-to-serosa apposition. One potential application of gastric plication is the treatment of weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), a procedure also known as plication transoral outlet reduction (P-TORe). This study aims to assess technical feasibility, safety, and efficacy of P-TORe.
METHODS: This was a registry study of RYGB patients who underwent P-TORe for weight regain. The primary outcome was the amount of weight loss and clinical success rate, defined as percentage of total weight loss (TWL) of at least 5% at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were technical success, adverse events (AEs), and predictors of weight loss.
RESULTS: One hundred eleven RYGB patients underwent P-TORe. Average body mass index (BMI) was 38.5 ± 7.5 kg/m2. Baseline gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) and pouch sizes were 17 ± 6 mm and 5 ± 2 cm, respectively. The primary outcome was total weight loss, defined as patients experiencing 9.5% ± 8.5% TWL at 12 months. Clinical success rate was 73%. Technical success rate was 100%. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) was performed around the GJA in all patients (100%) before plication placement. The total number of plications per case was 7 ± 3. Overall AE rate was 12.6%. These included GJA stenosis (9.9%), melena because of marginal ulceration (1.8%), and deep vein thrombosis (.9%). The severe AE rate was 0%. Predictors of weight loss were the amount of weight regain and baseline pouch length.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel P-TORe technique combining APC with gastric plication appears to be technically feasible, safe, and effective at treating weight regain after RYGB.
