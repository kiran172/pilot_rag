Title: Intraprocedural high-degree atrioventricular block or complete heart block in transcatheter aortic valve replacement recipients with no prior intraventricular conduction disturbances.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Conduction disturbances are the most frequent complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, no data exists regarding the outcomes of intraprocedural high-degree atrioventricular block (HAVB) or complete heart block (CHB) in patients without previous conduction disturbances.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of intraprocedural-HAVB/CHB in patients without previous intraventricular conduction disturbances.
METHODS: The occurrence of intraprocedural-HAVB/CHB was assessed in 676 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR, and two groups were established according to its duration: persistent-HAVB/CHB (PHAVB/CHB) and transient-HAVB/CHB (THAVB/CHB), not present at the end of the procedure.
RESULTS: Intraprocedural-HAVB/CHB occurred in 50 patients (7.4%), being persistent in 32 (64.0%), and transient in 18 (36.0%). The use of Medtronic Corevalve Revalving System (MCRS) and a greater oversizing of the valve increased the risk of intraprocedural-HAVB/CHB (p < 0.001). Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) was more frequent in the PHAVB/CHB than in the THAVB/CHB group (96.9% vs. 33.3%; p < 0.001). At 1-month follow-up, the PHAVB/CHB group showed a 98% ventricular pacing rate (VPR) compared to 16% in the THAVB/CHB group (p < 0.001), and similar VPR were observed at 1-year follow-up (98% vs. 37%, p < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased at 1-year follow-up in patients with PHAVB/CHB (-3.9 ± 1.8%, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: In TAVR recipients with no prior intraventricular conduction disturbances, intraprocedural-HAVB/CHB occurred in 7.4% of cases. HAVB/CHB was persistent in most cases and determined a high rate of PPI post-TAVR. Very high VPR at 1- and 12-month follow-up were observed, which in turn was associated with a negative effect on LVEF. These results support early PPI and close follow-up in patients developing intraprocedural-PHAVB/CHB.
