Title: [Application of hybrid surgery in the clipping of large complex paraclinoid aneurysms].

Abstract: Nine patients with large complex paraclinoid aneurysms were treated by hybrid surgery in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University between January 2016 and July 2021. Intraoperative angiography was conducted for real-time evaluation of the aneurysm and its clipping efficacy. A total of 8 aneurysms were clipped under temporary proximal control with balloon occlusion. Suction decompression was simultaneously applied in 2 of these cases. After surgery, 2 patients developed symptomatic cerebral infarction, 3 patients developed transient oculomotor nerve palsy, but no patients had vision deterioration. Postoperative follow-up showed that small neck residue occurred in 1 case, but with the rest of aneurysms were completely occluded without parent artery stenosis. Hybrid surgery was proved to be advantageous in real-time assessment of aneurysm morphology and clipping efficacy. Combination of temporary proximal balloon occlusion and suction decompression technique can help in reducing the difficulty of aneurysm exposure and remodeling, thereby improving the outcome and decreasing the complications.
