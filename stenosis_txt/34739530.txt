Title: Effects of intracranial atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation on the prognosis of ischemic stroke with active cancer.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In ischemic stroke patients with active cancer, cryptogenic stroke has worse prognosis than stroke by conventional mechanisms. However, the individual effects of intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) or atrial fibrillation (AF) on the prognosis of these patients have not been studied.
AIMS: Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of ICAS and AF on the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients with active cancer.
METHODS: We included ischemic stroke patients with active cancer between 2010 and 2020. Early neurological deterioration (END) was defined as an increase of ≥ 1 in the motor NIHSS score, or ≥ 2 in the total NIHSS score within 72 hours of admission. Unfavorable outcomes were defined as a score of ≥ 3 on the 3-month modified Rankin Scale.
RESULTS: In total, 116 ischemic stroke patients with active cancer were evaluated. In multivariable analysis, ICAS was positively associated with END (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52-13.70), and this association showed a quantitative relationship according to the degree of stenosis of ICAS (stenosis group: aOR = 4.24, 95% CI: 1.31-13.72; occlusion group, aOR = 5.74, 95% CI: 1.05-31.30). ICAS was also closely related to unfavorable outcomes (aOR = 6.33, 95% CI: 1.15-34.79). In contrast, AF showed no significant association with END or unfavorable outcomes. Our data showed that patients with ICAS had larger and more severe initial stroke lesions, and poorer prognosis than those without.
CONCLUSIONS: ICAS, but not AF, was closely associated with poor prognosis in ischemic stroke patients with active cancer.
