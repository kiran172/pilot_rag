Title: Outcomes of rotational atherectomy versus orbital atherectomy for the treatment of heavily calcified coronary stenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The optimal approach to deal with severe coronary artery calcification (CAC) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains ill-defined.
METHODS: We conducted an electronic database search of all published studies comparing Orbital versus Rotational Atherectomy in patients undergoing PCI.
RESULTS: Eight observational studies were included in the analysis. Overall, there were no significant differences in Major-adverse-cardiac-events/MACE (OR: 0.81, CI: 0.63-1.05, p = .11), myocardial-infarction/MI (OR: 0.75, CI: 0.56-1.00, p = .05), all-cause mortality (OR: 0.82, CI: 0.25-2.64, p = .73) or Target-vessel-revascularization/TVR (OR: 0.72, CI: 0.38-1.36, p = .31). However, OA was associated with lower long-term MACE (1-year), (OR: 0.66, CI: 0.44-0.99, p = .04), long-term TVR (OR: 0.40, CI: 0.18-0.89, p = .03), and short-term MI (in-hospital and 30-day) (OR: 0.64, CI: 0.44-0.94, p = .02). OA was associated with more coronary artery dissections (OR: 2.61, CI: 1.38-4.92, p = .003) and device-related coronary perforations (OR: 2.79, CI: 1.08-7.19, p = .03). There were no differences in cardiac tamponade (OR: 1.78, CI: 0.37-8.69, p = .47). OA was noted to have significantly lower fluoroscopy time (MD: -3.96 min, CI: -7.67, -0.25; p = .04) compared to RA. No significant difference was noted in terms of contrast volume between the two groups (OR: -4.35 ml, CI: -14.52, 23.22; p = .65).
CONCLUSION: Although there was no difference in overall MACE, MI, all-cause mortality and TVR, OA was associated with lower long-term MACE and short-term MI. OA is associated with lower fluoroscopy time but higher rates of coronary artery dissection and coronary perforation.
