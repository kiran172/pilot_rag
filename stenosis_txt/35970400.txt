Title: Integrating hemodynamics with ventricular and valvular remodeling in aortic stenosis. A paradigm shift in therapeutic decision making.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) has traditionally been approached in hemodynamic terms. Although hemodynamics and symptoms have formed the basis of recommending interventional treatment in AS, other factors reflecting left ventricular and valvular and/or vascular remodeling are equally important for the prognosis and outcome of patients with AS. Left ventricular and valvular/vascular remodeling in AS do not consistently correlate with hemodynamic severity of AS. Those remodeling changes are reflected and can be detected by a variety of novel laboratory and imaging techniques, including biomarkers, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance and gated Computer Tomography (CT) imaging. Taking all those elements into Heart Team therapeutic decision making in patients with AS, can significantly improve appropriate patient selection for interventional treatment and patient outcomes. We review this novel approach and propose a simple algorithm for decision making by the Heart Team, in patients with moderate or severe AS.
