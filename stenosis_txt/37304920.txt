Title: In-Hospital and One-Year Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients Requiring Supplemental Home Oxygen Use.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There have been limited reports with inconsistent results on the impact of long-term use of oxygen therapry (LTOT) in patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: We compared in-hospital and intermediate TAVR outcomes in 150 patients requiring LTOT (home O<sub>2</sub> cohort) with 2,313 non-home O<sub>2</sub> patients.
RESULTS: Home O<sub>2</sub> patients were younger, and had more comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, carotid artery disease, lower forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>) (50.3±21.1% vs. 75.0±24.7%, P &lt; 0.001), and lower diffusion capacity (DLCO, 48.6±19.2% vs. 74.6±22.4%, P &lt; 0.001). These differences represented higher baseline Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score (15.5±10.2% vs. 9.3±7.0%, P &lt; 0.001) and lower pre-procedure Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12) scores (32.5 ± 22.2 vs. 49.1 ± 25.4, P &lt; 0.001). The home O<sub>2</sub> cohort required higher use of alternative TAVR vascular access (24.0% vs. 12.8%, P = 0.002) and general anesthesia (51.3% vs. 36.0%, P &lt; 0.001). Compared to non-home O<sub>2</sub> patients, home O<sub>2</sub> patients showed increased in-hospital mortality (5.3% vs. 1.6%, P = 0.001), procedural cardiac arrest (4.7% vs. 1.0%, P &lt; 0.001), and postoperative atrial fibrillation (4.0% vs. 1.5%, P = 0.013). At 1-year follow-up, the home O<sub>2</sub> cohort had a higher all-cause mortality (17.3% vs. 7.5%, P &lt; 0.001) and lower KCCQ-12 scores (69.5 ± 23.8 vs. 82.1 ± 19.4, P &lt; 0.001). Kaplan-Meir analysis revealed a lower survival rate in the home O<sub>2</sub> cohort with an overall mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) survival time of 6.2 (5.9 - 6.5) years (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Home O<sub>2</sub> patients represent a high-risk TAVR cohort with increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality, less improvement in 1-year KCCQ-12, and increased mortality at intermediate follow-up.
