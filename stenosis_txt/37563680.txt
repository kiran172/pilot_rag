Title: Metachronous ureteral metastasis of a gastric adenocarcinoma: a case report and review of literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ureteral metastasis from gastric cancers are rare and can be a cause of ureteral obstruction. There have been few published case reports in the literature. In this paper, we report an additional case and a review of the literature of all the previous reported cases.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 67Â years old North African women who was treated four years before for a gastric adenocarcinoma, presented with abdominal pain. Imaging and endoscopy showed a mural stenosis of the left ureter, without any other abnormality. Histopathology confirmed the gastric origin of the metastasis. A palliative chemotherapy was foreseen, but due to the deterioration of the general condition of the patient, she received palliative care. We have also reviewed the literature and reported the previously published cases of ureteral metastasis from gastric cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: It is worth recalling that in a context of neoplasia and with the presence of signs of ureteral obstruction, it is important to keep in mind the possibility of a ureteral metastasis.
