Title: The role of hysteroscopy with morcellator without anesthesia in the management of abnormal uterine bleeding.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of hysteroscopy with morcellator without anesthesia and the diagnostic accuracy of 2D, 3D and power Doppler transvaginal sonography (TVS) in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study including women with AUB. All patients underwent 2D, 3D and power Doppler TVS evaluation of the uterine cavity, and patients with suspicion on ultrasound (US) of endometrial pathology (EP) underwent hysteroscopy with morcellator without anesthesia. The painful symptomatology was assessed during the procedure using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Additionally, histological evaluation was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 182 women underwent US imaging, of whom 131 (72%) had hysteroscopy. 130/131 patients completed the hysteroscopic examination with good compliance (VAS <4). One patient (0.8%) was unable to complete the procedure due to nulliparity and cervical stenosis. Of the 130 patients the US diagnosis was confirmed in 120 (92.3%), while in 10 patients (7.7%) the hysteroscopic diagnosis was different from the US diagnosis. Histological examination confirmed benign endometrial polyps in 115/130 patients (88.5%), while premalignant conditions were diagnosed in 3/130 patients (2.3%) and malignant conditions in 2/130 (1.5%). Of the 10 patients with endometrial thickening, two were diagnosed with a malignant condition.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the feasibility of managing patients with AUB and suspicion of EP using "see-and-treat" hysteroscopy with morcellator without anesthesia. This procedure has the potential to yield desired outcomes while minimizing pain and discomfort, presenting a feasible outpatient approach for both treating and preventing endometrial carcinoma without requiring anesthesia.
