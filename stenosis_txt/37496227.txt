Title: [A Patient with AFP-Producing Gastric Cancer and Stenosis Who Regained Oral Intake Capabilities after T-DXd Treatment].

Abstract: We present the case of a 55-year-old man with HER2-positive, AFP-producing gastric cancer and multiple liver metastases. The patient consequently underwent 7 courses of SOX plus trastuzumab therapy, 3 courses of weekly PTX plus ramucirumab therapy, and 3 courses of nivolumab therapy, all of which resulted in PD. Obstruction due to tumor growth became noticeable 9 months after the start of the first treatment. Subsequently, the patient experienced malnutrition and systemic edema due to impaired oral intake. However, subsequent trastuzumab deruxtecan(T-DXd)therapy induced remarkable tumor shrinkage. Furthermore, oral intake became possible, and edema started subsiding. Thus, we report the course of a patient with AFP-producing gastric cancer and stenosis who regained oral intake capabilities after T-DXd treatment.
