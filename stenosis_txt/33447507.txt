Title: Isolated Double-Chambered Right Ventricle - A Rare Entity.

Abstract: A double-chambered right ventricle (DCRV) is a rare congenital heart disease and an uncommon cause of congestive heart failure. An anomalous muscle band divides the right ventricle into two cavities: the proximal high-pressure chamber and the distal low-pressure chamber. Most cases are diagnosed and treated during childhood. Furthermore, there is a tendency for progression, if not treated early. Echocardiography is considered useful for the diagnosis of this ailment. Most of the patients have associated congenital anomalies, such as ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, and subaortic stenosis. Isolated DCRV is a rare entity. Hence, we report a case of an isolated DCRV in an adult patient.
