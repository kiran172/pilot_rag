Title: A Rare Case Report Of Benign Airway Stenosis and Challenges in its Management.

Abstract: Laryngeal stenosis following surgical intervention of larynx is a difficult condition to manage. The extensive adhesions formed between the vocal cords can obstruct the glottis and subglottis region and make decannulation unfeasible. In this report, we describe the challenges faced in the management of Glottosubglotic stenosis formed post Coblation assisted surgery for bilateral abductor cord palsy. The authors emphasize on the prevention techniques and management of laryngeal stenosis with a successful decannulation in such patients.
