Title: Obstructive Shock in Acute Vena Cava Filter Thrombosis: A Rare Presentation.

Abstract: Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are commonly placed to prevent the development or worsening of pulmonary emboli. They are also inherently thrombogenic. Here we discuss a case of acute IVC filter thrombosis with the unusual presentation of obstructive shock resulting in death. A man, age 70 years, underwent laminectomy for multilevel spinal stenosis. An IVC filter was placed preoperatively for acute calf deep vein thrombosis (DVT). On postoperative day 4 he developed tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of lower extremity arterial insufficiency. No lower extremity swelling was noted. Imaging showed complete IVC occlusion caudal to the IVC filter with extension to bilateral iliofemoral veins. Arterial flow was preserved. Therapeutic heparinization was initiated and urgent percutaneous thrombectomy was performed. However, the patient developed multi-organ failure and died shortly thereafter. This report describes an uncommon etiology of obstructive shock and highlights a potentially life-threatening thrombotic complication associated with IVC filters that clinicians should be vigilant about.
