Title: Short- and medium-term outcomes for patent ductus arteriosus stenting in neonates ≤2.5 kg with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Morbidity with surgical systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunting (SPS) in infants ≤2.5 kg has remained high. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting may be a valid alternative. The objective of this study is to evaluate outcomes following PDA stenting in patients ≤2.5 kg from four large tertiary centers.
METHODS: Retrospective review of all neonates ≤2.5 kg with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation who underwent PDA stenting. Procedural details, pulmonary arterial growth, reinterventions, surgery type, and outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: PDA stents were implanted in 37 of 38 patients attempted (18 female) at a median procedural weight of 2.2 kg (interquartile range [IQR], 2-2.4 kg). Seven patients (18%) had a genetic abnormality and 16 (42%) had associated comorbidities. The median intensive care unit stay was 4 days (IQR, 2-6.75 days), and the median hospital stay was 20 days (IQR, 16-57.25). One patient required a rescue shunt procedure, with three others requiring early SPS (<30 days postprocedure). Twenty patients (54%) required reintervention with either balloon angioplasty, restenting, or both. At 6-month follow-up, right pulmonary artery growth (median z-score -1.16 to 0.01, p = 0.05) was greater than the left pulmonary artery (median z-score -0.9 to -0.64, p = 0.35). Serious adverse effects (SAEs) were seen in 18% (N = 7) of our cohort. One patient developed an SAE during planned reintervention There were no intraprocedural deaths, with one early procedure-related mortality, and three interstage mortalities not directly related to PDA stenting.
CONCLUSIONS: PDA stenting in infants ≤2.5 kg is feasible and effective, promoting pulmonary artery growth. Reintervention rates are relatively high, though many are planned to allow for optimal growth before a definitive operation.
