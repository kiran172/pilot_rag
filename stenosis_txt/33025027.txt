Title: From Other Journals: A Review of Recent Articles in Pediatric Cardiology.

Abstract: In this review, we provide a brief description of recently published articles addressing topics relevant to pediatric cardiologists. Our hope is to provide a summary of the latest articles published recently in other journals in our field. The articles address (1) outcomes after anomalous aortic origin of the coronary artery repair which showed relief of ischemia in most patients with low mortality, (2) the role of lymphatic imaging to predict post-Fontan complications which showed that lymphatic imaging by MRI may have an added prognostic value, (3) European guidelines for participation in competitive sports in congenital heart disease patients using a systematic approach based on ventricular structure and function, pulmonary pressure, aortic root, arrhythmia, and cyanosis, (4) fenestrated atrial septal defect closure combined with medical therapy in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension which resulted in improved pulmonary pressure and offered hope for this population, (5) animal model study for pulmonary vein stenosis postsurgery showing activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and that application of rapamycin at the anastomosis location may prevent pulmonary vein stenosis, and (6) mitral valve replacement with the 15-mm mechanical valve describing a 20-year multicenter experience from the Netherland that showed that this "dime valve" may be a good option for small infants with mitral valve disease.
