Title: Impact of Cognitive Impairment on Long-Term Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment assessed using the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) is associated with short-term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We assessed the long-term prognostic impact of cognitive impairment in patients with severe aortic stenosis post-TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 1,057 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at the Kokura Memorial Hospital and prospectively assessed them using the MMSE. Results showed that 319 (30%) patients had cognitive impairment. Compared with normal cognition, cognitive impairment was associated with an increased risk for 5-year all-cause mortality (55% vs. 39%; P<0.001), cardiovascular mortality (23% vs. 14%; P=0.007), and non-cardiovascular mortality (42% vs. 29%; P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that cognitive impairment was independently associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.70; P=0.005), and this result was consistent regardless of stratification based on age, sex, body mass index, left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical frailty scale without significant interaction. Patients with MMSE scores <16 had a significantly higher mortality rate compared with patients with MMSE scores >25, 21-25, and 16-20, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive impairment assessed using MMSE scores is independently associated with an increased risk for 5-year all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.
