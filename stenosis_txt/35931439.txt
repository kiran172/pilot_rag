Title: Robotic Ureteral Reconstruction.

Abstract: It is generally accepted that robotic ureteral reconstruction provides equivalent results to open and laparoscopic approaches while decreasing pain and length of stay. There is a rapid expansion of robotic ureteral reconstructive techniques, platforms, and adjunctive technologies, enabling more efficient, safer, and novel surgical approaches that could not be done in the past. For instance, indocyanine green use allows rapid, precise location of ureteral stenosis and determination of tissue perfusion. Multi-image display allows the surgeon to integrate the robotic field and ureteroscopic images. Novel robotic surgical techniques, such as buccal mucosa ureteroplasty, are changing the treatment algorithm for ureteral strictures.
