Title: Risk factors for complications after endoscopic treatment in Chinese patients with early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze the risk factors for complications after endoscopic treatment of early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions and provides evidence for developing preventive measures against these complications.
METHODS: The clinical data of patients with early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions treated in the Department of Endoscopy, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and Peking Union Medical College from January 2009 to December 2015 were analyzed. The risk factors related to delayed bleeding, perforation, and stenosis were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 459 patients, 15 (3.3%) had delayed bleeding, 16 (3.5%) had perforation, and 82 (17.9%) had stenosis. Conservative treatment was performed for patients with bleeding and perforation, and endoscopic dilation was performed to relieve stenosis. The independent risk factors for delayed bleeding were lesion size (OR = 1.51, P = 0.020), circumferential diameter [odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, P = 0.037]. The kind of operation method [endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)/cap-based endoscopic resection (EMR-Cap): OR = 15.38, P = 0.013) was the independent risk factor for perforation. The independent predictors of stenosis were circumferential diameter (OR = 1.58, P < 0.001), lesion in the neck (OR = 0.12, P = 0.003), and surgical time (OR = 1.02, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Few complications occur after the endoscopic treatment of early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions which can be treated by endoscopic and conservative medical therapies. Strict operational training is required for ESD treatment.
