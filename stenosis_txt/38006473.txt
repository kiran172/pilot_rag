Title: Repair of radiation-induced rectovaginal fistula with rectal stricture by a combined Tuttle, Turnbull-Cutait and Singapore flap approach.

Abstract: Radiation-induced rectovaginal fistula (RI-RVF) with associated rectal stricture represents a challenging problem in management. The aim of the present technical note is to describe a surgical technique aimed at minimizing disease recurrence by avoiding radiated tissue in the reconstruction: 1. Tuttle longitudinal incision of posterior vaginal wall with sharp excision of proximally located fistula; 2. Resection of strictured rectum via a combined transvaginal/laparotomy access, reconstruction with Turnbull-Cutait colon pull-through, and delayed handsewn coloanal anastomosis with loop ileostomy; 3. Bridge closure of the posterior vaginal wall by the interposition of a Singapore flap. This approach resulted in a favorable outcome at the 1-year follow-up in one patient with a medical history of gynecological carcinoma status after hystero-salpingo-oophorectomy followed by adjuvant radiation.
