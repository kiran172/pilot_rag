Title: The Correlation of the Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus Classification to Outcomes of Pedal Amputations.

Abstract: In an attempt at limb salvage for patients with peripheral arterial disease, revascularization is often performed prior to pedal amputation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between proximal arterial lesions, based on Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, and infrapopliteal classifications, and healing pedal amputations post endovascular revascularization. Patients with revascularization up to 90 days prior to pedal amputation with a minimum of 12 months postoperative follow-up were included. Each level of proximal disease was subdivided into Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus classifications A through D, which range in severity from a single short stenosis or occlusion to more complex stenoses and chronic total occlusion. For comparison, we categorized A and/or B lesions into Group 1 and C and/or D lesions into Group 2. The frequency of proximal lesions was recorded as either isolated, bi-level, or multilevel disease. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. Of the 310 patients, there were a total of 68 aortoiliac, 256 femoropopliteal, and 172 infrapopliteal lesions; 140 patients had isolated lesions, 154 had bi-level disease, and 16 had multilevel disease. Although not statistically significant, patients in Group 1 (A and/or B lesions) had higher proportion of failed amputation compared to Group 2 (C and/or D lesions) in either aortoiliac (84.4% vs 15.6%, p = .17), femoropopliteal (61.2% vs 38.8%, p = .72), or infrapopliteal (57.3% vs 42.7%, p = .44). Bi-level disease showed a higher proportion of failure (50.6%) compared to isolated lesions (43.8%) and multilevel disease (5.6%), (p = .86). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the association between Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus arterial lesions and incisional healing of pedal amputations. Despite our belief, there was no correlation between patients with simple, isolated lesions compared to either complex arterial lesions or multilevel disease in healing pedal amputations.
