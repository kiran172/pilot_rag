Title: Imaging Evaluation of Airway Complications After Lung Transplant.

Abstract: Airway complications (ACs) after lung transplant remain a challenge and include bronchial dehiscence, bronchial stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia, infections, and bronchial fistulas. The spectrum of complications may coexist along a continuum and can be classified as early (<1 month after transplant) or late (>1 month), and anastomotic or nonanastomotic. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the most common form of chronic lung allograft rejection. Airway compromise is seen in rare instances of lung torsion, and imaging may provide helpful diagnostic clues. Computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy play major roles in the diagnosis and treatment of ACs after lung transplant. Chest CT with advanced postprocessing techniques is a valuable tool in evaluating for airways complications, for initial bronchoscopic treatment planning and subsequent posttreatment assessment. Various bronchoscopic treatment options may be explored to maintain airway patency. The goal of this article is to review imaging findings of ACs after lung transplantation, with emphasis on chest CT and bronchoscopic correlation.
