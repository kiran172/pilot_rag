Title: Sham Feeding Induced Gastric Acid Secretion in Patients with Caustic Induced Esophageal Stricture.

Abstract: Caustic ingestion can lead to structural changes in the upper gastro-intestinal tract. However, there is limited data on the effect of caustic ingestion on gastric secretion. This study was planned to determine changes in gastric acid output after sham feeding in patients with caustic induced esophageal stricture and to compare it with healthy controls. It was a prospective study done at tertiary care center in North India. Consecutive patients with caustic induced esophageal stricture were evaluated for the study. Gastric secretory function was estimated in the basal state and after modified sham feeding. These results were compared with age-matched controls. The mean age of the included patients (n = 18) was 30.11 ± 9.19 years and 13 patients were male. 16 (88%) patients had history of acid ingestion. Patients with caustic sequelae had significantly lower basal and stimulated acid secretion compared to controls (n = 10) (5.84 ± 2.44 mmol/hr; p < 0.01 and 17.16 ± 7.53 mmol/hr; p < 0.01; respectively). Patients with lower esophageal stricture (n = 8) had significantly lower increase in acid output compared to patients with stricture elsewhere in esophagus (0.20 ± 0.3 vs. 2.31 ± 1.74 mmol/hr, p < 0.01). Patients with lower esophageal involvement had significantly lower stimulated acid secretion and increase in acid secretion compared to controls (4.74 ± 4.67 vs. 17.16 ± 7.53 mmol/hr; p < 0.01 and 20 ± 0.3 vs. 2.09 ± 0.88 mmol/hr; p < 0.01; respectively).
