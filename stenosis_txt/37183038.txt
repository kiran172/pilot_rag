Title: [A case of biliary panperitonitis due to intrahepatic bile duct rupture with intrahepatic bile duct tumor].

Abstract: An 87-year-old man visited his previous doctor because of jaundice, abdominal pain, and disturbance of consciousness. He was diagnosed with cholangitis and panperitonitis and was referred to our hospital. Emergency laparotomy revealed biliary peritonitis. However, the bile leak point was unclear. Two days after surgery, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed and revealed hilar bile duct stenosis, slight dilation of the intrahepatic bile duct, and bile leakage from the peripheral left intrahepatic bile duct to the abdominal free space. Endoscopic nasobiliary drainage was performed, and bile leakage decreased. He was discharged from our hospital with improvement from jaundice and peritonitis. Intrahepatic bile duct rupture with neoplastic obstruction of the bile duct is extremely rare. To date, only two cases of intrahepatic bile duct rupture with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma have been published.
