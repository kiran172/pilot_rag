Title: Analysis of Factors Influencing Restenosis after Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to analyse the influencing factors of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) ultrasound-guided restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).
METHODS: This was a retrospective trial. The clinical data and ultrasound examination data of patients in maintenance haemodialysis who received ultrasound-guided PTA for AVF stenosis at our hospital from January 2018 to December 2020 were retrospectively analysed. The fistula patency and the relationship between age, dialysis age, fistula service age, combined hypertension, diabetes, hypoproteinaemia, stenosis type, fistula location, and patency rate after the operation were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 128 participants were evaluated. The results showed that being over 65 years old, with complications from hypertension, diabetes, and hypoproteinaemia, are all risk factors affecting the patency of postoperative internal fistulas. Compared with lumen stenosis, the patency rate of hyperplastic endothelial stenosis (p = 0.014) and thrombotic stenosis (p = 0.017) was lower, and the difference was statistically significant. The patency rate of the mixed site (p = 0.010), the anastomotic site (p = 0.041), and the cephalic vein near the anastomotic site (p = 0.018) was lower than the forearm cephalic vein, and the difference was statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Age, hypertension complications, diabetes complications, hypoproteinaemia, and the type and location of the AVF stenosis were essential for vascular patency of internal fistulas after PTA. Other risk factors of restenosis after PTA still need further research.
