Title: Diagnosis and Management of Moyamoya Disease.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is an uncommon vascular disease, which causes obstruction and stenosis of arteries of the circle of Willis, and preferentially affects children and young adults. This disease is seen across the world, but is more common in East Asia. It may cause hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. If symptoms or cerebral blood flow become worse, revascularization surgery is recommended. We present 2 cases of moyamoya disease who underwent bypass surgery. We also discuss the epidemiology, pathology, genomics, and symptomatology as well as diagnosis, and management of moyamoya disease.
