Title: Case-Control Study on the Interaction Effects of rs10757278 Polymorphisms at 9p21 Locus and Traditional Risk Factors on Coronary Heart Disease in Xinjiang, China.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the interaction effects of rs10757278 polymorphisms at 9p21 locus and traditional risk factors on coronary heart disease (CHD) in Xinjiang, China.
METHODS: This case-control study consecutively enrolled 310 unrelated consecutive CHD patients aged 18-70 years old. All study participants were recruited between January and December 2017 from The Heart Center of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. CHD patients were confirmed by coronary angiography (≥50% diameter stenosis in at least one of the major coronary arteries) according to the American Heart Association criteria for the confirmation of CHD. Healthy subjects were randomly selected from the occupational population, who received physical examination in our hospital and matched to cases on the basis of age (±3 years) and sex, those without medical history of cardiovascular diseases, and 536 subjects were selected as the control group after medical history inquiry, physical examination, cardiac ultrasound, electrocardiogram, and other blood biochemical examinations in the hospital. The occupational stress was evaluated by an effort-reward imbalance questionnaire. An epidemiological survey was conducted to collect clinical data. Chi-squared test, analysis of variance, and binary logistic regression analysis were adopted.
RESULTS: Both the case and the control groups showed significant difference in smoking, drinking, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history of CHD, and body mass index (BMI) (all P < 0.05); prevalence of CHD was not related to occupational stress. There was no significant difference in occupational stress level between the 2 groups (P > 0.05); Differences in rs10757278 genotype between the case group and the control groups were statistically significant; binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors of CHD. After adjustment for age and sex, significant increased risk effects for CHD were found to be associated with smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 2.311; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-2.499; P < 0.001], physical exercise (OR = 1.365; 95% CI: 1.137-1.639; P < 0.001), hypertension (OR = 4.627; 95% CI: 2.165-10.764; P < 0.001), family history of CHD (OR = 4.103; 95% CI: 3.169-6.892; P < 0.001), BMI (OR = 2.484; 95% CI: 2.036-3.03; P < 0.001), and GG genotype at rs10757278 (OR = 1.978; 95% CI: 1.413-2.769; P < 0.001); We noted that a significant interaction association between GG genotype at rs10757278 and CHD differs across categories of smoking, hypertension, family history of CHD, and BMI.
CONCLUSION: GG genotype at rs10757278 may be a risk factor for CHD. And there are interaction effects between GG genotype of rs10757278 in region 9p21 gene and traditional risk factors.
