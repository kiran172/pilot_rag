Title: Treatment Strategy for Currarino Syndrome Complicated With Anorectal Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The present study aimed to review the treatment experience and outcomes of Currarino syndrome (CS) complicated with anorectal stenosis to evaluate the current treatment strategies.
METHODS: Seven cases of CS complicated with anorectal stenosis, treated at our hospital between 1998 and 2021, were retrospectively investigated. This is a case series article from a single institution.
RESULTS: In six and three cases and one case, the presacral mass was a mature teratoma, meningocele, and lipoma, respectively. Resection of the lesion was performed in all six cases of mature teratoma, and duraplasty was performed before resection in all three cases of meningocele. Moreover, surgery for anorectal stenosis was performed simultaneously in four patients. Surgery was performed for six cases of anorectal stenosis, with the remaining case relieved by dilation using a metal bougie. The surgical methods used were a partial resection with end-to-end anastomosis, anorectal strictureplasty, pull-through, posterior sagittal anorectoplasty, and cutback after mass resection. Pathological analysis of the anorectal stenoses revealed disorganized and rough smooth muscle fibers and the replacement of the stroma by an increased quantity of collagen fibers.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcomes of CS can be improved by establishing a treatment flow chart and understanding the complicated pathophysiology of the disease.
