Title: Endoscopic approaches to small intestinal strictures.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) occurs from benign or malignant causes. Historically, the treatment of benign strictures revolved around endoscopic balloon dilation, whereas, in the case of malignant strictures, the placement of self-expandable metallic stents was the focus. The advent of lumen-apposing metal stent has opened new horizons in addressing shortcomings of enteral stenting and surgical gastroenterostomies. The purpose of the review is to discuss the endoscopic approaches to small bowel strictures and to examine the supporting data behind each practice.
RECENT FINDINGS: Given the risk and futility of balloon dilation for malignant strictures, enteral stenting is pursued in patients who are poor surgical candidates and with life expectancy less than 6â€Šmonths. For patients with longer survival, surgical gastroenterostomy (S-GE) should be considered. Recent data have shown comparable technical and clinical success rates between EUS-gastroenterostomy and S-GE but with lower adverse event rate and hospital length of stay.
SUMMARY: In recurrent benign strictures and malignant GOO, EUS-GE has recently gained momentum in providing an effective and a well tolerated alternative. Individualized therapy centered around the patient's prognosis and preference while factoring in the local expertise for the specific indication is vital.
