Title: [Single center experience of transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a simplified operative protocol].

Abstract: Objective: To summarize the single center experience of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a simplified operative protocol. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR (TF-TAVR) from July 2020 to December 2020 in Fuwai Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. We compared the baseline characteristic, procedure information, 30-day follow-up outcomes of the patients who underwent TF-TAVR without the simplified operative protocol (routine group) or with the simplified operative protocol (simplified protocol group). Results: 93 patients were collected, 42 patients belonging to routine group, 51 patients belonging to simplified protocol group. In simplified protocol group, there were 51 patients planned to use ultrasound-guided femoral access puncture, procedure was successful in all 51 patients (100%). There were 49 patients planned to use the radial artery as the secondary access, procedure was successful in 45 patients (92%). There were 48 patients planned to use the strategy of avoidance of urinary catheter, this strategy was achieved in 35 patients (73%). There were 12 patients planned to use the left ventricular guidewire to pace, procedure was successful in 11 patients (92%). There were no differences in baseline characteristics, major clinical endpoints and 30-day follow-up outcomes between the two groups. Meanwhile, the procedure time ((62.5±17.9)min vs. (78.3±16.7)min, P&lt;0.001), operation room time ((133.7±25.1)min vs. (159.2±42.6)min, P&lt;0.001), X-ray exposure time ((17.2±6.5)min vs. (20.2±7.7)min, P=0.027) were significantly shorten in simplified protocol group compared with the routine group. Conclusion: Our study results indicate that the simplified operative protocol of TF-TAVR is as effective and safe as the routine operative protocol, meanwhile using the simplified operative protocol can significantly increase the operative efficiency of TF-TAVR.
