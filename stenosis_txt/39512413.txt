Title: The Effect of Vitamin D Deficiency Treatment on Lipid Profile and C-reactive Protein in Patients with Ischemic Heart Disease: Double-blind Randomized Clinical Trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is the main process in coronary artery stenosis, which is exacerbated by vitamin D deficiency. This study aims to investigate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency treatment, lipid profile, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in ischemic heart disease (IHD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized clinical trial involving 44 IHD patients with hypovitaminosis, aged 40-65 years, who were referred to Chamran Specialty Heart Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: The intervention group received weekly doses of 50,000 units of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for 5 weeks, while the placebo group received a control substance. CRP and serum lipid profiles, including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), were assessed before and after the intervention. Trial registration number: IRCT20200905048622N1.
RESULTS: The mean age of the IHD patients was 57.84 Â± 9.66 years, and among all 44 patients, 40 patients (91%) were male In the intervention group receiving vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, serum levels of HDL (P = 0.048) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (P &lt; 0.001) increased, while serum level of TG (P = 0.008) decreased significantly. In the placebo group, HDL level (P = 0.007) was increased and alanine transaminase (ALT) (P = 0.05) was significantly decreased. The results showed that the correlation between serum 25(OH)D treatment and CRP level was not significant.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation in IHD patients led to notable improvements in lipid profiles, including increased HDL-C levels and decreased TG levels. These findings hold potential clinical implications for healthcare professionals in managing risk factors in IHD patients.
