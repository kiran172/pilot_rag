Title: A coronary artery CTA segmentation approach based on deep learning.

Abstract: Presence of plaque and coronary artery stenosis are the main causes of coronary heart disease. Detection of plaque and coronary artery segmentation have become the first choice in detecting coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate a new method for plaque detection and automatic segmentation and diagnosis of coronary arteries and to test its feasibility of applying to clinical medical image diagnosis. A multi-model fusion coronary CT angiography (CTA) vessel segmentation method is proposed based on deep learning. The method includes three network layer models namely, an original 3-dimensional full convolutional network (3D FCN) and two networks that embed the attention gating (AG) model in the original 3D FCN. Then, the prediction results of the three networks are merged by using the majority voting algorithm and thus the final prediction result of the networks is obtained. In the post-processing stage, the level set function is used to further iteratively optimize the results of network fusion prediction. The JI (Jaccard index) and DSC (Dice similarity coefficient) scores are calculated to evaluate accuracy of blood vessel segmentations. Applying to a CTA dataset of 20 patients, accuracy of coronary blood vessel segmentation using FCN, FCN-AG1, FCN-AG2 network and the fusion method are tested. The average values of JI and DSC of using the first three networks are (0.7962, 0.8843), (0.8154, 0.8966) and (0.8119, 0.8936), respectively. When using new fusion method, average JI and DSC of segmentation results increase to (0.8214, 0.9005), which are better than the best result of using FCN, FCN-AG1 and FCN-AG2 model independently.
