Title: Mid-term outcome in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis following transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a current generation device: A multicenter study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To perform clinical and echocardiographic follow-up beyond 1 year in consecutive patients with severe bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a current generation balloon-expandable valve.
BACKGROUND: Treatment of bicuspid aortic valve disease with TAVR remains controversial and late follow-up data is still scarce.
METHODS: We collected baseline characteristics, procedural data, 30-day and mid-term clinical follow-up findings from six centers in Europe and Canada from patients with bicuspid AS treated with TAVR using the SAPIEN 3 valve.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients underwent TAVR. Mean age was 76 ± 9 years; median STS risk score for mortality was 3.8% (interquartile range 2.3-5.5%). Median follow-up was 390 days (interquartile range 138-739 days). Device success was achieved in 95% of patients. Postimplantation mean aortic gradient decreased from 50.2 ± 16.2 to 8.8 ± 4.4 mmHg and no patient had more than mild aortic regurgitation. At last follow-up, there was persistent good valve performance. At 30 days and 1 year, the rates of all-cause mortality were 3.8 and 7.7%, stroke 1.2 and 1.2%, and the rate of new pacemakers 18 and 18%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that treating patients with stenotic bicuspid aortic valves is safe, effective, and has favorable valve performance over time.
