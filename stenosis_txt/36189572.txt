Title: A Case of Bilateral Middle Cerebral Artery Stenosis with Unilateral M1 Stenting.

Abstract: Stroke is not only the third leading cause of death in Bangladesh but it also causes a high number of disability adjusted life years loss (485 per 10,000 people). Appropriate treatment of recurrent stroke has to be established. Here we present A 60 year's old male patient with history of recurrent stroke who came in our out patient department. He had progressing bilateral middle cerebral artery atherosclerotic stenosis (100.0% on right side and 52.0% on left side) which was less severs but symptomatic at dominant hemisphere (left). Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting was done to prevent further ischemia and to increase the blood supply of remaining brain parenchyma. On post stenting follow-up patient did not suffered from any new event of stroke for about 22 months. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting is an effective procedure to prevent recurrent stroke for intracranial atherosclerotic disease.
