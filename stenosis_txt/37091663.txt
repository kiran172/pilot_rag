Title: Treatment of amyloidosis: present and future.

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an infiltrative heart disease resulting from the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the interstitial spaces of the myocardium. The two main forms of CA are represented by light chain amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) in the two forms familial or variant or wild-type or senile. Although considered a rare disease, CA is an underdiagnosed disease. Delay in diagnosis has a negative impact on the prognosis, delaying the initiation of specific therapy. The treatment of both forms of CA is based on: (i) prevention and slowing of the generation and deposition of amyloid fibrils and (ii) supportive care of complications. The main success of recent years has been the development of effective therapies that have been possible thanks to the understanding of the pathophysiology of amyloidosis. For the AL form, new therapeutic combinations between a proteasome inhibitor and a monoclonal antibody have been developed. For ATTR forms, the main strategies are transthyretin (TTR) production 'silencers' and TTR tetramer stabilizers. Supportive care of patients with CA involves various clinical aspects including treatment of heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, thrombo-embolism, and the concomitant presence of aortic stenosis.
