Title: Cardiovascular events in patients with deferred lesions and chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: No study has reported the association between the worsening of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular events in patients with deferred coronary artery lesions. We included patients with deferred lesions, defined as a fractional flow reserve (FFR) value > 0.80 treated with conservative medical therapy. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1, CKD stages 1-2; group 2, CKD stages 3-5; and group 3, CKD stage 5D (hemodialysis), with the clinical outcomes compared. The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of target vessel myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization, or all-cause death. The primary endpoint was noted in 17, 25, and 36 patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Within the three groups, the incidence rate of deferred lesions was 7.0%, 10.4%, and 32.4%, respectively. No difference was observed in the incidence of the primary endpoint between groups 1 and 2 (log-rank p = 0.16). However, the patients in group 3 had a significantly higher risk for the primary endpoint than those in groups 1 and 2 (log-rank p < 0.0001). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, the patients in group 3 exhibited a higher incidence of the primary endpoint than those in group 1 (HR: 2.14; 95% CI 1.02-4.49; p < 0.01). Careful management is needed in patients undergoing hemodialysis, even if coronary artery stenosis is considered a deferred lesion.
