Title: Venous sinus stenosis intracranial hypertension, rethinking idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the setting of venous sinus stenosis: A call for new nomenclature and diagnostic precision.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is traditionally characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause, primarily affecting obese women. However, recent evidence suggests that venous sinus stenosis may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of IIH, challenging its designation as "idiopathic." This editorial discusses the limitations of the current nomenclatures and diagnostic criteria, highlighting the importance of routine venography in detecting venous sinus abnormalities, irrespective of a patient's demographic profile. We propose a new nomenclature of this subset of patients to venous sinus stenosis intracranial hypertension in order to promote more accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment, including potential endovascular interventions.
