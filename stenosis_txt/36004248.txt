Title: Staged versus concomitant transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous coronary intervention: A national analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although patients with significant coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis have traditionally undergone open valve replacement and bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are increasingly considered. Because of the lack of data regarding timing of PCI/TAVR, in the present study we evaluated associations of staged and concomitant PCI/TAVR on outcomes in a nationally representative cohort.
METHODS: Adults who underwent TAVR and PCI were identified using the 2016 to 2018 Nationwide Readmissions Database. If PCI/TAVR occurred on the same day, patients were considered Concomitant and otherwise considered Staged. Staged were further classified as Early-Staged if both occurred in the same hospitalization or Late-Staged if TAVR ensued PCI in a subsequent hospitalization. Multivariable regression models were developed to evaluate the association of TAVR timing on outcomes. The primary end point was in-hospital mortality whereas perioperative complications including acute kidney injury and hospitalization costs were secondarily considered.
RESULTS: Of an estimated 5843 patients, 843 (14.4%) were Concomitant and 745 (12.7%) and 4255 (72.8%) were Early-Staged and Late-Staged, respectively. Although age and TAVR access were similar, Concomitant had a lower proportion of chronic kidney disease and more commonly underwent single-vessel PCI. Staged showed similar risk-adjusted mortality but greater odds of acute kidney injury (Early-Staged adjusted odds ratio: 2.68; 95% CI, 1.57-4.55 and Late-Staged: 1.97; 95% CI, 1.29-2.99) compared with Concomitant. Although post-TAVR hospitalization duration was similar, total length of stay and costs were increased in Staged.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant PCI/TAVR was associated with similar rates of in-hospital mortality but reduced rates of acute kidney injury and lower resource utilization. While evaluating patient-specific factors, concomitant PCI/TAVR might be reasonable in select individuals.
