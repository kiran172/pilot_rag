Title: MINOCA biomarkers: Non-atherosclerotic aspects.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA) is an important subtype of myocardial infarction. Although comprising less than 50% stenosis in the main epicardial coronary arteries, it constitutes a severe health risk. A variety of approaches have been recommended, but definitive diagnosis remains elusive. In addition, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of underlying pathophysiology makes clinical management difficult and unpredictable. This review highlights ongoing efforts to identify relevant biomarkers in MINOCA to improve diagnosis, individualize treatment and better predict outcomes.
