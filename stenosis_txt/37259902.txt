Title: Lifestyle patterns, genetic susceptibility, and risk of valvular heart disease: a prospective cohort study based on the UK Biobank.

Abstract: AIMS: Genetic and lifestyle factors are both major contributors to valvular heart disease (VHD). However, it is still uncertain whether genetic susceptibility alters the association between lifestyle and VHD. We aimed to investigate the association between lifestyle and VHD in different genetic risk backgrounds.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective cohort study was carried out on 499 341 participants without VHD at baseline. The assessment of lifestyle included smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, activity, and sleep. Genetic susceptibility was separately measured by polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) between lifestyle and VHD, as well as aortic stenosis (AS). During a median follow-up of 10.8 years, 12 983 incident VHD cases were diagnosed (incidence rate 2.46 per 1000 person-years), including 3527 AS cases (incidence rate 0.66 per 1000 person-years). The risk of VHD and AS decreased with healthier lifestyles (P value for trend <0.001). Compared to individuals with a unhealthy lifestyle, the HRs of VHD in intermediate and healthy lifestyle groups were 0.81 (0.76-0.86) and 0.81 (0.76-0.87). The negative association between healthy lifestyle and VHD events was independent of genetic risk (P for interaction between healthy lifestyle scores and PRSs/family history of CVD was 0.723/0.763). Similar findings were obtained in analyses of AS, and a stronger negative association was found.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that adherence to a healthy lifestyle is significantly associated with a reduced risk of VHD especially AS, irrespective of genetic susceptibility.
SUMMARY: Based on a cohort of around 490 000 participants, the study investigated the association between lifestyle and VHD under different stratifications of genetic risk. The study found that a healthy lifestyle was associated with a lower risk of VHD, particularly AS, independent of genetic risk. Our findings suggest that advance interventions for lifestyle may be an effective way to reduce the global burden of VHD.
