Title: [Consensus on the procedure of balloon pulmonary angioplasty for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension].

Abstract: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is classified as group IV pulmonary hypertension, characterized by thrombotic occlusion of the pulmonary arteries leading to vascular stenosis or obstruction, progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, and eventual right heart failure. Unlike other types of pulmonary hypertension, the prognosis of CTEPH can be significantly improved by surgery, vascular intervention, and/or targeted drug therapy. Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the preferred treatment of choice for CTEPH. However, PEA is an invasive procedure with high operative risks, and is currently only performed in a few centers in China. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is an emerging interventional technique for CTEPH, serving as an alternative for patients who are ineligible for PEA or with residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA. BPA is gaining traction in China, but its widespread adoption is limited due to its complexity, operator skills, and equipment requirements, a lack of standard operating procedures and technical guidance, which limit the further improvement and development of BPA in China. To address this, a multidisciplinary panel of experts was convened to develop the Consensus on the Procedure of Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty for the Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension, which fomulates guidelines on BPA procedural qualification, perioperative management, procedural planning, technical approach, and complication prevention, with the aim of providing recommendations and clinical guidance for BPA treatment in CTEPH and standardizing its clinical application in this setting. Summary of recommendations: Recommendation 1: It is recommended that physicians who specialize in pulmonary vascular diseases take the lead in formulating the diagnostic and treatment plans for CTEPH, using a multidisciplinary approach.Recommendation 2: Training in BPA technique is critical; novice operators should undergo standardized operative training with at least 50 procedures under the guidance of experienced physicians before embarking on independent BPA procedures.Recommendation 3: BPA requires catheterization labs, angiography systems, standard vascular interventional devices and consumables, drugs, and emergency equipment.Recommendation 4: Patient selection for BPA should consider cardiac and pulmonary function, coagulation status, and comorbid conditions to determine indications and contraindications, thereby optimizing the timing of the procedure and improving safety.Recommendation 5: In experienced centers, patients deemed likely to benefit from early BPA, based on clinical and imaging features of CTEPH and without elevated D-dimer levels, could bypass standard 3-month anticoagulation therapy.Recommendation 6: BPA is a complex interventional treatment that requires thorough pre-operative assessment and preparation.Recommendation 7: The use of perioperative anticoagulants in BPA requires a comprehensive risk assessment of intraoperative bleeding by the operator for individualized decision making.Recommendation 8: A variety of venous access routes are available for BPA; unless contraindicated, the right femoral vein is usually preferred because of its procedural convenience and reduced radiation exposure.Recommendation 9: For the different types of vascular lesion in CTEPH, treatment of ring-like stenoses, web-like lesions, and subtotal occlusions should be prioritized before addressing complete occlusions and tortuous lesions, in order to reduce complications and improve procedural safety.Recommendation 10: A targeted, incremental balloon dilatation strategy based on vascular lesions is recommended for BPA.Recommendation 11: Intravascular pulmonary artery imaging technologies, such as OCT and IVUS can assist in accurate vessel sizing and confirmation of wire placement in the true vascular lumen. Pressure wires can be used to objectively assess the efficacy of dilatation during BPA.Recommendation 12: Endpoints for BPA treatment should be individually assessed, taking into account improvements in clinical symptoms, hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, and quality of life.Recommendation 13: Post-BPA routine monitoring of vital signs is essential; anticoagulation therapy should be initiated promptly post-procedure in the absence of complications. In cases of intraoperative hemoptysis, postoperative anticoagulation regimen adjustments should be adjusted according to the bleeding severity.Recommendation 14: If reperfusion pulmonary edema occurs during or after BPA, ensure adequate oxygenation, diuresis, and consider non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation if necessary, while severe cases may require early mechanical ventilation assistance or ECMO.Recommendation 15: In cases of intraoperative hemoptysis, temporary balloon occlusion to stop bleeding is recommended, along with protamine to neutralize heparin. Persistent bleeding may warrant the use of gelatin sponges, coil embolization, or covered stent implantation.Recommendation 16: For contrast imaging during BPA, non-ionic, low or iso-osmolar contrast agents are recommended, with hydration status determined by the patient's clinical condition, cardiac and renal function, and intraoperative contrast volume used.
