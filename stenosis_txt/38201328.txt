Title: Incidental Finding of Subannular Perfused Aortic Root Abscess.

Abstract: An 83-year-old female presented with aortic valve stenosis requiring surgery, which was diagnosed with a transthoracic echocardiography three years ago. However, the patient declined the surgery at that time due to personal reasons. Three years later she presented again with signs of dizziness and weakness and progression of the aortic valve stenosis. Cardiac catheterization and a computed tomography scan were performed before the planned surgery. Surprisingly, a huge subannular perfused abscess hole around the aortic root companying a pericardial effusion was revealed. The patient underwent an urgent aortic root replacement with a tissue valve and an aortic ascending replacement without any complications. Intraoperative inspection confirmed an active aortic root and valve endocarditis.
