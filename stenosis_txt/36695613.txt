Title: Endovascular transatrial stenting of pulmonary vein stenosis after lung transplantation.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) and pulmonary vein occlusion (PVO) represent rare complications after lung transplantation (LTx), with limited therapeutic options and a high risk of graft loss. We present 2 cases of successful endovascular transatrial stenting following double LTx. A 60-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent double lobar LTx was diagnosed at postoperative day 72 with a high-grade PVS on the left side. A 22-year-old woman with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension who underwent double LTx was diagnosed 9 days later with PVO of the left upper lobe vein. To avoid surgical reintervention, endovascular transatrial dilatation and stenting were performed successfully in both cases. Transatrial endovascular stenting of PVS or PVO after LTx seems an effective and safe treatment option that should be considered for these life-threatening complications and executed with care.
