Title: Two-Year Outcomes of Endovascular Interventions of the Common Femoral Artery: A Retrospective Analysis From Two Medical Centers.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Treatment of common femoral artery (CFA) disease has been traditionally surgical. Recent data indicate that an endovascular option is feasible in treating CFA disease but there remains significant controversy about the endovascular versus surgical approach to treatment. Newer modalities of therapy have emerged to treat the CFA including atherectomy and drug coated balloons. We retrospectively reviewed data on the long-term outcome of endovascular treatment of CFA from 2 medical centers.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with CFA disease treated by 6 operators using endovascular techniques from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017 were reviewed and analyzed. Two-year follow up was completed using medical records. Demographic, clinical, procedural and angiographic variables were collected. The primary endpoint of the study was target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary endpoints included target vessel revascularization (TVR), mortality, unplanned major and minor amputations and 30-day periprocedural adverse events. Descriptive analysis was performed on all variables. Kaplan-Meier for freedom from TLR was plotted. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at our center.
RESULTS: A total of 89 patients (116 limbs) were included at Index. There were males 57.3%, diabetics 42.7%. Mean age was 65.1 ± 16.3 years. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) was present in 27.7%. Disease distribution was classified by the Medina classification: 1-0-0 (CFA only) 48.3%, 1-0-1 (CFA + profunda) 6.9%, 1-1-1 (CFA+ profunda + origin of superficial femoral artery) 16.4%, 1-1-0 (CFA and origin of SFA) 28.4%. Denovo disease was present in 70.7%. Atherectomy was used in 104/116 limbs (89.7%). Drug coated balloons (DCB) in 15.5%, and stenting in 22.4%. Baseline stenosis 81.2 ± 13.1%, lesion length was 42.0 ± 14.5 mm. Final stenosis was 13.3 ± 11.0. Major bleeding occurred in 2.6%. At 2-year mortality was 9.0% (none related to procedure), CLI was 5.9% and no unplanned major or minor amputations. At 2-year KM analysis showed a probability of freedom from TLR of 72.2%. At 2-year the following TLRs were noted for various devices used: PTA 50%, orbital atherectomy 0%, jetstream 29.2%, laser 36.4%, and SilverHawk/TurboHawk 23.1% (p = 0.0476).
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of CFA predominantly with atherectomy in this cohort, is feasible and with acceptable outcomes considering a low percentage of DCB use. A randomized trial is needed to validate these findings and explore the added role of DCB and atherectomy on clinical outcomes when compared to endarterectomy.
