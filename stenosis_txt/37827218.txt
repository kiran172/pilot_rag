Title: 4D flow MRI-derived energy loss and RV workload in adults with tetralogy of Fallot.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess flow energy loss (EL) pattern inside the pulmonary circulation in adult patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), particularly in TOF with pulmonary stenosis (PS) and pulmonary regurgitation (PR), as a cardiac workload parameter and its relationship to symptoms and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
METHODS: Prospectively, 51 consecutive TOF adults after intracardiac repair, who underwent four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging, were enrolled. All of them had significant PR (PR regurgitant fraction >25 %). TOF patients who had already reached the conventional criteria were excluded. We defined MACE as the following: 1) fatal arrhythmias, 2) sudden cardiac death, 3) surgical pulmonary valvular repair (PVR), 4) right heart failure (HF) needing diuretics and/or hospitalization within 2 years.
RESULTS: A total of 15 patients had MACE; 1) 10 patients underwent PVR within 2 years, 2) 2 patients had ventricular tachycardia, and 3) 6 patients developed right HF (overlapped). Right ventricular (RV) end diastolic volume index (EDVI), RV end systolic volume index (ESVI), average EL/cardiac output (CO), and diastolic EL/CO in patients with MACE were greater than ones without MACE. On a multivariate logistic analysis, the diastolic EL/CO ratio and RVEDVI had the highest odds with MACE in all TOF (odds ratio, 40.7 and 1.15. 95%CI, 1.83-905 and 1.02-13.0; p-value, 0.02 and 0.03). In sub-analysis within 29 patients with moderate PS with PR, and 10 patients with MACE showed higher diastolic EL/CO. Average and diastolic EL/CO negatively correlated with RV ejection fraction (EF) in this sub-analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: High EL, particularly, high diastolic EL/CO, were the important factors for MACE in adult TOF. Higher diastolic EL/CO was also related to lower RV EF and deteriorated RV function in adult TOF with PS and PR. Right-sided EL can be a sensitive marker of excessive cardiac workload which integrates both afterload and preload in adult patients with TOF, beyond the RV size.
