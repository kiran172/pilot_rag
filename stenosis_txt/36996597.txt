Title: Intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging features of infectious vasculitis.

Abstract: Vasculitis is a complication of several infectious diseases affecting the central nervous system, which may result in ischemic and/or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, and aneurysm formation. The infectious agent may directly infect the endothelium, causing vasculitis, or indirectly affect the vessel wall through an immunological mechanism. The clinical manifestations of these complications usually overlap with those of non-infectious vascular diseases, making diagnosis challenging. Intracranial vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VWI) enables the evaluation of the vessel wall and the diseases that affect it, providing diagnostic data beyond luminal changes and enabling the identification of inflammatory changes in cerebral vasculitis. This technique demonstrates concentric vessel wall thickening and gadolinium enhancement, associated or not with adjacent brain parenchymal enhancement, in patients with vasculitis of any origin. It permits the detection of early alterations, even before a stenosis occurs. In this article, we review the intracranial vessel wall imaging features of infectious vasculitis of bacterial, viral, and fungal etiologies.
