Title: Long-term outcomes of three-vessel coronary artery disease after coronary revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention using second-generation drug-eluting stents versus coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Abstract: Studies on the outcomes of de novo three-vessel coronary artery disease (3VD) are limited. This study evaluated the outcomes after coronary revascularization in patients with 3VD treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using second-generation drug-eluting stents (2ndDES) in comparison with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We analyzed 853 patients undergoing either PCI or CABG for 3VD between 2010 and 2014. Of them, this study included 298 undergoing PCI with 2ndDES alone (PCI group) and 171 undergoing CABG (CABG group). The primary outcome measure was a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke. The secondary outcome measures were cardiac death, MI, stroke, and target vessel revascularization (TVR). Propensity matching was used to adjust a cohort of patients with similar baseline characteristics. Between the PCI and CABG groups, no significant differences were found in the 3-year cumulative incidence of the primary outcome measure (14.9% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.60). After propensity score matching, no significant differences were found in the incidences of primary outcome measure (13.0% vs. 12.8%, p = 0.95), cardiac death, MI, and stroke (3.5% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.72; 1.2% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.31; and 4.9% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.35), whereas that of TVR was significantly higher in the PCI group (24.5 vs. 7.1%, p < 0.01). Compared with CABG, PCI with second-generation DES was not associated with higher risk of clinical outcomes, but was associated with a higher risk of TVR in the treatment of 3VD.
