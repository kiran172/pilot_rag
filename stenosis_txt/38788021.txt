Title: Albumin levels and cerebral collateral circulation in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to intracranial arteriosclerotic: A propensity score-matched analysis.

Abstract: Cerebral collateral circulation (CC) is associated with the recurrence and severity of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and early identification of poor CC is helpful for the prevention of AIS. In this study we evaluated the association between serum albumin levels and CC in AIS using logistic regression. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to eliminate the effect of confounders, and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were employed to explore potential nonlinear associations between albumin and CC. In unadjusted logistic regression analysis, lower albumin (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79-0.92) was associated with poor CC, and after adjusting for covariates, the odds of lower albumin for poor CC compared to good CC were 0.86 (95% CI = 0.79-0.94). In the PS cohort, the association of albumin with CC was consistent with those of the original cohort. RCS results showed a linear relationship between albumin and CC (P values of .006 and .08 for overall and nonlinear associations, respectively). The results of this study suggest that lower serum albumin is independently associated with an increased risk of poor CC, which may serve as an effective predictive indicator for poor CC in patients with severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.
