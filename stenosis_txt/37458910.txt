Title: Rethinking an effective AV fistula-graft screening program. An "A B C".

Abstract: The goal of a vascular access screening program is to detect and preemptively correct hemodynamically significant stenosis, however, a practice pattern allowing to implement such a program still remains to be defined. Achieving balance between the increase in access-related procedures by adopting an aggressive screening program, and the risks associated with the absence of any screening program, i.e., failure or abandonment of the arterio-venous access with need for central venous catheter placement, can be extremely challenging. All major guidelines agree about the role of arterio-venous access monitoring, but the way surveillance should be managed is still a controversial issue. Preserving long-term vascular access function should be a goal for all hemodialysis teams, yet it ideally requires a multidisciplinary effort with a monitoring program, calling for a great deal of involvement by hemodialysis health professionals. In this context, the engagement of skilled nurses and the role of patient empowerment with collaborative decision-making may be the key to a successful vascular access screening program. Screening programs should be personalized, shared with the patients, and tailored according to vascular access type and site. In the near future, new devices and the use of artificial intelligence may allow to support interpretation of complex data and lead to the development of prediction models for vascular access failure.
