Title: Influence of reconstruction kernels on the accuracy of CT-derived fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the influence of image reconstruction kernels on the diagnostic accuracy of CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) compared to invasive FFR in patients with coronary artery disease.
METHODS: Sixty-nine patients, in whom coronary CT angiography was performed and who were further referred for invasive coronary angiography with FFR measurement via pressure wire, were retrospectively included. CT data sets were acquired using a third-generation dual-source CT system and rendered with medium smooth (Bv40) and sharp (Bv49) reconstruction kernels. FFR<sub>CT</sub> was calculated on-site using prototype software. Coronary stenoses with invasive FFR ≤ 0.80 were classified as significant. Agreement between FFR<sub>CT</sub> and invasive FFR was determined for both reconstruction kernels.
RESULTS: One hundred analyzed vessels in 69 patients were included. Twenty-five vessels were significantly stenosed according to invasive FFR. Using a sharp reconstruction kernel for FFR<sub>CT</sub> resulted in a significantly higher correlation with invasive FFR (r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.01 vs. r = 0.58, p &lt; 0.01; p = 0.04) and a higher AUC in ROC curve analysis to correctly identify/exclude significant stenosis (AUC = 0.92 vs. AUC = 0.82 for sharp vs. medium smooth kernel, respectively, p = 0.02). A FFR<sub>CT</sub> value of ≤ 0.8 using a sharp reconstruction kernel showed a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 92% for detecting ischemia-causing lesions, resulting in a diagnostic accuracy of 91%. The medium smooth reconstruction kernel performed worse (sensitivity 60%, specificity 89%, accuracy 82%).
CONCLUSION: Compared to invasively measured FFR, FFR<sub>CT</sub> using a sharp image reconstruction kernel shows higher diagnostic accuracy for detecting lesions causing ischemia, potentially altering decision-making in a clinical setting.
KEY POINTS: • Image reconstruction parameters influence the diagnostic accuracy of simulated fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography. • Using a sharp kernel image reconstruction algorithm delivers higher diagnostic accuracy compared to medium smooth kernel image reconstruction (gold standard invasive fractional flow reserve).
