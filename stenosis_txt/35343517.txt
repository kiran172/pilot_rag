Title: [Staged rotational atherectomy in a patient with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a case report and review of the literature].

Abstract: Rotational atherectomy represents an option to improve the treatment of calcified/undilatable coronary stenoses, but its use in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is controversial. We report the case of a patient with an occlusive and calcified coronary stenosis and its management not previously described. A 67-year-old man with STEMI was referred to our cath-lab. Coronary angiography showed a complex calcified and thrombotic occlusion of the right coronary artery. Vessel patency was obtained with balloon dilation, achieving clinical stability. The patient started dual antiplatelet therapy and was scheduled for a staged procedure using rotational atherectomy ("Rota-staged PCI"), performed 6 days later reaching optimal angiographic and clinical results. Our purpose was to manage this STEMI patient with an occluded and heavily calcified coronary artery in two times: a primary coronary angioplasty to quickly reopen the artery and an early staged PCI using rotational atherectomy to optimize the intervention (coronary dilation and stent deployment) minimizing the risk of stent underexpansion or acute complications.
