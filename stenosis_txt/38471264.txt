Title: Identification of circular RNA hsa_circ_0034621 as a novel biomarker for carotid atherosclerosis and the potential function as a regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in disease development by regulating gene expression, and have emerged as promising novel disease biomarkers. This study aimed to identify the NLRP3 inflammasome-associated circRNA biomarkers of carotid atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Based on the differential expression profiles of circRNAs in patients with carotid artery plaque (CAP) and healthy controls, hsa_circ_0043621, hsa_circ_0051995, and hsa_circ_0123388 were screened and validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Potential circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions were explored using a luciferase assay. The biological roles of the validated circRNAs were investigated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using Western blotting, transwell, and CCK-8 assays. Clinical significance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The expression levels of all candidate circRNAs were significantly higher in patients with CAP than in controls (p<0.05), which was consistent with the results of the microarray analysis. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0043621 significantly increased the expression of NLRP3, induced migration of HUVECs, and inhibited cell proliferation. hsa_circ_0043621 demonstrated reasonable diagnostic accuracy for CAP detection and increased intima-media thickness (IMT). hsa_circ_0043621 upregulation was an independent predictor of an increased risk of CAP and increased IMT.
CONCLUSIONS: hsa_circ_0043621 is a valuable circulating biomarker of carotid atherosclerosis and may contribute to its pathogenesis by regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome.
