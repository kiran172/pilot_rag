Title: [Efficacy and safety of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Methods: The clinical data of patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR at the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region between September 2016 and September 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Changes in aortic transvalvular pressure gradients, valve orifice area, and activity tolerance of patients before and after the surgery were compared. Moreover, postoperative complications and follow-up results from 30 days to 6 years after the surgery were recorded. Results: A total of 76 patients were included in the study (50 males and 26 females), with an average age of (71.3±7.6) years, including 16 rheumatic valvular diseases, 60 senile degenerative diseases, 46 bicuspid valves and 30 tricuspid valves. The success rate of the operation was 96.1% (73/76). Compared with that before the operation, the mean aortic transvalvular pressure gradients decreased [(8.5±2.8) mmHg vs (68.5±19.2) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa),P&lt;0.001], but the valve orifice area increased [(1.91±0.31) cm2 vs (0.65±0.21) cm2, P&lt;0.001]. Likewise, six-minute walking test (6MWT) showed that walking distance was longer after the surgery [(430±13) m vs (201±28) m, P&lt;0.001]. There were 1 case of retroperitoneal hematoma, 1 case of stricture balloon dilatation after femoral artery suture concomitant with postoperative puncture site infection, 1 case of femoral artery surgical incision, 2 cases of valve-in-valve (ViV) and 5 cases of perivalvular leakage (4 cases were mild and 1 case was moderate) after the surgery, respectively. Moreover, acute left main artery occlusion during operation occurred in 1 case, ventricular rupture during operation occurred in 1 case and the patient was transferred to valve replacement surgery and finally dead, delayed coronary artery occlusion and death happened in 1 case, and all of the above-mentioned 3 cases were due to surgical failure. Postoperative pacemaker implantation due to third-degree atrioventricular block was performed in 5 cases. There were 1 case of pulmonary embolism, 1 case of transient right limb disorder, 1 case of gastrointestinal bleeding and 1 case of urethral bleeding after the surgery, respectively. The patients were followed up for (1.0±0.1) years (30 days to 6 years), and the results showed that 2 cases died, including 1 case died suddenly at home (the cause of death was unknown) and 1 case died of acute heart failure 8 months after the surgery. Chronic heart failure occurred repeatedly in 6 cases. The quality of life of other patients improved significantly. Conclusion: TAVR is effective and safe for patients with severe aortic stenosis.
