Title: Efficacy of Office-Based Intralesional Steroid Injections in the Management of Subglottic Stenosis: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of office-based intralesional steroid injections (ILSI) as a management therapy for adult subglottic stenosis (SGS).
DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was completed using PubMed and Science Direct for office-based management of SGS due to various etiologies.
REVIEW METHODS: The primary end point measured was a change in surgery free interval (SFI) between endoscopic procedures due to office-based serial ILSI. The secondary end point was to determine what percentage of patients did not require further operative intervention for SGS maintenance therapy after changing management to office-based serial ILSI.
RESULTS: We identified 187 abstracts, 4 of which were included in the analysis. The total number of participants was 55. The mean age was 50.4, and 78.1% were women. The etiologies were as follows: idiopathic (58.2%), postintubation/tracheotomy (29.1%), and autoimmune (12.7%). The SFI was reported in 3 of the 4 studies. The reported mean pre-ILSI SFI was 362.9 days and the post-ILSI SFI was 582.2 days. The secondary outcome was reported in 3 of the 4 studies. Forty-one of the 55 patients (74.5%) did not require further operative intervention during the duration of the study.
CONCLUSION: This review explored office-based ILSI as a potential treatment option for patients with SGS. The limited data presented found ILSI significantly lengthened SFI, potentially reducing surgical burden. In addition, ILSI was found to be safe with few reported side effects.
