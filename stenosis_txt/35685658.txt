Title: Coronary Artery Magnetic Resonance Angiography Combined with Computed Tomography Angiography in Diagnosis of Coronary Heart Disease by Reconstruction Algorithm.

Abstract: This research aimed at discussing the diagnosis effect of coronary artery magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) combined with computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) based on the back-projection filter reconstruction (BPFR) algorithm in coronary heart disease (CHD), and its role in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Sixty patients with CHD were selected and randomly rolled into group A (undergone MRA examination), group B (undergone CTA examination), and group C (undergone MRA + CTA), with 20 cases in each group. Taking the diagnostic results of coronary angiography as the gold standard, the MRA and CTA images were reconstructed using a BPFR algorithm, and a filter function was added to solve the problem of image sharpness. In addition, the iterative reconstruction algorithm and the Fourier transform analysis method were introduced. As a result, the image clarity and resolution obtained by the BPFR algorithm were better than those obtained by the Fourier transform analytical method and the iterative reconstruction algorithm. The accuracy of group C for the diagnosis of mild coronary stenosis, moderate stenosis, and severe stenosis was 94.02%, 96.13%, and 98.01%, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of group B (87.5%, 90.2%, and 88.4%) and group C (83.4%, 89.1%, and 91.5%) (P &lt; 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of noncalcified plaque in group C were 87.9% and 89.2%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of calcified plaque were 84.5% and 78.4%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in groups B and C (P &lt; 0.05). In summary, the BPFR algorithm had good denoising and artifact removal effects on coronary MRA and CTA images. The combined detection of reconstructed MRA and CTA images had a high diagnostic value for CHD.
