Title: Unstable Non-isthmic Spondylolisthesis Following Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy Assisted Unilateral Laminotomy for Bilateral Decompression: A Case Report.

Abstract: Lumbar decompressive laminectomy is a standard treatment for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, but in some cases, can lead to iatrogenic spondylolysis and delayed segmental instability. Iatrogenic spondylolysis occurs in most cases in pars interarticularis, but rare cases have also been reported, pediculolysis in pedicle and laminolysis in lamina. Minimally invasive spine surgery (MIS) is known to have a low risk of developing these iatrogenic spondylolyses, and unilateral biportal endoscopy is the MIS that has been drawing attention. We present a case of a 72-year-old female who was diagnosed with L4-5 unstable non-isthmic spondylolisthesis and severe right central disc extrusion 10 weeks after UBE assisted unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (ULBD) at the consecutive segments of L3-4 and L4-5. Pre-operative imaging studies revealed severe central stenosis without spondylolisthesis at L3-L4 and L4-L5 along with L4-L5 facet tropism. She was managed by anterior lumbar interbody fusion and cement augmented pedicle screw fixation, which resulted in the complete resolution of her clinical and neurologic symptoms.
