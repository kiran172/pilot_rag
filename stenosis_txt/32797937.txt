Title: Infective endocarditis following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has recently emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in high risk patients. Although several procedures have been performed worldwide, infective endocarditis (IE) has been reported to be a rare TAVI complication, nevertheless if IE occurs it represents a life-threatening condition and treatment is challenging. TAVI-IE are thus normally treated conservatively by targeted antibiotic therapy with a high reported mortality (40%). Surgical explant represent the definitive strategy but, the intervention is at a high risk (risk of complication 87%, with an in hospital mortality of about 47%). In the present paper, we report the case of a 71-year-old patient affected by an early endocarditis after TAVI (TAVI-IE) treated at our Institution by surgical explant. The case highlights a paradox: if TAVI procedures are indicated over traditional surgical valve replacement in treatment of high surgical risk patients, what should be the best management when TAVI-IE occurs in these same population of patients?
