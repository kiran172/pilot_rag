Title: Necessity sequential intermediate kissing balloon dilation for crush stenting: Further insights from metal/polymer vessel scaffolds bench testing.

Abstract: Sequential intermediate kissing balloon dilation (sIKBD) is crucial for crush stenting, but it require appropriate procedure remains unclear for crush stenting. This study aims to investigate whether sIKBD is necessary and how it can be properly performed during crush stenting. Mini-crush stenting (mini-CS) and sIKBD for mini-crush stenting (sIKBD-mini-CS) using metal drug-eluting stents/polymer bioresorbable vessel scaffolds (mDES/pBVS) were emulated in bifurcation models considering the branch diameter difference, and sIKBD was added to mini-CS for pretreating side-branch (SB) stent before main-branch (MB) stenting (second figure), respectively. Micro-computed tomography was used to assess the morphological parameters of bifurcated stents including length of overlapping stent segment, residual ostial stenosis of the SB, and neocarina length using quantitative methods. Further, optical coherence tomography was to analyze the incidence of stent malapposition. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that in mDES/pBVS phantom, the neocarina length (mDES: 0.45 ± 0.10 mm vs 0.30 ± 0.09 mm, P = .005; pBVS: 0.47 ± 0.11 mm vs 0.29 ± 0.09 mm, P = .001), residual ostial stenosis at the SB (mDES: 19.37 ± 8.21% vs 12.47 ± 2.05%, P = .001; pBVS: 21.89 ± 8.54% vs 9.98 ± 3.35%, P = .035), and stent malapposition in the overlapping segment (mDES: 10.29 ± 3.31% vs 3.83 ± 0.97%, P = .001; pBVS: 12.05 ± 3.87% vs 6.40 ± 1.59%, P = .003) were lower in the sIKBD-mini-CS group than those in the mini-CS group (P < .05 for all). The results of factorial analysis showed that mDES platform tended to have better morphological indicators than the pBVS platform. Adding the sIKBD to mini-CS showed better morphologic characteristics of mDES/pBVS phantoms when compared with mini-CS. Therefore, it should be considered as a critical and proper technique for crush stenting.
