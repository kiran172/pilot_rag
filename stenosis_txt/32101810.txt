Title: IgG4-Related Lung Disease Exhibiting the Invasion into the Diaphragm: A Case Report.

Abstract: Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a fibroinflammatory condition which involves various organs. This is a very rare case of IgG4-related lung disease (IgG4-RLD) with the invasion into diaphragm. The patient was a 71-year-old man with a long-term exposure to asbestos who had a mass shadow in the left lower lung lobe, which was suspected to invade the left diaphragm on computed tomography (CT). Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT also presented an avid intake of fluorodeoxyglucose in the mass, which suspected lung cancer. Although bronchoscopic biopsy could not lead to the definite diagnosis, we performed left lower lobectomy combined with the resection of left diaphragm. The specimen showed the features of IgG4-RLD on pathology: the vein stenosis and fibrosis around the vein, the infiltration of IgG4-positive cells, and IgG cells to IgG4 cells ratio of 40%. Furthermore, there were inflammatory cells infiltrating to the diaphragm.
