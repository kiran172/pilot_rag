Title: Design of a Biocompatible Drug-Eluting Tracheal Stent in Mice with Laryngotracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) is a pathologic narrowing of the subglottis and trachea leading to extrathoracic obstruction and significant shortness of breath. LTS results from mucosal injury from a foreign body in the trachea, leading to tissue damage and a local inflammatory response that goes awry, leading to the deposition of pathologic scar tissue. Treatment for LTS is surgical due to the lack of effective medical therapies. The purpose of this method is to construct a biocompatible stent that can be miniaturized to place into mice with LTS. We demonstrated that a PLLA-PCL (70% poly-L-lactide and 30% polycaprolactone) construct had optimal biomechanical strength, was biocompatible, practicable for an in vivo placement stent, and capable of eluting drug. This method provides a drug delivery system for testing various immunomodulatory agents to locally inhibit inflammation and reduce airway fibrosis. Manufacturing the stents takes 28-30 h and can be reproduced easily, allowing for experiments with large cohorts. Here we incorporated the drug rapamycin within the stent to test its effectiveness in reducing fibrosis and collagen deposition. Results revealed that PLLA-PCL tents showed reliable rapamycin release, were mechanically stable in physiological conditions, and were biocompatible, inducing little inflammatory response in the trachea. Further, the rapamycin-eluting PLLA-PCL stents reduced scar formation in the trachea in vivo.
