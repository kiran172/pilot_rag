Title: Management of Atherosclerotic Carotid Artery Disease: A Brief Overview and Update.

Abstract: Extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease has been associated with approximately 15%-20% of ischemic stroke cases and is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Medical, surgical, and endovascular therapies for the prevention of stroke from carotid disease have advanced considerably over the past quarter century. The objective of this review is to outline the clinical presentation of symptomatic carotid artery stenosis and the risk factors associated with development of carotid artery stenosis and then summarize the current evidence-based medical treatment modalities, along with available surgical and endovascular therapies.
