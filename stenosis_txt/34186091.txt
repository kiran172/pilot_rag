Title: Routine Stent Bridging to the Supraaortic Vessels in Aortic Arch Replacement: 10-Year-Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The supraaortic vessel anastomosis stent bridging (SAVSTEB) technique simplifies the reattachment of the supraaortic vessels in aortic arch surgery; however, follow-up data are limited. The study aimed to investigate the stent-related performance and complications.
METHODS: Between February 2009 and September 2020, 112 patients underwent total arch replacement with a tetrabranched graft and using the SAVSTEB technique. Mean age was 59.3±12.7 years, and male gender prevailed. Nineteen percent of these patients had acute aortic dissection extending into the supraaortic vessels, 12% had chronically dissected vessels, and 70% had unaffected vessels. The left subclavian artery, left common carotid artery, and innominate artery were bridged in 88%, 75%, and 2%, respectively, and an aberrant right subclavian artery was bridged in 2%.
RESULTS: Total stent experience was 341 stent-years, and stent patency was found in 98%. Technical success was achieved in all but 1 case. One percent of patients had major stent thrombosis requiring reintervention. Minor stent thrombosis was found in 2%. No endoleak was found, and the number of new-onset dissections distal to the stent was 4%. Freedom from stent-related events was estimated at 89.1% ± 0.5% at 3 years. The stroke rate was 10%, with the highest incidence among nondissected vessels. The vertebral artery was overstented in 15%, and 2% of these cases were associated radiographically with stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: SAVSTEB is a comparatively simple, safe, and efficacious technique to create the anastomosis between tetrabranched arch grafts and the supraaortic arteries in the short and intermediate term. Bleeding from the anastomoses, kinking, and scar-associated stenosis are negligible; however, vertebral overstenting remains a critical technical issue.
