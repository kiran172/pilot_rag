Title: Clinical Care for Cardiovascular Disease in Patients With Williams-Beuren Syndrome.

Abstract: Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a congenital multisystem disorder affecting the cardiovascular, central nervous, and musculoskeletal systems. Cardiovascular abnormalities, which consist principally of vascular stenoses, occur in approximately 80% of people with WBS and are the predominant cause of early morbidity and mortality. Supravalvar aortic stenosis and peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis are the most common stenotic lesions in WBS, though other stenoses often occur, including stenoses of the coronary arteries. Approximately one-third of people with WBS undergo cardiovascular interventions. The risk of sudden cardiac death is markedly higher than the general population, with most events occurring in the periprocedural period. Because of the rarity of WBS and the often-complex nature of the cardiovascular abnormalities, most physicians, including cardiologists, have limited experience in caring for patients with WBS. Further, heretofore, clinical cardiovascular management guidelines based on international expert consensus have not been available. This state-of-the-art review provides a comprehensive synopsis of the cardiovascular abnormalities in WBS and presents clinical management guidelines based on the authors' expert consensus.
