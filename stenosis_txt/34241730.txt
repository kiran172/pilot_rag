Title: Effect of Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon Angioplasty on Side Branch Lesion and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with De Novo True Coronary Bifurcation Lesions Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the effects of paclitaxal-coated balloon (PCB) versus conventional balloon (CB) on side branch (SB) lesion and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with de novo true bifurcation lesions.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients with de novo true bifurcation lesions were enrolled and divided into PCB group (102 cases) and CB group (117 cases) according to angioplasty strategy in SB. Drug-eluting stent (DES) was implanted in main vessel (MV) for each subject. All subjects underwent a 12-month follow-up for late lumen loss (LLL), restenosis, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MACEs included cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina requiring admission.
RESULTS: There were no differences in diameter, minimum lumen diameter (MLD), and stenosis for bifurcation lesions between the two groups before and immediately after PCI (P > 0.05). After 12-month follow-up, no differences occurred in MV-MLD and MV-LLL between the two groups (P > 0.05); SB-MLD in PCB group was higher than that in CB group (1.97 ± 0.36 mm vs. 1.80 ± 0.43 mm, P = 0.007); SB-LLL in PCB group was lower than that in CB group (0.11 ± 0.18 mm vs. 0.19 ± 0.25 mm, P = 0.024). Multivariate COX analyses indicated that PCB group had lower MACE risk than CB group (HR = 0.480, 95%CI 0.244-0.941, P = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: PCB could decrease SB-LLL and MACE risk in patients with de novo true coronary bifurcation lesion 12 months after single-DES intervention.
