Title: From Wellens To Kounis Syndrome: An Unlucky Patient.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Wellens syndrome (WS) is identified by ECG changes in the precordial leads after resolution of angina chest pain. WS indicates critical stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. On the other hand, Kounis syndrome (KS) is an allergic reaction to various substances resulting in acute coronary syndrome. Contrast media can trigger the allergic reaction associated with KS. We describe a patient with WS who developed an allergic reaction to contrast media after percutaneous coronary intervention and experienced recurrent myocardial infarction on re-exposure.
LEARNING POINTS: Despite its rarity, physicians and radiologists should be aware of Kounis syndrome triggered by contrast media so it can be rapidly diagnosed and treated.The initial target of the prevention and treatment of KS is avoidance of the precipitating stimulus or allergen.There are three KS variants: angina due to allergic coronary spasm, allergic myocardial infarction and allergy-induced stent thrombosis.
