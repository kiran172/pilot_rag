Title: Renovascular Hypertension.

Abstract: Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is relatively common but underrecognized cause of resistant hypertension in clinical practice. Most patients with RVH have suboptimal control of hypertension in spite of being on multiple anti hypertensive medications. Prompt diagnosis and management is crucial to prevent long term morbidity and mortality. Initial evaluation by primary care physicians can expedite this to improve patient outcomes by co-managing hypertension specialists. In addition to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures, some patients may benefit from angioplasty. This article discusses various definitions of hypertension, approach to diagnosis of RVH, and management. Data from clinical trials are discussed with evidence-based medicine practice recommendations.
