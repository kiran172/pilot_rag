Title: Pyeloureteral Anastomosis as a Reconstructive Technique for Post-Renal Transplant Ureteral Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Ureteral stenosis in renal transplant patients is a frequent urological complication that involves significant morbidity and may compromise graft function. Despite the common use of minimally invasive techniques, surgery continues to be the definitive treatment for ureteral stenosis, and pyeloureteral anastomosis is an infrequent but effective technique in the management of this pathology and has been described as a safe treatment with a low percentage of complications.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients in whom surgical intervention via pyeloureteral anastomosis was carried out in our center in the last 12 years. A descriptive analysis of perioperative management, complications, and functional results is provided. A comparison of renal function at diagnosis and after surgery was made to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent surgery within the described time frame. Time to diagnosis of stenosis was 60 days [interquartile range (IQR) 31-368]. Creatinine at diagnosis was 2.2 mg/dL [IQR 1.9-3] with a glomerular filtration rate, estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease equation, of 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 [IQR 22.6-34.5]. Of these patients, 92.3% underwent percutaneous nephrostomy, and 38.5% also had a ureteral catheter. The mean duration of surgery was 265 minutes [IQR 240-300], and hospital stay was 9 days [IQR 7.5-16]. A double J was placed in all cases, which was maintained for 36 days [IQR 30-49]. Postoperative complications occurred in 15.4% of patients. Serum creatinine 1 year after surgery was 1.6 Â± 0.4 mg/dL. Among the patients, 76.9% had no new pyelocalyceal dilatation on follow-up Doppler ultrasound scans at a mean follow-up time of 12 months. The restenosis rate was 23.1%, and all were successfully treated by endoscopic approach. There was an improvement in renal function figures at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months compared to renal function at diagnosis, both in terms of serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate, with statistically significant results.
CONCLUSION: Pyeloureteral anastomosis as a reconstructive technique of the urinary tract in renal transplant patients is an effective and reproducible technique with good long-term results.
