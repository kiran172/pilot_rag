Title: Learning from a case of right ventricular outflow tract stenting in tricuspid atresia with critical pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: Tricuspid valve atresia with severe pulmonary stenosis is one of the common cyanotic diseases in neonate. Child can succumb due to profound cyanosis and arterial hypoxaemia after closure of patent ductus arteriosus. Evolving procedure of right ventricular outflow tract stenting may be considered as a palliative procedure in such vulnerable group, destined for a later definitive management. The right ventricular outflow tract stenting is described essentially for tetralogy of Fallot physiology with a catheter course across tricuspid valve. We describe a case of successful right ventricular outflow tract stenting in a 5-day-old symptomatic neonate. We discuss the possible routes and the tips to facilitate right ventricular outflow tract stenting in such a case. This happens to be the first reported case description with successful stenting of neonate with tricuspid atresia with critical pulmonic stenosis.
