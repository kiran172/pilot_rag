Title: A rare cause and an even rarer treatment of hypertension in a 5-year-old boy: Mid-aortic syndrome.

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis is one of the common vascular diseases that cause hypertension in children. However, renal artery aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysms, which may be components of mid-aortic syndrome, are rarely associated with renal artery stenosis. Despite its rarity, early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent fatal complications. Currently, non-surgical invasive techniques are considered the first choice for treatment, but in some cases, surgery is inevitable. Here, we present a 5-year-old boy with a mid-aortic syndrome. The patient presented with a history of severe headache and epistaxis 5-6 times a day and was diagnosed with hypertension. A 9 × 9 mm saccular aneurysm on the anterior surface of the abdominal aorta at the level of the left renal artery ostium, and a 12 mm aneurysm in the left renal artery after a stenotic segment at the hilum level was detected in the doppler USG and contrast-enhanced imaging techniques. The patient was operated on electively. We used a PTFE patch to repair the abdominal aorta and, saphenous vein which was taken from his father to repair the renal artery. The patient recovered well and was discharged on the 18th day.
