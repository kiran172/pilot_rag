Title: [A Case of Multidomain Integrated Treatment Strategy  for Complex Primary Pulmonary Sarcomatoid Carcinoma].

Abstract: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a rare and highly malignant tumor, which includes the following five pathologic types: pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma and pulmonary blastoma. The onset of PSC is occult with non-specific clinical symptoms and signs. The clinical manifestations include irritating cough, bloody sputum, dyspnea, chest pain and so on, which are closely related to the growth and invasion site of the tumor. PSC tends to metastasize early, so most patients are already in local advanced stage or advanced stage with a median survival of 9 months at the time of hospital visit. A patient with primary PSC which led to 90% stenosis in central airway was treated by combined method of vascular and tracheoscopic intervention in our respiratory center. This treatment prolonged the patient's survival time and got a satisfactory effect at 19-month follow-up after surgery. Herein we report the case for clinical reference. .
