Title: Asymptomatic carotid intraplaque hemorrhage is associated with a high risk of cerebral infarction and death after cardiovascular surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a lack of information on the natural history of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (AsymCS) associated with cardiovascular diseases that require surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors for postoperative ipsilateral ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality after cardiovascular surgery in patients with AsymCS.
METHODS: Among 2158 patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery, 150 patients with AsymCS who didn't undergo carotid revascularization were included. The relationships between preoperative factors, including carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), and postoperative ipsilateral ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality were analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 1087 days of 150 patients with 19 IPH, 12 (8.0%) and 21 (14.0%) encountered ipsilateral infarction and all-cause mortality, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression analyses indicated that IPH was significantly predictive of both ipsilateral infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 21.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.98-91.17; P ≤.001) and all-cause mortality (HR 4.64, 95% CI, 1.61-13.34; P = .004). Another significant factor was peak systolic velocity for ipsilateral infarction with the cutoff velocity of 227 cm/s by the receiver-operating characteristic curve.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with AsymCS undergoing cardiovascular surgery, IPH had a close connection with a high risk of both postoperative ischemic stroke and mortality after cardiovascular surgery.
