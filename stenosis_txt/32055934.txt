Title: [Anastomosis stenosis after radical prostatectomy and bladder neck stenosis after benign prostate hyperplasia treatment: reconstructive options].

Abstract: Bladder neck stenosis (BNS) after simple prostatectomy and vesicourethral anastomosis stenosis (VUAS) after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer are common sequelae. However, the two entities differ in their pathology, anatomy and their surgical results. VUAS has an incidence of 0.2-28%. Commonly, VUAS occurs within the first 2 years after surgery. Initial therapy should be performed endourologically: dilatation, (laser) incision or resection. After three unsuccessful treatment attempts, open reconstruction should be considered. Different surgical approaches (abdominal, perineal, abdominoperineal) have been described. All are associated with good success rates. However, they are accompanied by high rates of urinary incontinence. Incontinence can be treated safely by implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter. The incidence of BNS is around 5% for all types of surgery for benign prostate hyperplasia. It occurs within the first 2 years after surgery. Initial treatment should be performed endourologically. In case of recalcitrant BNS, open reconstruction is indicated. The YV-plasty is an established procedure, and the T‑plasty represents a modification. Success rates of both procedures are high. Robot-assisted reconstructive procedures have been described for both VUAS and BNS.
