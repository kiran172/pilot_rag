Title: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with dilated sinus of Valsalva: A case-control study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to test the hypothesis that there is an association between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated aorta in a case-control, matched-design fashion.
METHODS: Of 65,843 studies done from November 2011 to December 2015, we found, after detailed evaluation by a single author, 153 cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 3,213 controls who were classified as normal clinically and echocardiographically. Controls were defined as normal patients referred to the echocardiography laboratory with no diagnoses and no known risk factors for dilated aorta (e.g., aortic stenosis, hypertension, aortic regurgitation). Clinical chart review showed none of the risk factors for dilated aorta, and echocardiography did not reveal any abnormalities. Of these 3,213 patients, 153 controls were matched to cases by age and sex by propensity score. Dilated aorta was defined according to clinical, Goldstein, and Lang's criteria.
RESULTS: The prevalence of a dilated sinus of Valsalva was 9 times higher in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients than controls (OR = 9.4, P = 0.003). The 9-fold higher prevalence in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients persisted after adjusting for height, weight, and aortic pathology. Association of dilated mid-ascending aorta with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was significant after adjustment for height and body surface area but became borderline insignificant after adjusting for weight and aortic valve pathology.
CONCLUSION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy appears to be associated with a dilated sinus of Valsalva, even after adjusting for height, weight, and aortic valve pathology.
