Title: Congenital central pulmonary artery anomalies: Part 2.

Abstract: There is a broad spectrum of congenital anomalies of the central pulmonary arteries including abnormalities of development, origin, course and caliber. These anomalies incorporate simple lesions such as isolated pulmonary valve stenosis to very complex anomalies with many associated abnormalities. Part 1 and Part 2 of this review describe the range of anatomical variations that are encountered as well as important aspects of anatomy, physiology and surgical correction. The authors summarize and illustrate both well-recognized and more complex anomalies to provide a broad and comprehensive understanding of these lesions and their appearances on CT and MR imaging. In Part 2 the authors review abnormalities in development, origin and course of the central branch pulmonary arteries as well as abnormal pulmonary artery caliber.
