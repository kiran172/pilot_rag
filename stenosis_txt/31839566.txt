Title: Machine Learning-based Algorithm Enables the Exclusion of Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease in the Patients Who Underwent Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: An application of artificial intelligence to screen for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) after coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) test.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: As an initial step we analyzed a group of 435 patients (23% male, mean age 61 ± 10) with low to moderate probability of CAD, who underwent clinically indicated CACS and coronary computed tomography angiography. Based on those data we elaborated a gradient boosting machine (GBM) model for prediction of obstructive CAD. Later the model was evaluated on a control group of 126 consecutive patients (31% male, mean age 59 ± 10).
RESULTS: Stratified 10-fold cross-validation performed on the group of 435 patients demonstrated the GBM model's sensitivity at 100 ± 0% and specificity at 69.8 ± 3.6%, while the outcomes (confusion matrix) of a clinical application on the group of 126 patients were: 73 true negative, 0 false negative, 20 true positive, and 33 false positive.
CONCLUSION: The GBM algorithm showcased a considerably high discriminatory power for excluding the presence of obstructive CAD, with negative predictive value and positive predictive value of 100% and 38%, respectively.
