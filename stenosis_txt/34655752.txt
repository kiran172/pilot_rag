Title: Feasibility and Preliminary Patency of Prophylactic Hypogastric Artery Stenting for Prevention of Spinal Cord Ischemia in Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To report early results of feasibility and patency of prophylactic hypogastric artery (HA) stenting during complex endovascular aortic repair.
METHODS: This is a single centre retrospective non comparative cohort study of all consecutive patients undergoing prophylactic HA stenting during fenestrated and/or branched EVAR (F/B EVAR) in order to prevent spinal cord ischemia (SCI). Endpoints included technical success and early outcomes in terms of morbidity, mortality and patency of the implanted stents.
RESULTS: Between May 2014 and June 2019 prophylactic HA stenting was performed in 36 consecutive patients with significant HA stenosis during F/B EVAR to prevent SCI. 69.4% of patients presented with asymptomatic, 25% with symptomatic and 5.6% with ruptured aortic aneurysms. 55.6% were treated for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 44.4% for pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. In 13.9% aortic coverage was limited to the abdominal aorta. In 86.1% the aortic coverage was in the thoracoabdominal aortic segment. Unilateral HA stenting was performed in 91.7%, whereas 8.3% underwent bilateral stenting. Technical success was 100%. The primary patency of the implanted stents after a median follow-up time of 9.5 months was 97.5%. One intraprocedural bleeding from an HA branch occurred and was successfully treated by coil embolization. No further procedure-related complications occurred. 11.1% of the patients developed SCI.
CONCLUSIONS: HA stenting is feasible and safe with high rates of technical success and short-term patency.
