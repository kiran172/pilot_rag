Title: Surgical complications in pediatric kidney transplantation-Incidence, risk factors, and effects on graft survival: A retrospective single-center study.

Abstract: The field of pediatric kidney transplantation remains challenging due to an ongoing lack of size-matched grafts and anatomical peculiarities. In the current study, we investigated the incidence of surgical complications in pediatric recipients, with a focus on risk factors and effects on graft outcome. We retrospectively reviewed all 2386 kidney transplantations at our institution from January 2005 until December 2018. Of these, 221 transplants were performed in pediatric recipients, defined as under the age of 18 years. Donor-recipient body surface area ratios were calculated to evaluate the effects of size mismatching. Regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for surgical complications and graft survival, respectively. Perioperative surgical complications requiring revision were observed in 34 (15.4%) cases. Leading cause for revision were vascular complications such as thrombosis or stenosis (n = 15 [6.8%]), which were significantly more frequent in case of young donors, (ie, donor age <6 years; OR: 4.281; CI-95%:1.385-13.226; P = .012), previous nephrectomy (OR: 3.407; CI-95%:1.019-11.387; P = .046), and en-bloc grafts (OR: 4.923; CI-95%:1.355-17.884; P = .015), followed by postoperative hemorrhage (n = 10 [4.5%]), ureteral complications (n = 8 [3.6%]), and lymphoceles (n = 7 [3.2%]). Median follow-up was 84.13 (0.92-175.72) months. One-, 5-, and 10-year graft survival rates were 97.1%, 88.9%, and 65.1%, respectively. Except for vascular complications (HR: 4.727; CI-95%:1.363-16.394; P = .014), none of the analyzed surgical morbidities significantly influenced graft survival. In conclusion, pediatric kidney transplantation achieves excellent long-term results. However, meticulous surgical technique and continuous postoperative monitoring are imperative for early detection and treatment of imminent vascular complications, especially in case of young donors and en-bloc grafts.
