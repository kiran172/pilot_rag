Title: Concomitant brain and liver abscesses: a rare complication of acute diverticulitis.

Abstract: Diverticular disease is one of the most common colonic pathologies in the Western world. In the UK, ~80% of the population aged over 85 years are diagnosed with it. Most of these cases are asymptomatic. Yet, they can become problematic when the diverticula bleed, become infected (diverticulitis) or perforate. Other well-known complications of diverticular disease are acute inflammation, stenosis, fistulation and abscess formation. In this case report, we describe a delayed presentation of metastatic abscesses (liver and brain) from a prior acute diverticulitis with contained perforation and abscess formation.
