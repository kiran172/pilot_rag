Title: "Transcallosal" periventricular anastomosis in moyamoya disease: the fourth periventricular anastomosis and a potential predictor of hemorrhage.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Choroidal anastomosis is a risk factor for hemorrhage in moyamoya disease. One variant of choroidal anastomosis, "transcallosal anastomosis," originates from the medial posterior choroidal artery, and penetrates the corpus callosum to reconstruct the pericallosal artery. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and the bleeding rate of transcallosal anastomosis using sliding thin-slab maximum intensity projection reformatted from magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 222 patients. We defined transcallosal anastomosis grades (0-2) and the stenosis of the anterior (ACA, 0-2), middle (MCA, 1-3), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA, 0-2) by MRA scores, independently by two coauthors.
RESULTS: Grade-2 transcallosal anastomosis was detected in 21 patients (9.5 %). There were no correlations of the incidence of transcallosal anastomosis with previous bypass surgery (P = 0.23). Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly higher incidence in hemorrhagic onset and younger age (odds ratio [OR] 3.77, and 0.97). Transcallosal anastomosis had statistically significant correlation with ACA and PCA scores (P = 0.01 and 0.03), but not with MCA scores (P = 0.1). In multivariate analysis, ACA scores 1 and 2 were significantly higher (OR, 15.44 and 11.17), and PCA score 1 was also higher (OR, 3.07), but PCA score 2 was not. Interrater agreement for judgment of transcallosal anastomosis grade was strong (κ = 0.89). Two patients with Grade-2 transcallosal anastomosis had late hemorrhage in the corpus callosum (bleeding rate: 2.5 % per year).
CONCLUSIONS: Transcallosal anastomosis may be associated with both advanced ACA and moderate PCA stenosis, and cause hemorrhage at the corpus callosum.
