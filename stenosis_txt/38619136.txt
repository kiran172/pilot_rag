Title: Effects of Clip Anchoring on Preventing Migration of Fully Covered Self-Expandable Metal Stent in Patients Undergoing Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography: A Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMSs) are commonly placed in patients with biliary stricture during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). However, up to 40% of migration has been reported, resulting in treatment failure or the requirement for further intervention. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of metal clip anchoring on preventing the migration of FCSEMS.
METHODS: Consecutive patients requiring placement of FCSEMS were included in this multicenter randomized trial. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive clip anchoring (clip group) or not (control group). The primary outcome was the migration rate at 6 months after stent insertion. The secondary outcomes were the rates of proximal and distal migration and stent-related adverse events. The analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle.
RESULTS: From February 2020 to November 2022, 180 patients with biliary stricture were enrolled, with 90 in each group. The baseline characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups. The overall rate of stent migration at 6 months was significantly lower in the clip group compared with the control group (16.7% vs 30.0%, P = 0.030). The proximal and distal migration rates were similar in the 2 groups (2.2% vs 5.6%, P = 0.205; 14.4% vs 22.2%, P = 0.070). Notably, none of the patients (0/8) who received 2 or more clips experienced stent migration. There were no significant differences in stent-related adverse events between the 2 groups.
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that clip-assisted anchoring is an effective and safe method for preventing migration of FCSEMS without increasing the adverse events.
