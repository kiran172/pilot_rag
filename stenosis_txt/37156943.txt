Title: Dialysis Access Maintenance: Plain Balloon Angioplasty.

Abstract: Plain balloon angioplasty remains the first-line treatment for dialysis access stenosis. This chapter reviews the outcomes of plain balloon angioplasty from cohort studies and comparative studies. Angioplasty outcomes are more favourable in arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) compared to arteriovenous grafts (AVG) with primary patency at 6Â months ranging from 42-63% compared to 27-61%, respectively, and improved for forearm fistulae compared with upper arm fistulae. Higher pressures are required to treat stenoses in AVFs compared to AVGs. Outcomes are worse in more severe stenoses, increased patient age, previous interventions and fistulae that develop early stenoses. Major complication rates following angioplasty in dialysis access are between 3 and 5%. Repeat treatments and the use of adjuncts such as drug-coated balloons and stents can prolong the patency of dialysis access. Level of Evidence No level of evidence (Review paper).
