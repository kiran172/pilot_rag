Title: Endocardial Fibroelastosis Resection: When it Works and When it Does Not.

Abstract: Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a thickening of the endocardial layer by accumulation of collagen and elastic fibers. Endothelial to mesenchymal transformation is proposed to be the underlying mechanism of formation. Although EFE can occur in both right and left ventricles, this article will focus on management of left ventricular EFE. Through its fibrous, nonelastic manifestation EFE restricts the myocardium leading to diastolic and systolic ventricular dysfunction and prevents ventricular growth in neonates and infants. The presence of EFE may be a marker for underlying myocardial fibrosis as well. The extent of EFE within the left ventricular cavity can be variable ranging from patchy to confluent distribution. Similarly the depth of penetration and degree of infiltration into myocardium can be variable. The management of EFE is controversial, although resection of EFE has been reported as part of the staged ventricular recruitment therapy. Following resection, EFE recurs and infiltrates the myocardium after primary resection. Herein we review the current experience with EFE resection.
