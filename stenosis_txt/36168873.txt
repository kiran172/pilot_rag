Title: Combined atrial fibrillation ablation and balloon mitral commissurotomy in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually not considered in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis (RMS). We analyzed the results of a combined procedure of AF ablation and percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy (PBMC).
METHODS: We prospectively included 22 patients with severe RMS to undergo a combined PBMC + AF ablation procedure. Noninvasive mapping of the atria was also performed. A historical sample of propensity-scored matched patients who underwent PBMC alone was used as controls. The primary endpoint was freedom from AF/AT at 1-year. Multivariate analysis evaluated sinus rhythm (SR) predictors.
RESULTS: Successful pulmonary vein isolation and electrocardiographic imaging-based drivers ablation was performed in 20 patients following PBMC. At 1-year, 75% of the patients in the combined group were in SR compared to 40% in the propensity-score matched group (p = 0.004). The composite of AF recurrence, need for mitral surgery and all-cause mortality was also more frequent in the control group (65% vs. 30%; p = 0.005). Catheter ablation (odds ratio [OR] 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.17-17.37]; p = 0.04) and AF type (OR 1.46; 95% CI [1.05-82.64]; p < 0.001) were the only independent predictors of SR at 1-year. Noninvasive mapping in the combined group showed that the number of simultaneous rotors (OR 2.10; 95% CI [1.41-10.2]; p = 0.04) was the only independent predictor of AF.
CONCLUSION: A combined procedure of AF ablation and PBMC significantly increased the proportion of patients in sinus rhythm at 1-year. Noninvasive mapping may help to improve AF characterization and guide personalized AF treatment.
