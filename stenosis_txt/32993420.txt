Title: The novel use of the Haemodialysis reliable outflow graft (HeRo速) in intestinal failure patients with end-stage vascular access.

Abstract: Intestinal failure (IF) patients are dependent on central venous access to receive parenteral nutrition. Longstanding central venous catheters are associated with life-threatening complications including infections and thromboses resulting in multiple line exchanges and the development ofprogressive central venous stenosis or occlusion. The Haemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) graft is an arterio-venous device that has been successfully used in haemodialysis patients with 'end-stage vascular access'. We describe a case series of HeRO graft use in patients with IF and end-stage vascular access. Four HeRO grafts were inserted into IF patients with end-stage vascular access to facilitate or support intestinal transplantation. In all patients the HeRO facilitated immediate vascular access, supporting different combinations of parenteral nutrition, intravenous medications, fluids or renal replacement therapy with no bloodstream infections. In a highly complex group of IF patients with central venous stenosis/occlusion limiting conventional venous access or at risk of life-threatening catheter-related complications, a HeRO速 graft can be a feasible alternative.
