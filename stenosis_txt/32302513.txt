Title: Laparoscopic-Assisted Anorectal Pull-Through for Currarino Syndrome.

Abstract: Objective: Currarino syndrome (CS) is characterized by the triad of sacral anomalies, presacral tumor, and anorectal malformation (ARM). This study evaluates the feasibility and outcomes of laparoscopic-assisted anorectal pull-through (LAARP) for CS. Materials and Methods: Children admitted for primary or redo repair of CS through LAARP between 2016 and 2019 were reviewed. The indication of redo included constipation with megarectosigmoid, residual presacral mass, anastomosis leak, and secondary fistula. ARM was corrected by excision of rectal stenosis, fistula, and its associated megarectosigmoid. This was followed by a complete surgical resection of the presacral tumor, with subsequent pull-through and anocolic anastomosis. This was done with a combined laparoscopic and transanal approach. The detailed surgical techniques, early postoperative complications, and mid-term functional outcomes were summarized. Results: Fourteen patients underwent LAARP for primary (N = 4) and redo (N = 10) repair of CS. Four of them had colostomy previously. Mean age at operation was 20.7 ± 13.9 months. Mean operative time was 120 ± 25 minutes. Median hospital stay was 8 days (range 7-9 days) postoperatively. None of the patients developed early postoperative complications such as anastomotic leaks, presacral abscesses, recurrent fistulas, and residual mass. Bowel function was assessed 1 year after LAARP in 10 patients. Mean follow-up time was 15.9 months. The frequency of bowel movements was 3.3 ± 1.5/day. Constipation occurred in 2 patients. Occasional soiling (&lt;3 times/week) was reported in 4 patients and frequent soiling (&gt;3 times/week) was in 1. Conclusion: LAARP for CS is safe and effective.
