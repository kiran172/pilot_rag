Title: [Prevention and management of stoma-related complications after surgery for low rectal cancer].

Abstract: The related technology of enterostomy is a professional skill that colorectal surgeons need to master, and it is clinically important to prevent the occurrence of enterostomy-related complications of low rectal cancer. The early complications of enterostomy include stoma retraction, stoma ischemic necrosis, stoma edema and peripheral dermatitis, and the long-term complications include parastomal hernia, stenosis and stoma prolapse. In addition, the rare or easily neglected stoma cancer, difficulty of stoma closure and following social psychological disorders should also be paid attention to by surgeons. Effective reduction of enterostomy complications can lead to better quality of life for patients, which is the best interpretation of the concept of "patient-centered ness" by colorectal surgeons.
