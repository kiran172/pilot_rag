Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of percutaneous endoscopic foraminoplasty for simple lumbar spinal lateral exit zone stenosis.
METHODS: A total of 36 patients with simple lumbar spinal lateral exit zone stenosis were admitted to our hospital from January 2013 to June 2018, and received selective nerve root canal radiography and radicular block. According to the symptoms and patients' personal wills, 22 cases underwent the one-stage percutaneous foraminal surgery(the one-stage operation group), and the other 14 patients were re-admitted to the hospital for operation(the delayed operation group) because of the recurrence of symptoms after discharge. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to evaluate the clinical effects before therapy, 1 day after the radicular block, and 1 day, 3 months and 6 months after the operation.
RESULTS: VAS and ODI of all 36 cases were obviously improved (P&lt;0.05) at various stages after the surgery and maintained well and showed a continuous downward trend. The VAS at 6 months after the operation was improved significantly compared with that at 1 day after the operation (P&lt;0.05).When comparing the postoperative ODI between 1 day and 3 months after the surgery, 1 day and 6 months after the surgery, 3 months and 6 months after the surgery, the differences were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). The VAS and ODI of the one-stage operation group at 1 day after radicular block were better than those of delayed operation group. The VAS and ODI of delayed operation group before readmission were significantly higher than those at 1 day after radicular block. There were no significant differences in VAS and ODI at each stage after operation between two groups(P&gt;0.05), but when compared with its own pretherapy andbefore readmission results, the difference was significant (P&lt;0.05). There was no nerve injury in all cases. Only 2 cases were presented with the outlet root stimulation symptoms, and the symptoms relieved after short term conservative treatment.
CONCLUSION: The clinical effects of radicular block may be unsustainable for patients with simple lumbar spinal lateral exit zone stenosis. Instead, percutaneous endoscopic foraminoplasty was simple, safe and effective.
