Title: Autologous platelet gel improves outcomes in tubularized incised plate repair of hypospadias.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: hypospadias is one of the most widespread male congenital anomalies, occurring in 1:250 to 1:300 live births. Several repair techniques have been developing to improve the outcomes.
PURPOSE: a randomized prospective controlled study was adopted to evaluate effectiveness of autologous platelet gel in healing promotion and improving the outcomes of hypospadias repair.
METHODS: thirty children who aged between 6 months and 12 years were recruited and subdivided into two groups; group A had tubularized incised plate (TIP) repair with autologous platelet gel application and group B had TIP repair without autologous platelet gel.
RESULTS: there was no significant difference in duration of operation between both groups. All patients in groups A and B had slit-like meatus shape in the distal glans. While all those of group A had one urine stream, yet only 11 of group B had one. There were complications that happened exclusively in group B such as spray stream (27%) and fistula (20%). Whereas other complications occurred insignificantly more in group B than in A including meatal stenosis (53 versus 27%), glans dehiscence, (20 versus 7%), bleeding (33 versus 13%), infection (33 versus 27%), edema (27% versus13), respectively. The incidence of skin necrosis was equal in both groups.
CONCLUSION: autologous platelet gel usage in TIP hypospadias repair can be a reliable technique to promote wound healing, and to limit of postoperative surgical complications.
