Title: Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement With Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.

Abstract: We aimed to compare the outcomes of combined surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to concurrent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a large U.S. population sample. The National Inpatient Sample was queried for all patients diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis who underwent SAVR with CABG or TAVR with PCI during the years 2016 to 2017. Study outcomes included all-cause in-hospital mortality, acute stroke, pacemaker insertion, vascular complications, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, sepsis, non-home discharge, length of stay and cost. Outcomes of hospitalization were modeled using logistic regression for binary outcomes and generalized linear models for continuous outcomes. Overall, 31,205 patients were included (TAVR + PCI = 2,185, SAVR + CABG = 29,020). In reference to SAVR + CABG, recipients of TAVR + PCI were older with mean age 82 versus 73 years, effect size (d) = 0.9, had higher proportions of females 47.6% versus 26.6%, d = 0.4 and higher prevalence of congestive heart failure and chronic renal failure. On multivariable analysis, TAVR + PCI was associated with lowers odds for mortality adjusted OR: 0.32 (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.62) p = 0.001, lower odds for acute kidney injury, sepsis, non-home discharge, shorter length of stay and higher odds for vascular complications, need for pacemaker insertion and higher cost. The occurrence of stroke was similar between both groups. In conclusion, results from real-world observational data shows less rates of mortality and periprocedural complications in TAVR + PCI compared to SAVR + CABG.
