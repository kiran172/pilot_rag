Title: The safety and efficacy of staged angioplasty for treating carotid stenosis with a high risk of hyperperfusion: A single-center retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) following carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a rare but life-threatening complication. Staged angioplasty (SAP) is an alternative method that prevents HPS by preventing a sudden increase in cerebral blood flow. In this study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of SAP.
METHODS: A total of 114 patients with carotid stenosis underwent CAS treatment in our hospital between September 2014 and September 2019. Patients with severe stenosis and poor collateral circulation shown on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and hypoperfusion of the ipsilateral diseased blood vessel shown on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging were subjected to SAP treatment (the SAP group), and other patients received regular CAS treatment (the RS group).
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (19.3%) with a high risk of HPS underwent SAP treatment, 1 of whom had carotid dissection after stage I balloon angioplasty and underwent regular CAS. This patient had HPS after surgery. None of the other patients in either group had HPS. One patient in the SAP group (4.5%) had hyperperfusion phenomenon (HPP) after stage II stenting, and 2 patients in the RS group (2.2%) had HPP. One patient in the SAP group (4.5%) and 4 patients in the RS group (4.3%) had symptomatic ischemic complications postoperatively. None of the differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant. Three patients had reduced modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 days after discharge.
CONCLUSION: This research suggests that SAP appears to be an effective method to prevent HPS for patients with a high risk of HPS.
