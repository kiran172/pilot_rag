Title: Propensity-Matched Outcomes of Transcarotid Artery Revascularization Versus Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) with cerebral flow reversal is an emerging treatment option for carotid artery stenosis in patients with high risk for traditional endarterectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare real-world, procedure-related outcomes in similarly comorbid patients undergoing TCAR or carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients receiving either TCAR or CEA outside of clinical trial regulations at our institution was performed. Participants were propensity-matched by age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, presence of restenosis, history of neck radiation, presence of contralateral carotid occlusion, history of previous neck dissection, and symptom status. Bivariate analysis was followed by a penalized Firth logistic regression to compare treatments.
RESULTS: Between January 2011 and July 2018, 342 CEAs and 109 TCARs were captured for analysis. After matching, 87 distinct treatment pairs were created without evidence of variation in any of the prespecified variables. On multivariate analysis using maximum and penalized likelihood ratios, we found that TCAR was associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative hypertension (adjusted coefficient, 1.41; 95% confidence interval [0.53, 2.29], P < 0.01). TCAR was also associated with decreased reverse flow/clamp time (mins; -36.80; [-45.47, -27.93], P < 0.01) and estimated blood loss (mLs; -63.66; [-85.91, -41.42], P < 0.01). In the perioperative period, there were no differences between TCAR and CEA with respect to myocardial infarction (-0.04; [-3.68, 3.60], P = 0.98), stroke (-0.74; [-2.68, 1.19], P = 0.45), and all-cause mortality (1.09; [-1.76, 3.94], P = 0.11). Similarly, a composite incidence of stroke/death was the same between cohorts (2.42; [-0.57, 5.41], P = 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: This propensity-matched analysis of carotid artery revascularization modalities suggests that TCAR is equivalent to CEA in the perioperative period while incurring shorter operative time and less blood loss.
