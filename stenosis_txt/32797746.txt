Title: US-guided vascular access and left ventricular rapid pacing in TAVR: Two simple points that may improve patients' outcomes.

Abstract: The use of US-guided vascular access and left ventricular rapid pacing could significantly reduce TAVR-related complications. This study suggests simple tricks to keep the procedure safer. Further multicenter studies are needed to confirm the present data.
