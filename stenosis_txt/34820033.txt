Title: Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of cerebral small vessel disease intensification in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of the neuroradiological indices of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 34 patients (age 60-90 years, 17 women and 17 men) with severe AS and 50 healthy controls (age 61-85 years, 29 women and 21 men) underwent MRI brain examinations, which were analysed for the neuroradiological indices of CSVD: hyperintensities in periventricular white matter (PVWM) and deep white matter (DWM), enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS), lacunar strokes, and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs).
RESULTS: PVWM hyperintensities were found in 46% of volunteers and was significantly lower (p = 0.027), corresponding to AS patients (80%), the density of lesions was higher in the AS group than in controls (p = 0.019). DWM hyperintensities were found more often in AS patients (76%) than in controls (66%) (p = 0.303), but the densities were similar in both groups. Lacunar strokes were found in 35% of AS patients and 16% of controls (p = 0.042). The average number of lacunar strokes per person was 0.9 in the AS group and 0.3 in the controls (p = 0.035). The AS group showed higher variance in the number of strokes: SD = 1.96 vs. SD = 1.06 in controls. Both prevalence and density of the ePVS and CMBs did not differ significantly between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuroradiological indices of the vascular disease do not provide an unequivocal clue to the pathogenesis of CSVD in patients with severe AS. Most observations imply that CSVD is primarily a consequence of cerebral hypoperfusion caused by AS.
