Title: Outcomes of ileal conduit urinary diversion in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Abstract: AIM: The objective of this study was to report the long-term outcomes and complications of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who underwent noncontinent urinary diversion to treat lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study included all adult patients with MS who underwent an ileal conduit urinary diversion between 2000 and 2015. Early postoperative complications were reported as well as long-term complications, reoperation rates, and renal function.
RESULTS: Overall, 91 patients were included. The surgery was indicated for refractory urinary incontinence (n = 73), renal failure (n = 8), major perineal skin ulcer due to urinary incontinence (n = 6), and recurrent urinary tract infections (n = 4). The median follow-up was 50 months (range, 3-158 months). A significant reduction (P < .05) of postoperative nonobstructive pyelonephritis rate was observed. There was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative renal function (P = .32). Early postoperative complications were reported in 24 patients (26%): 4 Clavien I, 6 Clavien II, 9 Clavien III, 4 Clavien IV, and 1 Clavien V. Nine patients required reoperation for these complications (9.9%). Late complications were reported in 28 patients (30.8%): 8 ureteral anastomosis stenosis, 2 stoma stenosis, 2 incisional hernias, 6 kidney or ureteral lithiasis, and 10 pyelonephritis. Among them, 15 patients (16.5%) required reoperation for late complications.
CONCLUSION: Noncontinent urinary diversion using ileal conduit appears to be an effective end-stage solution in MS patients. The perioperative morbidity rate of 26% and the late complication rate of 31% should be considered to better inform patients before the surgery.
