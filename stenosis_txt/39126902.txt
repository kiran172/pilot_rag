Title: [Local versus locoregional anesthesia in transfemoral TAVI procedures].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the treatment of choice for the most fragile patients with severe aortic stenosis. The transfemoral route is preferred as the simplest and safest. The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy, tolerance and safety of local vs. locoregional anesthesia in trans-femoral TAVI procedures.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: This was a single-center retrospective study. Patients treated with femoral TAVI between February 25 and November 15, 2022 at the University Hospital of Reims were included, and two groups (local and locoregional anesthesia) were compared.
RESULTS: TAVI success rate (92.9%), death rate (3.0%) and procedure duration (90.5 ± 13.5 minutes) did not differ between groups (p = 0.18, 0.15 and 0.55 respectively). For intra- and post-procedural treatments, the use of sedation, analgesics and benzodiazepines did not differ between groups. The cumulative dose of Remifentanil used per-procedure was lower in the local anesthesia group than in the locoregional anesthesia group (148.6 ± 71.9 mcg vs. 208.9 ± 110.0 mcg; p = 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: In this non-randomized retrospective study, local and locoregional anesthesia had comparable safety and efficacy in transfemoral TAVI procedures. In a constrained context and with a view to simplification, these results encourage transfemoral TAVIs to be performed under local anaesthesia, and to consider a "PCI-like" approach, without the presence of an anaesthetist, for selected patients without respiratory, musculoskeletal or agitation disorders, or vascular approach difficulties.
