Title: Human Aortic Stenotic Valve-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Induce Endothelial Dysfunction and Thrombogenicity Through AT1R/NADPH Oxidases/SGLT2 Pro-Oxidant Pathway.

Abstract: Pathological tissues release a variety of factors, including extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed by activated or apoptotic cells. EVs trapped within the native pathological valves may act as key mediators of valve thrombosis. Human aortic stenosis EVs promote activation of valvular endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction, and proadhesive and procoagulant responses.
