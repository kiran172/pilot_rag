Title: [Perpetuation of defunctioning stoma: risk factors and countermeasures].

Abstract: Defunctioning stoma is an effective method to reduce symptomatic anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer surgery. It is of concern that about 1 in 5 defunctioning stomas will not be restored, that is, becoming permanent. And that is usually beyond expectation by physicians and patients, which deserves enough attention. The causes are complex, including anastomotic complications, tumor progression, perioperative death, poor anal function and patient willingness. Possible risk factors include symptomatic anastomotic leakage, age, tumor location, neoadjuvant therapy, anal function, TNM stage, ASA score, hospital factors, etc. Those factors may occur in various stages of patient referral such as before neoadjuvant therapy, prior to surgery, intra or post-operative period, and follow-up. Adequate physician-patient communication and shared decision-making, comprehensive tumor and patient function assessment, rational treatment strategy, careful manipulation during operation and good quality control, and meticulous perioperative management are important steps to reduce the permanent stoma. When shared decision-making, patients' needs should be fully considered while unnecessary expectations of anal preservation should be avoided. The risk of perpetuation of defunctioning stoma should be fully informed. Safe operation, especially anastomosis, is the key to avoid permanent stoma. And attention should be paid to the early detection and intervention of postoperative anastomotic stenosis.
