Title: Endovascular Treatment Outcome and CT Angiography Findings in Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion with and without Underlying Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) in acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) with and without underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) and to investigate the usefulness of preprocedural CT angiography findings in the diagnosis of ICAS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients who received IAT for acute BAO between September 2014 and March 2019 were included. Additional therapies such as angioplasty, stent placement, and tirofiban infusion were provided while treating ICAS. Clinical and angiographic results of treatment were recorded. Preprocedural CT angiography findings in ICAS and non-ICAS groups were compared to assess (i) basilar tip opacification, (ii) partial occlusion, (iii) presence of convex border, (iv) occlusion segment longer than two thirds of the basilar artery or 20 mm, (v) dense basilar artery, and (vi) wall calcification in the occluded segment.
RESULTS: Among the 20 patients (mean age, 71.3 y; mean stroke score, 24.8), optimal recanalization was achieved in 19 (95%). Three patients had good clinical outcomes. There were 6 patients with underlying ICAS. No difference was observed between ICAS and non-ICAS groups in terms of optimal angiographic recanalization and good outcome. On CT angiography, basilar tip occlusion (100% vs 29%), partial occlusion (100% vs 83%), and long occlusion length (100% vs 14%) significantly differed between the groups (P â‰¤ .01).
CONCLUSIONS: In acute BAO, underlying ICAS does not affect optimal recanalization rate or clinical outcome. Preprocedural CT angiography is a potentially useful tool to detect it.
