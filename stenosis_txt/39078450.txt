Title: Safety and Efficacy of Barbed Sutures Compared to Non-barbed Sutures in Bariatric Surgery: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Mastering intracorporeal suturing is challenging in the evolution from conventional to laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Among various techniques competing for superiority in overcoming this hurdle, we focus on exploring the potential of barbed sutures through a meta-analysis that compares outcomes to those of conventional non-barbed sutures in bariatric surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase to identify studies comparing barbed sutures with non-barbed sutures in bariatric surgeries, focusing on outcomes such as operative time, suturing time, postoperative complications, and hospital stay. The statistical analysis was carried out using RStudio version 4.3.2. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q test and I2 statistics.
RESULTS: Incorporating data from 11 studies involving a total of 27,442 patients, including 3,516 in the barbed suture group across various bariatric surgeries, our analysis demonstrates a significant reduction in suturing time (mean difference -4.87; 95% CI -8.43 to -1.30; p &lt; 0.01; I2 = 99%) associated with the use of barbed sutures. Specifically, in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, we observed a significant decrease in operative time (mean difference -12.11; 95% CI -19.27 to -4.95; p &lt; 0.01; I2 = 93%). Subgroup analyses and leave-one-out analyses consistently supported these findings. Furthermore, we found that the mean body mass index did not significantly predict the mean difference in operative time outcome. No significant differences emerged in hospital stay or postoperative complications, including leak, bleeding, stenosis, and bowel obstruction (p &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our study findings address barbed sutures as a potential alternative for laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing in bariatric surgery.
