Title: ANCA-negative granulomatosis polyangiitis: an airway emergency.

Abstract: Granulomatosis polyangiitis (GPA) is an autoimmune condition causing inflammation of small blood vessels. It is a rare disorder that may affect various parts of the body. The diagnosis is often based on clinical examination, laboratory investigations and tissue biopsy. In about 10-20% of patients, the anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) can be negative, and histology maybe inconclusive, which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Failure to treat vasculitis can lead to morbidity and even mortality. We present a case report of a gentleman who was presented with an airway emergency with inflammation of the nasal cavity and subglottic involvement amounting to airway stenosis. His ANCA was negative and tissue biopsy from the subglottis was inconclusive. He underwent urgent dilatation of his airway, local therapies to the nose and was commenced on 10 cycles of cyclophosphamide. A follow-up of over 4 years has not shown any relapse of his disease clinically or biochemically. We discuss the clinical findings, diagnostic dilemma and multidisciplinary management of this life-threatening condition.
