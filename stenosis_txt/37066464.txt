Title: [A Case of Gastric Submucosal Tumor at Esophagogastric Junction Resected by Endoscopic Intragastric Surgery].

Abstract: We report a case in which a gastric submucosal tumor at the esophagogastric junction was resected by endoscopic intragastric surgery with minimally invasive and function-preserving. A 30s-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal findings pointed by a barium examination at a health check up. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound revealed a submucosal tumor approximately 60 mm in size on the posterior wall of the gastric fundus. Endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration was carried out and pathological result was a leiomyoma. The tumor was an intraluminal and extraluminal growth extending from the dorsal esophagus to the cardiac region, but considering the patient's young age, we decided to perform endoscopic intragastric surgery to preserve the function of stomach. A 30 mm median incision was made above the umbilicus, and the anterior wall of the gastric body was incised and the intragastric surgery was started using the double protector method. The mucosal surface of the tumor was located at the fundus, but the tumor developed into the dorsal aspect of the lower esophageal muscle layer. The tumor was carefully dissected and resected by intragastric manipulation. Postoperative oral contrast examination revealed no obvious stenosis, and gastric peristalsis was normal.
