Title: Standard Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: The introduction of the transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure has revolutionized the standards of care in patients with aortic valve pathologies and has significantly increased the quality of the medical treatment provided. The durability and constant technical improvements in the modern transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure have broadened the indications towards younger patient groups with low-risk profiles. Therefore, transcatheter aortic valve implantation now represents an effective alternative for surgical aortic valve replacement in a large number of cases. Currently, various technical methods for the transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure are available. The contemporary transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure focuses on optimization of postoperative results and reduction of complications such as paravalvular leakage and permanent pacemaker implantation. Another goal of transcatheter aortic valve implantation is the achievement of a valid lifetime concept with secure coronary access and conditions for future valve-in-valve interventions.Â  In this case report, we demonstrate a standard transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure with a self-expandable supra-annular device, one of the most commonly performed methods.
