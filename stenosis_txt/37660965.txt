Title: Evolving Concept of Aortic Valve Replacement in Asymptomatic Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) has been gaining attention ever since the results of the Early Surgery Versus Conventional Treatment in Very Severe Aortic Stenosis (RECOVERY) and Aortic Valve replacement versus conservative treatment in Asymptomatic seveRe aortic stenosis (AVATAR) trials showed survival benefits with early surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). This study analyzed the long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of SAVR in asymptomatic severe AS.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2020, 272 patients with asymptomatic severe AS and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50% underwent SAVR with or without concomitant aortic surgery and met the study criteria. The median follow-up was 8.5 years (interquartile range, 6-12.8 years), for a total of 2584 patient-years. The time course of the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and the average E/E' (ratio of the Doppler-derived E wave to the tissue Doppler-derived E' wave) were assessed using 594 postoperative echocardiograms. The association of preoperative LVMI and average E/E' with survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazards.
RESULTS: There was no operative mortality. On longitudinal analyses, LVMI improved in patients who presented with moderate or severe preoperative left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, after the early decline in average E/E', there was a late increase to greater than upper limit normal, particularly in patients with a preoperative average E/E'≥14. Postoperative survival was 100%, 94%, 84%, and 76% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, comparable to age- and sex-matched expected survival on the basis of the US general population. On adjusted Cox survival analysis, only moderate to severe LVH was associated with a survival penalty (hazard ratio], 2.32; 95% CI, 1.02-5.27; P = .045).
CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic patients with AS, SAVR restores survival and improves LVH, but patients with diastolic dysfunction are left with persistent dysfunction. Presentation with moderate or severe LVH at the time of surgery translated to a survival penalty. This observational study supports early SAVR in this population before development of LVH, although further investigation is needed.
