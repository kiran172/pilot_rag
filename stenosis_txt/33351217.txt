Title: Amplatzer device closure of femoral pseudoaneurysm after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: An alternative to surgical repair.

Abstract: Iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysm is an infrequent but troublesome complication of vascular access during transcatheter aortic valve implantation. There are non-invasive, percutaneous and surgical treatment options for management of this complication. This case series report demonstrates a novel technique using an Amplatzer Duct Occluder II closure device to successfully treat iatrogenic common femoral pseudoaneurysm following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
