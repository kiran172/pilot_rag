Title: Horner's Syndrome After Anterior Decompression and Fusion for Cervical Spine Pathologies: Report of Two Cases.

Abstract: Horner's syndrome is caused by impairment of the sympathetic trunk, resulting in associated ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. The cervical sympathetic trunk is sometimes damaged during an anterior approach to the lower cervical spine. We report two cases of Horner's syndrome after anterior decompression and fusion for lower cervical spine pathologies. Case 1 was in a 58-year-old woman with a herniated C5-6 intervertebral disc presenting myelopathy who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion of C5-6. After the operation, miosisÂ and anhidrosis of the right face occurred, and the symptoms continued for more than 15 years. Case 2 was in a 40-year-old woman whose diagnosis was flexion myelopathy with kyphosis at C5-6 and canal stenosis, so she underwent anterior cervical C5-6 discectomy and fusion of C5-6. Immediately after surgery, ptosis and miosis occurred, which lasted for four months. Horner's syndrome tends to occur during anterior cervical spine procedures, especially at the lower level, and the syndrome may be transient or irreversible. During an anterior approach to the lower cervical spine, taking care not to damage the sympathetic trunk is important to avoid this complication.
