Title: Systematic review and meta-analysis of ureteral stent for risk factors of restenosis after laparoscopic pyeloplasty.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) has been widely used to treat ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO); however, no previous series of reports has focused on analyzing the factors that influence the complications and outcomes of LP. In this study, we analyzed the risk factors related to complications of LP, especially that of restenosis. The aim of this study is to perform meta-analysis of relevant comparative studies to analyze the risk factors of restenosis after LP treatment with ureteral stent as of 30 April 2021.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in April 2021. The evaluation results included operation time (OT), intraoperative blood loss (IBL), anastomotic tension (AT), postoperative drainage (PD), and ectopic blood vessels (EBV). Relative risk (RR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) were extrapolated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analysis was performed based on research design and technology.
RESULTS: After screening, 7 studies were included, incorporating a total of 979 patients with PUJO treated by LP. Analysis revealed the likelihood of risk factors as follows: OT [mean difference (MD) -3.16, 95% CI: -7.18 to 0.85; P=0.12], IBL (MD -3.16, 95% CI: -7.18 to 0.85; P=0.12), AT (RR 3.86, 95% CI: 2.96 to 5.02; P<0.00001), PD (MD 303.97, 95% CI: 219.49 to 388.44; P<0.00001), and EBV (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.68; P=0.49). The results indicated that high AT and increased PD are risk factors for postoperative ureteral restenosis.
DISCUSSION: The results of the meta-analysis showed that among the factors related to the efficacy of LP in the treatment of ureteral stenosis, OT, IBL, AT, and EBV were not significantly correlated with postoperative restenosis. However, AT and PD are independent risk factors for postoperative restenosis of the ureter. Therefore, during the operation, the AT should be reduced, and the local injury is reduced to reduce the PD, thereby reducing the risk of restenosis.
