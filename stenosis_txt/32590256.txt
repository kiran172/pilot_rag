Title: Auricular suppurative perichondritis secondary to exclusive endoscopic ear surgery for tympanoplasty: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: Endoscope is an innovative method for otologists in middle ear surgery. Many previous studies have confirmed the safety and efficiency of the endoscopic technique, as a reliable therapeutic option with very low complication rates, clearly supporting the use of endoscopy in ear surgery. Auricular suppurative perichondritis secondary to exclusive endoscopic ear surgery for tympanoplasty is an extremely rare type of those without any previously reported cases. In this report, we describe the course of auricular suppurative perichondritis of a 55-year-old woman. The patient was ultimately healed through surgical debridement and postoperative dressing with no evidence of recurrence at two months follow-up. There were no auricle deformity or external auditory canal stenosis with six months following-up.
