Title: Surgical Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Explantation Technique.

Abstract: As transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) indications expand, cardiac surgeons need to be prepared to manage heretofore rare TAVR complications requiring explantation, such as acute type A dissection, in these typically high-risk patients. This report describes the successful use of an explantation technique that is ready to hand, efficient, and effective at avoiding further injury to the aortic root and coronary ostia.
