Title: Acute valvular emergencies.

Abstract: Acute valvular emergencies represent an important cause of cardiogenic shock. However, their clinical presentation and initial diagnostic testing are often non-specific, resulting in delayed diagnosis. Moreover, metabolic disarray or haemodynamic instability may result in too great a risk for emergent surgery. This review will focus on the aetiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and treatment options for patients presenting with native acute left-sided valvular emergencies. In addition to surgery, options for medical therapy, mechanical circulatory support, and novel percutaneous interventions are discussed.
