Title: Bespoke valve sizing avoids annular rupture in patients treated with a balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Annular and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) calcification increase the risk of annular rupture following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The outcomes of a strategy of routine use of a balloon-expandable valve (BEV) for all patients irrespective of annular or LVOT calcium is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the impact of bespoke sizing on annular rupture in patients treated with a BEV.
METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing TAVR at a single centre (February 2020-February 2022) were treated only with a BEV. No other valve design was used. Annular/LVOT calcification was assessed using a standardized grading system. For each annular area, we determined the percentage valve oversizing with nominal deployment. The balloon deployment volume was then adjusted when required (over-/underfilled) to achieve over-sizing of approximately 5% in the presence of annular/LVOT calcium and 5%-10% in the absence of annular/LVOT calcium. Adjusted valve areas were assumed to change proportionately to the change in balloon deployment volume.
RESULTS: Among 533 TAVR treated patients, annular/LVOT calcification was present in 166 (31.1%) and moderate or severe in 90 (16.9%). In patients with annular/LVOT calcification, the adjusted oversizing was 3.5 ± 3.6% and in patients without annular/LVOT calcification, the adjusted oversizing was 6.8 ± 4.7% (p &lt; 0.001). There were no cases of annular rupture and no cases with more than mild paravalvular leak (PVL). Mild PVL was more frequent in patients with annular/LVOT calcium (10.8% vs 4.6%, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Bespoke BEV sizing by adjustment of balloon deployment volume avoided annular rupture in patients undergoing TAVR.
