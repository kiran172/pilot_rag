Title: Novel strategy using a spiral embedded flap for meatal stenosis after post-penile cancer amputation surgery: a single-center experience.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the curative effect of spiral embedded flap urethroplasty for the treatment of meatal stenosis after penile carcinoma surgery. From January 2015 to January 2021, we used our technique to treat strictures of the external urethral orifice in seven patients, including four cases of meatal stenosis after partial penile resection and three cases of meatal stenosis after perineal stoma. All patients had previously undergone repeat urethral dilatation. The patients underwent spiral embedded flap urethroplasty to enlarge the outer urethral opening. The patients' mean age at the time of surgery was 60 (range: 42-71) years, the mean operative time was 43 min, and the median follow-up period was 18 months. The patients voided well post-operatively, and urinary peak flow rates ranged from 18.3 ml s-1 to 30.4 ml s-1. All patients were successful with absence of urethral meatus stricture. The present study showed that using spiral embedded flap urethroplasty to treat meatal stenosis after penile carcinoma surgery is an effective surgical technique with good long-term outcomes.
