Title: [3D-modelling and 3D-printing in diagnosis and treatment of common bile duct stricture].

Abstract: An example of the use of 3D-modeling of 3D-printing in the diagnosis and choice of a surgical approach for the treatment of hepaticocholedochal stricture is given. The inclusion of meglumine sodium succinate (intravenous drip, once a day, 500 ml, course of 10 days) into the therapy regimen was substantiated, which contributed to the reduction of intoxication syndrome due to its antihypoxic mechanism of action and, as a result, to a reduction in the duration of hospitalization and an increase in the quality of life of the patient.
