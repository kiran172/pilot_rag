Title: Percutaneous Transhepatic Treatment of Benign Bile Duct Strictures Using Retrievable Covered Stents: Long-Term Outcomes in 148 Patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term outcomes of percutaneous treatment of benign biliary strictures using temporary placement of a retrievable expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) covered stent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 148 patients (84 male and 64 female; age range, 11-92 years) who underwent percutaneous transhepatic placement and removal of a retrievable PTFE-covered stent for the treatment of benign biliary strictures between March 2007 and August 2019 through long-term follow-up. Ninety-two patients had treatment-na√Øve strictures and 56 had recurrent/refractory strictures.
RESULTS: Stent placement was technically successful in all 148 patients. The mean indwelling period of the stent was 2.4 months (median period, 2.3 months; range, 0.2-7.7 months). Stent migration, either early or late, occurred in 28 (18.9%) patients. Clinical success, defined as resolution of stricture after completing stent placement and removal, was achieved in 94.2% (131 of 139 patients). The overall complication rate was 15.5% (23 of 148 patients). During the mean follow-up of 60.2 months (median period, 52.7 months; range, 1.6-146.1 months), 37 patients had a recurrence of clinically significant strictures at 0.5-124.5 months after removal of biliary stent and catheter (median, 16.1 months). The primary patency rates at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years after removal of biliary stent and catheter were 88.2%, 70.0%, 66.2%, 60.5%, and 54.5%, respectively. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, sex, age, underlying disease, relation to surgery, stricture type, biliary stones, history of previous treatment, and stricture site were not significantly associated with the primary patency.
CONCLUSION: Long-term outcomes suggest that percutaneous treatment of benign biliary strictures using temporary placement of retrievable PTFE-covered stents may be a clinically effective method.
