Title: Feasibility and Outcomes of Tubular Decompression in Extreme Stenosis.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVES: To report the feasibility, nuances, technical tips as well as outcomes of managing single-level grade D (extreme stenosis) and to compare the outcomes with nonextreme stenosis using the tubular retractor system.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive decompression in extreme stenosis is a challenge due to technical difficulty, feasibility of adequate decompression, and a steep learning curve.
METHODS: Consecutive patients from January 2007 to January 2017 presenting with neurogenic claudication secondary to single-level spinal stenosis operated using tubular retractors were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups; extreme-stenosis and nonextreme stenosis. The outcomes of surgery were evaluated and compared using visual analogue score (VAS) for leg and back pain, Oswestry disability index (ODI), and MacNab's criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 325 patients (out of 446 patients after excluding the multilevel cases) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One hundred forty patients were cases of extreme stenosis and 185 were nonextreme stenosis. The mean VAS for back and leg pain for extreme stenosis improved from 3.23 ± 1.30 to 2.15 ± 0.91 and 7.33 ± 0.78 to 1.66 ± 1.03 respectively as compared with nonextreme stenosis where the mean VAS for back and leg pain improved from 3.01 ± 1.15 to 1.86 ± 1.10 and 6.57 ± 1.00 to 1.54 ± 1.12 respectively. The mean ODI changed from 66.47 ± 7.53 to 19.95 ± 2.90 in extreme stenosis as compared with nonextreme stenosis where mean ODI changed from 59.05 ± 5.08 to 19.88 ± 2.67. As per MacNab's criteria 102 (of 120 patients) and 139 (of 157 patients) reported excellent and good outcomes in extreme and nonextreme stenosis respectively.
CONCLUSION: Tubular decompression is feasible in patients with extreme-stenosis with no difference in the outcomes as well as complication rates when compared with a cohort of nonextreme stenosis.
