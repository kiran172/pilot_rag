Title: Urethral diverticulum with stone formation in an adult male after hypospadias repair: A case presentation.

Abstract: Long-term complications of hypospadias surgery can lead to urethral diverticula, causing issues like stone formation, incomplete voiding, and infections. We present a case: a 45-year-old male, who underwent two-stage penile hypospadias repair at age three, now experiencing lower urinary obstruction symptoms. Urethroscopy revealed urethral stenosis and stone formation within the diverticulum. After successful stone removal without diverticulum excision, a urethrotomy was performed. Early stricture detection post-hypospadias repair, through routine calibration, is vital for efficient treatment. Urethral diverticulum with stone formation in adult males post-hypospadias surgery is rare. Efficient management typically involves stone removal and a simple urethrotomy, minimizing surgical interventions.
