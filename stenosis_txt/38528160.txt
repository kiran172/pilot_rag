Title: Diagnostic and prognostic significance of miR-486-5p in patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinical value of microRNA miR-486-5p in diagnosing lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patients and predicting the clinical outcomes after minimally invasive spinal surgery (MISS) in LSS patients, and the correlation of miR-486-5p with inflammatory responses in LSS patients.
METHODS: This study included 52 LSS patients, 46 patients with lumbar intervertebral disk herniation (LDH) and 42 healthy controls. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR was used to detect miR-486-5p expression. The ability of miR-486-5p to discriminate between different groups was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic analysis. The visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores at 6 months postoperatively were used to reflect the clinical outcomes of LSS patients. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the levels of inflammatory factor [interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)]. The correlation of miR-486-5p with continuous variables in LSS patients was evaluated by the Pearson correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Expression of serum miR-486-5p was upregulated in LSS patients and had high diagnostic value to screen LSS patients. In addition, serum miR-486-5p could predict the 6-month clinical outcomes after MISS therapy in LSS patients. Moreover, serum miR-486-5p was found to be positively correlated with the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in patients with LSS.
CONCLUSION: miR-486-5p, increased in LSS patients, can function as an indicator to diagnose LSS and a predictive indicator for the clinical outcomes after MISS therapy in LSS patients. In addition, miR-486-5p may regulate LSS progression by modulating inflammatory responses.
