Title: Isoperistaltic vs antiperistaltic anastomosis after right hemicolectomy: A comprehensive review.

Abstract: To optimize the efficiency of ileocolic anastomosis following right hemicolectomy, several variations of the surgical technique have been tested. These include performing the anastomosis intra- or extracorporeally or performing a stapled or hand-sewn anastomosis. Among the least studied is the configuration of the two stumps (i.e., isoperistaltic or antiperistaltic) in the case of a side-to-side anastomosis. The purpose of the present study is to compare the isoperistaltic and antiperistaltic side-to-side anastomotic configuration after right hemicolectomy by reviewing the relevant literature. High-quality literature is scarce, with only three studies directly comparing the two alternatives, and no study has revealed any significant differences in the incidence of anastomosis-related complications such as leakage, stenosis, or bleeding. However, there may be a trend towards an earlier recovery of intestinal function following antiperistaltic anastomosis. Finally, existing data do not identify a certain anastomotic configuration (i.e., isoperistaltic or antiperistaltic) as superior over the other. Thus, the most appropriate approach is to master both anastomotic techniques and select between the two configurations based on each individual case scenario.
