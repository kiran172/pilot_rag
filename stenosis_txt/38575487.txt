Title: Pediatric Esophageal Dysphagia.

Abstract: Swallowing is an elaborate process that requires neuromuscular coordination. Pediatric esophageal dysphagia is broadly categorized into structural and nonstructural causes. The structural causes of pediatric esophageal dysphagia are related to processes that narrow the lumen of the esophagus. Esophageal strictures are the result of scar tissue formation within the lumen of the esophagus, leading to stenosis. Vascular rings and slings cause external compression of the esophagus. Diagnosis requires an esophagram and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment is guided by the patient's symptoms and underlying diagnosis, although it often requires surgical intervention when symptomatic.
