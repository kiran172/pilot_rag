Title: Successful full-endoscopic decompression surgery under local anesthesia for L5 radiculopathy caused by L5-Sforaminal stenosis and L4-5 lateral recess stenosis : A case report.

Abstract: In this report, we presented a 65 year-old male case having right leg pain due to L5 radiculopathy. Based on the radiological examination including CT, MRI and radiculography, double crash impingement of L5 nerve root due to L4-5 lateral recess and L5-S foraminal stenosis was diagnosed. Because of the strong pain, he could not work anymore. His job was a general manager of big hospital, he needed to return to job as soon as possible. We decided to conduct the full-endoscopic decompression surgery of ventral facetectomy (FEVF) for L4-5 lateral recess stenosis and foraminoplasty (FELF) for L5-S foraminal stenosis. The technique can be done under the local anesthesia with only 8 mm skin incision; thus, it must be the least invasive spine surgery. Soon after the surgery, he could return to the original job as a general manager. In conclusion, the full-endoscopic decompression surgery for the spinal canal stenosis such as FELF and FEVF would be minimally invasive procedure and it enable patients the quick return to the original activity.
