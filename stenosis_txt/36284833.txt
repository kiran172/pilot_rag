Title: Thromboaspiration for Iatrogenic Thrombotic Occlusion of the Superior Mesenteric Artery during Endovascular Treatment of Pancreaticoduodenal Artery Aneurysm and Celiac Artery Occlusion.

Abstract: Herein, we present a case of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) thrombus as a complication of stent placement for celiac stenosis and coil packing of a pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm. The SMA thrombus was likely caused by thromboembolism from the guiding sheath in the SMA without a continuous heparin flush. It was promptly treated with aspiration thrombectomy, and there was no mesenteric ischemia. To avoid thromboembolic complications, periprocedural prophylactic antithrombotic therapy should also have been performed because a complex procedure involving the pull-through technique was performed.
