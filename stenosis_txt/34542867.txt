Title: Characteristics and Outcomes of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment in Intrinsic and Extrinsic Stenosis: A Single-Center Experience in China.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to explore the precipitating factors and evaluate the impact of different stenosis types on treatment outcomes in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and venous sinus stenosis (VSS).
METHODS: We recruited patients with IIH who presented with VSS, either intrinsic or extrinsic. We observed the clinical and laboratory findings, and we then compared the outcomes of stenting and medical treatment in different stenosis types.
RESULTS: Among 145 patients with IIH and VSS, 59 were of the intrinsic type and 86 were of the extrinsic type. Patients in the intrinsic group were older (42 vs. 34 years old, P < 0.001) and presented with higher pre-op gradient pressure (15 mmHg vs. 12 mmHg, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups regarding other precipitating factors (P > 0.05). Stenting was significantly associated with complete resolution of the headache and impaired vision both in intrinsic (adjusted OR 0.017, 95% CI 0.001-0.35, P = 0.011; adjusted OR 0.056, 95% CI 0.004-0.697, P = 0.025, respectively) and extrinsic types of stenosis (adjusted OR 0.072, 95% CI 0.015-0.343, P = 0.001; adjusted OR 0.241, 95% CI 0.062-0.931, P = 0.039, respectively). Meanwhile, stenting was significantly associated with improvement of the papilledema in extrinsic-type stenosis compared with medical treatment (adjusted OR 0.017, 95% CI 0.002-0.135, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Stenting may provide substantial clinical improvement in patients with IIH regardless of intrinsic or extrinsic stenosis type in our patient population, as noted in other series.
