Title: [Importance of comprehensive management of anastomotic site after ultra-low anal sphincter-preservation surgery].

Abstract: Intersphincteric resection (ISR) surgery increases the rate of anal sphincter preservation in patients with ultra-low rectal cancers. However, the anastomotic site of ISR surgery is at risk for structural healing complications such as anastomotic leakage, anastomotic dehiscence, secondary anastomotic stenosis, chronic presacral sinus, rectovaginal fistula, and rectourethral fistula, which can lead to a persistent defunctioning ostomy or a secondary permanent colostomy. This article systematically describes the preoperative high-risk factors and characteristics of anastomotic site structural healing complications after ISR surgery, as well as the management of the anastomotic site during various stages including hospitalization, from discharge to one month after surgery, from one month after surgery to before stoma reversal, and after stoma reversal. This is to provide a clearer understanding of the risks associated with the anastomotic site at different stages of the healing process and to timely detect and actively manage related complications, thereby reducing the rate of permanent colostomy and truly achieving the dual goals of "survival benefit" and "quality of life improvement" in ISR surgery.
