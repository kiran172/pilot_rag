Title: Association of ambient PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> with coronary stenosis measured using selective coronary angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure exerts detrimental effects on cardiovascular health. Evidence on the relation of chronically exposed ambient PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> with coronary stenosis remains lacking. Our aim was to investigate the association of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> with coronary stenosis in patients undergoing coronary angiography.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study consisting of 7513 individuals who underwent coronary angiography in Fujian Province, China, from January 2019 to December 2021. We calculated a modified Gensini score (GS) to represent the degree of stenosis in coronary arteries by selective coronary angiography. We fitted linear regressions and logistic models to assess the association of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> with coronary stenosis. We employed restricted cubic splines to describe the exposure-response curves. We performed mediation analyses to assess the potential mediators.
RESULTS: Long-term ambient PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> (prior three years average) exposure was significantly associated with the GS, with a breakpoint concentration of 47.5 μg/m3 and 25.8 μg/m3 for PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, respectively, above which we found a linear positive exposure-response relationship of ambient PM with GS. Each 10 µg /m3 increase in PM<sub>10</sub> exposure (β: 4.81, 95 % CI: 0.44-9.19) and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure [β: 10.50, 95 % CI: 3.14-17.86] were positively related to the GS. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for each 10 µg/m3 increment in PM<sub>10</sub> exposure on severe coronary stenosis was 1.33 (95 % CI: 1.04-1.76). Correspondingly, the adjusted OR for PM<sub>2.5</sub> was 1.87 (95 % CI: 1.24-2.99). The mediation analysis indicated that the effect of PM<sub>10</sub> on coronary stenosis may be partially mediated through total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and the effect of PM<sub>2.5</sub> may be mediated in part by hemoglobin A1c.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides the first evidence that chronic ambient PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure was associated with coronary stenosis assessed by GS in patients with suspected coronary artery disease and reveals its potential mediators.
