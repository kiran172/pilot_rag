Title: Clinical Impact of Preoperative Symptoms of Aortic Stenosis on Prognosis After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Background: The prognostic significance of different presentations of aortic stenosis (AS) remains unclear. Our aim was to analyze outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) according to preoperative AS symptoms. Methods and Results: We retrospectively enrolled 369 consecutive patients (age 84.3±5.0 years, and 64% females) who underwent TAVR from 2014 to 2021. We divided them into 4 groups by the main preoperative symptom: asymptomatic (n=50), chest pain (n=46), heart failure (HF; n=240), and syncope (n=33). Post-TAVR rates of HF readmission, all-cause death and cardiac death were compared among the 4 groups. The 4 groups showed no significant trends in age, sex, stroke volume index, or echocardiography indices of AS severity. During a follow-up, the overall survival rate at 1 and 5 years after TAVR was 97% and 90% in the asymptomatic group, 96% and 69% in the chest pain group, 93% and 69% in the HF group, and 90% and 72% in the syncope group, respectively. HF and syncope symptom had significantly lower HF readmission or cardiac death-free survival at 5 years after TAVR (log-rank test P=0.038). In the Cox hazard multivariate analysis, preoperative syncope was an independent predictor of future HF readmission or cardiac death after TAVR (HR=9.87; 95% CI 1.67-97.2; P=0.035). Conclusions: AS patients with preoperative syncope or HF had worse outcomes after TAVR than those with angina or no symptoms.
