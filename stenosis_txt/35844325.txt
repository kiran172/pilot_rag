Title: A Complete Workup of Recurrent Syncope Caused by Significant Left Main Coronary Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Syncope is usually caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. Differentials to consider during the workup of syncope includes vasovagal, orthostatic, drug-induced, arrhythmia, structural heart disease, and ischemic cardiomyopathy.  An 81-year-old African American man with recurrent witnessed syncopal events and newly diagnosed heart failure underwent extensive cardiac workup including electrocardiograms (EKG), echocardiogram, Holter monitor, electrophysiology (EP) study, and coronary angiogram. The workup revealed ischemic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of significant coronary artery disease including 80% distal left main disease. The patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with subsequent resolution of further syncopal events. The patient was successfully discharged with guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and coronary artery disease (CAD).  It is very rare for ischemic cardiomyopathy to present as syncope; however, it is not unheard of. Extensive transmural ischemia could lead to ventricular arrhythmias, a known cause of syncope. This rare presentation serves as a reminder to consider ischemic heart disease in the evaluation of syncope.
