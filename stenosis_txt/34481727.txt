Title: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of post-irradiated stenosis of subclavian artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The therapeutic efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) of post-irradiated stenosis of subclavian artery (PISSA) was not well clarified. This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the technical safety and outcome of the patients of severe symptomatic PISSA accepted PTAS.
METHODS: Between 2000 and 2019, 16 cases with 17 lesions of symptomatic and medically refractory PISSA accepted PTAS were included. We evaluated their technical success, peri-procedural complications and diffusion-weight imaging (DWI) of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), results of symptom relief, and long-term stent patency.
RESULTS: The stenosis of the 17 stenotic lesions were 81.2 ± 11.1%. The most common symptom of the 16 patients was dizziness (14/16, 87.5%). All successfully accepted PTAS without neurological complication and had symptom relief after PTAS (17/17, 100%). Of the 12 patients accepted pre-procedural and early post-procedural MRI follow-up, 2 patients had an asymptomatic tiny acute embolic infarct in the territory of vertebrobasilar system. In a 51.9 ± 54.9 months follow-up, all patients had no severe restenosis and no recurrent vertebrobasilar ischemic symptoms.
CONCLUSION: For patients with PISSA and medically refractory ischemic symptoms, PTAS can be an effective alternative management.
