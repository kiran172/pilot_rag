Title: Relationship Between Carotid Artery Angle and Plaque Morphology in Acute Cerebral Infarction Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI) can be used to clearly distinguish the luminal structure of the carotid artery (CA); measure the lumen, vessel wall, and total blood vessel area; and accurately describe the morphologic features of plaques.
METHODS: This study used HRMRI to investigate the relationship between geometric features and volume and composition of carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Patients (n=81) who had experienced acute cerebral infarction (CI) within 7Â±3 days before admission to the Neurology Department of Beijing Tiantan Hospital between November 2011 and June 2012 were enrolled in the study. CA HRMRI was performed to analyze the geometry and morphology of plaques in 160 blood vessels.
RESULTS: The median left and right internal carotid artery angles (ICAAs) were 32.79 and 31.00 degrees, respectively. Aside from the nonplanar external CA angle, plaque volume and angles did not differ significantly between the left and right sides. Age ( B =3.77; P =0.03) and nonplanar ICAA ( B =4.70; P =0.01) were predictors of left but not right carotid plaque volume. ICAA and bifurcation angle did not predict plaque volume.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, CA morphology in acute stroke patients is not associated with plaque volume or composition, but age and nonplanar ICAA can predict left carotid plaque volume.
