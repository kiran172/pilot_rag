Title: Navigating the "Optimal Implantation Depth" With a Self-Expandable TAVR Device in Daily Clinical Practice.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study sought to predict whether different methods of calculating the implantation depth (ID) influence clinical and hemodynamic outcome reporting in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a self-expandable device.
BACKGROUND: Different approaches exist to calculate the ID, which may influence uniform and reliable reporting because the updated Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC-2) criteria do not provide specific instructions.
METHODS: The clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of 258 patients undergoing TAVR with a third-generation self-expandable device were analyzed with regard to the method used to assess the ID as follows: arithmetic mean, the arithmetic mean of the measured distances from the noncoronary cusp and the left coronary cusp to the distal prosthesis end; noncoronary cusp distance, the distance from the noncoronary cusp to the distal prosthesis end; and deepest edge, the deepest edge of the distal prosthesis end.
RESULTS: Regardless of the measurement method, the optimal ID (OID) was reached in <30% (arithmetic mean, 25.4%; noncoronary cusp distance, 28.4%; deepest edge, 20.5%; p = 0.008). The deepest edge method is the most stringent to differentiate the relevant outcome parameters, such as the need for permanent pacemaker implantation (OID 3.7% vs. no OID 14.6%; p = 0.033). The hemodynamic outcome (i.e., mean pressure gradient reduction after TAVR: OID 7.4 ± 3.4 mm Hg vs. no OID 8.3 ± 4.0 mm Hg; p = 0.093) was not affected.
CONCLUSIONS: The OID was reached in <30% of TAVR procedures. The various methods applied for ID calculation significantly influence the outcome reporting and do not allow a uniform perception of the ID. (Multi Modal Cardiac Imaging Prior Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation; NCT01805739).
