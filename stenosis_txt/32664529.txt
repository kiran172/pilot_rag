Title: Aortic Valve Stenosis and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions: Clinical and Molecular Perspectives.

Abstract: Calcific aortic stenosis is a disorder that impacts the physiology of heart valves. Fibrocalcific events progress in conjunction with thickening of the valve leaflets. Over the years, these events promote stenosis and obstruction of blood flow. Known and common risk factors are congenital defects, aging and metabolic syndromes linked to high plasma levels of lipoproteins. Inflammation and oxidative stress are the main molecular mediators of the evolution of aortic stenosis in patients and these mediators regulate both the degradation and remodeling processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation of autophagy also contribute to the disease. A better understanding of these cellular impairments might help to develop new ways to treat patients since, at the moment, there is no effective medical treatment to diminish neither the advancement of valve stenosis nor the left ventricular function impairments, and the current approaches are surgical treatment or transcatheter aortic valve replacement with prosthesis.
