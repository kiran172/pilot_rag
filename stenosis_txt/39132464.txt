Title: A Comparison of 2 Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon Systems in Treatment of De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of de novo lesions, drug-coated balloons (DCB) have been shown to be a promising strategy to improve clinical outcomes of patients with small vessel disease. Evidence of this strategy in PCI of de novo coronary lesions in a real-world setting is limited. The objective of this study was to compare the 12-month outcomes of 2 paclitaxel-coated balloon systems for the treatment of all de novo coronary artery lesions.
METHODS: All patients who were treated for de novo coronary artery stenosis with either SeQuent Please or In.Pact Falcon DCB at a single center from January 2014 to December 2018 were included. The primary end point was the composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization (3-point major adverse cardiovascular events) at 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 496 patients with 623 lesions, of which 144 were treated with SeQuent Please and 352 were treated with In.Pact Falcon were included in the study. Baseline patient, lesion and procedural characteristics at baseline were similar between groups. At 12-month follow-up, 3-point major adverse cardiovascular event outcomes were similar (4.2% vs 2.3% respectively; P = .272). Deaths due to cardiovascular events were few and similar between groups (2.7% vs 1.1% respectively; P = .20).
CONCLUSIONS: Both paclitaxel DCB systems have similar efficacy and safety outcomes, suggesting that both may be an appropriate treatment choice for patients with de novo lesions. However, a larger randomized controlled study is needed to confirm these findings.
