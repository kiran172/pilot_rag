Title: Functional outcome after single-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction with rib cartilage grafting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Single-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction (SSLTR) provides a definite surgical treatment for patients with complex glotto-subglottic stenosis. To date, the influence of SSLTR on the functional outcome after surgery has not been analyzed.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all patients receiving a SSLTR between November 2012 and October 2019 was performed. Preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively, patients received a full functional evaluation, including spirometry; voice measurements (eg, fundamental frequency; dynamic range, singing voice range, and perceptual voice evaluation using the Roughness-Breathiness-Hoarseness [RBH] score, and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing [FEES]).
RESULTS: A total of 15 patients with a mean age of 45 ± 17 years underwent SSTLR. Two (13%) patients were men and 13 (87%) were women. The majority of patients (67%) had undergone previous surgical or endoscopic treatment attempts that had failed. At the 3-month follow-up visit, none of the patients had signs of penetration or aspiration in their swallowing examination. Voice measurements revealed a significantly lower fundamental voice frequency (201.0 Hz vs 155.5 Hz; P = .006), whereas voice range (19.1 semitones vs 14.9 semitones; P = .200) and dynamic range (52.5 dB vs 53.0 dB; P = .777) was hardly affected. The median RBH score changed from R1 B0 H1 to R2 B1 H2. In spirometry, breathing capacity increased significantly (peak expiratory flow, 44% vs 87% [P < .001] and mean expiratory flow at 75% of vital capacity, 48% vs 90% [P < .001]). During a median follow-up of 32.5 months (range, 7-88 months), none of the patients developed re-stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: For complex glotto-subglottic stenoses, durable long-term airway patency together with reasonable voice quality and normal deglutition can be achieved by SSLTR.
