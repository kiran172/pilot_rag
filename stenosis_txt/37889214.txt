Title: Endothelial Microparticles: Markers of Inflammatory Response After Sutureless Valve Implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is related to increased circulating endothelial microparticles (EMP).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the plasma concentration of EMP between patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with conventional bioprosthesis implantation and Perceval™ S (LivaNova) and to evaluate its impact on the inflammatory response in the short-term follow-up.
METHODS: This is a randomized clinical trial with 24 patients submitted to isolated aortic valve replacement divided into two groups: Perceval™ S (Group P) and conventional bioprostheses (Group C). Incidence of severe SIRS (three or more criteria) in the first 48 hours postoperatively, EMP release profile, interleukins (IL) 6 and 8, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were analyzed preand postoperatively at 24 hours and three months.
RESULTS: There were 24 patients (12 in each group), mean age was 69.92±5.17 years, 83.33% were female, the incidence of severe SIRS was 66.7% and 50% in groups C and P, respectively (P=0.68), and EMP showed a significant increase in the 24-hour postoperative period (P≤0.001) and subsequent decrease in the three-month postoperative period (P≤0.001), returning to baseline levels. For IL-6 and IL-8, there was a greater increase in group C at 24 hours postoperatively (P=.0.02 and P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of severe SIRS was similar in both groups, with significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8, at the 24-hour postoperative period, in group C, however with higher levels of EMP in group P, and subsequent return to baseline levels at the three-month postoperative period in both groups.
