Title: Potential risk of perioperative thromboembolism in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A case series.

Abstract: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a positive serum antiphospholipid antibody status. Patients with APS usually have an underlying hypercoagulable state, which can increase the risk of perioperative thromboembolism. We describe three patients with APS who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Of them, two had complicated cerebrovascular events, and the other had no complications. Careful antithrombotic management is essential to minimize the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding in patients with APS.
