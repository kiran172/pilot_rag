Title: Mitral Stenosis After MitraClip: How to Avoid and How to Treat.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of the paper is to highlight the importance of procedural planning and patient selection when using the MitraClip device in treating severe mitral regurgitation (MR).
RECENT FINDINGS: Following the recent results of the COAPT trial and FDA approval for functional MR patients, the indications for mitral clip are continuing to expand. Because of this, mitral stenosis from mitral clip can become a problem if the appropriate patients are not selected. Proper valve imaging, utilizing 3D transesophageal echocardiography to identify the pathology, is important to prevent iatrogenic mitral stenosis. In the unfortunate event of severe mitral stenosis as a result of the MitraClip device, surgery is the only treatment.
