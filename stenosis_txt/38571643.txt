Title: High-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging in ischemic stroke and carotid artery atherosclerotic stenosis: A review.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke is a significant burden on human health worldwide. Carotid Atherosclerosis stenosis plays an important role in the comprehensive assessment and prevention of ischemic stroke patients. High-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a successful technique for assessing carotid atherosclerosis stenosis. This advanced imaging modality has shown promise in effectively displaying a wide range of characteristics associated with the condition, leading to a comprehensive evaluation. High-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging not only enables a comprehensive evaluation of the instability of carotid atherosclerosis stenosis plaques but also provides valuable information for understanding the pathogenesis and predicting the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients. The purpose of this article is to review the application of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in ischemic stroke and carotid atherosclerotic stenosis.
