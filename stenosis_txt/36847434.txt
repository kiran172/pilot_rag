Title: OCT guided vs. COmplete pci in patieNts with sT segment elevation myocArdial infarCtion and mulTivessel disease: OCT-CONTACT RCT.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the culprit lesion significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular death. However, the management of non-culprit lesions in patients with the multivessel disease remains a matter of debate in this setting. It's still unclear if a morphological OCT-guided approach, identifying coronary plaque instability, may provide a more specific treatment compared with a standard angiographic/functional approach.
METHODS: OCT-Contact is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients with STEMI with successful primary PCI of the culprit lesion will be enrolled after the index PCI. Patients will be deemed eligible if a critical coronary lesion other than the culprit (associated with a diameter of stenosis â‰¥50%) will be identified during the index angiography. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to OCT-guided PCI of non-culprit lesions (Group A) vs. complete PCI (Group B). PCI in group A will be undertaken according to criteria of plaque vulnerability, while in group B the use of fractional flow reserve will be left at the operators' discretion. Major-adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are a composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (excluding peri-procedural MI), unplanned revascularization, and NYHA IV heart failure) will be the primary efficacy outcome. Single components of MACE along with cardiovascular mortality will be the secondary endpoints. . Safety endpoints will embrace worsening of renal failure, procedural complications, and bleedings. Patients will be followed for 24 months after randomization.
RESULTS: A sample size of 406 patients (203 per group) is required to provide the analysis an 80% power to detect a non-inferiority in the primary endpoint with an alpha error set at 0.05 and a non-inferiority limit of 4%.
CONCLUSIONS: A morphological OCT-guided approach may be a more specific treatment compared with the standard angiographic/functional approach in non-culprit lesions of STEMI patients.
