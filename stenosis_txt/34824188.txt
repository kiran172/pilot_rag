Title: Idiopathic Retroperitoneal Hematoma with Spontaneous Resolution.

Abstract: A 54-year-old man was transferred from another hospital due to a hematoma in the third portion of the duodenum on abdomen CT. He had been admitted for 2 weeks due to vomiting at another hospital. He had abdominal discomfort and nausea without abdominal pain when he visited the Gwangyang Sarang Hospital. Other than a distended abdomen and mild general abdominal tenderness, the results of physical examination were unremarkable. Abdominal CT revealed an approximately 9 cm thick walled hematoma at the anteroinferior site of the duodenal third portion. Upper endoscopy revealed stenosis of the third portion of the duodenum without mucosal lesions. The endoscope was not advanced through the narrowed duodenal lumen. A retroperitoneal hematoma was diagnosed, and his state was classified as subacute rather than acute based on the duration. The surgeon did not recommend surgical treatment. Urgent treatment was unnecessary; he was managed conservatively. The size of the hematoma decreased from 9.0 cm to 5.8 cm on the following CT. He could begin to eat food on the 26th admission day, and he was discharged on the 31st admission day. The hematoma disappeared entirely on the following CT. This paper describes a rare case of idiopathic retroperitoneal hematoma with a spontaneous resolution.
