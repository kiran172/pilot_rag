Title: Stenting of the right ventricular outflow tract as an initial intervention in Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of right ventricular outflow tract stenting as the primary intervention in Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.
BACKGROUND: The management of a subset of infants with Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries requires a staged approach including rehabilitation of diminutive native pulmonary arteries, conventionally using an aortopulmonary shunt. We share our experience of pulmonary artery rehabilitation with right ventricular outflow tract stenting.
METHODS: Retrospective review of all patients with Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis who underwent right ventricular outflow tract stenting as primary intervention over an 8-year period.
RESULTS: Ten patients underwent right ventricular outflow tract stent insertion at a median age of 61 days (interquartile range (IQR) 8.3-155 days). Median weight at stent deployment was 4.2 kg (IQR 3.2-5.7 kg). Oxygen saturations improved from a median of 79% (IQR 76-80%) to 92% (IQR 90-95%), p = 0.012. The median right and left pulmonary artery z score increased from -3.51 (IQR -4.59 to -2.80) and -2.07 (IQR -3.72 to 0.15) to a median of -1.17 (IQR -2.26 to 0.16) p < 0.05, and 0.24 (IQR -1.09 to 1.84) p < 0.05, respectively, at subsequent angiogram. Nine patients underwent further catheterisation. Four patients underwent complete anatomical repair. Only one patient required unifocalisation, as most patients had a native supply to all-important lung segments.
CONCLUSION: Right ventricular outflow tract stenting is a useful procedure in the subset of patients with Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, where native pulmonary arterial growth is required to facilitate repair.
