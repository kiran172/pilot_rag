Title: Aortic Stenosis and the Evolution of Cardiac Damage after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease. Models for stratifying cardiac damage associated with aortic stenosis have been developed to predict outcomes following valve replacement. However, evidence regarding morphological and functional evolution, as well as potential changes in the degree of cardiac damage, is limited. We aim to provide information on the evolution of cardiac morphology and the function of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) who have been classified using a cardiac damage staging system. Methods: In total, 496 patients were included in the analysis, and were classified into four stages based on the extent of cardiac damage as follows: Stage 0, no cardiac damage: left ventricle global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) &lt; -17%; right ventricular-arterial coupling (RVAc) ≥ 0.35), and absence of significant mitral regurgitation (MR). Stage 1, left-sided subclinical damage: LV-GLS ≥ -17%. Stage 2, left-sided damage: significant MR. Stage 3, right-sided damage: RVAc &lt; 0.35. Results: The mean age was 82.1 ± 5.9 years, and 53.0% were female. In total, 24.5% of patients met the criteria for Stage 0, and Stage 1 included 42.8% of patients, Stage 2 included 16.5%, and Stage 3 comprised 16.2% of patients. Mortality was 8.4% for stage 0, 17.4% for stage 1, 25.6% for stage 2, and 28.6% for stage 3 patients (p = 0.004). Diabetes mellitus (DM) (p = 0.047) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (p = 0.024) were the only clinical predictors of no change or worsening in the stage of cardiac damage. Regarding echocardiographic variables, concomitant tricuspid, and mitral regurgitation, ≥ 2 were both significantly associated with no change or worsening, also (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Cardiac damage that is secondary to severe aortic stenosis has morphological and functional repercussions that, even after valve replacement, persist and might worsen the prognosis.
