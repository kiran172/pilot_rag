Title: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to valvular heart disease: a state-of-the-art review.

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common disease affecting up to 1% of the population and at least 50% of patients diagnosed with heart failure (HF) (Hoeper et al. in Lancet Respir Med 4(4):306-322, 2016). It is estimated that PH is present in 15% to 60% of patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) which can result from an increase in pulmonary blood flow and subsequently in pulmonary venous congestion and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). It is important to identify the severity of PH in patients with VHD to appropriately risk stratify and manage these patients (Magne et al. in JACC Cardiovasc Imaging 8(1):83-99, 2015). In this review, we examine the diagnostic criteria for PH and its pathophysiology. We also focus on the growing evidence supporting the presence of PH secondary to VHD and describe the contemporary surgical and medical therapeutic interventions in this patient population (Fig.Â 1).
