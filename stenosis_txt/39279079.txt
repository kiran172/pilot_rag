Title: A haemodialysis catheter misplaced due to central venous stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Chronic kidney disease has become a significant global health issue, with some individuals progressing to endstage renal disease (ESRD) and requiring renal replacement therapy. For ESRD patients undergoing haemodialysis, the first step is to establish vascular access. In emergency situations, inserting a haemodialysis catheter (HDC) into the central vein is often the most appropriate approach; the right internal jugular vein (IJV) is considered the optimal site for catheterisation. However, catheter placement in the right IJV can sometimes lead to inadvertent entry into an abnormal position. Herein, we present a unique case in which the tip of the HDC was noted to have misplaced into the left IJV due to the patient's multiple central venous stenosis (CVS). This case highlights the clinical manifestation of HDC misplacement, with CVS being the underlying cause. Therefore, healthcare providers should pay adequate attention to CVS.
