Title: Long-term follow-up of Bentall procedure using the Perimount bioprosthesis and the Valsalva graft.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Bentall procedure is the gold standard for aortic root pathologies when valve repair is not feasible. The development of durable bioprosthetic valves and improved vascular conduits allowed the implementation of bioprosthetic composite grafts; hereby, we performed a retrospective analysis of long-term follow-up of Bentall procedure using the Valsalva graft and the Perimount Magna Ease prosthesis.
METHODS: From June 2000 to March 2019, 309 patients received an aortic root and valve replacement with a bioprosthetic composite graft. The mean age was 69 ± 6.9 years, and the majority were men (88%); most of them were affected by aortic stenosis (86%) and the mean aortic root diameter was 48.6 ± 5.5 mm.
RESULTS: Freedom from cardiac death was 76.8% [confidence interval (CI) 32.5-94.0] at 16 years. Freedom from thromboembolism, haemorrhage, structural valve deterioration and infective endocarditis was 98.2% (CI 96.0-98.9), 95.2% (CI 87.1-98.2), 87.5% (CI 63.2-97.1) and 79.6% (CI 45.3-95.6) at 16 years, respectively. Freedom from reoperation was 74.7% (CI 41.9-90.6).
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that, in experienced centres, the Bentall procedure is a safe and effective intervention. This is the first long-term follow-up that analyses the results after implantation of a composite graft made with the Perimount Magna Ease aortic valve and the Valsalva graft.
