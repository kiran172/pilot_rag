Title: Percutaneous Renal Artery Stenting With Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging in a Young Boy With Recanalized-Thrombus Associated Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: The common cause of renal artery stenosis in young is fibromuscular dysplasia or Takayasu arteritis. Recanalized thrombus, on the other hand, is a rare cause for renal artery stenosis in young patients. OCT imaging confirmed the diagnosis and optimized the renal stenting results.
