Title: Highlights in clinical medicine-Giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and Takayasu's arteritis: pathogenic links and therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Giant cell arteritis (GCA), frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) are characterized by extensive vascular remodeling that results in occlusion and stenosis. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the onset of GCA/PMR and TAK are still hypothetical. However, similarities and differences in the immunopathology and clinical phenotypes of these diseases point toward a possible link between them. The loss of tolerance in the periphery, a breakdown of tissue barriers, and the development of granulomatous vasculitis define a disease continuum. However, statistically powered studies are needed to confirm these correlations. In addition to glucocorticoids, inhibition of the interleukin-6 axis has been proposed as a cornerstone in the treatment of GCA/PMR and TAK. Novel biologic agents targeting the pathogenic pathway at various levels hold promise to achieve glucocorticoid-free sustained remission.
