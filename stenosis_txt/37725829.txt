Title: Ectopic Opening of Common Bile Duct to Duodenal Bulb: A Single Tertiary Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The ectopic opening of the common bile duct(CBD) into the duodenal bulb is a rare biliary anomaly. The study aimed to reveal the experience with clinical and endoscopic outcomes in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 57 consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for ectopic opening of the CBD into the duodenal bulb at our institution between 2010 and 2020.
RESULTS: The median age was 59 years (49 males). A total of 146 ERCP procedures were performed (once in 26 patients and 2 or more times in 31 patients). Ten patients had a history of unsuccessful ERCP in an external center. The median follow-up time was 14.6 months. All patients had a slit-like opening of the CBD into the duodenal bulb, apical stenosis, and hook-shaped distal CBD. ERCP findings were CBD stone or dilatation in 55 patients and post-cholecystectomy biliary leakage in 2 patients. Balloon dilatation was performed for apical stenosis in 7 patients and distal CBD stenosis in 26 patients. During the first ERCP session, biliary stent/nasobiliary drainage was placed in 37 patients, and CBD stones were extracted in 19 patients without stenting. Biliodigestive anastomosis was applied to 13 patients, 5 of whom had recurrent cholangitis, 7 required recurrent ERCP, and one was due to the technical difficulty of ERCP.
CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic biliary opening should be remembered if the papilla cannot be seen in its usual place in a patient with apical stenosis. ERCP should be performed in experienced hands, and surgery should be considered in the need for recurrent ERCP.
