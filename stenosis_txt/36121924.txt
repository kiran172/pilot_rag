Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Through a Single Femoral Access: A Multicenter Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: During the past few years, physicians have optimized transcatheter aortic valve replacement and its periprocedural management, with the minimalist approach becoming popular. We aimed to further simplify the procedure using a single femoral access (the "all-in-one" technique). Here, we report a multicenter experience with TAVR with Acurate neo/neo2 transcatheter heart valves (Boston Scientific) through a single, large-bore, femoral sheath.
METHODS: Patients underwent TAVR with the Acurate neo or neo2 through a single femoral access at 4 centers. The large sheath was used for both the delivery catheter and the pigtail used to visualize the aortic root.
RESULTS: A total of 157 patients (59% women) with a mean age of 82 ± 6 years underwent TAVR with the Acurate neo (n = 100) or the Acurate neo2 (n = 57). The procedure was successfully performed through a single large sheath in all patients. Median duration of hospitalization stay was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-3 days). On echocardiography before discharge, the mean gradient was 7 ± 3 mm Hg and 7 patients (4.4%) had more than mild paravalvular leak. At 30 days, a major vascular complication had occurred in 2 patients (1.3%), 2 patients (1.3%) had suffered a stroke, and only 4 patients (2.5%) had required new permanent pacemaker implantation. A total of 3 patients (1.9%) had died.
CONCLUSIONS: An all-in-one access technique allows safe implantation of Acurate neo and neo2 transcatheter heart valves, with low rates of periprocedural complications and favorable short-term outcomes.
