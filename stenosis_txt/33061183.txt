Title: Management of the mitral valve in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Septal myectomy is the gold standard treatment option for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy whose symptoms do not respond to medical therapy. This operation reliably relieves left ventricular outflow tract gradients, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and associated mitral valve regurgitation. However, there remains controversy regarding the necessity of mitral valve intervention at the time of septal myectomy. While some clinicians advocate for concomitant mitral valve procedures, others strongly believe that the mitral valve should only be operated on if there is intrinsic mitral valve disease. At Mayo Clinic, we have performed septal myectomy on more than 3000 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and in our experience, mitral valve operation is rarely necessary for patients who do not have intrinsic mitral valve disease such as leaflet prolapse or severe calcific stenosis. In this paper, we review anatomical considerations, imaging, and surgical approaches in the management of the mitral valve in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
