Title: Treatment of Bicuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis Using Transcatheter Heart Valves.

Abstract: The paucity of data regarding the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) anatomy due to exclusion from pivotal studies and lack of studies assessing the long-term outcomes and valve performance continue to present a significant challenge as we expand TAVR to patients with BAV anatomy. This article discusses the important anatomic and clinical considerations in the selection and management of patients with BAV with TAVR and reviews the emerging evidence that increasingly suggests this procedure is safe, device success is excellent, and procedural outcomes are improving.
