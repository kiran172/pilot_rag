Title: Cone-Beam CT-assisted navigation for endovascular treatment of erection-related artery stenosis in patients with erectile dysfunction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Angioplasty and stenting have emerged as endovascular treatment options for arteriogenic erectile dysfunction over the past few years. Considerable anatomical variation of the erection related pelvic arteries can be challenging during these procedures, leading to time-consuming repetitive super-selective angiograms for navigation.
TECHNIQUE: We report a novel technique of using C-arm Cone-Beam CT and vessel navigation software to facilitate super-selective catheterization.
CONCLUSION: Cone-Beam CT-guided navigation for vascular assessment of arteriogenic ED is an optional approach compared to exclusive angiographic assessment. Compared to CT angiography, C-arm Cone-Beam CT offers benefits regarding usage of contrast media and radiation exposure. It has the advantage to combine imaging with endovascular procedures in a single session, reduces time to target navigation in complex pelvic arteries anatomy and may increase therapy safety in endovascular treatment of ED.
