Title: [Risk factors associated with lethality on patients with central cord syndrome].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Central Cord Syndrome is the most common incomplete spinal cord injury, and it represents 9% of all spinal injuries of the adult.
OBJECTIVE: to determine the risk factors associated with lethality or/and mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with Central Cord Syndrome (CCS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: upon a retrospective cohort with patients with posttraumatic CCS we evaluated at the time of emergency admission and until the hospital discharge. The dependent variable was dead or MV. We calculated incidence, relative risk (RR) with CI95% and a multivariate model for the association of statistically significant variables by means of a risk coefficient model upon the variables that evidenciated tendencies towards risk.
RESULTS: From 101 patients with CCS, 85.1% with a severe medullary canal stenosis and 9.9% required MV; the mortality was 13.9%. The only risk factor associated with dead was the use of MV with an RR of 3.6 (CI95% 1.4-9.5); the risk with tendencies towards MV was being older than 60 RR 5.4 (CI95% 0.6-44.2). Other factors demonstrated a tendency towards mortality, but they were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: MV is a risk factor associated with mortality, other factors evidenciated tendencies towards mortality; being older than 60, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, narrow spinal canal, more than 20 days of hospital stay and being intervened farther than 10 days from the accident. The incidence of mortality in our sample is greater than thus reported previously on other international articles. To know and identify these and other factors will let us identify patients with a greater risk of complications.
