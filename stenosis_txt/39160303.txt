Title: Risk factors for and treatment of anastomotic strictures after Ivor Lewis esophagectomy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Anastomotic strictures following esophagectomy occur frequently and impact on nutrition and quality of life. Although strictures are often attributed to ischemia and anastomotic leaks, the role of anastomosis size and pyloroplasty is not well evaluated. Our study aims to assess the rate of and risk factors for anastomotic stricture following esophagectomy, and the impact of treatment with regular endoscopic balloon dilatations.
METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 207) undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy performed by two surgeons at our institution were included. Data on patient demographics, surgical outcomes and anastomotic strictures were recorded. Relationship of anastomotic strictures with circular stapler size, pyloroplasty and anastomotic leak was analyzed. Treatment of strictures with endoscopic balloon dilatation was reviewed and percentage weight loss at 1 year was evaluated.
RESULTS: Anastomotic strictures occurred in 17.4% of patients. Patient demographics between those with and without stricture were similar. Stricture rate was similar in patients with or without pyloroplasty (13.9% vs 21.7%, respectively, p = 0.14) and in those with or without an anastomotic leak (25.0% vs 16.6%, respectively, p = 0.345). Stricture risk increased with smaller sized stapler (25 mm = 33.3%, 28 mm = 15.3%, 31 mm = 4.8%; p = 0.027). The median number of dilatations required to fully treat strictures was 2 (IQR: 1-3). The median length of time from surgery to first dilatation was 2.9 months (IQR: 2.0-4.7) and to last dilatation was 6.1 months (IQR: 4.8-10.0). Median maximum dilatation diameter was 20 mm (IQR: 18.0-20.0). There were no complications from dilatations. Percentage weight loss at 1 year in patients with strictures was similar to those without strictures (8.7% vs 11.1%, respectively, p = 0.090).
CONCLUSIONS: Post-esophagectomy anastomotic strictures are common and not necessarily related to anastomotic leaks or absence of pyloroplasty. Smaller anastomosis size was strongly linked with stricture formation. A driven approach with regular endoscopic balloon dilation is safe and effective in treating these strictures with no excess weight loss at 1 year once treated.
