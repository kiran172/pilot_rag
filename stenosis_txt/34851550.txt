Title: Utilizing ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring to reduce conduction related death after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of ambulatory cardiac monitoring (ACM) in detecting delayed advanced conduction abnormalities (DACA) and associated 30-day mortality.
BACKGROUND: DACA are well-known complications of TAVR and may be associated with post-discharge mortality within 30-days.
METHODS: Between October 2019 and October 2020, TAVR patients who were discharged home without a permanent pacemaker (PPM) were monitored with an ACM device for 14-days. The incidence of DACA at follow up, mortality and readmission within 30-days were investigated. The risk of DACA was assessed in three patient categories based on a composite of their 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Group I: Normal pre-TAVR, periprocedural, and discharge ECGs. Group II: Normal pre-TAVR and abnormal subsequent ECGs. Group III. Abnormal baseline and abnormal subsequent ECGs.
RESULTS: Among 340 TAVR patients, 248 were discharged home with an ACM device. The overall incidence of DACA was 7% (n = 17), of whom 4% (n = 10) required a PPM. Mortality and readmission between discharge and 30 days was 0% and 8.3%, respectively. Stratification of patients identified 96 (38.7%) patients in Group I: 50 (20%) in Group II, and 102 (41%) in Group III. The incidence of DACA requiring a PPM was 0% in Group I, 4% (n = 2) in Group II, and 8.5% (n = 8) in Group III (p < 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: In TAVR patients who were discharged home with ACM, none died between discharge and 30-days. For those with normal baseline, perioperative and discharge ECG, there were no events of DACA at 14-days.
