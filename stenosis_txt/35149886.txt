Title: Transradial Cerebral Angiography: Is it Feasible and Safe for Children?

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility and safety of transradial cerebral angiography (TRCA) in comparison to transfemoral cerebral angiography (TFCA) in the pediatric population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients who underwent TRCA between January 2019 and July 2020. Patients with TFCA experience were examined. Pre- and post-procedural Doppler ultrasonography was performed to evaluate TRCA complications. To evaluate differences in radiation exposure between TRCA and TFCA, we investigated the radiation dose, dose area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time, and examination time.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (mean age, 13.8 years; 22 male) underwent TRCA, with 18 (mean age, 13.0 years; 10 male) experiencing TFCA. TRCA was successful in all cases without technical failure. Radiation exposure including radiation dose and DAP were significantly higher in the TRCA group (474.1 mGy and 8299.6 μGy m2) compared with the TFCA group (347.8 mGy and 6342.0 μGy m2). Fluoroscopy time and total examination time were significantly longer (145.1% and 32.6%) in TRCA (15.2 and 38.6 min) group compared with the TFCA group (6.2 and 29.1 min). Among the 26 patients who underwent post-procedural Doppler ultrasonography, five (19.2%) had complications after TRCA. Two (7.7%) patients showed radial artery stenosis, two (7.7%) had hematoma at the puncture site, and one (3.8%) showed thrombotic occlusion.
CONCLUSION: Although TRCA is a technically feasible and safe method in pediatric patients, high radiation exposure to TFCA must be considered. Therefore, it should be considered as an alternative method in those with unfavorable clinical situations for performing TFCA.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4, Case Series.
