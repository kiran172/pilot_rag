Title: [Perioperative period management of laryngotracheoplasty using anterior cricoid split procedure with free hyoid grafting].

Abstract: Objective:To review the key points of the perioperative period management of laryngotracheoplasty using free hyoid grafting in children with acquired subglottic stenosis, in order to reduce postoperative complications, to improve extubation rate, and to promote the rehabilitation of the patients. Methods:Twenty-five cases with subglottic stenosis were treated by laryngotracheoplasty using free hyoid grafting in department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Shanghai Children's Hospital from September 2017 to June 2021. Standardized perioperative period management protocols were carried out in all 25 cases. Results:21 cases were successfully extubated, T tubes of 2 cases were replaced by tracheal tubes which have been sealed, but tracheal tubes sealing was failed in 2 cases after tube replacement. Conclusion:High quality perioperative period management of laryngotracheoplasty using free hyoid grafting can effectively reduce related complication rate, maintain airway patency, promote laryngeal function recovery, shorten the period of tracheotomy and improve the quality of life.
