Title: Life expectancy and end-of-life communication in adult patients with congenital heart disease, 40-53 years after surgery.

Abstract: AIMS: Although survival of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) improved significantly over time, life expectancy is still not normal. We aimed to investigate how adult patients, their partners, and treating cardiologists estimated the individual life expectancy of CHD patients. Furthermore, preferences regarding end-of-life (EOL) communication were investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we included 202 patients (age: 50 Â± 5) who were operated in childhood (&lt;15 years old) between 1968 and 1980 for one of the following diagnoses: atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot, or transposition of the great arteries. A specific questionnaire was administered to both the patients and their partners, exploring their perceived life expectancy and EOL wishes. Two cardiologists independently assessed the life expectancy of each patient. Most adults with CHD believed their life expectancy to be normal. However, significant differences were found between estimated life expectancy by the cardiologist and patients (female: P = 0.001, male: P = 0.002) with moderate/severe defects, as well as for males with mild defects (P = 0.011). Regarding EOL communication, 85.1% of the patients reported that they never discussed EOL with a healthcare professional. Compared with patients with mild CHD, significantly more patients with moderate/severe defect discussed EOL with a physician (P = 0.011). The wish to discuss EOL with the cardiologist was reported by 49.3% of the patients and 41.7% of their partners.
CONCLUSION: Adult patients, especially with moderate/severe CHD, perceived their life expectancy as normal, whereas cardiologists had a more pessimistic view than their patients. Increased attention is warranted for discussions on life expectancy and EOL to improve patient-tailored care.
