Title: Arterio-Venous Thrombosis and Spontaneous Bleeding in COVID-19-Associated Coagulopathy: A Case Report.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome which was declared a global pandemic in 2019 causing significant morbidities and mortalities. COVID-19 is a multi-systemic disease and is not primarily limited to the respiratory system. Thrombus formation is one of its distinct features. However, renal complications associated with COVID-19 are rarely reported in the literatureÂ due to limited occurrence and research. We report a rare case of right retroperitoneal hematoma in a COVID-19 patient. We report a 51-year-old male patient who was received at the emergency department (ED). The patient was positive for COVID-19 and had a Glasgow coma scale of 12/15. The patient was initially managed on IV anticoagulation due to cavernous sinus thrombosis and was placed on mechanical ventilation which helped him to improve. After two weeks, a sudden drop in hemoglobin was observed. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed the presence of a right retroperitoneal hematoma, and right renal artery non-occlusive filling defect. The patient was successfully managed with conservative treatment. Retroperitoneal hematoma although a rare occurrence in COVID-19 patient should be observed and monitored closely in case of bleeding or anemia, as early management and intervention is beneficial.
