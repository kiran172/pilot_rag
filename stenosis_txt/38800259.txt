Title: Trichinellosis-Induced Eosinophilic Myocarditis Mimicking Hypereosinophilic Syndrome.

Abstract: Trichinella spiralisis an uncommon parasitic disease contracted through the consumption of undercooked pork. We report the case of a 59-year-old man with a history of bicuspid aortic valve with recent travel to the Philippines and consumption of raw pork presenting with progressive myalgia and hypereosinophilia (nadir 12,940/uL) in profound cardiogenic shock in the setting of critical aortic stenosis. He underwent emergent balloon valvuloplasty, which was complicated by aortic insufficiency. This necessitated a transcatheter aortic valve replacement. However, despite hemodynamic stabilization, he developed catastrophic eosinophilic myocarditis, complicated by cardiac arrest from ventricular tachycardia. A rectus femoris muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis, showing a T. spiralis parasite and significant eosinophilic infiltration. Empiric treatment with albendazole, ivermectin, and methylprednisolone resulted in the significant resolution of symptoms and the liberalization of critical illness. This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing the underlying etiologies of hypereosinophilia and/or eosinophilic myocarditis, underscoring the importance of considering parasitic etiologies, particularly in endemic regions or in patients who have a significant travel history to such areas. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent morbidity and mortality.
