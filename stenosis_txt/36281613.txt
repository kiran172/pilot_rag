Title: [The Effects of Bridge to Surgery(BTS)for Malignant Colorectal Stenosis on the Nutritional and Immunological Status].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify the effects of bridge to surgery(BTS)for malignant colorectal stenosis on the nutritional and immunological status.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 19 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent BTS were included. We examined the technical success of stenting, clinical improvement, treatment progress after BTS, and nutritional and immunological status changes before and after BTS.
RESULTS: There were 19 technically successful cases and 18 clinically improved cases. One patient(Score 0)had an obstruction after BTS, which improved after stent repositioning. The CROSS Score before and after stenting improved in all patients. Scores 0 to 4 improved in 12 patients, Scores 0 to 3 in 5 patients, and Scores 3 to 4 in 2 patients. The median time to resume eating was 3 days, and the median surgery time was 25 days. The final diet before operation for colorectal consisted of a rokubugayu(rice gruel: polished rice content 12%)in 1 case, zengayu(rice gruel: polished rice content 20%)in 8 cases, soft diet in 5 cases, and regular diet in 5 cases. Before and after BTS, the nutritional and immunological status decreased significantly(p<0.05)with albumin levels ranging from 3.9- 3.5 g/dL, BUN/Cr from 24.8-12.5, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio from 3.8-2.5; however, no significant fluctuations in the prognostic nutritional index were observed.
CONCLUSION: BTS enabled the nutritional management using the intestinal tract and improved the patient's immune status.
