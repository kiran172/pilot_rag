Title: The Effects of Hyaluronic Acid on Traumatic Urethral Inflammation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study investigated the possible beneficial effect of hyaluronic acid (HA) on traumatic urethral healing.
METHODS: A total of 40 adult male Wistar rats were randomized into four groups: control, sham (serum physiologic; SF group), HA 1.8%, and HA 3%. A tiny hook was introduced and drawn at the 12 o'clock position into the urethra for the SF and HA groups to create a urethral inflammation model. Either SF or HA was applied intraurethrally for 5 consecutive days. After a 15-day follow-up period (21st day of the study), penile tissue was harvested and evaluated histopathologically.
RESULTS: None of the groups showed inflammation at the end of study. Pathological findings such as calcification, hemorrhage, and stenosis were observed in the wound healing and these findings were present in all trauma groups. A significant increase in tissue thickness was observed in the group treated with saline (p = 0.004). No statistically significant difference was found in the two groups receiving HA treatment compared to the SF group.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that HA does not provide a beneficial effect on the connective tissue repairment when it is applied locally during the acute period of urethral injury for 5 consecutive days. There is a need for further studies in which the duration of drug use is extended or the dosage is increased.
