Title: Sinogram-Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction Negatively Impacts the Risk Category Based on Agatston Score: A Study Combining Coronary Calcium Score Measurement and Coronary CT Angiography.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the impact of sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) on risk category for coronary artery disease by combining coronary calcium score measurement and coronary CT angiography (CCTA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients (64.0% male) older than 18 years (64.4 ± 10.3 years) underwent coronary artery calcium scanning and prospectively ECG-triggered sequential CCTA examination. All raw data acquired in coronary artery calcium scanning were reconstructed by both filtered back projection (FBP) and SAFIRE algorithms with 5 different levels. Objective image quality and calcium quantification were evaluated and compared between FBP and all SAFIRE levels by the Sphericity Assumed test or Greenhouse-Geisser ε correction coefficient. Coronary artery stenosis was assessed in CCTA. Risk categories of all patients and of the patients with coronary artery stenosis in CCTA were compared between FBP and all SAFIRE levels by the Friedman test.
RESULTS: The reconstruction protocol from traditional FBP to SAFIRE 5 was associated with a gradual reduction in CT value and image noise (P &lt; 0.001) but associated with a gradual improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (P &lt; 0.001). There was a gradual reduction in coronary calcification quantification (Agatston score: from 73.5 in FBP to 38.1 in SAFIRE 5, P &lt; 0.001) from traditional FBP to SAFIRE 5. There was a significant difference for the risk category between FBP and all levels of SAFIRE in all patients (from 3.5 in FBP to 3.2 in SAFIRE 5, P &lt; 0.001) and in the patients with coronary artery stenosis in CCTA (from 4.0 in FBP to 3.6 in SAFIRE 5, P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: SAFIRE significantly reduces coronary calcification quantification compared to FBP, resulting in the reduction of risk categories based on the Agatston score. The risk categories of the patients with coronary artery stenosis in CCTA may also decline. Thus, SAFIRE may lead risk categories to underestimate the existence of significant coronary artery stenosis.
