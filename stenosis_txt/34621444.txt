Title: Hyponatremia induced Brugada syndrome mimicking ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Abstract: Seventy-three year-old male with history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease stage 3 presented with epigastric pain and hyponatremia. ECG showed new ST segment elevation at precordial leads consistent with Cove-type Brugada ECG pattern. Cardiac catheterization revealed non-significant coronary artery stenosis. He experienced pre-syncope and palpitations a year prior to admission with family history sudden cardiac death. Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. Cove-type Brugada ECG pattern and palpitations resolved with corrected sodium to 135.
