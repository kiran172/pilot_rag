Title: Spontaneous periduodenal hematoma: a rare surgical and radiological conundrum.

Abstract: This is a case of a 68-year-old female with spontaneous and rare periduodenal hematoma of unknown origin without any signs or symptoms of duodenal stenosis. All causes of known precipitating factors, such as trauma, intervention, anticoagulation, pancreatitis or malignant processes, were ruled out. She was managed conservatively, with a series of radiological investigations performed throughout her 7-day admission to further define stability and investigate the possible cause for the periduodenal hemorrhage. A repeat magnetic resonance imaging 4Â weeks later showed near resolution of the hematoma. The underlying cause in this case remains unclear.
