Title: Correlation between risk factors of cerebrovascular disease and calcified plaque characteristics in patients with atherosclerotic severe carotid stenosis.

Abstract: Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the risk factors of cerebral vascular diseases (CVD) and the characteristics of calcified plaques in patients with severe carotid arteriosclerosis stenosis (SCAS).Methods: A total of 402 patients with SCAS who were treated in our hospital between January to December 2016 were included in this study. The patients were divided into calcified plaque group and non-calcified plaque group according to the ultrasonography and computerized tomography angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) imaging of SCAS-responsible plaque and the characteristics of calcified plaques evaluated by high-frequency ultrasound.Results: The patients with long-term diabetes mellitus or higher levels of fasting blood glucose were more likely to develop calcified plaques (P = 0.00 and P = 0.021, respectively). In addition, the patients with calcified plaques were mostly smokers (P = 0.016). Their smoking duration and accumulative smoking exposure were higher than those without calcified plaque (P = 0.006 and P = 0.007, respectively). The basal location of calcification (P = 0.004) and the type of patchy calcification (P = 0.00) were both easier to appear in smokers, while non-smokers were more likely to have small granular calcification (P = 0.002). Furthermore, the carotid plaque calcification with mixed-location were more frequently seen in patients with hypertension (P = 0.016). The risk factors independently associated with plaque calcification were significantly associated with smoking status, smoking age, and accumulative smoking exposure, as well as age and diabetes mellitus (all P &lt; 0.05).Conclusion: Smoking, diabetes mellitus and age were independent risk factors for carotid plaque calcification. Smoking and hypertension were associated with specific locations and types of plaque calcification.
