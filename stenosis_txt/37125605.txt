Title: Intraprocedural delayed reassessment of paravalvular regurgitation in TAVR significantly reduces the use of postdilatation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the effect of a 15-min delayed intraprocedural reassessment of paravalvular aortic regurgitation (PVR) after an immediate evaluation of posttranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) on the regurgitation grading and usage of postdilatation.
BACKGROUND: PVR after TAVR is associated with poor prognosis, but postdilatation may increase the risk of other complications.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort of consecutive patients treated with balloon-expandable valve ES-3 ultra, the degree of PVR was assessed immediately and 15 min after that first evaluation (excluded severe cases), with the indication of postdilatation based on the delayed assessment. As a control group, the previous consecutive series of patients also treated with the same model of valve prosthesis was used.
RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were included in the prospective study cohort and 152 in the retrospective control group. In the study group, the immediate PVR assessment showed none-trace 27.5%, mild 52%, moderate 19%, and severe 1.5%, and the delayed re-evaluation graded PVR as none-trace 83%, mild 15.6%, and moderate 1.2% (p < 0.001 as compared to immediate). In the control group, the immediate PVR assessment showed none-trace 33.5%, mild 52%, moderate 13%, and severe 1.5%. The rate of postdilatation was 2.8% in the study group versus 10.5% in the control group (p = 0.006). At discharge, no differences were observed between groups in PVR echocardiographic grading.
CONCLUSIONS: A post-TAVR delayed intraprocedural reassessment of the PVR shows a clearly lower degree of regurgitation as compared to immediate evaluation, which significantly decreased the indication of postdilatation.
