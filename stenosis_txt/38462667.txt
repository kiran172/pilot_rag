Title: Friction injury of the central vein caused by catheter for hemodialysis: an in vitro study.

Abstract: Vascular injury such as central venous stenosis (CVS) is a common complication in hemodialysis patients with central venous catheters (CVCs), yet the impact of the microstructure and partial physic characteristics of catheter surface on the chronic injury of central vein has not been elucidated. In this study, the microscopic morphology of tips and bodies of six different brands of polyurethane CVCs was observed and their roughness was assessed. Subsequently, an in vitro model was established to measure the coefficients of friction (COF) between CVCs (tips and bodies) and the vena cava intima of Japanese rabbits under the same condition in a linear reciprocating mode, and changes in the intima of vessels after friction were observed. The study found that there was a significant variation in surface roughness among different brands of CVCs (tips P < 0.001, bodies P = 0.02), and the COF was positively correlated with the catheter surface roughness (tips P = 0.005, R = 0.945, bodies P = 0.01, R = 0.909). Besides, the endovascular roughness increased after friction. These findings suggest that the high roughness surface of CVCs may cause chronic mechanical friction injury to the central venous intima, which is one of the potential factors leading to CVS or occlusion. This provides a breakthrough for reducing complications, improving patient prognosis, and advancing catheter surface lubrication technology.
