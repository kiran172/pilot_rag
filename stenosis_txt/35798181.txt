Title: Changes to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) services during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: A single centre experience from United Kingdom tertiary hospital.

Abstract: AIMS: COVID-19 had a devastating impact on patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Like many cardiac procedures, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) services were suspended during the first wave of COVID-19. We took the opportunity to evaluate the clinical outcomes and identify any delays at different stages of the TAVR pathway during the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data on 210 consecutive TAVR patients between March 2019 and March 2021 were analysed. We compared the clinical outcomes and 30-day mortality rates of TAVR cases pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. We also looked to identify any time lags from the initial referral to respective stages of the TAVR workup.
RESULTS: A total of 134 patients underwent TAVR prior to the national lockdown (March 2019-March 2020), compared to 76 patients during COVID-19 (April 2020-April 2021). Success rates of TAVR were similar (99% prior to the pandemic and 97.4% during COVID-19). The 30-day survival rates were 98.6% and 94.7%, respectively. Median length of stay post TAVR was 2 days during COVID-19 and 2.5 days prior to the pandemic (p = 0.064). Patients were seen quicker in clinic (median of 33 days) during COVID-19, compared to 51 days before COVID-19 (p = 0.044). No significant difference in times from referral to discussion at TAVR multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings, CT Aortogram and TAVR implantation, in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Reconfiguring the patient pathway during COVID-19 allowed TAVR to be performed safely, with a similar success rate and no excess complications or increased 30-day mortality. There proved to be no delay in the respective stages of patient TAVR workup, during the pandemic.
