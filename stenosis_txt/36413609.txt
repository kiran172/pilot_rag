Title: A word of caution: Early failure of Magmaris® bioresorbable stent after pulmonary artery stenting.

Abstract: Bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS) have been advocated as the fourth revolution in interventional cardiology medical devices with promising technology to improve the treatment of coronary artery disease with an event-free future. We describe the first reported use and early collapse of the Magmaris® Resorbable Magnesium Scaffold (RMS) stent (BIOTRONIK AG, Switzerland) to relieve left pulmonary artery severe stenosis in a newborn after the Norwood procedure. The stent collapse was detected 2 weeks after implantation and urgently treated with a balloon-expandable stent. This complication raises the alarm about the need to keep implanted RMS under scrutiny. The possibility of faster scaffold resorption in small babies or lack of sufficient radial force of RMS to resist acute vessel recoil has led to ineffective relief of branch pulmonary artery stenosis and failure to enable a safe short-term bridge to Stage II palliation.
