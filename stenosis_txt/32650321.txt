Title: Recapitulating atherogenic flow disturbances and vascular inflammation in a perfusable 3D stenosis model.

Abstract: Blood vessel narrowing and arterial occlusion are pathological hallmarks of atherosclerosis, which involves a complex interplay of perturbed hemodynamics, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory cascade. Herein, we report a novel circular microfluidic stenosis model that recapitulates atherogenic flow-mediated endothelial dysfunction and blood-endothelial cell (EC) interactions in vitro. 2D and 3D stenosis microchannels with different constriction geometries were fabricated using 3D printing to study flow disturbances under varying severity of occlusion and wall shear stresses (100 to 2000 dynecm-2). Experimental and fluid simulation results confirmed the presence of pathological shear stresses in the stenosis region, and recirculation flow post stenosis. The resultant pathological flow profile induced pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic EC state as demonstrated by orthogonal EC alignment, enhanced platelet adhesion at the stenosis, and aberrant leukocyte-EC interactions post stenosis. Clinical utility of the vascular model was further investigated by testing anti-thrombotic and immunomodulatory efficacy of aspirin and metformin, respectively. Overall, the platform enables multi-factorial analysis of critical atherogenic events including endothelial dysfunction, platelets and leukocyte adhesion, and can be further developed into a liquid biopsy tool for cardiovascular risk stratification.
