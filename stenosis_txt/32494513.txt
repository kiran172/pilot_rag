Title: Dysphagia as an Initial Manifestation of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

Abstract: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a clinicopathological condition characterized clinically by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, with typical endoscopic findings and intra-epithelial eosinophilia on biopsy. This case report focuses on the historical aspect of EoE, clinical manifestations, and correlation with immune disorders, medical management, and interventional management of EoE. We present a 20-year-old patient presenting with tightness in throat and odynophagia after the ingestion of certain foods. These symptoms resolve in two or three hours. Endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract visualizes esophageal stenosis, and histological examination of the biopsy specimen reveals increased eosinophils in the esophageal mucosa. The patient was treated with fluticasone inhaler and has shown improvement in symptoms. EoE is a chronic esophageal disorder that is increasing in incidence and prevalence in both pediatric and adult age groups. This case report accentuates the complications of EoE, and delays in diagnosis lead to strictures, and fibro-stenotic disease and punctual recognition can govern the course of the disease.
