Title: 3D Characterization of the Aortic Valve and Aortic Arch in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Patients.

Abstract: Patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) commonly have associated aortic stenosis and aortopathy. The geometry of the aortic arch and BAV is not well defined quantitatively, which makes clinical classifications subjective or reliant on limited 2D measurements. The goal of this study was to characterize the 3D geometry of the aortic arch and BAV using objective and quantitative techniques. Pre-TAVR computed tomography angiogram (CTA) in patients with BAV and aortic stenosis (AS) were analyzed (n = 59) by assessing valve commissural angle, presence of a fused region, percent of fusion, and calcium volume. The ascending aorta and aortic arch were reconstructed from patient-specific imaging segmentation to generate a centerline and calculate maximum curvature and maximum area change for the ascending aorta and the descending aorta. Aortic valve commissural angle signified a bimodal distribution suggesting tricuspid-like (≤ 150°, 52.5% of patients) and bicuspid-like (> 150°, 47.5%) morphologies. Tricuspid like was further classified by partial (10.2%) or full (42.4%) fusion, and bicuspid like was further classified into valves with fused region (27.1%) or no fused region (20.3%). Qualitatively, the aortic arch was found to have complex patient-specific variations in its 3D shape with some showing extreme diameter changes and kinks. Quantitatively, subgroups were established using maximum curvature threshold of 0.04 and maximum area change of 30% independently for the ascending and descending aorta. These findings provide insight into the geometric structure of the aortic valve and aortic arch in patients presenting with BAV and AS where 3D characterization allows for quantitative classification of these complex anatomic structures.
