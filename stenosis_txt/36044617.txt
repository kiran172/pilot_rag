Title: Technical Considerations for Dynamic Myocardial Computed Tomography Perfusion as Part of a Comprehensive Evaluation of Coronary Artery Disease Using Computed Tomography.

Abstract: Dynamic myocardial computed tomography perfusion (DM-CTP) has good diagnostic accuracy for identifying myocardial ischemia as compared with both invasive and noninvasive reference standards. However, DM-CTP has not yet been implemented in the routine clinical examination of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. An important hurdle in the clinical dissemination of the method is the development of the DM-CTP acquisition protocol and image analysis. Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide a review of critical parameters in the design and execution of DM-CTP to optimize each step of the examination and avoid common mistakes. We aim to support potential users in the successful implementation and performance of DM-CTP in daily practice. When performed appropriately, DM-CTP may support clinical decision making. In addition, when combined with coronary computed tomography angiography, it has the potential to shorten the time to diagnosis by providing immediate visualization of both coronary atherosclerosis and its functional relevance using one single modality.
