Title: Right posteroinferior bile duct angulation correlates with bile duct stone occurrence in patients with hepatolithiasis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the correlation between right posteroinferior bile duct (RPBD) angulation and the occurrence of bile duct stones in patients with hepatolithiasis.
METHODS: Patients presenting with hepatolithiasis in our hospital from January 2011 to July 2016 were divided into two groups according to whether their RPBD was affected by stones. A statistical analysis for the relevant factors associated with bile duct stone formation in the RPBD was performed.
RESULTS: The binary logistic regression results showed that stenosis of the right hepatic duct [odds ratio (OR): 7.313; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.131-12.945)] and the angle of the RPBD (OR 0.896; 95%CI 0.877-0.916) were risk factors associated with the formation of RPBD stones. Further, the receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that, when the angle of the RPBD was less than 44.58Â°, stones were able to form more easily in the RPBD.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of bile duct stones is well correlated with sharp bile duct angulation.
