Title: Cognitive function after carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients.

Abstract: Asymptomatic carotid stenosis has been shown to be associated with progressive neurocognitive decline, but the effects of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on this are not well defined. Due to the wide heterogeneity of studies and lack of standardization in cognitive function tests and study design, there is mounting scientific evidence to support the notion that CEA is effective in reversing or slowing neurocognitive decline; however, definitive conclusions are difficult to make. Further, while the association between ACS and cognitive decline has been well document, a direct etiological role has not been established. More research is required to elucidate the relationship between asymptomatic carotid stenosis and the benefit of carotid endarterectomy and its potential protective effects regarding cognitive decline. This article aims to review current evidence in preoperative and postoperative cognitive function in asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis undergoing CEA.
