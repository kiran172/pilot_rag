Title: Hybrid 3D bioprinting for advanced tissue-engineered trachea: merging fused deposition modeling (FDM) and top-down digital light processing (DLP).

Abstract: In this present study, we introduce an innovative hybrid 3D bioprinting methodology that integrates fused deposition modeling (FDM) with top-down digital light processing (DLP) for the fabrication of an artificial trachea. Initially, polycaprolactone (PCL) was incorporated using an FDM 3D printer to provide essential mechanical support, replicating the structure of tracheal cartilage. Subsequently, a chondrocyte-laden glycidyl methacrylated silk fibroin (Sil-MA) hydrogel was introduced via top-down DLP into the PCL scaffold (PCL-Sil scaffold). &#xD;The mechanical evaluation of PCL-Sil scaffolds showed that they have greater flexibility than PCL scaffolds, with a higher deformation rate (PCL-Sil scaffolds: 140.9±5.37% vs. PCL scaffolds: 124.3±6.25%) and ability to withstand more force before fracturing (3.860±0.140 N for PCL-Sil scaffolds vs. 2.502±0.126 N for PCL scaffolds, ***P < 0.001). Both types of scaffolds showed similar axial compressive strengths (PCL-Sil scaffolds: 4.276±0.127 MPa vs. PCL scaffolds: 4.291±0.135 MPa). Additionally, PCL-Sil scaffolds supported fibroblast proliferation, indicating good biocompatibility. In vivo testing of PCL-Sil scaffolds in a partial tracheal defect rabbit model demonstrated effective tissue regeneration. The scaffolds were pre-cultured in the omentum for two weeks to promote vascularization before transplantation. Eight weeks after transplantation into the animal, bronchoscopy and histological analysis confirmed that the omentum-cultured PCL-Sil scaffolds facilitated rapid tissue regeneration and maintained the luminal diameter at the anastomosis site without signs of stenosis or inflammation. Validation study to assess the feasibility of our hybrid 3D bioprinting technique showed that structures, not only the trachea but also the vertebral bone-disc and trachea-lung complex, were successfully printed. &#xD.
