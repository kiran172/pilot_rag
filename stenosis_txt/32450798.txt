Title: A noteworthy clue for diagnosing non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction by computed tomography without ECG synchronization: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although timely coronary intervention can result in markedly improved clinical outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), non-ST-elevation (NSTE)-ACS is sometimes difficult to accurately diagnose.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old woman complained of acute chest pain with sudden onset. Both electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography showed normal results, and we urgently needed to make a differential diagnosis among critical illnesses such as acute coronary syndrome and nonischemic cardiovascular life-threatening diseases. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) without ECG synchronization showed evidence of neither aortic dissection nor pulmonary embolism, but regionally reduced contrast enhancement in the posterior myocardium, which were suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Emergency coronary angiography demonstrated severe stenosis of the left circumflex artery, and we achieved favorable revascularization with drug-eluting stent deployment.
CONCLUSIONS: We diagnosed a patient with NSTE-ACS in whom contrast-enhanced CT without ECG synchronization was effective for visualization of reduced myocardial perfusion, suggesting ischemic heart disease.
