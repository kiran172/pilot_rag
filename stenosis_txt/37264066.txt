Title: Association of citrullination with the progression of aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Despite its clinical importance, biomarkers of disease activity in aortic stenosis (AS) are lacking. We investigated the association between anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and AS. All 678 patients who underwent echocardiography and anti-CCP antibody testing were analysed. Anti-CCP antibody status was categorized as negative, low-positive, and high-positive. In addition, aortic valve (AV) tissues were obtained from the patients with and without AS to analyze the presence of citrullinated proteins. At baseline, 241 (35.5%) subjects with AV degeneration had a higher rate of anti-CCP antibody positivity (42.7% versus 34.6%, p = 0.035) than those without AV degeneration. Out of the 331 (48.8%) subjects who underwent echocardiographic follow-up, progression of AS was observed in 34 (10.3%) patients, with a higher incidence in the high-positive group compared to the low-positive or negative group (19.0% vs. 11.3% vs. 8.4%, respectively; p = 0.041). On multivariable analysis, high anti-CCP antibody positivity was independently associated with progression to AS (odds ratio: 2.312; 95% confidence interval: 1.006-5.310; p = 0.048). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting revealed increased citrullination in diseased AV compared to normal AV tissue. This study demonstrated that a high positive anti-CCP antibody result is associated with AV degeneration and may be an independent factor for AS progression.
