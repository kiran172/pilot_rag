Title: Safety, efficacy, and selection strategy of laparoscopic local gastrectomy for gastrointestinal stromal tumors in the esophagogastric junction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety, efficacy, and selection strategy of laparoscopic local gastrectomy for stromal tumors in the esophagogastric junction.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with mesenchymal tumors in the esophagogastric junction were retrospectively enrolled from April 2018 to July 2021 in which the upper edge of the tumor is less than 2 cm from the Z-line or has invaded the Z-line <1/2 circumference. Surgical outcomes, complications, recover, and postoperative gastroesophageal reflux of both groups were compared.
RESULTS: 27 patients underwent wedge resection, and 11 underwent resection by opening all of the layers of the stomach wall. Operative time (90.0 vs. 181.8 min, respectively, P = 0.001) was shorter for the WR group vs. RASW. Blood loss (20 vs. 50 ml, respectively, P = 0.012) was less for the WR group vs. RASW. Recovery of the RASW group was slower in terms of time to pass gas (2 vs. 3 days, P = 0.034), time to oral intake (2 vs. 4 days, P = 0.007), time to semi-liquid food intake (4 vs. 8 days, P = 0.003), and postoperative hospitalization (5 vs. 8 days, P = 0.001) vs. WR. In terms of short-term complications (≤30 days), no significant between-group differences were observed. Cardia stenosis did not occur in either group. In the WR group, one patient experienced mild reflux at 6 months and recovered 1 year after surgery. In the RASW group, one patient experienced severe gastroesophageal reflux at 6 months and 1 year after surgery, which was not entirely relieved by taking antacids. No other patients have gastroesophageal reflux.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic local gastrectomy is safe and feasible for mesenchymal tumors in the esophagogastric junction in which the upper edge of the tumor is less than 2 cm from the Z-line or has invaded the Z-line <1/2 circumference, and has achieved an excellent short-term effect. The choice of surgery is based on the relationship between the tumor and the position of the cardia.
