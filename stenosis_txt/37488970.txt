Title: Factors affecting the primary patency of native arteriovenous fistulas after ultrasound-guided percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: By analyzing the clinical history, laboratory test indexes, and intraoperative ultrasound imaging data of patients receiving ultrasound-guided percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (UG-PTA) for the first time, the application value of UG-PTA in the treatment of peripheral stenosis of autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and the related factors affecting postoperative patency were investigated.
METHODS: A total of 381 patients with dysfunction of radio-cephalic AVF were treated with UG-PTA from June 2017 to September 2019. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 199 patients were included in this study. Baseline characteristics of patients, including demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, were collected. Kaplan-Meier's survival curve was used to demonstrate the cumulative primary patency rate of UG-PTA. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed on clinical, anatomic, biochemical, and medication variables to identify the predictors of postintervention primary patency.
RESULTS: The early technical success rate of UG-PTA was 98.4% (375/381). One hundred and ninety-nine patients, with an average age of 52.9 years, were analyzed, 97 of whom were males (48.7%). The median follow-up duration was 21 months. No major complication was observed. Postintervention primary patency rates were 87.7%, 75.8%, and 60.0% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. A previously failed AVF (HR, 1.935, 95% CI 1.071-3.494; p = .029) and an increased level of parathyroid hormone (HR per 100 pg/mL increase, 1.105; 95% CI 1.014-1.203; p = .004) were identified as independent negative predictors of primary patency of UG-PTA.
CONCLUSIONS: UG-PTA is a safe and effective method for the treatment of peripheral stenosis of AVF. Previously failed AVF and elevated parathyroid hormone levels are associated with lower primary patency rate.
