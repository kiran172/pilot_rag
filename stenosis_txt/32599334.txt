Title: Management of atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Challenges and therapeutic considerations.

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is very common among patients with severe aortic stenosis. Moreover, new onset AF (NOAF) is a frequent finding after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). There is a significant impact of AF on outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR including mortality, thrombo-embolic and bleeding events. There is lack of clear evidence about the optimal management of AF in TAVR patients. This review aims to summarize the epidemiology, predictors, prognosis, therapeutic considerations and challenges in the management of AF in patients undergoing TAVR.
