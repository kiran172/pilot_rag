Title: A retrospective comparison between laparoscopic and open ureteroneocystostomy for management of benign lower ureteral strictures: An experience in tertiary care centre of Eastern India.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The objective is to discover the etiopathogenesis of benign lower ureteric stricture in Eastern India and compare the outcome of open versus laparoscopic ureteroneocystostomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively 52 patients who underwent laparoscopic (n = 28) or open ureteroneocystostomy (n = 24) for lower ureteral stricture between January 2018and December 2021 were included. The demography, aetiology, radiologic imaging, intraoperative &amp; postoperative outcomes and follow-up data were collected and analysed.
RESULTS: The mean duration of follow up was 14.3 months. Lower ureteric stricture were common in females. The most common cause of the stricture was iatrogenic injury (42%). Other causes were tuberculosis, post-endourological surgery, obstructing mega ureter, endometriosis and idiopathic. Laparoscopic surgery had longer mean operative time (228 vs 171 min), less blood loss (166 vs 246 ml), lower VAS score (6.1 vs 7.22) and less need of post-operative analgesia (1.86 vs 2.36 days). The hospital stay (5.36 vs 6.77 days) and post-operative complications (none vs 3) were also significantly lower in laparoscopic group. Open surgery and laparoscopic surgery had success rate of 100% and 96.6% each.
CONCLUSIONS: Iatrogenic injury are the most common cause of ureteric stricture followed by tuberculosis. Laparoscopic approach is a feasible option in treatment of lower ureteric stricture as it offer comparable outcome to open procedure while offering the advantage of a minimal invasive technique. Stricture secondary to iatrogenic injury poses a different challenge due to presence of hard dense fibrosis. This is a complex reconstructive procedure and has a steep learning curve and demands high level of laparoscopic skill.
