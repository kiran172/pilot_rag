Title: Light-Induced Amaurosis-A Case Report and Brief Literature Review.

Abstract: Light-induced amaurosis is a rare manifestation of symptomatic carotid artery disease. Unlike amaurosis fugax, which is often attributed to embolic phenomenon associated with carotid artery disease, light-induced amaurosis has been associated with reduced perfusion to the eye, secondary to carotid artery disease, leading to retinal ischemia. The case described here is that of a 67-year-old male with bilateral vision loss in response to bright light. Imaging revealed severe internal carotid stenosis on the right and occlusion of the internal carotid artery on the left. Similar to previous cases reported in the literature, the symptoms resolved after carotid endarterectomy.
