Title: Retroperitoneal Aortobifemoral Bypass by a Combination of Horseshoe Kidney and Aortoiliac Occlusive Disease with Stent Thrombosis.

Abstract: Bilateral aorto-profunda femoris bypass with Dacron bifurcation graft was performed by a patient with aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) and horseshoe kidney (HSK) who had undergone stenting of the right common iliac artery and of the left superficial femoral artery with subsequent stent thrombosis as well as significant subrenal aortic stenosis. As endovascular treatment was not feasible and surgical treatment by means of transperitoneal incision would be associated with high risk of damage to the HSK, the operation was successfully accomplished through left pararectal retroperitoneal approach.
