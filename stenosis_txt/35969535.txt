Title: Utility of automated data-adaptive propensity score method for confounding by indication in comparative effectiveness study in real world Medicare and registry data.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Confounding by indication is a serious threat to comparative studies using real world data. We assessed the utility of automated data-adaptive analytic approach for confounding adjustment when both claims and clinical registry data are available.
METHODS: We used a comparative study example of carotid artery stenting (CAS) vs. carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in 2005-2008 when CAS was only indicated for patients with high surgical risk. We included Medicare beneficiaries linked to the Society for Vascular Surgery's Vascular Registry >65 years old undergoing CAS/CEA. We compared hazard ratios (HRs) for death while adjusting for confounding by combining various 1) Propensity score (PS) modeling strategies (investigator-specified [IS-PS] vs. automated data-adaptive [ada-PS]); 2) data sources (claims-only, registry-only and claims-plus-registry); and 3) PS adjustment approaches (matching vs. quintiles-adjustment with/without trimming). An HR of 1.0 was used as a benchmark effect estimate based on CREST trial.
RESULTS: The cohort included 1,999 CAS and 3,255 CEA patients (mean age 76). CAS patients were more likely symptomatic and at high surgical risk, and experienced higher mortality (crude HR = 1.82 for CAS vs. CEA). HRs from PS-quintile adjustment without trimming were 1.48 and 1.52 for claims-only IS-PS and ada-PS, 1.51 and 1.42 for registry-only IS-PS and ada-PS, and 1.34 and 1.23 for claims-plus-registry IS-PS and ada-PS, respectively. Estimates from other PS adjustment approaches showed similar patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: In a comparative effectiveness study of CAS vs. CEA with strong confounding by indication, ada-PS performed better than IS-PS in general, but both claims and registry data were needed to adequately control for bias.
