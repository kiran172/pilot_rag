Title: [Catheter-based and surgical treatment of mitral valve diseases].

Abstract: There is a broad spectrum of mitral valve diseases ranging from young patients with rheumatic mitral valve stenosis up to older patients with secondary mitral valve regurgitation and numerous comorbidities. A profound understanding of the etiology, anatomical characteristics of mitral valve diseases and current treatment options is necessary to be able to prepare a patient-centered treatment approach. The interdisciplinary collaboration of referring physicians, interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, heart failure and imaging specialists as well as anesthesiologists is a cornerstone of optimal patient treatment.
