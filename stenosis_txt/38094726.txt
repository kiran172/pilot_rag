Title: Severe Aortic Stenosis in a Pregnant Patient Displaced by the Ukrainian-Russian War.

Abstract: We describe the complex case of a 32-year-old pregnant woman with known severe aortic stenosis, who was displaced by the Ukrainian-Russian War. She arrived in the United Kingdom at 32 weeks' gestation speaking minimal English, but requiring urgent multidisciplinary care to facilitate appropriate antenatal, peripartum, and postpartum care.
