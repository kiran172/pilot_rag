Title: Renal and Mesenteric Artery Intervention.

Abstract: Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and may cause progressive renal disease and cardiac destabilization syndromes. Guideline-directed medical therapy is advised in all patients. Patients with refractory symptoms and hemodynamically significant stenoses are more likely to benefit from renal artery stent placement. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is an infrequent and difficult to diagnose illness. Due to robust collateralization, clinical symptoms from mesenteric artery stenosis or occlusion is uncommon. Atherosclerosis is the most common etiology of CMI. Current evidence suggests that, compared with open surgical repair, endovascular therapy is the most cost-effective choice for CMI.
