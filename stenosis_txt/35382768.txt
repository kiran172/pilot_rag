Title: De Winter electrocardiogram pattern due to type A aortic dissection: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: De Winter electrocardiograph (ECG) pattern is an atypical presentation of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to severe stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD). Complications of acute aortic dissection (AD) in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with de Winter sign are relatively rare and physicians may easily miss the diagnosis of AD. We report a case of patient with acute chest pain and de Winter ECG pattern due to AD involving the left main coronary artery (LM), LAD and left circumflex artery (LCX).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old male patient was initially diagnosed with AMI and then the diagnosis of acute AD was supported by transthoracic echocardiograph (TTE). After two stents were implanted respectively into the proximal LM-LAD and LM-LCX, he recovered from cardiogenic shock. Two months later, the patient underwent the surgery of ascending aorta replacement. After the surgery, there was no obvious chest discomfort during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: When an ECG shows a "de Winter pattern", we should also consider the possibility of AD which result in LAD occlusion. TTE is a useful tool in screening for AD. Further research is needed to prove that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be a useful treatment strategy in the case of AD leading to severe LAD occlusion and unstable hemodynamics when there's no condition to perform aortic replacement surgery immediately.
