Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Aortic Stenosis and Variable Ejection Fractions (<40%, 40%-49%, and >50%).

Abstract: We evaluated the safety and efficacy of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in aortic stenosis patients with mid-range ejection fraction (ASmrEF) and compared it to aortic stenosis patients with reduced ejection fraction (ASrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (ASpEF). TAVI cases were stratified by baseline ejection fraction (ASrEF, ASmrEF, ASpEF) and compared for characteristics, procedural outcomes, and change in echocardiographic parameters at 1 year and mortality over a 5-year follow-up. The final study population included 708 patients who underwent TAVI. ASmrEF patients presented with improved EF at 1-year after procedure (49.0 ± 9.8 at 1 year vs 43.0 ± 2.5 at baseline, p <0.001) and showed improvements in left ventricular (LV) diameters (LV end-diastolic diameter: 50.4 ± 6.0 at 1 year vs 53.0 ± 5.5 at baseline and LV end-systolic diameter 34.7 ± 7.8 at 1 year vs 39.5 ± 5.9 at baseline, p <0.001 for both). LVEF improved for patients with ASrEF but not in ASpEF patients. LV diameters did not improve for patients in either group. Procedural safety and success rates were similar between all heart failure groups. Survival rates over a 5-year follow-up post-TAVI were not different between patients with ASmrEF, ASrEF, and ASpEF (ASrEF 78.4%, ASmrEF 81.9%, ASpEF 78.3%, p = 0.327). TAVI for patients with ASmrEF is safe and effective and results in marked improvement of LV function and structure.
