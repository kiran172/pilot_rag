Title: In-Hospital Outcome In Patients With Acyanotic Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: The purpose of the study was to determine the in-hospital outcome and resource utilization in patients with acyanotic congenital heart disease (ACHD) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Current guidelines from professional societies do not support TAVR in patients with ACHD, likely from a lack of supportive evidence. Temporal trends in patients with ACHD undergoing TAVR were determined using the 2016-2018 National Inpatient Sample database appropriate ICS-10-PCS code. Stata 16.0 was used for statistical analysis. 0.87% of patients undergoing TAVR had concomitant ACHD, with ASD being the most common (78%). After matching, there was no increased risk of mortality in ACHD patients undergoing TAVR compared to patients without ACHD (OR 1.43, P = 0.59). Additionally, no difference was found in the incidence of overall cardiac complications between patients with ACHD and patients without ACHD, except STEMI (OR 4.16, 95% CI, 1.08-16.00, P = 0.038), which is likely due to more comorbidity burden in the later cohort. Complications such as acute kidney injury, ischemic stroke, and bleeding were similar. Hospital resource utilization was higher in the ACHD group in the form of increased length of stay and higher mean total cost. The comparable in-hospital all-cause mortality and complication rate in ACHD patients undergoing TAVR compared to patients without ACHD is encouraging and will be helpful to design future randomized controlled trials.
