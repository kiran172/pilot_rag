Title: The periprocedural and 30-day outcomes of carotid stenting in patients with carotid artery near-occlusion.

Abstract: The safety of endovascular revascularization in patients with carotid artery near occlusion (CANO) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the peri-procedural risk in CANO patients receiving carotid artery stenting (CAS). A prospective data base with retrospective review was performed to identify patients who underwent CAS with CANO from July 2006 to July 2020, and had at least 1-month clinical follow-up data. The primary endpoints were stroke, hyperperfusion syndrome, and death within 30 days after CAS. A total of 198 patients with carotid artery stenosis were enrolled including 92 patients with CANO and 106 age and sex-matched patients with 70-99% conventional carotid stenosis. Full distal carotid collapse was found in 45 CANO patients (45/92, 49%). The technical success rate was 100%. The CANO patients had significantly longer lesion lengths compared with those of the non-CANO group. The incidence of hyperperfusion syndrome was comparable (CANO: 2.2%, non-CANO: 0.9%, P = 0.598). The risks of ischemic stroke and death within 30 days were 1.1% and 0% in the CANO group; and 1.9% and 0.9%, in the non-CANO group, respectively, without statistical difference. In conclusion, CAS is safe for patients with CANO, with a similar low 30-day peri-procedural event rate comparable to those of non-CANO.
