Title: Impella CP to Impella 5.5 Uninterrupted Upgrade Using a Double Device Technique.

Abstract: For the first time, we present a novel technique that enables the exchange of the Impella CP (Abiomed Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts, USA) to the Impella 5.5 (Abiomed Inc.) with no interruption of mechanical support in patients with minimal left ventricular reserve. Specifically, the aortic valve is crossed with the Impella 5.5 whereas the Impella CP is still functioning within the left ventricle. The Impella 5.5 is then initiated, and the Impella CP is weaned. Finally, the Impella CP is pulled out into the descending aorta. This exchange provides continuous support with no hemodynamic disarrangement.
