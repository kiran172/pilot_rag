Title: Thoracoscopy Approach in Prone Position for Esophagoplasty in Children.

Abstract: Congenital esophageal stenosis (CES) is a very rare clinical condition found in 1 per 25,000 to 50,000 live births. There are three histological types of CES described: tracheobronchial remnants, fibromuscular stenosis (FMS), and membranous stenosis. The first-line treatment in most cases is the conservative treatment (dilatation with a Savary bougie or balloon), but in some CES types, dilatation may be ineffective or result in esophageal perforation with serious complications or lethal outcome. Resection of the stenotic segment and end-to-end esophageal anastomosis was formerly presented as the most common surgical treatment option for CES. However, esophagoplasty is a safe and feasible alternative for surgical treatment of esophageal stenosis in children. Our aim is to report two cases of FMS submitted to thoracoscopic esophagoplasty. Both cases started with dysphagia and refusal after transition to solid diet, at 6 months old, and the radiological examination showed stricture of the distal esophagus. Esophagoplasty was performed with the patients in prone position. The stenotic esophageal wall was incised longitudinally and transverse synthesis was performed. After surgery, the patients had prompt recovery, without recurrent stenosis, remaining asymptomatic, with good diet acceptance.
