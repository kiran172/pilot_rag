Title: Comparable efficacy and safety for bicuspid aortic valve stenosis patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with balloon-expandable or self-expanding valves using Wei's sizing method.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate whether proper sizing can improve the procedural and clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with new-generation self-expanding valves (SEVs) and balloon-expandable valves (BEVs) for treating bicuspid aortic stenosis (BAS).
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with Sapien 3 valves (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) or Evolut R/PRO valves (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) for severe BAS from 2017 to 2022. The primary endpoints were device success rate and major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCEs), including mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction or disabling stroke, transcatheter heart valve failure, or clinically relevant valve thrombosis during follow-up. Our team used a complementary approach of supraannular sizing in addition to the conventional annular sizing method (Wei's method) to guide the TAVR procedures.
RESULTS: We recruited a total of 75 consecutive patients, of whom 43 (57%) were treated with BEVs from October 2017 to June 2021, and 32 (43%) were treated with SEVs from July 2021 to December 2022. Device success was similar between the BEV and SEV groups (93% vs 94%; p > 0.99), and no cases of annular rupture occurred in either group. Similar rates of moderate-to-severe paravalvular leak were observed in the BEV and SEV groups (5% vs 6%, p > 0.99). At a median follow-up of 464 days, the MACCE rates were comparable between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, the presence of previous percutaneous coronary interventions (hazard ratio: 5.43; p = 0.039) and New York Heart Association functional class III/IV heart failure at 30 days of follow-up after TAVR (hazard ratio: 9.90; p = 0.037) were independently associated with long-term MACCEs.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety for BAS patients undergoing TAVR using either BEVs or SEVs when using Wei's sizing method.
