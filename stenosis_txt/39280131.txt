Title: Meatotomy and meatoplasty on meatal stenosis due to balanitis xerotica obliterans.

Abstract: Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the male genitalia that is mostly underdiagnosed and undertreatment. We presented a 40-year-old man with meatal stenosis and an inability to urinate. Discoloration at the tip of the penis was found, and he said it got wider as he grew up. We conducted meatotomy and meatoplasty to release obstruction. Early diagnosis is essential to avoid complications.
