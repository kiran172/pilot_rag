Title: Anesthetic Management of a Patient With Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome Undergoing Cerebral Revascularization Surgery-A Case Report.

Abstract: Arterial tortuosity syndrome is a rare hereditary autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder characterized by elongation and tortuosity of the large- and medium-sized arteries. We present the case of a 13-year old child with arterial tortuosity syndrome who underwent occipital encephaloduroarteriomyosynangiosis for posterior circulation insufficiency. The constellation of clinical features in our patient portended significant anesthetic concerns, including difficult airway due to craniofacial abnormalities, risk of stroke, and myocardial infarction due to intracerebral and coronary arterial tortuosity and stenosis. The pertinent anesthetic implications are summarized, and we describe the anesthetic technique and use of multimodal neuromonitoring relevant for the case.
