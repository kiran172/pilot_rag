Title: The use of postoperative calibrations in Hirschsprung disease: a practice to reconsider?

Abstract: PURPOSE: Daily postoperative anal dilations after endorectal pull-through for Hirschsprung disease (HD) are still considered a common practice. We analyzed the potential risks of this procedure and its effectiveness compared to a new internal protocol.
METHODS: All infants (< 6 months of age) who underwent transanal endorectal pull-through between January 2021 and January 2023 were prospectively enrolled in a new postoperative protocol group without daily anal dilations (Group A) and compared (1:2 fashion) to those previously treated by postoperative anal dilations (Group B). Patients were matched for age and affected colonic tract. Patients with associated syndromes, extended total intestinal aganglionosis, and presence of enterostomy were excluded. Outcomes considered were: anastomotic complications (stenosis, disruption/leakage), incidence of enterocolitis, and constipation.
RESULTS: Eleven patients were included in group A and compared to 22 matched patients (group B). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of anastomotic complications between the two groups. We found a lower incidence of enterocolitis and constipation among group A (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively).
CONCLUSION: A non-dilation strategy after endorectal pull-through could be a feasible alternative and does not significantly increase the risk of postoperative anastomotic complications. Moreover, some preliminary advantages such as lower enterocolitis rate and constipation should be further investigated.
