Title: Increased circulating levels of MIP-1α and CD14 are associated with the presence of severe stenosis and hypoechoic plaques in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid atherosclerosis, a major cause of ischemic cerebrovascular events, is characterized by a pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant vascular microenvironment. The current risk score models based on traditional risk factors for cardiovascular risk assessment have some limitations. The identification of novel blood biomarkers could be useful to improve patient management. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of selected inflammation- and oxidative stress-related markers with the presence of severe stenosis and/or vulnerable plaques.
METHODS: Circulating levels of soluble CD40 ligand, interleukin-10, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, endoglin, CD163, CD14, E-selectin, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, C-Reactive protein, CD40 L + T lymphocytes, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione reductase activity, and protein carbonyl content were determined in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: Multiparametric analysis showed significantly higher levels of MIP-1α in patients with stenosis ≥70% than in patients with stenosis <70%, and significantly higher levels of CD14 in patients with hypoechoic (vulnerable) lesions compared to those with hyperechoic (stable) ones. The area under the curve obtained by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 0.7253 for MIP-1α and 0.6908 for CD14.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that circulating MIP-1α and CD14 levels are associated with the presence of advanced stenosis and of vulnerable carotid plaques.
