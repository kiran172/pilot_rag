Title: The relationship between preoperative predictive factors for clinical outcome in patients operated for lumbar spinal stenosis by decompressive laminectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Our hypothesis was that by identifying certain preoperative predictive factors, we could favorably impact clinical outcomes in patients undergoing decompressive surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: In this retrospective study, there were 65 patients (2016-2018) with symptomatic LSS who underwent decompressive laminectomy without fusion. Their clinical outcomes were assessed utilizing the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Multiple preoperative variables were studied to determine which ones would help predict improved outcomes: gender, age, body mass index (BMI), general/neurological examination, smoking, and drug therapies (anxiolytics and/or antidepressants).
RESULTS: All patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement on the ODI. Multivariate analysis revealed that those with higher preoperative BMI had significantly lower ODI on 1-year follow-up examinations, reflecting poorer outcomes. Postoperatively, 44 patients (67%) exhibited lower utilization of anxiolytic medications, 52 patients (80%) showed reduced use of antidepressant drugs, and pain medications utilization was reduced in 33 patients (50%).
CONCLUSION: Decompressive laminectomy without fusion effectively managed LSS. It reduced patients' use of pain, anxiety, and antidepressant medications. In addition, we found that increased preoperative BMIs contributed to poorer postoperative outcomes (e.g., ODI values).
