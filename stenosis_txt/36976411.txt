Title: Risk and risk factor of ischemic stroke after acute retinal arterial ischemia.

Abstract: PURPOSES: We aimed to confirm the risk and risk factor for ischemic stroke after acute retinal arterial ischemia (ARAI).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with a diagnosis of acute retinal arterial ischemia (ARAI) and completing 2-year follow-up was conducted from January 2015 to December 2021 at a general hospital.
RESULTS: A total of 69 patients including 43(62.3%) patients of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), 11(15.9%) patients of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) and 15(21.7%) patients of ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO) were included in the study. Patients age was 58.2 ± 13.0(years), male patients accounting for 51 (73.9%) and 22 (31.9%) patients having at least 70% ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis (ICAS). During the 2-years follow-up period, 11(15.9%) patients of ARAI experienced ischemic stroke. Among them, 3(20%) patients of OAO, 6(14%) patients of CRAO and 2(18.2%) patients of BRAO had ischemic stroke. The cumulative probabilities of ischemic stroke were 13.0% at 12.9 months and 15.9% at 24 months after ARAI. In addition, patients with at least 70% ICAS were more likely than patients without it to have ischemic stroke (p = 0.002). After Cox regression analysis, ICAS (≥ 70%) or occlusion was significantly associated with a high risk of ischemic stroke after ARAI during the 2-years follow-up time (HR,6.769,95%CI [1.792-25.578], p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Patients have a high risk of ischemic stroke, particularly those with a diagnosis of ICAS (≥ 70%) or occlusion after the onset of ARAI. Clinical management of ARAI should focus on vascular risk factors control and secondary prevention for stroke.
