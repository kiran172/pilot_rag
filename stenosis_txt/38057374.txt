Title: The role of carotid artery stenosis in predicting stroke after coronary artery bypass grafting in a Chinese cohort study.

Abstract: Current guidelines give priority to surgical treatment of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), especially in symptomatic patients. Carotid artery stenting is an alternative treatment for narrowing of the carotid arteries. This study sought to demonstrate the role of severe CAS in predicting stroke after CABG and assess the efficacy of carotid artery stenting in preventing postoperative stroke in a Chinese cohort. From 2015 to 2021, 1799 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery were retrospectively recruited in a Chinese cohort. The predictive value of severe CAS in postoperative stroke and carotid stenting in preventing postoperative stroke was statistically analyzed. The incidence of postoperative stroke was 1.67%. The incidence of CAS with stenosis ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% was 19.2% and 6.9%. After propensity matching, the incidence of stroke was 8.0% in the severe CAS group and 0% in the non-severe CAS group. We successfully established an optimal predictive nomogram for predicting severe CAS in patients undergoing CABG. Carotid artery stenting was found ineffective in preventing postoperative stroke. The present study provides the incidence of CAS and postoperative stroke in a Chinese cohort, identifies severe CAS as an independent risk factor for postoperative stroke after CABG, constructs a nomogram predicting the incidence of severe CAS, and evaluates the effectiveness of carotid artery stenting in preventing postoperative stroke after CABG.
