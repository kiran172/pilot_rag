Title: Endoscopic Management of Surgical Complications of Bariatric Surgery.

Abstract: Bariatric surgery, although highly effective, may lead to several surgical complications like ulceration, strictures, leaks, and fistulas. Newer endoscopic tools have emerged as safe and effective therapeutic options for these conditions. This article reviews post-bariatric surgery complications and the role of endoscopy in their management.
