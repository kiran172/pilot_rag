Title: African Americans have worse outcomes after transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement: A national inpatient sample analysis from 2015 to 2020.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are controversial among African Americans (AA). This study investigated racial disparities comparing AA and Caucasians undergoing aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: Patients who underwent SAVR and TAVR for aortic stenosis were identified in National Inpatient Sample from Q4 2015-2020. In-hospital perioperative outcomes, length of stay, days from admission to operation, and total hospital charge, were compared between AA and Caucasians using multivariable analysis, adjusting for sex, age, socioeconomic status, comorbidity, and hospital characteristics.
RESULTS: In TAVR, 51,394 (84.41 %) were Caucasians and 2433 (4.00 %) were AA. In SAVR, there were 50,080 (78.52 %) Caucasians and 3565 (5.59 %) AA. Compared to Caucasians, AA underwent TAVR had a higher risk of complications such as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.335, p = 0.02)], respiratory complications (aOR = 1.363, p = 0.01), acute kidney injury (AKI) (aOR = 1.468, p < 0.01), pulmonary embolism (aOR = 4.65, p = 0.05), hemorrhage/hematoma (aOR = 1.202, p < 0.01), or superficial wound complication (aOR = 1.414, p = 0.04). AA who underwent SAVR had higher risks of morality (aOR = 1.184, p < 0.05) and surgical complications including MACE (aOR = 1.263, p < 0.01), pericardial complications (aOR = 1.563, p < 0.01), cardiogenic shock (aOR = 1.578, p < 0.01), respiratory complications (aOR = 1.261, p < 0.01), AKI (aOR = 1.642, p < 0.01), venous thromboembolism (aOR = 1.613, p < 0.01), hemorrhage/hematoma (aOR = 1.129, p < 0.01), infection (aOR = 1.234, p < 0.01), superficial wound complications (aOR = 1.756, p < 0.01), vascular complications (aOR = 1.592, p < 0.01), and diaphragmatic paralysis (aOR = 2.181, p = 0.02). In both TAVR and SAVR, AA had longer waiting times from admission to operation (p < 0.01), longer hospital stays (p < 0.01), and higher hospital charges (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: AA were underrepresented, especially in TAVR. AA experienced higher in-hospital mortality post-SAVR, but not after TAVR. Furthermore, AA had more complications for both TAVR and SAVR. These findings underscore the pronounced disparities among AA in aortic valve replacement.
