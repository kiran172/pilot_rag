Title: Association between BMI-based metabolic phenotypes and prevalence of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis: a cross-sectional study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) have been acknowledged to commonly co-exist and lead to increased risks of stroke, whereas the association between various BMI-based metabolic phenotypes and development of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) remained controversial.
METHODS: A total of 5355 participants were included from the Asymptomatic Polyvascular Abnormalities Community (APAC) study. Participants were categorized into six groups according to their body mass index (BMI) and MetS status. ICAS was assessed using transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasonography. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate the association between BMI-based metabolic phenotypes and ICAS.
RESULTS: 704 participants were diagnosed with ICAS. Compared to the metabolic healthy normal weight (MH-NW) group, the metabolic unhealthy normal weight (MUH-NW) group demonstrated a higher risk of ICAS (full-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-2.57), while no significant association was observed in the metabolic unhealthy obesity (MUO) group (full-adjusted OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.70-1.65) and other metabolic healthy groups regardless of BMI. The results were consistent across gender, age, smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity subgroups.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that MUH-NW individuals had a significant association with increased risk of ICAS compared with MH-NW individuals.
