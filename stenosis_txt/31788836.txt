Title: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell microRNAs in coronary artery disease.

Abstract: The accuracy of risk prediction for coronary artery disease can be improved with the use of novel molecular or genetic biomarkers. In this study, we investigated the difference of five selected microRNAs (miR or miRNA) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and controls, assessed by coronary angiography. The study population consisted of 85 subjects, aged between 18 and 75 years and underwent invasive coronary angiography. Subjects with more than 30% stenosis in at least one coronary artery, patients with a history of prior percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary by-pass surgery were allocated to the patient group; whereas the subjects without at least 30% stenosis consisted the control group. Groups were similar in age, presence of hypertension, and smoking status. However, the proportion of males and subjects taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, nitrates, and statins were higher in the patient group. miR-221 and miR-155 were downregulated (P = .02 and .001, respectively), while miR-21 levels were significantly increased (P = .003) in the patient group compared to controls. Changes in miR-145 and miR-126 did not reach statistical significance (P > .05). miRNA- 21, miR-155, and miR-221 were differentially expressed between the patients and controls. miRNAs are promising biomarkers for CAD diagnosis, however, this requires further research with larger groups.
