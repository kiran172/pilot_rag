Title: Phase-III Clinical Trial of Fluorine-18 Flurpiridaz Positron Emission Tomography for Evaluation of Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fluorine-18 flurpiridaz is a novel positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging tracer.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the diagnostic efficacy of flurpiridaz PET versus technetium-99m-labeled single photon emission computed tomography SPECT for the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD), defined as ≥50% stenosis by quantitative invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Flurpiridaz safety was also evaluated.
METHODS: In this phase III prospective multicenter clinical study, 795 patients with known or suspected CAD from 72 clinical sites in the United States, Canada, and Finland were enrolled. A total of 755 patients were evaluable, and the mean age was 62.3 ± 9.5 years, 31% were women, 55% had body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, and 71% had pharmacological stress. Patients underwent 1-day rest-stress (pharmacological or exercise) flurpiridaz PET and 1- or 2-day rest-stress Tc-99m-labeled SPECT and ICA. Images were read by 3 experts blinded to clinical and ICA data.
RESULTS: Sensitivity of flurpiridaz PET (for detection of ≥50% stenosis by ICA) was 71.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 67.0% to 76.3%), significantly (p < 0.001) higher than SPECT (53.7% [95% CI: 48.5% to 58.8%]), while specificity did not meet the prespecified noninferiority criterion (76.2% [95% CI: 71.8% to 80.1%] vs. 86.6% [95% CI: 83.2% to 89.8%]; p = NS). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated superior discrimination of CAD by flurpiridaz PET versus SPECT in the overall population, in women, obese patients, and patients undergoing pharmacological stress testing (p < 0.001 for all). Flurpiridaz PET was superior to SPECT for defect size (p < 0.001), image quality (p < 0.001), diagnostic certainty (p < 0.001), and radiation exposure (6.1 ± 0.4 mSv vs. 13.4 ± 3.2 mSv; p < 0.001). Flurpiridaz PET was safe and well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: Flurpiridaz PET myocardial perfusion imaging shows promise as a new tracer for CAD detection and assessment of women, obese patients, and patients undergoing pharmacological stress testing. A second phase III Food and Drug Administration trial is ongoing. (A Phase 3 Multi-center Study to Assess PET Imaging of Flurpiridaz F 18 Injection in Patients with CAD; NCT01347710).
