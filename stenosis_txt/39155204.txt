Title: Epidemiology and risk factors for angiodysplasias of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract: A large population-based study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal angiodysplasia (GIAD) is a rare diagnosis among the general population. We aimed to identify risk factors for GIADs and to determine the frequency rate in the general population.
METHODS: A population-based retrospective study was performed including patients diagnosed with upper (stomach/duodenum) or lower (small bowel/colon) GIADs based on diagnostic codes from a large health maintenance organization. Control groups were matched for age and gender. Additional data including demographics, comorbidities, malignancies, and medications were collected.
RESULTS: 991 upper GIADs and 3336 lower GIADs were included, compared to 7217 and 32,802 controls. The overall prevalence of GIAD was 0.092 %. 88 % of the upper and 85 % of the lower GIADs were diagnosed at ages â‰¥60, peaking at a prevalence of 0.37 % for ages 71-80. The most significant risk factors for GIADs included liver cirrhosis (OR 4.0 for lower GIAD and OR 7.0 for upper GIAD, p < 0.001), hypertension (OR 2.3 for lower GIAD and OR 2.8 for upper GIAD, p < 0.001) and aortic stenosis (OR 2.8 for lower GIAD and OR 2.0 for upper GIAD, p < 0.001). Other significant risk factors included ischemic heart disease, chronic renal failure, female gender, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interestingly, both upper and lower GIADs were found to be significantly less frequent in patients with malignancy.
CONCLUSION: Identification of the clinical conditions and demographic factors associated with GIAD may improve our understanding of the etiology and the optimal treatment modalities for this rare condition.
