Title: Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis and Noncardiac Surgery.

Abstract: The patient with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis presenting for elective noncardiac surgery poses a unique challenge. These patients are not traditionally offered surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve replacement given their lack of symptoms; however, they are at increased risk for postsurgical complications given the severity of their aortic stenosis. The decision to proceed with elective noncardiac surgery should be based on individual and surgical risk factors. However, severity of aortic stenosis is not accounted for in current surgical risk factor assessment scoring; therefore, extensive communication with patients and surgical teams is necessary to minimize a patient's risk. A clear intraoperative plan should be designed to manage the unique hemodynamics of these patients, and a discussion should address postoperative placement.
