Title: Carotid artery stenting with flow inversion cerebral protection and MicroNet-covered stent.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The study aims to evaluate the association of proximal flow-inversion cerebral protection and MicroNet-covered CGuard stents in reducing early and late embolic events in carotid artery stenting procedures.
METHODS: From 2018 to 2023, we performed 204 procedures in 180 patients with flow inversion cerebral protection and CGuard stents at the Vascular Surgery Unit of Sant'Eugenio Hospital in Rome. Cerebral protection was achieved with a Flow-Gate2 catheter connected to a peripheral vein. The tip balloon is inflated in the CCA to obtain an effective endoclamping, the pressure difference between the carotid bifurcation and the venous compartment ensures a constant back flow with wash-out in the venous compartment. Inclusion criteria were: life expectancy of >12 months, target lesions indicating treatment according to ESVS Guidelines, increased surgical risk due to comorbidities or anatomic issues. ECD follow-up was performed immediately postoperatively, at 30 days, 6 and 12 months, and subsequently annually.
RESULTS: The treatment protocol was successfully implemented in 99% of cases. No major strokes occurred, while one minor stroke (0.5%) occurred within 8 hours of the procedure, regressing in the following months. One perioperative death (0.5%) due to cerebral hemorrhage occurred three hours after the procedure. All patients remained asymptomatic, with no short or medium-term neurological score deterioration. One hemodynamically significant restenosis (0.5%) was detected at the 6-month follow-up. All patients completed the 6 months follow-up, though 6 (3%) were lost at the 12-month appointment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective monocentric study has demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of the FlowGate2 flow inversion cerebral protection system in association with MicroNet covered CGuard stent.
