Title: Upper airway and tracheostomy management in patients with COVID-19: A long-term acute care hospital (LTACH).

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Describe the tracheostomy and ventilation management of patients admitted due to COVID-19 as facilitated by speech language pathologists (SLPs) and otolaryngologists within the long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) setting.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Long-term acute care hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients admitted to RML Specialty Hospital for respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 from April 1, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Demographic information, laryngeal findings, and tracheostomy management was reviewed. Descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Amongst the 213 subjects, 80.0 % arrived on mechanical ventilation. 23.0 % required otolaryngology consultation during LTACH stay due to poor Passy Muir Valve (PMV) or tracheostomy capping tolerance. 35 (71.4 %) of those consulted had abnormal laryngeal findings on exam with subglottic/tracheal stenosis and laryngeal edema being most common at 38.8 % and 20.4 %, respectively. 28.6 % of those with laryngeal findings were decannulated by discharge. Mechanical ventilator weaning and decannulation success were 86.6 % and 62.5 %, respectively. No association (p > 0.05) between number of intubations and abnormal laryngeal findings were found. No association (p > 0.05) between number of intubations or prone-positioning and decannulation success at discharge were found.
CONCLUSION: LTACHs can serve a specific role in upper airway rehabilitation and tracheostomy care in the post COVID-19 period. SLPs and otolaryngologists should be involved in the care of these patients to help facilitate decannulation and return to normal laryngeal function.
