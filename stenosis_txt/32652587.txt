Title: Thoracoatrial discordance in a case of twisted atrioventricular connections: A unique configuration of visceroatrial arrangement.

Abstract: We present a case of a 12-year-old boy with discordance between the atrial arrangement and the thoracoabdominal arrangement in the setting of twisted atrioventricular connections. This case highlights the importance of a separate description of all visceral organs and venous drainage for an accurate description of visceroatrial arrangement in cases of congenital heart defects.
