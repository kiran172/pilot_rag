Title: Comparison of endoscopic balloon dilation and surgery for duodenal stricture in patients with Crohn's disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Few studies have compared endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) and surgery in the treatment of duodenal stricture in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to compare the efficacy and safety among patients with CD-associated duodenal stricture treated with EBD or surgery from October 2013 to December 2021. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate factors associated with recurrence-free or surgery-free survival.
RESULTS: A total of 48 eligible patients were included, including 30 patients treated with EBD only and 18 patients treated with surgery. Patients treated with surgery experienced more symptomatic improvement (100% vs. 63.33%, p = 0.003) and significantly longer recurrence-free survival (6.31 [IQR: 3.00-8.39] years vs. 2.96 [IQR: 1.06-5.42] years, p = 0.01) but suffered more postprocedural adverse events (16.67% vs. 0.74% per procedure, p = 0.001). In patients initially treated with EBD (n = 41), a total of 11 (26.83%) required subsequent surgical intervention. Younger age at CD diagnosis (HR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81-1.00, p = 0.04) was associated with a higher risk for subsequent surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for CD-associated duodenal strictures was associated with a longer recurrence-free survival. EBD was safe and effective with minimal postprocedural adverse events but led to a high frequency of recurrence.
