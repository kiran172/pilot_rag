Title: Correlation of sLOX-1 Levels and MR Characteristics of Culprit Plaques in Intracranial Arteries with Stroke Recurrence.

Abstract: (1) Background: Symptomatic intracranial artery atherosclerosis (sICAS) is an important cause of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and is associated with a high risk of stroke recurrence. High-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (HR-MR-VWI) is an effective method for evaluating atherosclerotic plaque characteristics. Soluble lectin-like oxidised low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (sLOX-1) is closely associated with plaque formation and rupture. We aim to explore the correlation between sLOX-1 levels and culprit plaque characteristics, based on HR-MR-VWI, with stroke recurrence in patients with sICAS. (2) Methods: A total of 199 patients with sICAS underwent HR-MR-VWI between June 2020 and June 2021 in our hospital. The culprit vessel and plaque characteristics were assessed according to HR-MR-VWI, and sLOX-1 levels were measured by ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). Outpatient follow-up was performed 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after discharge. (3) Results: sLOX-1 levels were significantly higher in the recurrence group than in the non-recurrence group (p &lt; 0.001). The culprit plaque thickness, degree of stenosis and plaque burden were higher in the recurrence group than in the non-recurrence group (p = 0.003, p = 0.014 and p = 0.010, respectively). The incidence of hyperintensity on T1WI, positive remodelling and significant enhancement (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.003 and p = 0.027, respectively) was higher in the recurrence group than in the non-recurrence group. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with sLOX-1 levels &gt; 912.19 pg/mL and hyperintensity on T1WI in the culprit plaque had a higher risk of stroke recurrence (both p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that sLOX-1 &gt; 912.19 pg/mL (HR = 2.583, 95%CI 1.142, 5.846, p = 0.023) and hyperintensity on T1WI in the culprit plaque (HR = 2.632, 95% CI 1.197, 5.790, p = 0.016) were independent risk factors for stroke recurrence. sLOX-1 levels were significantly associated with the culprit plaque thickness (r = 0.162, p = 0.022), degree of stenosis (r = 0.217, p = 0.002), plaque burden (r = 0.183, p = 0.010), hyperintensity on T1WI (F = 14.501, p &lt; 0.001), positive remodelling (F = 9.602, p &lt; 0.001), and significant enhancement (F = 7.684, p &lt; 0.001) (4) Conclusions: sLOX-1 levels were associated with vulnerability of the culprit plaque and can be used as a supplement to HR-MR-VWI to predict stroke recurrence.
