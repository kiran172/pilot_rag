Title: Electrocardiographic Changes with Age in Japanese Patients with Noonan Syndrome.

Abstract: Little information is available on age-related electrocardiographic changes in patients with Noonan syndrome. This single-center study evaluated the electrocardiograms of patients with Noonan syndrome. We divided the patients (n = 112; electrocardiograms, 256) into four groups according to age: G1 (1 month-1 year), G2 (1-6 years), G3 (6-12 years), and G4 (&gt;12 years). Typical Noonan syndrome-related electrocardiographic features such as left-axis deviation, abnormal Q wave, wide QRS complex, and small R wave in precordial leads were detected. A high percentage of QRS axis abnormalities was found in all groups. Significant differences in right-axis deviation (RAD) were noted among the groups: 56.5% of G1 patients showed RAD compared with 33.3% of G2, 21.1% of G3, and 19.2% of G4 patients. The small R was also significantly different among the groups: 32.6% of G1 patients showed a small R wave compared with 14.9% of G2, 8.5% of G3, and 15.4% of G4 patients. Of the 53 patients with Noonan syndrome aged 1 month to 2 years, 18 had T-positive V1 with a higher prevalence of pulmonary stenosis and cardiac interventions. QRS axis abnormalities, small R in V6, and T-positive V1 could help diagnose Noonan syndrome in infants or young children.
