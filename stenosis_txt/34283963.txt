Title: David Operation for Insufficient Pulmonary Autograft After Ross-Konno Procedure.

Abstract: We report the case of a 25-year-old woman who developed severe aortic regurgitation because of pulmonary autograft root dilatation late after Ross-Konno procedure. The geometric heights of all 3 cusps were relatively small, allowing for the David operation with a 24-mm straight graft. We carefully dissected the aortic root and, the dissection process was relatively straightforward, and the basal ring could be sutured properly. The latest follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal autograft valve function and mild aortic regurgitation. Even in the Ross-Konno procedure, valve-sparing root replacement is possible, as in the Ross procedure.
