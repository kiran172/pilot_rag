Title: In-Hospital Outcomes of Combined Coronary Revascularization and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Inpatient Nationwide Analysis.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is accepted as an alternative to surgery, but data on combined percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and TAVI during the same in-hospital stay are still lacking. Using the national inpatient sample (NIS) database, we identified all TAVI encounters and compared in-hospital outcomes of patients who had TAVI only to patients who had TAVI and PCI. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR). Of 291,810 patient encounters with TAVI, 13,114 (4.5%) had combined PCI during the same index admission. The average age was 79.61 ± 8.61 years in the TAVI-only vs 80.25 ± 8.73 years in the combined TAVI-PCI group. Combined TAVI and PCI was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (4.5% vs 1.8%, aOR: 2.3), stroke (4.7% vs 2.9%, aOR: 1.4), net adverse events (NAE) (20.2% vs 5.7%, aOR: 3.6), major bleeding (40.1% vs 24.3%, aOR: 1.8), vascular complications (10.6% vs 2.5%, aOR: 3.9), acute kidney injury (AKI) (23.3% vs 11.7%, aOR: 2.1), hemodialysis (HD) (4.2% vs 2.4%, aOR: 1.4), postoperative cardiogenic shock (1.2% vs 0.4%, aOR: 2.8), need for mechanical circulatory support (6.9% vs 1%, aOR: 7); p-value < 0.001 for all. The utilization of permanent pacemakers was similar between the groups (9.8% vs 9.2%, aOR: 1; p = 0.6). Combining TAVI and PCI during the same index admission is associated with worse outcomes. The decision to do PCI for patients undergoing TAVI should be individualized and tailored based on the patient's clinical conditions.
