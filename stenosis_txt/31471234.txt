Title: Impact of plaque dilation before carotid artery stent deployment.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Plaque stability is of utmost importance for stroke prevention in the perioperative period (within 24 hours) following carotid artery stenting (CAS). Although carotid plaque is entrapped between stent struts after stent deployment, postdilation can cause a scissoring effect on the plaque, increasing the risk of postprocedural embolic events due to plaque prolapse. Maximum carotid plaque dilation before stent deployment may reduce this risk. This study analyzed the effect of maximum dilation of the carotid plaque before stent deployment (max-pre-SD) or after stent deployment (post-SD) on macroscopic plaque debris, hemodynamic depression (HD), and immediate major adverse events.
METHODS: This prospective nonrandomized multicenter study analyzed patients treated for carotid artery stenosis with CAS from January 2014 to August 2016. Clinical and morphologic characteristics and operative details were analyzed with logistic regression analysis for macroscopic debris and HD. The number of microembolic signals (MESs) was assessed by transcranial Doppler and analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 309 patients were enrolled and treated with standard CAS performed using a proximal occlusion cerebral embolic protection device; 149 received max-pre-SD and 160 were treated with post-SD. Technical success was achieved in 100% of cases. Macroscopic debris and HD were significantly different between the two groups in favor of max-pre-SD (P < .001). A significant difference in intraprocedural MESs between the groups was detected. Compared with post-SD, max-pre-SD significantly reduced mean MES counts (8.1% vs 68.1%; P < .001). Patients treated with post-SD had a significantly increased risk of MESs in the immediate postoperative period compared with patients treated with max-pre-SD (41.9% vs 1.3%; P < .001).This result was mainly due to the small number of events encountered. Patients treated with post-SD had a 12-fold increased risk of macroscopic debris collection (odds ratio [OR], 12.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.68-26.87; P < .001) and an 18 times increase in HD risk (OR, 17.80; 95% CI, 5.27-60.17; P < .001) compared with patients treated with max-pre-SD. The heterogeneous, mainly echolucent plaque type significantly highly increased the risk of macroscopic debris (OR, 78.45; 95% CI, 8.70-707.09; P < .001) while acting as a protective factor against HD (OR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.006-0.11; P < .001) along with echogenic or echolucent complex plaques with irregular surface plaque types (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.031-0.336; P < .001). No significant differences between groups (max-pre-SD group and post-SD) were detected in immediate major adverse events (minor stroke, 2.0% and 2.5% [P = .461]; major stroke, 0% and 0.6% [P = .334], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Max-pre-SD seems to be a safe and feasible technical modification to the CAS procedure. Macroscopic debris, HD, and MESs are significantly reduced compared with CAS with post-SD. Further research with larger, randomized cohorts of patients is required to establish the superiority of this technical modification.
