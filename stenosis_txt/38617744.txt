Title: Pediatric stricturing Crohn's disease.

Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. The incidence of pediatric CD is increasing and is currently 2.5-11.4 per 100000 world-wide. Notably, approximately 25% of children with CD develop stricturing CD (SCD) that requires intervention. Symptomatic stricturing diseases refractory to pharmacological management frequently require non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies include endoscopic balloon dilatation, stricturoplasty, and surgical resection of the strictured segment. However, strictures tend to recur postoperatively regardless of treatment modality. The lifetime risk of surgery in patients with childhood SCD remains at 50%-90%. Thus, new and emerging strategies, advanced diagnostic tools, and minimally invasive approaches are under investigation to improve the outcomes and overall quality of life of pediatric patients with SCD.
