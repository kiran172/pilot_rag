Title: Scoping review of atherectomy and intravascular lithotripsy with or without balloon angioplasty in below-the-knee lesions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We evaluated how contemporary data on infrapopliteal vessel preparation have been reported to identify knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research.
METHODS: A literature search was performed on Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar to identify clinical research studies reporting on the outcomes of vessel preparation in below-the-knee lesions between 2006 and 2021. Studies were excluded if they were case reports or case series with a sample size of <10.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies comprising 5450 patients were included in this review, with vessel preparation performed in 2179 cases (40%). Of the 15 studies, 2 were randomized controlled trials, 6 were prospective cohort studies, and 7 were retrospective studies. Only 2 of the 15 studies evaluated intravascular lithotripsy devices, and 6 were noncomparative studies. The mean diameter stenosis treated was 86.7% ± 12.6%, and the lesion length was 71.7 ± 55.3 mm. Large heterogeneity was found in the choice and definitions of end points and lesion characterization. Procedural success ranged between 84% and 90%, and bailout stenting was performed in 0.8% to 15% of cases. Of the five studies comparing procedural success of atherectomy with or without balloon angioplasty to balloon angioplasty alone, only one was in favor of the former (99% vs 90%; P &lt; .001). The remaining studies did not show any statistically significant differences. Similarly, atherectomy had a significantly superior limb salvage rate in only one of seven studies (91% vs 73%; P = .036). In contrast, the seven studies evaluating target lesion revascularization reported conflicting outcomes, with two in favor of atherectomy, two against atherectomy, and three reporting similar outcomes between atherectomy and balloon angioplasty alone. None of the studies evaluating intravascular lithotripsy was comparative.
CONCLUSIONS: The current body of evidence on vessel preparation in tibial arteries is largely based on observational studies with a large amount of heterogeneity and a number of inconsistencies. Further clinical and experimental studies with more robust study designs are warranted to investigate the comparative efficacy and safety of vessel preparation in calcified tibial arteries.
