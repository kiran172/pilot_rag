Title: Cilostazol Addition to Aspirin could not Reduce the Neurological Deterioration in TOAST Subtypes: ADS Post-Hoc Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Our previous trial acute dual study (ADS) reported that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using cilostazol and aspirin did not reduce the rate of short-term neurological worsening in non-cardioembolic stroke patients. Present post-hoc analysis investigated whether the impact of combined cilostazol and aspirin differed among stroke subtypes and factors associated with neurological deterioration and/or stroke recurrence.
METHODS: Using the ADS registry, the rate of neurological deterioration, defined as clinical worsening and/or recurrent stroke, including transient ischemic attack was calculated. Stroke subtypes included large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), small vessel occlusion (SVO), other determined etiology (Others), and undetermined etiology of stroke (Undetermined).
RESULTS: Data of 1022 patients were analyzed. Deterioration was seen in 104 (10%) patients, and the rates were not markedly different between patients treated with DAPT vs. aspirin in any stroke subtypes: LAA, 19% vs. 11%, (p=0.192); SVO, 10% vs. 10% (p=1.000); Others, 6% vs. 6% (p=1.000); Undetermined, 11% vs. 8% (p=0.590). Diabetes mellitus was the independent factor associated with deterioration (odds ratio 4.360, 95% confidence interval 1.139-16.691, p=0.032) in the LAA group. Age (1.030 [1.004-1.057], p=0.026), systolic blood pressure (1.012 [1.003-1.022], p=0.010), and infarct size (2.550 [1.488-4.371], p=0.001) were associated with deterioration in SVO group, and intracranial stenosis/occlusion was associated with it in the Undetermined group (3.744 [1.138-12.318], p=0.030).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined cilostazol and aspirin did not reduce the rate of short-term neurological deterioration in any clinical stroke subtype. The characteristics of patients whose condition deteriorates in the acute period may differ based on the stroke subtypes.
