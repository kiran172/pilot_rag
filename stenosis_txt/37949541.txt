Title: Physiology and Intravascular Imaging Coregistration-Best of all Worlds?

Abstract: Percutaneous coronary intervention is increasingly guided by coronary physiology and optimized using intravascular imaging. Pressure-based measurements determine the significance of a stenosis using hyperemic or nonhyperemic pressure ratios (eg, the instantaneous wave-free ratio). Intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography provide cross-sectional and longitudinal detail regarding plaque composition and vessel characteristics. These facilitate lesion preparation and optimization of stent sizing and positioning. This review explores the evidence-base and practical aspects of coregistering pressure gradient assessment and intravascular imaging with angiography. We then discuss gaps in the evidence and what is needed to help integrate these techniques into clinical practice.
