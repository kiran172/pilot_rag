Title: Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and dysphonia complicating awake transcarotid artery revascularization.

Abstract: A 59-year-old woman presented with advanced, symptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the setting of severe medical comorbidities including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with recent admission for exacerbation, and diabetes mellitus. She underwent awake transcarotid artery revascularization because of her medically high-risk status. Postoperatively, she was noted to have developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and dysphonia, thought to be secondary to entrained air during the course of low neck dissection for carotid artery exposure in the setting of partial airway obstruction and high negative intrathoracic pressures during the procedure. After conservative treatment, she ultimately enjoyed complete clinical resolution. This case demonstrates an unusual complication of awake transcarotid artery revascularization.
