Title: [A case of pulmonary aspergillus infection in underground coal mine workers].

Abstract: The underground environment is dark and humid, and it is easy to breed pathogenic microorganisms. A lump in the right lung of a coal mine underground transport worker was found druing occupational health examination. CT examination showed that the lump was located in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the right lung, with point strip calcification, liquefaction necrosis, and proximal bronchial stenosis and occlusion. MRI examination FS-T(2)WI and DWI showed "target sign", annular low signal around the central high signal, and low mixed signal around the periphery, and annular high signal in the isosignal lesions on T(1)WI. Then the pulmonary aspergillus infection was confirmed by pathology.
