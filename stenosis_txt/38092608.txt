Title: Removal of intraglandular calculi in Wharton's duct: clinical outcome and treatment algorithm.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to propose a treatment strategy for intraglandular submandibular calculi based on calculus site. Seventy-three consecutive patients with impalpable intraglandular submandibular calculi were enrolled retrospectively. The calculi were classified as either post-hilar type, central type, or superficial type. Treatment approaches included transoral duct slitting (TDS), interventional basket retrieval (IBR), intraductal laser lithotripsy (ILL), and transcervical lithotomy (TCL). Complete calculus removal with gland preservation was achieved in 64 patients (87.7%). The success rate for post-hilar, central, and superficial calculi was 86.4% (51/59), 90.9% (10/11), and 100% (3/3), respectively. The treatment approach applied in patients with treatment success was TDS in 32 cases, IBR in 20, ILL in nine, and TCL in three. During follow-up (median 17.3 months), one patient experienced gland atrophy and three had ductal stenosis; the remaining 60 patients (93.8%, 60/64) had good clinical outcomes. In the eight failure cases operated by TDS, the deeply situated calculi could not be detached despite the parenchymal incision in five cases, while the procedure was ceased due to the patient's inability to cooperate in the other three cases. In the remaining failure case, the submandibular gland was sacrificed after calculus extraction via TCL. Application of the proposed treatment algorithm might help preserve gland function in patients with intraglandular submandibular calculi.
