Title: Quantitative computed tomography angiography evaluation of the coronary fractional flow reserve in patients with left anterior descending artery myocardial bridging.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To quantitatively investigate the effect of myocardial bridge (MB) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) on the fractional flow reserve (FFR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-hundred patients with LAD MB who had undergone coronary artery CT angiography (CCTA) were retrospectively enroled, and 104 normal patients were enroled as the control. The CCTA-derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) was measured at the LAD 10 mm proximal (FFR1) and 20-40 mm distal (FFR3) to the MB and at the MB location (FFR2).
RESULTS: FFR2 and FFR3 of the MB (with BM only) and MBLA (with both MB and atherosclerosis) groups were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than those of the control. The FFR3 distal to the MB was significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that of the control. The FFRCT of the whole LAD in the MBLA group was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of the MB and control group (p < 0.05). MB length (OR 1.061) and MB muscle index (odds ratio or OR 1.007) were two risk factors for abnormal FFRCT, and MB length was a significant independent risk factor for abnormal FFRCT (OR = 1.077). LAD stenosis degree was a risk factor for abnormal FFRCT values (OR 3.301, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.441-7.562, p = 0.005) and was also a significant independent risk factor (OR = 3.369, 95% CI: 1.392-8.152; p = 0.007) for abnormal FFRCT.
CONCLUSION: MB significantly affects the FFRCT of distal coronary artery. For patients with MB without atherosclerosis, the MB length is a risk factor significantly affecting FFRCT, and for patients with MB accompanied by atherosclerosis, LAD stenotic severity is an independent risk factor for FFRCT.
