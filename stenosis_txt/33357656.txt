Title: Left and right ventricular deformation in patients with severe mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension undergoing percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty: A two dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographic study.

Abstract: Seventy-five patients with isolated severe MS (mitral valve area: 1.10 ± 0.15 cm2) and pulmonary hypertension underwent regional and global longitudinal strain (GLS) measurements of left (LV) and right ventricle (RV) at baseline and within 48 h after percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV). PBMV resulted in significant improvement in LV GLS (-16.35 ± 1.67% vs -19.98 ± 2.17%) and RV GLS (-10.34 ± 2.38% vs -13.83 ± 2.04%), p &lt; 0.001 for both. Absolute increase in strain of basal segments of LV was more compared to mid and apical segments. We also found significant positive correlation between decrease in mean LA pressure (pre PBMV 28.91 ± 4.21 mm Hg vs post PBMV 10.55 ± 3.04 mm Hg, difference of 16.36 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.001) obtained invasively during PBMV for 62 patients with improvement in LV GLS (r = 0.257, p = 0.048), RV GLS (r = 0.267, p = 0.043), and fall in right ventricular systolic pressure (r = 0.308, p = 0.022) that occurred post PBMV. The LV dysfunction is predominantly because of altered hemodynamics due to restricted LV filling with additional contribution from rheumatic involvement of basal LV myocardial segments. The improvement in LV deformation after PBMV is likely due to increase in preload. RV afterload reduction because of LA pressure decrease improved RV deformation.
