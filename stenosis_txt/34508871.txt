Title: Medium-term outcomes after inferior vena cava reconstruction for acute and chronic deep vein thrombosis and retroperitoneal fibrosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we evaluated the technical and clinical outcomes after endovascular inferior vena cava (IVC) reconstruction in patients with nonmalignant obstruction.
METHODS: The preoperative, procedural, and follow-up medical records and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed for 59 consecutive patients who had undergone endovascular IVC reconstruction for nonmalignant obstruction from February 2014 to January 2019. The patients were classified into three groups according to the quality of their infrainguinal inflow vessels. The outcomes measured were the primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates, reintervention rates, and symptomatic resolution.
RESULTS: The indications for treatment were post-thrombotic syndrome (n = 41), acute deep vein thrombosis (n = 12), and retroperitoneal fibrosis (n = 6). The median patient age was 37 years, 11 months, 71.2% were men, and 32.2% had a diagnosis of thrombophilia, with no significant difference in these demographics between the three inflow groups. The median follow-up duration was 2 years, 3 months (range, 6 months to 6 years, 5 months). The whole-cohort primary patency was 91.2%, 71.0%, and 24.1% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Secondary patency was 76.7% at 1 year and 66.4% at both 3 and 5 years. Inflow group A (no post-thrombotic disease in the femoral or deep femoral veins) demonstrated significantly higher primary patency compared with group B (stenotic disease in one or two infrainguinal inflow veins; P = .009) and significantly higher secondary patency than for both groups B (P = .008) and C (all three infrainguinal inflow veins had stenosed or femoral and/or deep femoral vein occlusion was present; P = .04). In post-thrombotic syndrome patients, the Villalta scores had decreased from a mean of 14.2 to 8.1 at 1 year and 6.8 at 2 years, and the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study Quality of Life score had improved from a mean of 19.8 to 54.1 and 57.3 at 1 and 2 years, respectively. In the patients with acute deep vein thrombosis, the Villalta score was 2.8 at 1 year and 0 at 2 years. In the patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis, the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study Quality of Life score had improved from a mean of 25.3 at baseline to 44 at 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular IVC reconstruction for nonmalignant obstruction can achieve good patency and clinical improvement, although the outcomes were poorer for patients with post-thrombotic disease of the femoral and deep femoral veins.
