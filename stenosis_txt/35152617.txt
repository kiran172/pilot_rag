Title: Y Stent Rendezvous to Treat Symptomatic Innominate Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: A male in his 60s presented with transient ischemic attacks 5 years after aortic arch branch graft repair for type A aortic dissection. Computed tomographic angiography demonstrated 80% stenosis of the brachiocephalic artery close to the origins of the right common carotid and subclavian arteries. The case was reviewed at our multidisciplinary aortic meeting and a plan for endovascular management was made. Percutaneous endovascular Y stenting from the innominate artery into the left common carotid and subclavian arteries was achieved using self-expanding nitinol stents with a rendezvous technique that included retrograde right radial artery, retrograde right external carotid artery, and retrograde right femoral arterial approaches. At 6 months review, the stents remained widely patent and the patient was symptom-free.
