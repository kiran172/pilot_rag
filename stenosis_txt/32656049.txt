Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Repair in a Patient With Anomalous Right Coronary Artery Originating From the Left Aortic Sinus and Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

Abstract: We report a patient with symptomatic low-flow high-grade aortic valve stenosis and myelodysplastic syndrome. Preinterventional imaging revealed an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery only defined by CT. The patient was classified as high risk in regard to conventional cardiac surgery by our heart team and therefore scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve repair (TAVR). The case presentation describes the potential effect of this anatomical coronary variant withÂ regard to the peri- and postinterventional outcome: anomalous origin of the right coronary artery may lead to severe ischemia during TAVR due to occlusion of the coronary vessel. Conversion to open surgery with immediate coronary bypass surgery may rapidly restore myocardial perfusion and enhance clinical outcome of the patient.
