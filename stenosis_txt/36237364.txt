Title: Carotid Vessel Wall MRI Findings in Acute Cerebral Infarction Caused by Polycythemia Vera: A Case Report.

Abstract: Polycythemia vera (PV) is a rare myeloproliferative disease that causes elevated absolute red blood cell (RBC) mass due to uncontrolled RBC production. Moreover, this condition has been associated with a high risk of ischemic stroke and large vessel stenosis or occlusion, with many studies reporting cerebral infarction in PV patients. Despite these findings, there have been no reports on the vessel wall MRI (VW-MRI) findings of the narrowed vessels in PV-associated ischemic stroke patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in English regarding the carotid VW-MRI findings of a 30-year-old male diagnosed with PV after being hospitalized due to stroke.
