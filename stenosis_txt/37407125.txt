Title: CT Coronary Angiography and Dynamic CT Myocardial Perfusion for Detection of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major obstacle limiting long-term graft survival. Effective noninvasive surveillance modalities reflecting both coronary artery and microvascular components of CAV are needed.
OBJECTIVES: The authors evaluated the diagnostic performance of dynamic computed tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for CAV.
METHODS: A total of 63 heart transplantation patients underwent combined CT-MPI and CCTA plus invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) between December 2018 and October 2021. The median interval between CT-MPI and heart transplantation was 4.3 years. Peak myocardial blood flow (MBF) of the whole myocardium (MBF<sub>global</sub>) and minimum MBF (MBF<sub>min</sub>) among the 16 segments according to the American Heart Association model, except the left ventricular apex, were calculated from CT-MPI. CCTA was assessed qualitatively, and the degree of coronary artery stenosis was recorded. CAV was diagnosed based on both ICA (ISHLT criteria) and IVUS. Patients were followed up for a median time of 2.3 years after CT-MPI and a median time of 5.7 years after transplantation.
RESULTS: Among the 63 recipients, 35 (55.6%) had diagnoses of CAV. The median MBF<sub>global</sub> and MBF<sub>min</sub> were significantly lower in patients with CAV (128.7 vs 150.4 mL/100 mL/min; P = 0.014; and 96.9 vs 122.8 mL/100 mL/min; P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The combined use of coronary artery stenosis on CCTA and MBF<sub>min</sub> showed the highest diagnostic performance with an area under the curve of 0.886 (sensitivity: 74.3%, specificity: 96.4%, positive predictive value: 96.3%, and negative predictive value: 75.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CT-MPI and CCTA demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance for the detection of CAV. One-stop evaluation of the coronary artery and microvascular components involved in CAV using combined CCTA and CT-MPI may be a potent noninvasive screening method for early detection of CAV.
