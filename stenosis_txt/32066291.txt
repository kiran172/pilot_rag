Title: Sex differences in aortic stenosis: from pathophysiology to treatment.

Abstract: Introduction: In aortic stenosis (AS), there are clear sex differences in clinical presentation, left ventricular (LV) response to pressure overload, and pathophysiology of valvular calcification. These differences may affect outcome following valve intervention.Area covered: This review aims to discuss sexÂ differences in clinical presentation, pathophysiology of aortic valve calcification, LV remodeling in view of historic and recent echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging studies, and outcome after valve intervention. In addition, it will also provide some brief insights on the exercise physiology in women and men with AS.Expert commentary: Women at presentation are often older, have higher prevalence of hypertension and diastolic dysfunction, while men are younger, and more often have a bicuspid aortic valve and higher atherosclerotic disease burden. Men have more valve calcification than women for a given severity of AS and develop different patterns of LV remodeling and myocardial fibrosis. Although women tend to walk shorter on treadmill and achieve lower metabolic equivalents, they achieve similar peak heart rates and blood pressure, and the frequency of revealed symptoms during exercise test is comparable in both sexes. Men are more likely to undergo a surgical AVR with better outcome, while women have generally better outcome after TAVI.
