Title: Role of CD34 in calcification of human aortic valve interstitial cells from patients with aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: Various osteogenic factors are involved in ectopic human aortic valve calcification; however, the key cell species involved in calcification remains unclear. In a previous study, we reported that mesenchymal stem (CD73, 90, 105) and endothelial (VEGFR2) cell markers are positive in almost all human aortic valve interstitial cells (HAVICs) obtained from a patient with calcified aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Further, CD34-negative HAVICs are highly sensitive to calcification stimulations. Here, we aimed to pathophysiologically clarify the role of CD34 in HAVICs obtained from individual patients with severe CAVS. A DNA microarray between CD34-positive and CD34-negative HAVICs, separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, indicated that tenascin X (TNX) mRNA expression significantly decreased in CD34-negative cells. Furthermore, the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β significantly downregulated CD34 expression in HAVICs. TGF-β, a key cytokine of endothelial-mesenchymal transition, did not affect HAVIC calcification. CD34 overexpression strongly inhibited TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced calcification and maintained TNX mRNA expression. These results suggest one possibility that CD34 is an inhibitory regulator of valve calcification. Furthermore, TNF-α- and IL-1β-induced CD34 downregulation in HAVICs contributes to HAVIC calcification by downregulating TNX protein expression.
