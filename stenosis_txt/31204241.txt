Title: Native Coronary Disease Progression Post Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It remains unclear if graft type impacts native disease progression in the target coronary artery post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
METHODS: Patients who underwent repeat angiograms at least 6 months post CABG with ≥1 arterial graft were included. Pre/post CABG angiograms were examined by 2 experienced readers. Progression was defined as new stenosis of ≥50% in a previously normal coronary, an increase in previous stenosis of ≥20%, or a new occlusion. Primary outcome was the occurrence of native disease progression in bypassed vessels. Secondary outcomes included complete occlusion, left main (LM) and distal disease progression. Cox-proportional hazard regression models were used for time-to-event outcomes.
RESULTS: Study population included 98 patients comprising 263 grafts (143 arterial/120 venous grafts). Median time from surgery to catheterization was 559 days (Interquartile Range 374,910).Ninety-one target vessels showed progression (34.6%) with 75 to complete occlusion (28.5%). Progression was not associated with graft choice (HR 0.74(0.49,1.13) p = 0.163),but was significantly associated with age(p = 0.034),previous PCI(p = 0.002),ACE inhibitor (ACEi) use(p < 0.001),CAD severity (p < 0.001),CCS class III/IV(p = 0.016) and NYHA class III/IV(p < 0.001). Progression to occlusion was significantly associated with SVG (p = 0.019), as well as previous percutaneous coronary intervention (p = 0.007) and ACEi use (p < 0.001). LM disease progression was significantly associated with peripheral vascular disease (HR 5.44(1.92, 15.46), p = 0.001), and not affected by graft type (p = 0.754).
CONCLUSIONS: Native CAD progression in non-LM coronaries is multifactorial, while SVG use was only associated with occlusion of non-LM coronaries. The implications of this study warrant consideration for increased arterial grafting in CABG patients, while the negative associations of previous PCI and ACEi use carry important clinical implications, which require further investigation.
