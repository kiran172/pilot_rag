Title: Prognostic impact of elevated erythropoietin levels in patients with severe aortic stenosis receiving trans-catheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Elevated endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). The clinical implication of endogenous EPO levels in patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) beyond other conventional risk factors remains unknown.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with EPO measurements who underwent TAVI for the treatment of their severe aortic stenosis at our institute between May 2015 and December 2020 were included. The association between the endogenous EPO levels and the primary outcome consisting of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 263 patients (85.1 ± 5.1 years old, 74 men) were included and tertiled according to the baseline EPO levels. The high EPO group had more advanced anemia, renal impairment, and hypoalbuminemia than the other two tertiled groups (p < 0.05 for both). Patients with high EPO had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of the primary outcomes compared to the other two groups (p = 0.002) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 6.0 (95 % confidence interval 1.9-18.1) in its logarithmic value (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated baseline EPO levels were independently associated with mortality and morbidity following TAVI. The clinical implication of aggressive intervention on the elevated EPO levels in this cohort remains the next concern.
