Title: Pure aortic valve regurgitation: SAVR is the gold standard, but TAVR is another gun.

Abstract: Surgical treatment is the gold standard for pure aortic regurgitation (AR). In this study, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) appears to be a promising option for inoperable/high-risk patients suffering pure AR. Long-term results and specific patient-level data are needed to better clarify the role of TAVR in pure AR treatment.
