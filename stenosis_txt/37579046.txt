Title: Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in Patients Over 60 Years Old: A Long-Term Follow-Up.

Abstract: Purpose: This study analyzed the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients over 60 years old, in a long-term follow-up, in a high-volume bariatric center. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all patients older than 60 years who underwent LSG in our center from January 2009 to December 2018. A prospectively collected database of 4991 consecutive LSG cases was reviewed. Results: One hundred seventy-nine sleeve gastrectomy procedures were performed in patients older than 60 years, 135 were aged 60-65 years (group A) and 44 were older than 65 years (group B). We reported five cases (2.7%) of early complications: three postoperative hemorrhages, one cardial leakage, and one perigastric abscess. No thromboembolic events or mortality rates were reported. The mean follow-up period was 5.5 years (66 months). The follow-up loss rate was about 29%. At last follow-up, the mean body-mass index/body mass/percentage of excess weight loss values were, respectively, 33.7 ± 7/86.1 ± 21/60.4 ± 28.6 in group A and 32.4 ± 6.4/82.6 ± 18/61.8 ± 33 in group B. We reported 5 (4.0%) trocar site hernias, 1 (0.8%) cardial junction stenosis, and 22 (18%) new outbreaks of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). There were 7 reinterventions (5.7%): 5 for weight regain and 2 for GERD not responding to medical therapy. There were no statistically significant differences between the two age groups. Conclusions: LSG is a safe and effective treatment for severe obesity in people over 60 years old. There are no differences in results of patients over 65 years and between 60 and 65 years old. Scales that include associated medical problems and the patient's general condition must be considered.
