Title: Post-intubation double tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Post-intubation tracheal stenosis is a condition that can occur as a consequence of tracheostomy or prolonged intubation. The development of two levels of airway narrowing is rare. We present the case of a 43-year-old male with a history of prolonged mechanical ventilation, who presented to our center with progressive respiratory impairment. Computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction demonstrated complex tracheal anatomy with double-level stenosis. The patient underwent successful endoscopic procedure.
