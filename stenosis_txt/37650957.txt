Title: Association of nidus size and rupture in brain arteriovenous malformations: Insight from angioarchitecture and hemodynamics.

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the correlation between AVM size and rupture by examining natural history, angioarchitecture characteristics, and quantitative hemodynamics. A retrospective review of 90 consecutive AVMs from the MATCH registry was conducted. Patients were categorized into small nidus (< 3 cm) and large nidus (≥ 3 cm) groups based on the Spetzler-Martin grading system. Natural history analysis used prospective cohort survival data, while imaging analysis examined angioarchitecture characteristics and quantitative hemodynamic parameters measured with QDSA. The small-nidus group had a significantly higher annualized rupture risk (2.3% vs. 1.0%; p = 0.011). Cross-sectional imaging revealed independent hemorrhagic risk factors, including small nidus (OR, 4.801; 95%CI, 1.280-18.008; p = 0.020) and draining vein stenosis (OR, 6.773; 95%CI, 1.179-38.911; p = 0.032). Hemodynamic analysis identified higher stasis index in the feeding artery (OR, 2.442; 95%CI, 1.074-5.550; p = 0.033), higher stasis index in the draining vein (OR, 11.812; 95%CI, 1.907-73.170; p = 0.008), and lower outflow gradient in the draining vein (OR, 1.658; 95%CI, 1.068-2.574; p = 0.024) as independent predictors of AVM rupture. The small nidus group also showed a higher likelihood of being associated with hemorrhagic risk factors. Small AVM nidus has a higher risk of rupture based on natural history, angioarchitecture, and hemodynamics. Clinical Trial Registration-URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .
