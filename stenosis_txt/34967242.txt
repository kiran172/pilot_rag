Title: Effect of perioperative blood pressure variability on cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome after carotid artery stenting: A retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of perioperative blood pressure variability on cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome after carotid artery stenting.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of data collected from 418 patients who underwent carotid artery stenting in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Hospital in China. The blood pressure data were collected during operation (after balloon dilation, before stent release, after stent release) and within 3 days after the operation. The blood pressure variability was evaluated by measuring the mean, maximum, minimum, max-min, standard deviation (SD) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The correlation between blood pressure variability and cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome was analysed.
RESULTS: Blood pressure data from 418 patients were analysed. Twenty patients (4.8%) developed cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. The parameters of blood pressure variability were divided into four groups according to quartile. After adjusting for age, symptomatic carotid stenosis, unilateral carotid stenosis, bilateral carotid stenosis, collateral circulation, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, multivariate analysis showed that SBP<sub>Max</sub>, SBP<sub>Min</sub>, SBP<sub>Max-Min</sub>, SBP<sub>CV</sub>, DBP<sub>SD</sub>, DBP<sub>Max</sub>, DBP<sub>Min</sub>, DBP<sub>Max-Min</sub> and DBP<sub>CV</sub> were associated with the occurrence of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (P &lt; 0.05), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that blood pressure variability during the perioperative period may increase the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome.
