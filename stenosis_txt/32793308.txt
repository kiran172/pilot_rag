Title: Predictive value of serum CTRP9 and STIM1 for restenosis after cerebrovascular stent implantation and its relationship with vasoactive substances and inflammatory cytokines.

Abstract: Predictive value of serum complement Clq tumor necrosis factor-related protein 9 (CTRP9) and serum stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) was investigated for restenosis after cerebrovascular stent implantation, as well as its relationship with vasoactive substances and inflammatory cytokines. In this prospective study, 128 patients with cerebral infarction treated with cerebrovascular stent implantation in Yantaishan Hospital were recruited. A total of 66 cases with restenosis after cerebrovascular stent implantation were included in group A, and 62 cases without stenosis were included in group B. Serum CTRP9 and STIM1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ROC curves of serum CTRP9 and STIM1 levels in patients with postoperative restenosis were drawn. The vasoactive substances nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were analyzed by ELISA. The correlation of serum CTRP9, STIM1 levels and NO, TNF-α, IL-6 were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient. Serum CTRP9 and NO levels in group A were significantly lower than those in group B. The levels of serum STIM1, TNF-α and IL-6 in group A were significantly higher than those in group B (P<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of serum CTRP9 level in the diagnosis of restenosis after cerebrovascular stent implantation were, respectively, 59.68 and 75.76%. Those of serum STIM1 were, respectively, 87.10 and 46.97% and those of the combination of serum CTRP9 and STIM1 were 90.32 and 48.48%. Serum CTRP9 level was positively correlated with NO, and negatively correlated with TNF-α and IL-6. STIM1 was positively correlated with TNF-α and IL-6, and negatively correlated with NO (P<0.001). Serum CTRP9 level was significantly decreased in patients with restenosis after cerebrovascular stent implantation, while STIM1 level was significantly up-regulated. Both were correlated with the change of NO, IL-6 and TNF-α levels, therefore they could be used as biological indicators for prediction of restenosis after cerebrovascular stent implantation.
