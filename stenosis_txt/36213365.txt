Title: Cardiovascular Morbidity in Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance: A Danish Nationwide Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is associated with renal dysfunction, inflammation, and increased cardiovascular mortality, but the cardiovascular risks are not fully understood.
OBJECTIVES: The authors explored the association of MGUS with a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases using the Danish nationwide databases.
METHODS: Between 1995 and 2018, patients 18 years and older with MGUS were age- and sex-matched (1:10) with control patients and followed prospectively until December 31, 2018, for the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. Patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, or amyloidosis were excluded. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression.
RESULTS: Patients with MGUS (n = 8,189; mean age 69.8 ± 11.7 years; 51.2% male) had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors at baseline, including hypertension (48.0% vs 38.5%) and type 2 diabetes (13.0% vs 9.3%), compared with control patients. Outcomes included an increased risk of heart failure (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.41-1.69), acute myocardial infarction (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06-1.40), ischemic stroke (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.30), atrial fibrillation (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.23-1.42), aortic aneurysm (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.28-1.89), aortic stenosis (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.41-1.82), aortic regurgitation (HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.34-2.07), heart block (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.08-1.61), peripheral artery disease (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.47-1.95), cor pulmonale (HR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.55-2.73), and venous thromboembolism (HR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.24-1.65). A sensitivity analysis including only patients without certain comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, and chronic kidney disease) yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: MGUS is associated with a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, with greater relative risks observed for diseases previously associated with infiltrative and inflammatory disorders. Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms.
