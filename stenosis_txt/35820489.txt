Title: Homozygous familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency without obvious coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: The prevalence of familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) is approximately one in 1,000,000 in the general population. There are conflicting reports on whether or not LPLD is atherogenic. We conducted coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography on two patients in their 70 s who had genetically confirmed LPLD. Patient 1 was a 73 year old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 27.5 kg/m2, no history of diabetes mellitus and no history of drinking alcohol or smoking. At the time of her first visit, her serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 4.8 mmol/L, 17.3 mmol/L, and 0.5 mmol/L, respectively. She was treated with a lipid-restricted diet and fibrate but her serum TG levels remained extremely high. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed a missense mutation (homo) in the LPL gene, c.662T&gt;C (p. Ile221Thr), leading to the diagnosis of homozygous familial LPL deficiency (LPLD). Patient 2 was another 73- year- old woman. She also had marked hypertriglyceridemia with no history of diabetes mellitus, drinking alcohol, or smoking. Previous genetic studies showed she had a nonsense mutation (homozygous) in the LPL gene, c.1277G&gt;A (p.Trp409Ter). To clarify the degree of coronary artery stenosis in these two cases, we conducted coronary CT angiography and found that no coronary artery stenosis in either the right or left coronary arteries. Based on the findings in these two elderly women along with previous reports on patients in their 60 s with LPLD and hypertriglyceridemia, we suggest that LPLD may not be associated with the development or progression of coronary artery disease.
