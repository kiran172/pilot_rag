Title: [Complications of esophageal reconstruction].

Abstract: Esophageal cancer is the most common cause of esophageal resections. Esophageal replacement is still a significant challenge for surgeons, because complications can be expected in over 50% and death also occurs between 4-7%. Complications can be divided into early and late categories and into general and specific complications. From a surgical point of view, early and late specific complications are the most important aspects. Between 1993 and 2012, 540 esophageal resections were performed due to malignant tumors at the Department of Surgery, Medical Center of the University of Pécs. Stomach was used for replacement in 445 cases, colon in 38 cases, and jejunum in 57 cases. The anastomosis with stomach replacement was located to the neck in 275 cases and to the thorax in 170 cases. The colon was pulled up to the neck in each case. There were 29 cases of free jejunal replacements located to the neck, and 28 cases with a Roux-loop reconstruction located to the thorax. In the case of gastric replacement, anastomotic insufficiency developed in 55 cases, graft necrosis occurred in 8 cases, and early anastomosis stricture developed in 30 cases. These numbers are 3 conduit necrosis and 2 strictures in cases of colonic replacements. There was one anastomosis failure in the case of a thoracic jejunum replacement. Also one conduit necrosis was observed in the free jejunal neck transplantation group. Among late special complications, dysphagia is the most important, the causes of which were found in the order of frequency: anastomotic stricture, conduit obstruction, peptic and ischemic stricture, foreign body, local recurrence, functional causes, new malignant tumor in the esophageal remnant after resection and malignant tumor emerging in the replaced organ. Causes may overlap each other, and their treatment may be conservative, endoscopic or surgical. Surgical treatment is usually the last option to restore the ability to swallow and can present a significant challenge even to experienced centers. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(7): 243-252.
