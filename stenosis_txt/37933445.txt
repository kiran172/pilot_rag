Title: Pancreatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Following Endovascular Treatment of Symptomatic Celiac and Superior Mesenteric Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: With endovascular therapy becoming the first-line treatment for symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia, acute pancreatitis within the context of abdominal ischemia-reperfusion injury may be seen more often in cross-sectional imaging following this kind of interventions and should therefore be kept in mind by the reading physician.
