Title: Predictors of non-obstructive coronary slow flow in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary slow flow (CSF) can occur due to various factors, such as inflammation, small vessel disease, endothelial dysfunction, and inadequate glucose control. However, the exact pathological mechanisms behind CSF remain incompletely understood. The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with slow coronary flow in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who have non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and experience CSF.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 120 patients with T2DM who were referred for invasive coronary angiography due to typical chest pain or inconclusive results from non-invasive tests for myocardial ischemia. Using a 2 × 2 design, we categorized patients into groups based on their glycemic control (adequate or poor) and the presence of CSF (yes or no), defined by a TIMI frame count > 27. All patients had non-obstructive CAD, characterized by diameter stenosis of less than 40%. We identified many variables associated with CSF.
RESULTS: Our investigation revealed no significant differences in age, sex, family history of coronary artery disease, ECG ischemia abnormalities, or echocardiographic (ECHO) data between the groups. In patients with adequate glycemic control, hypertension increased the risk of CSF by 5.33 times, smoking by 3.2 times, while dyslipidemia decreased the risk by 0.142. Additionally, hematocrit increased the risk by 2.3, and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) increased the risk by 1.053. Among patients with poor glycemic control, hematocrit increased the risk by 2.63, and the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) by 24.6. Notably, NLR was positively correlated with glycemic control parameters in T2DM patients with CSF.
CONCLUSIONS: In T2DM patients with CSF, various factors strongly correlate with glycemic control parameters and can be employed to predict the likelihood of CSF. These factors encompass hypertension, smoking, increased body mass index (BMI), elevated platelet count, hematocrit, NLR, PLR, and C-reactive protein (CRP).
