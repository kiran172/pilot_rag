Title: Cardiopulmonary Management for Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis With Noninvasive Ventilation Using a Nasopharyngeal Tube.

Abstract: The nasopharyngeal tube (NT) is an effective interface for noninvasive ventilation (NIV). In cases of severe heart failure, assistance with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) effectively reduces afterload and alleviates respiratory effort. We present the case of a three-day-old male neonate diagnosed with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). In respiratory management, extubation was delayed due to increased respiratory effort and afterload, so this patient was extubated and managed with NPPV using an NT. An uncuffed endotracheal tube was inserted, initiating NIV with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. The patient exhibited stable vital signs post-extubation and was weaned off NPPV and transferred to the general ward. In this case of severe AS, the use of NT as an interface for NPPV demonstrated efficacy in respiratory and circulatory management. This approach could have shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and facilitated safe postoperative care, highlighting the potential benefits of NT in managing severe heart failure.
