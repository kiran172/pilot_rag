Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation 10 years after valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation for failing aortic valve homograft root replacement.

Abstract: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) is an established therapy for a degenerated surgical bioprosthesis. TAVI-in-TAVI following ViV-TAVI has not been previously performed. We report a high-risk patient presenting with severe left ventricular failure secondary to undiagnosed critical aortic stenosis due to degeneration of the implanted transcatheter heart valve more than a decade after initial ViV-TAVI for a failing stentless aortic valve homograft. Successful TAVI-in-TAVI reversed the clinical and echocardiographic changes of decompensated heart failure with no evidence of coronary obstruction.
