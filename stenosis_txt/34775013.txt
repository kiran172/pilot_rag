Title: Subclavian Artery Stenting Under Cerebral Protection by Balloon-Guiding Catheter Inflation Inside the Aortic Arch at the Left Subclavian Artery Origin.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We describe a simple and novel technique for cerebral protection during left subclavian artery (SA) stenting by inflation of a balloon-guiding catheter inside the aortic arch at the SA origin.
METHODS: A total of 12 patients with left SA stenosis underwent SA stenting with inflation of a balloon-guiding catheter inside the aortic arch at the left SA origin between January 2020 and December 2020. The SA stenting procedures under proximal protection were retrospectively reviewed to assess ischemic complications, hyperintense spots on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and flow direction of left vertebral artery (VA) during balloon-guiding catheter inflation using ultrasonography (US).
RESULTS: The success rate of the SA stenting procedure was 100% with no symptomatic ischemic complications. None of the 12 patients showed small hyperintense spots in DWI. In all patients, the left VA on US during balloon inflation showed retrograde blood flow.
CONCLUSIONS: The left VA on US had retrograde blood flow during inflation of the balloon-guiding catheter inside the aortic arch at the SA origin. Therefore, the proximal balloon protection inside the aortic arch at the SA origin is a simple and maybe a safe technique for cerebral protection during SA stenting.
