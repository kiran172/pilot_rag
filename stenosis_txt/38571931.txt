Title: Chinese guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of Takayasu's arteritis (2023).

Abstract: Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease that involves aorta and its primary branches. It is characterized by wall thickening, stenosis/obliteration or aneurysm formation of the involved arteries. In order to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of TAK in China, a clinical practice guideline with an evidence-based approach is developed under the leadership of National Clinical Medical Research Center for Dermatologic and Immunologic Diseases (NCRC-DID). Eleven recommendations for 11 clinical questions that are important to the diagnosis and treatment of TAK are developed based on the latest evidence and expert opinions combined with real clinical practice in China.
