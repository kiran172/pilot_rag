Title: Human Basilar Arterial Plaque Detected by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy: Clinical Image.

Abstract: A patient in their 70s presented with weakness of the left limb and aphasia. Left vertebral angiography showed acute basilar artery occlusion. After mechanical thrombectomy, basilar artery trunk stenosis was evident and catheter-based near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) showed lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaque extending to almost 220Â° of the vessel circumference in the culprit lesion. Loading doses of dual antiplatelet therapy and aggressive medical treatment were started because additional intervention might have increased risk of plaque protrusion and thrombotic reocclusion. The patient presented with minor stroke caused by restenosis of the basilar artery 4 months later; balloon angioplasty and stenting were performed without thromboembolic complications. The patient was discharged without any new neurologic deficits. NIRS visualizes the distribution of lipids in the culprit lesion and the plaque burden of residual stenosis, identifies mechanisms of in situ thrombosis, and provides suggestions for the timing of additional interventions.
