Title: Predictive Factors for Pulmonary Homograft Dysfunction After Ross Surgery: A 20-Year Follow-up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We studied the determinants of hemodynamics and analyzed the incidence, risk factors, and clinical impact of pulmonary homograft dysfunction following Ross surgery, after a 20-year follow-up at our referral center.
METHODS: From 1997 to 2017, a total of 142 patients underwent surgery using the Ross procedure. The development of moderate-severe stenosis (peak transhomograft pressure gradient 36 mm Hg or greater) and surgical or percutaneous Ross homograft reinterventions were evaluated by echocardiography in the immediate postoperative period and at annual intervals.
RESULTS: After 20 years of follow-up, 31% of patients had moderate-severe homograft stenosis, and 9.1% had had to undergo one or two reinterventions, of which, six were valve replacements and seven were percutaneous interventions. At 1, 5, and 20 years, 89.4%, 74.6%, and 69% of these patients, respectively, were free from moderate-severe stenosis; and 99.3%, 95.7%, and 90.9%, respectively, had freedom from homograft reintervention. The pediatric group had a higher risk factor for homograft stenosis (hazard ratio 3.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.56 to 7.20, P = .002), whereas donor age behaved as a protective factor (hazard ratio 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 0.99; P = .044). Pulmonary homograft stenosis tended to appear in the first year (10.6%) or at 5 years (25.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary homografts implanted in the Ross procedure offer satisfactory long-term results, but the level of homograft dysfunction is not negligible. Young recipient and donor age were associated with a higher rate of homograft stenosis during follow-up. Moreover, homograft dysfunction usually occurred during the first few years of follow-up, and may have been related to immune responses.
