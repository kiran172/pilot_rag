Title: Tracheal stenosis in a yellow-crowned parrot (Amazona ochrocephala) due to diffuse ossification and osteopetrosis of tracheal rings.

Abstract: Tracheal luminal stenosis can cause clinical respiratory distress in wild birds. We describe a case of tracheal stenosis due to diffuse ossification with osteopetrosis of tracheal rings in a yellow-crowned parrot (Amazona ochrocephala) with a history of chronic respiratory distress and death after development of marked dyspnoea. An ante-mortem radiographic examination revealed that the tracheal rings were radiopaque and that there were multiple areas of osteopenic change in long bones. At necropsy, there was stenosis of the tracheal rings characterized by complete replacement of cartilage by thickened compact bone with osteopetrosis and bone necrosis. The clinical respiratory distress and death of the parrot were associated with tracheal luminal stenosis due to thickening of the tracheal rings by diffuse ossification with osteopetrosis.
