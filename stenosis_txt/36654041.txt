Title: Fluid-structure interaction simulation of calcified aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: Calcified aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is caused by calcium buildup and tissue thickening that impede the blood flow from left ventricle (LV) to aorta. In recent years, CAVS has become one of the most common cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mechanics of aortic valve (AV) caused by calcification. In this paper, based on a previous idealized AV model, the hybrid immersed boundary/finite element method (IB/FE) is used to study AV dynamics and hemodynamic performance under normal and calcified conditions. The computational CAVS model is realized by dividing the AV leaflets into a calcified region and a healthy region, and each is described by a specific constitutive equation. Our results show that calcification can significantly affect AV dynamics. For example, the elasticity and mobility of the leaflets decrease due to calcification, leading to a smaller opening area with a high forward jet flow across the valve. The calcified valve also experiences an increase in local stress and strain. The increased loading due to AV stenosis further leads to a significant increase in left ventricular energy loss and transvalvular pressure gradients. The model predicted hemodynamic parameters are in general consistent with the risk classification of AV stenosis in the clinic. Therefore, mathematical models of AV with calcification have the potential to deepen our understanding of AV stenosis-induced ventricular dysfunction and facilitate the development of computational engineering-assisted medical diagnosis in AV related diseases.
