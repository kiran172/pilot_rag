Title: The Promise and Perils of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) in Low Surgical Risk Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis in the Current Era.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has become the preferred treatment approach for many patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis (SsAS), particularly those who are deemed at high surgical risk. However, in low-risk surgical patients (LSRP) with SsAS, the choice between TAVR and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is often a matter of debate and depends on several clinical and anatomical considerations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Midterm data show similar clinical outcomes and durability of TAVR and SAVR bioprosthetic valves in LRSP. Data on long term durability and outcomes of TAVR in LRSP remains scarce. Both TAVR and SAVR are reasonable options in LRSP with SsAS. Nevertheless, many of these LRSP are expected to outlive their bioprosthetic valves and planning for the second aortic valve replacement should begin at the time of the index procedure with special consideration for coronary re-access, risk for coronary obstruction, and prothesis patient mismatch.
