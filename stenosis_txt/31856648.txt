Title: Safely traversing venous sinus stenosis: The "Cobra" technique.

Abstract: Venous sinus stenting is an accepted and minimally invasive treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension associated with significant venous sinus stenosis. There is inherent difficulty in navigating past the region of venous stenosis in order to safely deliver and deploy a stent. We have developed the "Cobra" technique, which allows for the safe and efficient navigation past regions of high-grade venous sinus stenosis.
