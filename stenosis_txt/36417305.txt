Title: Membranous Nasopharyngeal Stenosis: Case Report.

Abstract: Nasopharyngeal stenosis is a rare condition and occurs usually secondary to nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal surgery and radiotherapy. It may cause obstructive symptoms in patients and is diagnosed usually with nasopharyngoscopy. Treatment is difficult and requires different surgical techniques including balloon dilatation. Even after a successful surgery, recurrence is very common.
