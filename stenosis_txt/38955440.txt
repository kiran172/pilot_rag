Title: Patch angioplasty carotid endarterectomy versus eversion carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To compare carotid endarterectomy patch angioplasty (p-CEA) with eversion carotid endarterectomy (e-CEA) and associated risks of early cardio-cerebrovascular complications.
METHODS: The study was a prospective randomized single-blind trial, monocentric, clinically applicable, descriptive analytical and comparative. From June 2021 to June 2023, 62 consecutive patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic stenosis of the internal carotid artery, admitted to our department and randomized into two groups: carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty and eversion carotid endarterectomy. Follow-up for 30 days after surgery.
RESULTS: During surgery e-CEA, 70% patients had an arrhythmia, and 24 hours after 66.7%, seven days after 46.7% and month after 13.3%. During surgery p-CEA, 33.3% patients had an arrhythmia, 24 hours later 33.3%, 7 days after 13.3% and 30 days after 13.3% patients. Statistically significant difference observed during surgery (Fishers p=0.004). One day after the surgery rate of patients with arrhythmia that were treated e-CEA has decreased, but it was still higher than after p-CEA (Fishers p=0.010).
CONCLUSION: The frequency and categorization of postoperative cardiac arrhythmias after eversion carotid endarterectomy, the clinical implications of various postoperative heart rhythm disturbances and their long-term effects on patients need to be further investigate through sufficiently powered randomized controlled studies.
