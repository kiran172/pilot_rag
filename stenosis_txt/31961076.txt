Abstract: In 2019, the guidelines on the new entity « chronic coronary syndrome » have been published. They influence importantly the work-up and treatment of patients with stable coronary artery disease. We will also report on publications showing the benefit of percutaneous aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with aortic stenosis and low risk surgical risk. With regard to infectious endocarditis, we elucidate the importance of the vegetation's size for predicting mortality and the prognostic value of the positron emission tomography in predicting septic embolism. We highlight the spectacular results of the DAPA-HF study in patients with heart failure and review publications showing the important role of the detection of myocardial fibrosis and scar by cardiac MRI for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death.
