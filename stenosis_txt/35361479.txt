Title: Marital Status and Sex-Based Differences in Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Studies have shown improved outcomes among married patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery; however, this has not been well studied in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVi). We examined the impact of marital status and patient sex on outcomes after TAVi. Patients who underwent TAVi from January 2015 to June 2018 were reviewed and stratified into 3 groups: single, married, and widowed. The impact of marital status and sex on 30-day outcomes was assessed using a stepwise logistic regression analysis. Cumulative survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and adjusted survival with multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling. A total of 785 patients were included: 149 single, 413 married, and 223 widowed. Widowed patients were older (84 vs 79 years) with higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk scores (6.79% vs 5.51%, both p ≤0.001) than married patients. Neither marital status nor sex was associated with 30-day mortality or home discharge. However, 1-year survival revealed a differential survival penalty, with married females (p = 0.041) having lower survival and married males (p = 0.007) having higher survival than their single counterparts. This survival penalty persisted in the adjusted analyses (married females hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p = 0.009; widowed males HR 2.42, p = 0.057). For patients who were readmitted in the first year, adjusted analysis showed widowed status was associated with higher 30-day readmissions (HR 1.91, p = 0.012) in both sexes. In conclusion, these findings suggest that marital status does not impact both sexes equally after TAVi; identifying at-risk patients and targeted interventions, such as adjusting discharge planning to ensure adequate home social support, may help improve outcomes.
