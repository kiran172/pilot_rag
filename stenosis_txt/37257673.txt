Title: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the treatment strategies for coronary artery bypass graft patients with concomitant carotid artery atherosclerotic disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Stroke is one of the devastating complications after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Underlying carotid artery atherosclerotic disease is reported to be an independent risk factor. The optimal treatment strategy for these patients remains under debate.
METHODS: We aimed to perform a network meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of additional carotid interventions for patients with concomitant carotid artery atherosclerotic disease who require CABG by comparing perioperative adverse event rates. All articles through February 2022 were searched using MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify studies that investigated outcomes of CABG only as well as additional staged vs combined carotid interventions by both carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS).
RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials and 23 observational studies were included, yielding a total of 32,473 patients who underwent combined CEA and CABG (n = 20,204), CEA and staged CABG (n = 6882), CABG and staged CEA (n = 340), CAS and CABG regardless of timing and sequences (n = 1224), and CABG only (n = 3823). No strategy showed a significant advantage over CABG only in all perioperative outcomes. CEA and staged CABG was associated with the lowest perioperative stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) rate, significantly lower compared with CAS and CABG (odds ratio [OR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.76) as well as CABG and staged CEA (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23-0.74), but was also associated with the highest perioperative mortality (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.67-3.85, vs CAS and CABG) and myocardial infarction rate (OR, 3.70 [95% CI, 1.16-12.5] and OR, 2.50 [95% CI, 1.35-4.55] vs CAS and CABG, vs combined CEA and CABG, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: CEA and staged CABG are associated with low perioperative stroke/transient ischemic attack rates with a tradeoff of higher mortality and myocardial infarction rate. No strategy showed a significant advantage over the CABG-only strategy in all perioperative outcomes, outlining the importance of a tailored approach and determining proper indications for carotid intervention in these patients.
