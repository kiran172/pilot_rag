Title: Systemic immune-inflammation index predicts short-term mortality in acute ischemic stroke with severe stenosis of internal carotid artery associated pneumonia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the relationship between systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and short-term mortality in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with internal carotid artery (ICA) severe stenosis and stroke associated pneumonia (SAP) patients.
METHODS: Information on general demographic, laboratory data, CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or digital subtraction angiography were obtained. The predictive power was evaluated by assessing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The logistic regression was performed to assess the association of SII and short-term mortality in severe stenosis ICA-AIS and SAP patients.
RESULT: Among 342 patients with severe stenosis ICA-AIS and SAP, death occurred in 66 patients during 120 days follow-up. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that increased SII predicts higher mortality in 120 days follow-up, and the risk of short-term mortality in SII &gt; 666.31 × 109/L group is increased 4.671-fold. Patients with SII &gt; 666.31 × 109/L had higher proportion of male, hypertension, smoking, higher admission NIHSS score, higher systolic blood pressure, and higher proportion of 120 days mortality. Higher SII predicted a worse 120 days mortality was worked out by Kaplan-Meier methods.
CONCLUSION: An elevated SII was remarkably associated with 120 days mortality in severe stenosis ICA-AIS and SAP patients.
