Title: Temporary stenting in a case of bronchomalacia due to relapsing polychondritis.

Abstract: Airway involvement in relapsing polychondritis (RP) can often be debilitating and life threatening. Interventional procedures such as stenting can be useful to improve airway stenosis. This case was diagnosed with RP with a circumferential obstruction at the left main bronchus. We determined that a silicone airway stent would be placed. The silicone stent was removed after 22â€‰months due to granulation tissue. After stent removal, bronchoscopic findings revealed a collapsing left main bronchus during exhalation, but airway patency was maintained during inhalation without any respiratory symptoms. In this case, bronchomalacia remained after stent removal. However, since there were no severe respiratory symptoms, we decided that stent replacement was unnecessary. In general, it is difficult to remove airway stents in severe tracheobronchomalacia; however, temporary stenting might be a useful procedure in cases with unilateral main bronchial stenosis.
