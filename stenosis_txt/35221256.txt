Title: Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery Occlusion After Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty.

Abstract: We report the case of a bridge balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) complicated by non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis. Coronary angiography showed left anterior descending occlusion, while no lesions were apparent at pre-operative angiogram. The case highlights a potential severe complication of BAV and its management.
