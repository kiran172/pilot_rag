Title: Coronary Artery Stenosis Severity in Patients With Different Coronary Artery Calcium Scores on Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography.

Abstract: Background In this study, we aimed to determine coronary artery stenosis severity in patients with different coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores. Methodology A total of 145 patients were included in the study. All patients were given beta-blockers 12 hours and two hours before the test to keep their heart rate between 55 and 65 beats per minute. Computed tomography angiography was done from the pulmonary hilum up to the base of the heart and the patients were asked to hold their breath. The CAC score and stenosis were assessed. Results The mean age of the patients was 41.35 Â± 4.95 years. In total, 112 (77.24%) patients were male and 33 (22.76%) were female. Regarding the frequency of the CAC score, a score of 0-9 was observed in 43 (29.66%) patients, 10-99 was observed in 55 (37.93%) patients, and 100-400 was observed in 47 (32.41%) patients. The CAC score was 0-9 in 86.4% of patients having normal coronary arteries. Two (5.2%) patients with a CAC score of 100-400 had mild coronary artery stenosis, 11 (32.3%) patients had moderate coronary artery disease, and 33 (66.0%) patients had severe coronary artery disease (p < 0.00001). Conclusions There is a strong association between CAC scores and the severity of coronary artery stenosis. A CAC score of zero is associated with a very low risk of having coronary artery stenosis.
