Title: Redox-Resistant SERCA [Sarco(endo)plasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase] Attenuates Oxidant-Stimulated Mitochondrial Calcium and Apoptosis in Cardiac Myocytes and Pressure Overload-Induced Myocardial Failure in Mice.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: SERCA [sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase] is regulated by oxidative posttranslational modifications at cysteine 674 (C674). Because sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium has been shown to play a critical role in mediating mitochondrial dysfunction in response to reactive oxygen species, we hypothesized that SERCA oxidation at C674 would modulate the effects of reactive oxygen species on mitochondrial calcium and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in cardiac myocytes.
METHODS: Adult rat ventricular myocytes expressing wild-type SERCA2b or a redox-insensitive mutant in which C674 is replaced by serine (C674S) were exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100 µmol/Lμ). Free mitochondrial calcium concentration was measured in adult rat ventricular myocytes with a genetically targeted fluorescent probe, and SR calcium content was assessed by measuring caffeine-stimulated release. Mice with heterozygous knock-in of the SERCA C674S mutation were subjected to chronic ascending aortic constriction.
RESULTS: In adult rat ventricular myocytes expressing wild-type SERCA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> caused a 25% increase in mitochondrial calcium concentration that was associated with a 50% decrease in SR calcium content, both of which were prevented by the ryanodine receptor inhibitor tetracaine. In cells expressing the C674S mutant, basal SR calcium content was decreased by 31% and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stimulated rise in mitochondrial calcium concentration was attenuated by 40%. In wild-type cells, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> caused cytochrome c release and apoptosis, both of which were prevented in C674S-expressing cells. In myocytes from SERCA knock-in mice, basal SERCA activity and SR calcium content were decreased. To test the effect of C674 oxidation on apoptosis in vivo, SERCA knock-in mice were subjected to chronic ascending aortic constriction. In wild-type mice, ascending aortic constriction caused myocyte apoptosis, LV dilation, and systolic failure, all of which were inhibited in SERCA knock-in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Redox activation of SERCA C674 regulates basal SR calcium content, thereby mediating the pathologic reactive oxygen species-stimulated rise in mitochondrial calcium required for myocyte apoptosis and myocardial failure.
