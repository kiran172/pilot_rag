Title: Unraveling the Enigma of Moderate Aortic Stenosis: Challenges and Future Prospects.

Abstract: According to current guidelines, only clinical surveillance is recommended for patients with moderate aortic valve stenosis (AS), while aortic valve replacement may be considered in patients undergoing surgery for other indications. Recent studies have shown that moderate AS is associated with a high risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including death, especially in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. In this context, multimodality imaging can help to improve the accuracy of moderate AS diagnosis and to assess left ventricular remodeling response. This review discusses the natural history of this valve disease and the role of multimodality imaging in the diagnostic process, summarizes current evidence on the medical and non-medical management, and highlights ongoing trials on valve replacement.
