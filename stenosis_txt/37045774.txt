Title: Association Between Aortic Valve Calcification and Severity of Concomitant Aortic Regurgitation in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) frequently have concomitant aortic regurgitation (AR), but the association between aortic valvular calcification (AVC) and the severity of AR remains unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with severe AS who underwent transthoracic echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) within 1 month. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the degree of concomitant AR. The association between AVC and the severity of concomitant AR was assessed in patients with severe AS. The study population consisted of 95 patients: 43 men and 52 women with a mean age of 82±7 years. Of the 95 patients with severe AS, 27 had no or trivial AR, 53 had mild AR, and 15 had moderate AR. The AVC score (AVCS) and AVC volume (AVCV) significantly increased as the severity of concomitant AR increased (P=0.014 for both), and similar findings were obtained for the AVCS and AVCV indexes (P=0.004 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of AR correlated with AVCS and AVCV measured by MDCT in patients with severe AS. AVC may cause concomitant AR, leading to worsening of disease condition.
