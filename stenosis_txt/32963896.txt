Title: Stapled Repair of Benign Acquired Tracheoesophageal Fistula: Description of Novel Technique and Assessment of Outcomes.

Abstract: Compared to less invasive measures, surgical repair is the most effective modality for managing benign acquired tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Traditionally, this involves dismantling of the fistula and suture repair of tracheal and esophageal defects using a lateral or direct approach. However, the best approach remains a subject of debate. We describe a novel and simple technique for dismantling a benign acquiredÂ TEF with the use of an endo-stapler and interposition with sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle flap. Eleven TEF patients underwent repair using this stapled repair technique. Retrospectively, the perioperative and long-term outcomes were assessed in these patients. There were no cases of procedure-related mortality or airway-related complications. Two patients developed transient vocal cord palsy and one developed esophageal leak. At a mean follow-up of 21.4 months, no fistula recurrence, dysphagia, or tracheal stenosis was observed. Hence stapled dismantling and SCM muscle interposition is a simple and safe technique for repair of benign acquired TEF.
