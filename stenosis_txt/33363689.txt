Title: Triaxial system in stent-graft placement for traumatic renal artery dissection: A case report.

Abstract: Stent-graft placement is an important treatment for traumatic renal artery dissection, but it may occasionally be technically difficult to advance a catheter through the lesion of the dissection due to severe stenosis of the true rumen. A triple-coaxial (triaxial) system, which consists of a small microcatheter, a large microcatheter, and a 4-Fr. catheter, has recently become available, and it contributes to super-selective catheterization. We thought this system may be useful for passing catheters through the dissection. We herein report a 30-year-old male patient with traumatic renal artery dissection, who was successfully treated by stent-graft placement using the triaxial system.
