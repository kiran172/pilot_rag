Title: Serum Biomarkers in Carotid Artery Disease.

Abstract: Carotid artery disease is considered a major cause of strokes and there is a need for early disease detection and management. Although imaging techniques have been developed for the diagnosis of carotid artery disease and different imaging-based markers have been proposed for the characterization of atherosclerotic plaques, there is still need for a definition of high-risk plaques in asymptomatic patients who may benefit from surgical intervention. Measurement of circulating biomarkers is a promising method to assist in patient-specific disease management, but the lack of robust clinical evidence limits their use as a standard of care. The purpose of this review paper is to present circulating biomarkers related to carotid artery diagnosis and prognosis, which are mainly provided by statistical-based clinical studies. The result of our investigation showed that typical well-established inflammatory biomarkers and biomarkers related to patient lipid profiles are associated with carotid artery disease. In addition to this, more specialized types of biomarkers, such as endothelial and cell adhesion, matrix degrading, and metabolic biomarkers seem to be associated with different carotid artery disease outputs, assisting vascular specialists in selecting patients at high risk for stroke and in need of intervention.
