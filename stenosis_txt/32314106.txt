Title: Combining the CoreValve Evolut PRO and 14-French eSheath in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Despite the small profile, it is occasionally difficult to pass the CoreValve InLine sheath through a calcified or tortuous femoral access. We present the case of an 84-year-old woman with a symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, wherein transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was performed using a self-expandable CoreValve Evolut PRO. Although delivering the CoreValve InLine sheath was difficult due to iliac artery calcification, a low-profile 14-French expandable eSheath proved useful for delivering the Evolut PRO system. This case demonstrated the feasibility of using the Evolut PRO valve combined with a 14-French eSheath, which was designed for the Edwards SAPIEN valve.
