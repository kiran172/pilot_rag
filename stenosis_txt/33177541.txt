Title: NFKB1 gene rs28362491 ins/del variation is associated with higher susceptibility to myocardial infarction in a Chinese Han population.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, is a disease in which multiple environmental and genetic factors are involved. Recently, researches suggested that insertion/deletion (ins/del) variation of NFKB1 gene rs28362491 is a functional polymorphism. In the present study, we aimed to explore the relation between variation of NFKB1 gene rs28362491 and MI by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 359 MI patients and 1085 control participants. Gensini score was used to evaluate the degree of coronary artery stenosis in MI patients. The plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, malonaldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were randomly measured by ELISA both in MI patients and control participants. We found that the detected frequencies of D allele (41.2% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.021) and DD genotype (17.5% vs. 12.0%, P = 0.022) were significantly higher in MI patients than in control participants. Compared with II or ID genotype carriers, the Gensini score in MI patients with DD genotype was 32-43% higher (both P < 0.001). Moreover, DD genotype carries had more diseased coronary arteries (P = 0.001 vs. II or ID genotype). Of note, IL-6 levels in MI patients carrying DD genotype were significantly higher than that in control participants and other genotype carriers in MI patients (both P < 0.05). In conclusion, NFKB1 gene rs28362491 DD genotype was associated with a higher risk of MI and more severe coronary artery lesion, which also had a potential influence on the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
