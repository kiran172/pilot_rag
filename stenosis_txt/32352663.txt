Title: [Quality of life after reconstructive procedures for esophageal strictures].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term results of reconstructive procedures for esophageal strictures and evaluate quality life after each type of esophageal repair using own criteria.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted among patients who underwent esophageal repair with gastric transplant (172), colonic transplant (25), intestinal transplant (14) and repair of short cervical strictures (7). The age of patients ranged from 5 to 60 years. All patients underwent X-ray and endoscopic examination. Survey also included external respiration function and cardiac function, digestive function, measurement of height and weight, analysis of social aspects (work, study), female genital function. Five-score scale for quality of life assessment was developed.
RESULTS: Long-term results were studied in 218 patients for the period from 3 months to 31 years (2002-2017). Excellent and good results were obtained in 180 patients. The best results were obtained after repair of short cervical strictures (4.42 scores), good results - after esophageal repair with gastric (4.14 scores) and intestinal (4.07 scores) transplants. Colonic repair was followed by satisfactory outcome (3.16 scores).
CONCLUSION: Gastric and small bowel grafts are preferred for total esophageal repair due to better quality of life in long-term postoperative period.
