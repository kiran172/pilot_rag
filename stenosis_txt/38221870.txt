Title: Patient reported outcomes of intermittent self-dilatation after direct vision internal urethrotomy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Long-term results on quality of life (QoL) as well as clinical outcomes of intermittent self-dilatation (ISD) of the urethra after direct visual internal urethrotomy (DVIU) are scarce. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate patient reported outcomes (PROs) on voiding symptoms and QoL in a large cohort of urethral stricture patients performing ISD.
METHODS: We identified a total of 121 patients who performed ISD following DVIU between 2008 and 2013. Baseline assessment was conducted for each patient before ISD was started. Follow-up visits were scheduled in 6-month intervals. Each assessment included the following questionnaires: International prostate symptom score (IPSS), IPSS quality of life index (IPSS-QoL), patient global impression of severity (PGI-S), and patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I). Additional parameters were maximum urinary flow rate (Q<sub>max</sub> ), postvoid residual urine, rate of complications, and stricture recurrence. Linear mixed models were used to examine the change over the course of the follow-up visits to the baseline.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 43-70). The median follow-up was 17 months (IQR: 7-30). Mean change from baseline IPSS was -6.1, -5.9, -4.2, and -4.8 points at 6, 24, 36, and 48 months. Mean change from baseline IPSS-QoL was -1.3, -1.4, -1.6, and -1.8 points, respectively. Mean PGI-I was 1.7 points at 6, 1.9 points at 24, 1.9 points at 36, and 2.2 points at 48 months after ISD initiation. Mean change of Q<sub>max</sub> ranged from 1.7 at 6 to 2.2 mL/s at 48 months. The median complication rate was 3.3% per 6-month ISD interval. Overall, 11 patients developed stricture recurrence (9%).
CONCLUSION: ISD after DVIU had no negative impact on patients' QoL (IPSS-QoL, PGI-I, PGI-S). Urodynamic parameters remained stable for up to 48 months with low complications and an acceptable stricture recurrence rate.
