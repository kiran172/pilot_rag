Title: Anorectal Functional Outcomes Following Doppler-Guided Transanal Hemorrhoidal Dearterialization: Evidence from Vietnam.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Doppler-guided transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD) was considered a less invasive and innovative method to treat hemorrhoidal disease, but it may impact the anal area during dearterialization and mucopexy. Thus, this study aimed to assess any changes in anorectal manometry of grade III and IV hemorrhoidal patients following THD treatment.
METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted with patients who had grades III and IV hemorrhoidal disease. The patients were treated using THD at the Department of Surgery in the National Hospital of Traditional Medicine (Hanoi, Vietnam) between June 2012 and December 2013. Anorectal manometry was performed prior to THD and again between 6 and 12 months following the procedure.
RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study, including 32 with grade III hemorrhoids and 8 with grade IV hemorrhoids. The proportion of male patients (65%) was higher than that of female patients (35%), and the majority of patients (82.5%) were > 40 years old. The mean duration of symptoms prior to treatment was 12.3 years. The mean length of the anal sphincter was unchanged before and after THD (3.64 ± 0.40 cm prior to treatment vs. 3.66 ± 0.48 cm following treatment; p = 0.57). Significant differences in treatment-related changes were detected for all anorectal manometric measurements except maximum squeezing pressure (p < 0.05). No patient showed anal stenosis or fecal incontinence.
CONCLUSION: The THD technique did not change the length of the anal sphincter 6 months after hemorrhoid treatment. The values of anal pressure and rectal sensation decreased almost significantly between treatment and the follow-up visit. We suggest that further studies, which include larger sample sizes, should be conducted to confirm THD effectiveness in terms of anorectal functions.
