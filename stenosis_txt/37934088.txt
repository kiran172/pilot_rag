Title: Cardiac surgery simulation - part 2: Step-by-step Konno operation in a preclinical model.

Abstract: This operation is performed on a preclinical model (porcine heart) that has been positioned and fixed inside a plastic mannequin, simulating the human anatomy. This set-up allows surgical operations to be performed at almost the same depth and orientation as in the operating theatre. The preclinical model allows the exact simulation of most of the key movements and steps of major adult and congenital operations. In this case, we replicate the Konno operation. This intervention addresses localized subaortic stenosis involving the left outflow tract or the narrowing of the left ventriculo-aortic junction.
