Title: Plaque characteristics associated with failure of primary balloon angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis: a retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary balloon angioplasty (PBA) is an alternative treatment approach for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS); however, its efficacy may be compromised by arterial dissection or early elastic recoil after balloon dilation. This study aimed to explore the association between plaque characteristics on high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (HR-VWI) and failure of PBA for ICAS.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 113 patients with ICAS who underwent HR-VWI before endovascular treatment. Based on the presence of arterial dissection or early elastic recoil post-balloon dilation, patients were classified into the failed PBA (FPBA) group or the successful PBA (SPBA) group. Clinical and baseline HR-VWI characteristics were compared between the two groups. Multivariable analysis was used to investigate plaque features associated with the failure of PBA.
RESULTS: The FPBA and SPBA groups comprised 74 and 39 patients, respectively. Plaque eccentricity (83.78% vs 46.15%, P<0.001), negative remodeling (90.54% vs 48.72%, P<0.001), remodeling index (median 0.73 vs 0.90, P=0.001), and intraplaque hemorrhage (31.08% vs 5.13%, P=0.002) differed significantly between the FPBA and SPBA groups. Multivariable analysis indicated that higher frequency of plaque eccentricity (OR 14.03, 95% CI 3.42 to 57.62, P<0.001) and negative remodeling (OR 6.11, 95%â€‰CI 1.22 to 30.71, P=0.028) were independently associated with failure of PBA.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that failure of PBA was associated with plaque eccentricity and negative remodeling. Analysis of plaque characteristics on baseline HR-VWI holds potential value for identifying arterial dissection or early elastic recoil after angioplasty in patients with ICAS.
