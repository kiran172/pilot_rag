Title: Association of plaque characteristics with long-term stroke recurrence in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease: a 3D high-resolution MRI-based cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the predictive ability of plaque characteristics for long-term stroke recurrence among patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD).
METHODS: This cohort study included 132 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) attributed to ICAD who were recruited between July 2017 and December 2020 and followed until stroke recurrence or December 2021. Plaque surface irregularity, degree of stenosis, plaque burden, remodeling ratio, enhancement ratio, and intraplaque hemorrhage were assessed with 3-dimensional high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (3D HR-MRI). Data were analyzed using Cox models, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 132 patients, during a median follow-up of 2.8 years, stroke recurrence occurred in 35 patients. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of stroke recurrence was 3.15 (1.34-7.42) per 10% increase in plaque burden and 2.17 (1.27-3.70) for enhancement ratio. The area under the curve (AUC) to predict stroke recurrence was 0.725 (95% CI 0.629-0.822) for plaque burden, 0.692 (95% CI 0.593-0.792) for enhancement ratio, and only 0.595 (95% CI 0.492-0.699) for the Essen stroke risk score. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis further demonstrated significant differences in survival of free recurrent stroke between patients with plaque burden or enhancement ratio below and above the optimum cut-offs (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Higher plaque burden and enhancement ratio are independent risk factors for long-term stroke recurrence among patients with symptomatic ICAD, and valuable imaging markers for predicting and stratifying risk of stroke recurrence.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: In patients with symptomatic ICAD, the results of this high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging study have potential implications for optimal management of intracranial plaques and secondary prevention of stroke recurrence based on plaque burden and enhancement ratio.
KEY POINTS: • Identification of intracranial plaque characteristics responsible for stroke recurrence is essential to preventing stroke recurrence in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease. • Higher plaque burden and enhancement ratio are independent risk factors for stroke recurrence. • Plaque burden and enhancement ratio are valuable imaging markers in the prediction and stratification of the risk of stroke recurrence.
