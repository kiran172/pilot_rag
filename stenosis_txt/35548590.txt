Title: Association Between Plasma Lipoprotein Levels and Aortic Valve Calcification Among Patients with Aortic Valve Replacement Surgery: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a prevalent type of valvular heart disease, its association with dyslipidemia remains controversial.
METHODS: Of 449 CAVD patients who underwent aortic valve replacement, 228 formed the aortic valve calcification (AVC) group, and 221 were the non-calcification group. We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative and one-year postoperative plasma lipoprotein levels of both and performed a logistic regression to evaluate the factors associated with AVC.
RESULTS: Preoperatively, AVC patients had significantly higher coronary heart disease (43.0% vs 24.9%, p&lt;0.001), peripheral vascular disease (41.7% vs 26.2%, p&lt;0.001), and heart failure rates (63.6% vs 47.1%, p&lt;0.001), and a higher level of total cholesterol (4.1±0.9 vs 3.9±0.8 mmol/L, p=0.032) and very low-density cholesterol (0.6 (0.4-0.7) vs 0.5 (0.3-0.7) mmol/L, p=0.054). Echocardiography revealed a significant difference of aortic stenosis in both AVC and non-AVC groups (p&lt;0.05), and also identified aortic regurgitation (AR) with a significant difference between these two groups (p=0.003). The peak transaortic jet velocity, peak transaortic gradient, and mean transaortic gradient were significantly higher in the calcification group (all p&lt;0.001), but the aortic valve area (0.7 (0.5-1.0) vs 4 (0.9-4.5) cm2; p&lt;0.001) was smaller. Age (OR=1.023), total cholesterol (OR=1.272), and mean transaortic gradient (OR=1.182) were AVC risk factors. A larger aortic valve area (OR=0.010) were protective factors. The one-year mortality and perivalvular leakage rates were significantly higher in the calcification group.
CONCLUSION: Total cholesterol was significantly higher in AVC patients and may be an AVC risk factor along with age and mean transaortic gradient. AVC patients had a relatively poorer outcome within one year.
