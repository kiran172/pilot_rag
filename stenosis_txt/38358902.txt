Title: Impact on clinical outcome of ventricular arrhythmias in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a largely used treatment for severe aortic stenosis. There are limited data, however, about predictors of long-term prognosis in this population. In this study, we assessed whether ventricular arrhythmias may predict clinical outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a 24 h ECG Holter monitoring in 267 patients who underwent TAVI for severe aortic stenosis within 30 days from a successful procedure. The occurrence of frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; ≥30/h), polymorphic PVCs and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) was obtained for each patient. Clinical outcome was obtained for 228 patients (85%), for an average follow-up of 3.5 years (range 1.0-8.6). Cardiovascular events (CVEs; cardiovascular death or resuscitated cardiac arrest) occurred in 26 patients (11.4%) and 63 patients died (27.6%). Frequent PVCs but not polymorphic PVCs and NSVT were found to be associated with CVEs at univariate analysis. Frequent PVCs were indeed found in 12 patients with (46.2%) and 35 without (17.3%) CVEs [hazard ratio 2.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-5.09; P  = 0.04], whereas polymorphic PVCs were found in 11 (42.3%) and 54 (26.7%) patients of the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio 1.44; 95% CI 0.64-3.25; P  = 0.38), and NSVT in 9 (34.6%) and 43 patients of the two groups, respectively (hazard ratio 1.18; 95% CI 0.48-2.87; P  = 0.72). Frequent PVCs, however, were not significantly associated with CVEs at multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 1.53; 95% CI 0.37-6.30; P  = 0.56). Both frequent PVCs, polymorphic PVCs and NSVT showed no significant association with mortality.
CONCLUSION: In our study, the detection of frequent PVCs at Holter monitoring after TAVI was a predictor of CVEs (cardiovascular death/cardiac arrest), but this association was lost in multivariable analysis.
