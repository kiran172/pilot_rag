Title: Prognostic Influence of Feature Tracking Multidetector Row Computed Tomography-Derived Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Strain in Patients with Aortic Stenosis Treated With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Computed tomography plays a central role in the evaluation of patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Advances in left ventricular (LV) analysis with multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) permit measurement of LV global longitudinal strain (GLS). The present study aimed at evaluating the association between feature tracking (FT) MDCT derived LV GLS and all-cause mortality in patients treated with TAVI. A total of 214 patients with severe aortic stenosis (51% male, 80 ± 7 years) who underwent TAVI and with dynamic MDCT data allowing LV GLS measurement with novel FT algorithm were included. LV GLS was measured at baseline and were divided according to a previously published cut-off value of LV GLS associated with all-cause mortality (≤-14% [more preserved LV systolic function] vs >-14% [more impaired LV systolic function]). Patients were followed for the occurrence of all-cause mortality. Mean FT MDCT-derived LV GLS was -12.5 ± 4%. During a median follow-up of 45 months (interquartile range: 29 to 62 months), 67 (31%) patients died. The cumulative rate of all-cause mortality for the patients with FT MDCT-derived LV GLS ≤-14% was 15% versus28% for the patients with FT MDCT-derived LV GLS >-14%, Log rank p = 0.001). FT MDCT-derived LV GLS was independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.851; 95% confidence interval: 0.772 to 0.937; p = 0.001). In conclusion, impaired FT MDCT-derived LV GLS is independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients treated with TAVI. Besides aortic valve area and calcification, FT MDCT-derived LV GLS is an important prognostic marker.
