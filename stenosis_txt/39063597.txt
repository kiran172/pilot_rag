Title: Myocardial, Valvular and Vascular Abnormalities in Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot.

Abstract: Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common heart defect associated with cyanosis characterized by the co-occurrence of pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and ventricular septal defect with over-riding of the aorta. The present review purposed to summarize myocardial, valvular and vascular abnormalities, which were described in a series of patients following repair of tetralogy of Fallot. It was also aimed to describe potential differences in these parameter using different surgical strategies.
