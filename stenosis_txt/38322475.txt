Title: Is medical management useful in Moyamoya disease?

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD), characterized by progressive internal carotid artery stenosis and collateral vessel formation, prompts cerebral perfusion complications and is stratified into idiopathic and Moyamoya syndrome subtypes. A multifaceted approach toward MMD management addresses cerebral infarctions through revascularization surgery and adjunctive medical therapy, while also navigating risks such as intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral infarction resulting from arterial stenosis and fragile collateral vessels. Addressing antithrombotic management reveals a potential role for treatments like antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, despite the ambiguous contribution of thrombosis to MMD-related infarctions and the critical balance between preventing ischemic events and averting hemorrhagic complications. Transcranial doppler has proven useful in thromboembolic detection, despite persisting challenges concerning the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic treatments. Furthermore, antihypertensive interventions aim to manage blood pressure meticulously, especially during intracerebral hemorrhage, with recommendations and protocols varying based on the patient's hypertension status. Additionally, lipid-lowering therapeutic strategies, particularly employing statins, are appraised for their possible beneficial role in MMD management, even as comprehensive data from disease-specific clinical trials remains elusive. Comprehensive guidelines and protocols to navigate the multifaceted therapeutic avenues for MMD, while maintaining a delicate balance between efficacy and safety, warrant further meticulous research and development. This protocol manuscript seeks to elucidate the various aspects and challenges imbued in managing and navigating through the complex landscape of MMD treatment.
