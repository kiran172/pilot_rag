Title: The Author's Contributions to Echocardiography Literature (Part II-1991-2020).

Abstract: The author's contribution up to 1990 was reviewed in part I and the echo contributions from 1991 to 2020 will be reviewed in part II. These include defining the relationship between the quantity of shunt across the atrial septal defect (ASD) and the diameter of ASD by echo and angio on the one side and the stretched diameter of the ASD on the other; echocardiographic assessment of balloon-stretched diameter of secundum ASDs; development of echocardiographic predictors of accomplishment of percutaneous closure of ASDs with the buttoned device, highlighting limitations of echocardiography in comprehensive assessment of mixed type of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection; description of follow-up echocardiographic results of transcatheter closure of ASD with buttoned device; review of ultrasound studies; depiction of collaborative echocardiographic and Doppler studies; echocardiographic appraisal of the outcome of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty; editorials; ventricular septal aneurysm causing pulmonary outflow tract obstruction in the morphologic left ventricle in corrected transposition of the great arteries; dependability of echocardiographic assessment of angiographic minimal diameter of the ductus; occurrence of supravalvular pulmonary artery stenosis after a Nuss procedure; echocardiographic assessment of neonates who were suspected of having heart disease; role of echocardiographic studies in the appraisal of patent ductus arteriosus in the premature babies; and the role of pressure recovery in explaining differences between simultaneously measured Doppler and cardiac catheterization pressure gradients across outflow tract stenotic lesions.
