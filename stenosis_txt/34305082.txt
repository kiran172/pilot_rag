Title: Beta-2-Microglobulin is an Independent Risk Factor for Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis in Patients with Primary Aldosteronism.

Abstract: AIM: To identify the association between serum beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) or cystatin C (CysC) and asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 265 subjects were enrolled, including 83 patients with PA, 91 with essential hypertension (EH), and 91 normotensive (NT) controls. B2M, CysC, plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were measured, and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) was calculated. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), increased cIMT, and presence of carotid plaque or carotid stenosis ＜50% in the carotid artery were measured via ultrasonography to evaluate the degree of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: CIMT increased in the NT, EH, and PA groups (0.60 (0.50, 0.80) mm vs. 0.80 (0.60, 1.00) mm vs. 0.90 (0.70, 1.10) mm, P＜0.01), so as the prevalence of increased cIMT and presence of carotid plaque (both P＜0.05). The B2M and CysC levels exhibited the same trend (B2M: 1.60±0.34 mg/L, 1.80±0.41 mg/L, 1.98±0.64 mg/L, P＜0.05; CysC: 0.76±0.12 mg/L, 0.88±0.17 mg/L, 0.94±0.23 mg/L, P＜0.05). B2M, CysC, PAC, and ARR were all positively associated with cIMT (all P＜0.01) in the PA group. After adjusting for potential confounders, B2M, PAC, but not CysC or ARR were independently associated with increased cIMT and presence of carotid plaque and carotid stenosis ＜50%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that B2M and PAC demonstrated significant predictive ability for increased cIMT and presence of carotid plaque and carotid stenosis ＜50%.
CONCLUSION: B2M is an independent risk factor for asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis in patients with PA.
