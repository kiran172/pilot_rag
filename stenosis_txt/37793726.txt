Title: Using Augmented Mean Arterial Pressure to Identify High Mortality Risk Patients With Moderate Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the usefulness of a novel echocardiographic marker, augmented mean arterial pressure (AugMAP = [(mean aortic valve gradient + systolic blood pressure) + (2 × diastolic blood pressure)] / 3), in identifying high-risk patients with moderate aortic stenosis (AS).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults with moderate AS (aortic valve area, 1.0-1.5 cm2) at Mayo Clinic sites from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2020, were identified. Baseline demographic, echocardiographic, and all-cause mortality data were retrieved. Patients were grouped into higher and lower AugMAP groups using a cutoff value of 80 mm Hg for analysis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to assess the performance of AugMAP.
RESULTS: A total of 4563 patients with moderate AS were included (mean ± SD age, 73.7±12.5 years; 60.5% men). Median follow-up was 2.5 years; 36.0% of patients died. The mean ± SD left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 60.1%±11.4%, and the mean ± SD AugMAP was 99.1±13.1 mm Hg. Patients in the lower AugMAP group, with either preserved or reduced LVEF, had significantly worse survival performance (all P<.001). Multivariate Cox regression showed that AugMAP (hazard ratio, 0.962; 95% CI, 0.942 to 0.981 per 5-mm Hg increase; P<.001) and AugMAP less than 80 mm Hg (hazard ratio, 1.477; 95% CI, 1.241 to 1.756; P<.001) were independently associated with all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSION: AugMAP is a simple and effective echocardiographic marker to identify high-risk patients with moderate AS independent of LVEF. It can potentially be used in the candidate selection process if moderate AS becomes indicated for aortic valve intervention in the future.
