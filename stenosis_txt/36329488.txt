Title: Age-related radiographic parameters difference between the degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis patients and healthy people and correlation analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To identify age-related radiographic risk factors for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) and analyze correlations among them.
METHODS: A total of 180 cases were enrolled in this study, and lumbar magnetic resonance was performed. Among them, 93 cases suffered DLSS and lumbar dynamic X-ray was examined. And following parameters were measured and evaluated: intervertebral disk height (IDH), the ratio of IDH(IDH<sub>L4-5/L3-4</sub>), initial IDH of L4-5(iIDH<sub>L4-5</sub>) in the DLSS group, disk degeneration (DD), cartilaginous endplate failure (CEF), Modic changes, the thickness of ligamentum flavum (LF), range of intervertebral motion (ROM), facet joint opening (FJO), facet joint angle (FJA), the standard cross-sectional area (SCSA) of the multifidus, erector spinae, and psoas major muscles. The data of two groups were compared, and the possible risk factors of DLSS were analyzed.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the DLSS group had higher IDH except for L4-5 and larger iIDH<sub>L4-5</sub> (P &lt; 0.05). Significant differences were shown in CEF and the thickness of LF at L1-S1 and DD at L4-5 (P &lt; 0.05). The DLSS group had smaller SCSA of multifidus, erector spinae, and psoas major muscles but greater FJA, FJO (P &lt; 0.05). And the risk of DLSS increased when iIDH<sub>L4-5</sub> ≥ 10.73 mm, FJA ≥ 52.03° , or FJO ≥ 3.75 mm. IDH positively correlated with SCSA of multifidus and psoas major muscles and ROM at L1-S1 (P &lt; 0.05). DD showed negative linear relations with SCSA of multifidus and psoas muscle and positive linear relation with CEF at L1-2, L2-3, and L5-S1 (P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Larger initial disk height and excessive CEF may induce DLSS by increasing intervertebral mobility to promote DD, and atrophied paravertebral muscles by weakening the stability of lumbar spine.
