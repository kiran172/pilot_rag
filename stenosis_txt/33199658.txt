Title: [Posterior Approach for Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy in Patients Older than 80 Years of Age].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the characteristics and operative results of elderly patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy(aged ≧80 years)treated using the posterior approach.
METHODS: Between April 2010 and December 2018, 21 patients aged ≧80 years(older group:8 men and 13 women;age range, 80-90 years)who underwent laminoplasty were reviewed and compared with 23 patients aged <80 years(younger group;13 men and 10 women;age range, 42-79 years)who underwent laminoplasty. The following data were obtained from chart reviews:age;sex;cervical canal stenosis level;time to operation;symptoms(e.g., gait disturbance);comorbidities(hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer, heart disease, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and lumbar canal stenosis);antithrombotic drug use;cardiac, pulmonary, and renal functions;operative time;volume of blood loss during the operation;postoperative delirium;and follow-up period. Neurological deficits before and after the surgery were assessed using the neurosurgical cervical spine scale(NCSS). Data were statistically analyzed, and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The operative time, symptoms(hypertension), renal function, and preoperative NCSS score were significantly different between the older and younger groups. Meanwhile, most variables showed no significant differences between the groups. Although the preoperative NCSS score was lower in the older group, there was no significant difference in the degree of improvement in the NCSS score after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that we should not hesitate to perform surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy in elderly patients with favorable cardiorespiratory function.
