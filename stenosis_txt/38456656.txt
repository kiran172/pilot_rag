Title: Punctal and Canalicular Stenosis Following Topical 1% 5-Fluorouracil Eye Drop Therapy for Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To present the first known cases of punctal and canalicular stenosis following topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) eye drops for ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with OSSN receiving topical 1% 5-FU eye drops as a primary or adjuvant treatment between 2013 and 2021 was performed. Individuals diagnosed with punctal or canalicular stenosis during or after topical 5-FU use were included in this study. Four individuals met these criteria; we report clinical findings and treatment course for each patient.
RESULTS: We reviewed 303 patients (316 eyes) with OSSN. All patients were treated with topical 1% 5-FU eye drops in cycles, given 4 times daily for 1 week with 3 weeks off. Four patients (5 eyes) developed punctal stenosis, for a frequency of 1.3%. The mean age at 5-FU initiation in the 4 individuals was 61 years (range 53-69). Most individuals were male (75%), White (75%), and non-Hispanic (100%). The most common presenting symptom of stenosis was epiphora, noted 4.6 ± 3 months after initiating topical 5-FU (after 4.9 ± 2.0 cycles). This occurred in 4 eyes while on therapy (3, 2, 4, and 4 months since 5-FU initiation) and in 1 eye after stopping therapy (10.3 months since 5-FU initiation). In 1 eye, punctal stenosis and epiphora resolved spontaneously after stopping 5-FU. Punctal dilation led to symptom resolution in 2 eyes. Surgical intervention (punctoplasty and external dacryocystorhinostomy) was needed in 2 eyes for punctal and canalicular stenosis, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Punctal or canalicular stenosis is a rare and previously unreported adverse effect of topical 5-FU that may require surgical treatment.
