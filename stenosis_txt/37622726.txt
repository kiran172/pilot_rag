Title: Life-Threatening Subglottic Thrombus Formation after Administration of Nebulized Tranexamic Acid.

Abstract: We present a case of subglottic thrombus formation after administration of nebulized tranexamic acid (TXA) for postoperative hemoptysis following CO<sub>2</sub> laser wedge excision of subglottic stenosis. Although other factors certainly could have resulted in postoperative bleeding and subsequent thrombus formation, the patient's rapid decompensation following administration of nebulized TXA suggests a direct effect. We recommend implementing an airway action plan regarding TXA use for patients presenting to the emergency department with postoperative hemorrhage following otolaryngology procedures.
