Title: [Effect of fully covered self-expandable metal stents completely inserted into the common bile duct in the treatment of benign biliary stricture].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of fully covered self-expandable metal stents(FCSEMS) completely inserted into the common bile duct in the treatment of benign biliary stricture(BBS). Methods: From December 2018 to December 2020, 22 cases of BBS treated by FCSEMS completely inserted into the common bile duct were analyzed retrospectively in the cholelithic center of Shanghai East Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University, including 12 males and 10 females, with average ages of (50.9±8.6) years. Results: All 22 cases of FCSEMS insertion were successful. The average indwelling time was (221.9±19.8) d. There were no complications of enterobiliary reflux such as liver abscess, acute cholangitis, and common bile duct obstruction. FSCEMS proximal displacement occurred in 2 cases (9.1%) with the removal time of 62 min and 115 min, respectively. There was no FCSEMS proximal displacement in 20 cases (90.9), with an average removal time of (29.7±6.3) min. All the 22 cases were followed up for 16.0 (8.0, 25.3) months, and there was no recurrence of stenosis. Conclusion: FCSESM completely inserted into the common bile duct is an effective method for the treatment of BBS, which can avoid the occurrence of enterobiliary reflux.
