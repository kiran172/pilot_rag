Title: The Relationship Between APOE Gene Polymorphism and In-stent Restenosis After Stenting at the Beginning of the Vertebral Artery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively investigate the relationship between apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphism and in-stent restenosis (ISR) after stenting at the beginning of the vertebral artery.
METHODS: The study included 155 patients who successfully underwent stenting at the beginning of the vertebral artery and had postoperative digital subtraction angiography or computed tomography angiography. Based on the follow-up results, they were divided into the restenosis (ISR) group and non-restenosis (non-ISR) group. The clinical information and APOE genotypes of both groups were analyzed. A binary logistic regression model was used to analyze independent risk factors for ISR.
RESULTS: After 1 year of follow-up, 49 (31.6%) patients had ISR and 106 (68.4%) did not. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), serum lipoprotein-related phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), and E3/E4 genotype were independent risk factors for ISR after stenting at the beginning of the vertebral artery. In addition, the LDL-C level of patients with the E3/E4 genotype was higher compared with the E3/E3 genotype group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: APOE gene polymorphism is associated with ISR, and the E3/E4 genotype is an independent risk factor for ISR after stenting at the beginning of the vertebral artery. Further genetic studies can identify risk genotypes to facilitate the early prediction and identification of high-risk patients with ISR.
