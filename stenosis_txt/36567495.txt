Title: Coronary artery disease and its vascular associates in patients with chronic nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism (cHypoPT) are prone to intracranial-calcification, cataract and nephrocalcinosis. In this study, we systematically investigated the possibility of increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) and coronary artery disease (CAD) in them.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Ninety-four nonsurgical cHypoPT (M:F = 50:44; age = 45 ± 15 years) with 18.6 ± 9.3 years of illness were assessed. Those with dyspnoea, angina, syncope, abnormal electrocardiogram, echocardiography or significant CAC underwent coronary angiography or myocardial-perfusion-stress imaging. Their lipid parameters and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were compared with age-matched healthy controls (Group A, n = 101). The prevalence of CAC in cHypoPT was compared with that of subjects referred from cardiology-clinics (Group B, n = 148, age = 52 ± 11 years).
RESULTS: One of 94 cHypoPT had known CAD. On screening, 17 cHypoPT required evaluation for CAD. Two of 17 had severe coronary stenosis, and 12 showed subclinical CAD. CAC and aortic-valve calcification occurred in 21.5% and 11.8%. Clinical and subclinical CAD, CAC and aortic-valve calcification in cHypoPT ≥50 years of age was 8.1%, 27.0%, 52.8% and 27.8%, respectively. Frequency of age-adjusted CAC was comparable between cHypoPT and control Group B (30.2% vs. 30.7%, p = .93). Elevated hsCRP was higher in cHypoPT than in controls A (52% vs. 32%, p < .01). Factors associated with CAD in cHypoPT were CAC and hypertension. However, CAD and CAC showed no association with long-term calcemic or phosphatemic control and intracranial-calcification in cHypoPT.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and subclinical CAD was observed in 3.2% and 12.8% of cHypoPT patients. The increased prevalence of CAD, CAC and aortic-valve calcification in cHypoPT above 50 years of age suggested their careful cardiac evaluation during follow-up.
