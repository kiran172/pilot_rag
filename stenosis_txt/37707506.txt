Title: Outcome of conventional radiotherapy in small centrally located tumours or lymph nodes: minimal toxicity, remarkable survival but challenging loco-regional control.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In peripheral lung tumours, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is superior to conventional RT. SBRT has also shown high loco-regional control (LC) in centrally located tumours, but there is a high risk of severe toxicity. The STRICTSTARLung trial (NCT05354596) examines if risk-adapted SBRT for central tumours is feasible. In this study, we examined overall survival (OS), Disease-free survival (DSF), LC, and toxicity in patients with central tumours that could have been candidates for SBRT but received conventional RT.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospectively, we evaluated 49 lung cancer patients that between 2008 and 2021 received RT (60-70Gy in 2 Gy fractions) for a solitary tumour or lymph node with a diameter <5cm located <2cm from the bronchial tree, oesophagus, aorta or heart. All tumours were pathologically verified; 30 were primary lung tumours (T1b-T4) and 19 were solitary lymph nodes (T0N1-N2). Chemotherapy was administered as concomitant (29) or sequential (4). OS and LC were analysed using Kaplan Meier. Cox proportional hazards model for OS and disease-free survival (DFS) was performed including tumour volume, histology, sex, T- vs N-site and chemotherapy. Toxicity was scored.
RESULTS: In 42 patients, the tumour was located <1 cm to mediastinum. Median follow-up time was 44 months (range: 7-123). The median OS was 51 months. OS at 1-, 3- and 5-year was 88% (SE:5), 59% (SE:7) and 50% (SE:8). Loco-regional recurrences occurred in 16 patients resulting in 1-, and 3-year LC rates of 77% (SE:6) and 64% (SE:8). The majority occurred within 3 years after RT. Only stage showed significant impact on OS and DFS. No patients experienced grade 4-5 toxicity. Seven patients developed grade 3 toxicity (5 oesophageal stenosis, 2 pneumonitis).
CONCLUSION: Conventional RT for patients with small central lung tumours or solitary lymph nodes is feasible. Median OS was 51 months, and toxicity was low with no grade 4-5 events.
