Title: Surgery for a giant atherosclerotic left main trifurcation saccular coronary artery aneurysm.

Abstract: Aneurysms of the left main coronary artery are rare clinical entities with an incidence of 0.1%. We herein report a case of left main trifurcation aneurysm in a 57-year-old woman whose coronary angiography demonstrated a giant saccular aneurysm of trifurcation of the left main coronary artery, measuring 32 × 21 mm with tight post-aneurysmal stenosis in the intermediate artery. The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting following the resection of CAA and reconstruction with saphenous vein roof-plasty, which ensured the preservation of the native coronary vasculature. At the 6-month follow-up, she remained asymptomatic and preserved preoperative left ventricular function.
