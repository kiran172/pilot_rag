Title: Variability in Cross-Sectional Muscle Atrophy: Insights From the Central Rectus Femoris.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the non-uniformity of cross-sectional areas in atrophic muscles using the central aponeurosis (CA) as a marker for the central region of the rectus femoris (RF).
METHODS: We enrolled 51 consecutively admitted patients (102 limbs) with aortic valve stenosis who were scheduled for elective surgical or catheter-based aortic valve replacement and were expected to have low physical activity-induced muscle atrophy. We obtained short-axis images of the mid-thigh using an ultrasonic diagnostic imaging system (with a 5-cm-wide probe) and measured the deviation of the central region of the rectus femoris from the body surface. Muscle thickness was measured using conventional morphological measurements on the body surface ("On Surface") and landmarks within the ultrasonographic image ("In Images").
RESULTS: Displacements ≥ 1.5 cm were observed in 56 (54.9%) limbs, and displacements ≥ 2.5 cm were observed in 34 (33%) limbs. The displacements were predominantly in the medial direction and ranged from 4 cm to 1.5 cm. Among the cases in which the deviation was ≥2.5 cm, "On Surface" measurements resulted in images in which the vastus lateralis overlapped with the rectus femoris. The thickness of the rectus femoris was significantly lower with "On Surface" measurements than with "In Images" measurements (right, p < 0.001; left, p = 0.007), with a maximum difference of 10.5 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it was observed that the rectus femoris at the center was often displaced medially, and the muscle thickness was thinner at the edge than at the center, showing a non-uniform morphology.
