Title: [Application of Rotarex catheter system in femoropopliteal artery stenosis accompanied with thrombosis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Rotarex catheter system in treating femoropopliteal artery stenosis accompanied with thrombosis.
METHODS: From Jun. 2017 to Dec. 2019, the clinical data of 32 femoropopliteal artery stenosis accompanied with thrombosis cases treated with Rotarex catheter system were retrospectively analyzed. There were 23 males and 9 females aged from 50 to 89 years and the mean age was (70.7±10.3) years. Six cases had acute course of disease (≤2 weeks), 17 cases had subacute course of disease (>2 weeks, ≤3 months), and 9 cases had chronic course of disease (>3 months). Mean lesion length was (23.4±13.7) cm, mean occlusion length was (19.9±13.3) cm, and in-stent occlusion 7 cases. The superficial femoral artery (SFA) was involved in 13 cases, the popliteal artery (PA) was involved in 8 cases, and both SFA and PA were involved in the other 11 cases. All the cases were treated with Rotarex catheter system. When necessary, suction with large lumen catheter was enabled. Residual stenosis was treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Drug-coated balloon (DCB) was only used in patients with financial status, and stent was used only when it was necessary. Heparin was used for 24 h after procedures, and after that, antiplatelet agents were used. Doppler ultrasonography was taken during the followed-up.
RESULTS: Technical success was 100%, and mean procedure time was (107.4±21.5) min. 8F (1F≈0.33 mm) and 6F Rotarex catheter were used in 27 and 5 cases respectively. In 27 cases, forward flow was obtained immediately after debulking with Rotarex catheter, and in the other 5 cases, suction with large lumen catheters were used. PTA was used in all 32 cases. DCB were used in 8 cases, of which 4 were used in in-stent stenosis. Twelve cases were implanted stents. There were no perioperative deaths. The only one procedure related complication was distal embolism. We took out the thrombus with guiding catheter. In all cases, mean hospital stay were (4.6±1.5) d. The ankle brachial index increased from 0.32±0.15 to 0.86±0.10 after treatment (t=-16.847, P &lt; 0.001). The Rutherford stages decreased significantly (Z=-4.518, P &lt; 0.001). All the patients were followed up for 6.0-36.0 months, and the median time was 16.0 months. 2 cases stopped antiplatelet agents, which resulted in acute thrombosis. Another percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and PTA were taken in one of them. Two cases died of cardiovascular disease during the follow-up, and no amputation was observed. Target lesion restenosis occurred in 7 cases during the follow-up, and target lesion revascularization (TLR) was taken in two of them.
CONCLUSION: In treating femoropopliteal artery stenosis accompanied with thrombosis, Rotarex catheter can remove thrombus effectively, and that can expose underlying lesions and reduce stent use and complications rates. It is a safe and effective method.
