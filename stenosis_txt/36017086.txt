Title: Coronary computed tomography angiography as a screening tool for moderate-high risk asymptomatic type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are few data on the clinical significance of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in asymptomatic type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate coronary heart disease (CHD) screening in asymptomatic patients with T2DM using CCTA and CHD risk stratification prediction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 141 T2DM patients (58 Â± 8 years, 57% males) without known symptoms suggestive of CHD who underwent CCTA were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were classified into three subgroups based on United Kingdom prospective diabetes study (UKPDS) CHD risk stratification prediction. Seventy-four patients without diabetes mellitus and CHD who underwent CCTA successively were chosen as the control group. The segment involvement score (SIS), segment stenosis score (SSS), stenosis coefficient (SC), severe proximal plaque (SPP) positive ratio and CCTA-adapted Leaman score (CT-LeSc) based on CCTA data were evaluated and compared among the groups.
RESULTS: Compared with the patients in the control group, patients in the moderate-high risk DM groups had higher scores on the SIS, SSS, SC, CT-LeSc, and a higher SPP positive ratio (all p-values &lt; 0.001), and no difference was observed between the low-risk group and the control group (p = 0.136, p = 0.088, p = 0.0.067, p = 0.225, p = 1.000, respectively). Compared with patients in the control group, the patients in the moderate-high risk DM groups had increased odds of SIS &gt; 3 [odds ratio (OR) = 6.557, p &lt; 0.001; OR = 4.455, p &lt; 0.001, respectively], SSS &gt; 5 (OR = 5.727, p &lt; 0.001; OR = 5.144, p &lt; 0.001, respectively), CT-LeSc &gt; 8.7 (OR = 3.780, p = 0.001; OR = 2.804, p = 0.007, respectively), and obstructive stenosis (OR = 7.233, p &lt; 0.001; OR = 5.787, p &lt; 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The moderate-high CHD risk patients had increased odds of obstructive coronary artery stenosis, and the distribution of coronary artery stenosis was more extensive and more severe in that group compared to the patients without diabetes mellitus and CHD. CHD can be effectively screened in moderate-high risk asymptomatic T2DM patients using CCTA.
