Title: Serum and Vascular Stiffness Biomarkers Associated with the Severity of Degenerative Aortic Valve Stenosis and Cardiovascular Outcomes.

Abstract: Background: Although degenerative aortic valve stenosis (DAS) is the most prevalent growth-up congestive heart valve disease, still little known about relationships between DAS severity, vascular stiffness (VS), echocardiographic parameters, and serum biomarkers in patients undergoing transcatheter (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The objective of this study was to identify biomarkers associated with DAS severity, and those that are associated with cardiovascular death (CVD) and episodes of chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. Methods: A total of 137 patients with initially moderate-to-severe DAS were prospectively evaluated for the relationship between DAS severity, baseline VS, and serum biomarkers (uPAR, GDF-15, Gal-3, IL-6Rα, ET-1, PCSK9, RANTES/CCL5, NT-proBNP, and hs-TnT), and were followed-up for 48 months. The prognostic significance of each variable for CVD and CHF risk was measured by hazard ratio of risk (HR), which was calculated by Cox’s proportional hazard model. Results: DAS severity showed correlations with IL-6Rα (r = 0.306, p < 0.001), uPAR (r = 0.184, p = 0.032), and NT-proBNP (r = −0.389, p < 0.001). Levels of ET-1 and Gal-3 were strongly correlated with VS parameters (r = 0.674, p < 0.001; r = 0.724, p < 0.001). Out of 137 patients, 20 were referred to TAVR, 88 to SAVR, and 29 to OMT. In TAVR patients, the highest levels of ET-1, Gal-3, and VS were found as compared to other patients. The highest incidence of CVD was observed in patients who underwent TAVR (35%), compared to SAVR (8%) and OMT (10.3%) (p = 0.004). In a multivariate analysis, ET-1 occurred predictive of CVD risk (HR 25.1, p = 0.047), while Gal-3 > 11.5 ng/mL increased the risk of CHF exacerbation episodes requiring hospital admission by 12%. Conclusions: Our study indicated that ET-1 and Gal-3 levels may be associated with the outcomes in patients with DAS.
