Title: Strain Assessment in Aortic Stenosis: Pathophysiology and Clinical Utility.

Abstract: Contemporary echocardiographic criteria for grading aortic stenosis severity have remained relatively unchanged, despite significant advances in noninvasive imaging techniques over the last 2 decades. More recently, attention has shifted to the ventricular response to aortic stenosis and how this might be quantified. Global longitudinal strain, semiautomatically calculated from standard two-dimensional echocardiographic images, has been the focus of extensive research. Global longitudinal strain is a sensitive marker of subtle hypertrophy-related impairment in left ventricular function and has shown promise as a relatively robust prognostic marker, both independently and when added to severity classification systems. Herein we review the pathophysiological basis underpinning the potential utility of global longitudinal strain in the assessment of aortic stenosis, as well as its potential role in quantifying myocardial recovery and prognostic discrimination following aortic valve replacement.
