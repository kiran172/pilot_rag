Title: The 10-year horizon: Survival and structural valve degeneration in first-generation transcatheter aortic valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an established treatment for high- or intermediate-risk patients with symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. As more low-risk patients are being treated, transcatheter heart valve durability is gaining importance. Data on structural valve deterioration beyond 8 years after transcatheter aortic valve replacement is limited.
AIM: To evaluate the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients with a follow-up of ≥10 years, focusing on survival and structural valve deterioration, according to the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions/European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery definitions.
METHODS: Only patients with a follow-up of ≥ 10 years were included in this study (n=510). Using serial echocardiographic data, the cumulative incidences of structural valve deterioration and bioprosthetic valve failure were analysed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used for predictor assessment.
RESULTS: Mean age was 79.6±6.7 years, with a mean logistic EuroSCORE of 19.8±12.7%. Immediate procedural mortality was 2.9%, and 30-day mortality was 7.8%. Kaplan-Meier-estimated survival at 10 years was 10.3±1.5%. At 10 years, the cumulative incidences of severe and moderate structural valve deterioration were 4.3% and 13%, respectively, for the total population. The cumulative incidence of bioprosthetic valve failure at 10 years was 9.0%. There was a significant difference in the rates of structural valve deterioration and bioprosthetic valve failure depending on valve type: structural valve deterioration, SAPIEN 8.9% vs CoreValve 2.2% at 10 years (P=0.001); bioprosthetic valve failure, SAPIEN 13.9% vs CoreValve 6.7% at 10 years (P=0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Structural valve deterioration and bioprosthetic valve failure of early transcatheter heart valves was low at 10 years. The identified differences between valve types must be validated using current-generation devices in younger patients.
