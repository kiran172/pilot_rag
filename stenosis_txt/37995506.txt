Title: Comparison of Drug-Coated Balloon and Drug-Eluting Stent for the Treatment of Small Vessel Disease (from the Dissolve SVD Randomized Trial).

Abstract: The Dissolve drug-coated balloons (DCBs) is a new-generation DCB coated with paclitaxel of balloon surface, with midchain triglyceride excipient. Although the use of DCBs is a promising technique, little is known about the the clinical efficacy of the novel Dissolve DCB in coronary small vessel disease. This study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, noninferiority trial comparing the Dissolve DCB with the Resolute drug-eluting stent (DES) in patients with a reference vessel diameter ≥2.25 and ≤2.75 mm. Patients with a reference vessel diameter ≥2.00 and <2.25 mm were enrolled in the very small vessel registry. The angiographic and clinical follow-up were planned at 9 months and 1 year in all patients, respectively. The primary end point was 9-month in-segment percentage diameter stenosis. A total of 247 patients with small vessel disease from 10 Chinese sites were included (Dissolve DCB, n = 118; Resolute DES, n = 129); 30 patients were treated with the DCB in the very small vessel cohort. The 9-month in-segment percentage diameter stenosis was 31.2 ± 2.0% with Dissolve DCB versus 26.1 ± 2.1% with Resolute DES; the 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit of the difference was 10.3% (p for noninferiority = 0.0002). At 12 months, the DCB and DES groups were associated with similar rates of target lesion failure (8.5% vs 6.1%, p = 0.28) and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (20.9% vs 13.6%, p = 0.12). In conclusion, the Dissolve DCB was noninferior to the Resolute DES for the primary end point of 9-month in-segment percentage diameter stenosis in this multicenter, head-to-head, randomized trial (a safety and efficacy study of Dissolve In Treatment Of Coronary Small Vessel Disease; NCT03376646).
