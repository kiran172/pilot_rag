Title: The Relationship Between Endocan and Serum Inflammatory Markers in Patients with Senile Calcific Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endocan is an indicator of many pathologies accompanied by inflammation, endothelial cell activation, and dysfunction. In this study, we examined the relationship between degenerative aortic sclerosis, which progresses in a similar pathophysiologic mechanism as atherosclerosis, and serum inflammatory markers and endocan levels.
METHODS: A total of 155 patients without known coronary artery disease, aged between 65 and 80 years, were consecutively included in the prospective cross-sectional study. The study population was analyzed in 4 different groups. The control group consisted of patients with normal aortic valve structure, while patients with aortic stenosis were classified as mild aortic stenosis (2-2.9 m/s), moderate aortic stenosis (3-3.9 m/s), and severe aortic stenosis (≥ 4 m/s) according to their aortic velocity. While there were 39 patients in the control group, there were 58, 24, and 34 patients in the mild, moderate, and severe aortic stenosis groups, respectively.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of patient distribution and characteristics. History of dyspnea and angina was correlated with the severity of aortic stenosis (P <.001). In this study, no statistically significant correlation was found between serum endocan levels and the severity of aortic stenosis (control group: 17.3 ± 6.3 ng/mL, mild aortic stenosis: 17.6 ± 8.7 ng/mL, moderate aortic stenosis: 16.3 ± 3.8 ng/mL, severe aortic stenosis: 15.2 ± 5.9 ng/mL, P =.396). However, it was figured out that there was a positive correlation between endocan levels and hemoglobin (Hg) (r = 0.308, P =.001), platelet (PLT) (r = 0.320, P <.001), and albumin (Alb) (r = 0.206, P =.026).
CONCLUSION: In this study, no significant correlation was found between serum endocan levels and the severity of aortic stenosis. On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between endocan levels and Hg, PLT, and Alb.
