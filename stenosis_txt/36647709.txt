Title: Intra-abdominal haemorrhaging after cardiac catheterisation: the importance of recognising vascular anomalies in heterotaxy syndrome.

Abstract: A 2-month-old boy with a single ventricle underwent cardiac catheterisation. Inferior vena cava angiography at the end of the examination revealed local stenosis, flexion, and connection to the right hepatic vein. Six hours after catheterisation, he went into haemorrhagic shock. CT revealed contrast extravasation into the liver with ascites. A precise diagnosis of vascular anomalies is mandatory, especially in patients with heterotaxy syndrome.
