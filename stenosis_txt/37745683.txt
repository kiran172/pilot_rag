Title: Asymptomatic Severe and Moderate Aortic Stenosis: Time for Appraisal of Treatment Indications.

Abstract: Over the last decades, we have witnessed considerable improvements in diagnostics and risk stratification of patients with significant aortic stenosis (AS), paralleled by advances in operative and anesthetic techniques. In addition, accumulating evidence points to the potential benefit of early valve replacement in such patients prior to the onset of symptoms. In parallel, interventional randomized trials have proven the benefit of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in comparison to a surgical approach to valve replacement over a broad risk spectrum in symptomatic patients with AS. This article reviews contemporary management approaches and scrutinizes open questions regarding timing and mode of intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe AS. We also discuss the challenges surrounding the management of symptomatic patients with moderate AS as well as emerging dilemmas related to the concept of a life-long treatment strategy for patients with AS.
