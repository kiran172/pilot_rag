Title: Coronary Stenosis and Cardiogenic Shock Secondary to Aortitis Following Aortic Root Support Procedure.

Abstract: A woman with recent personalized external aortic root support implant presented in cardiogenic shock with bilateral coronary ostial occlusion and aortic inflammation requiring emergency coronary angioplasty. Subsequent computed tomography with positron emission tomography scanning demonstrated aortitis with extensive inflammation adjacent to the personalized external aortic root support mesh, the first report of this important complication.
