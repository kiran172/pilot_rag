Title: Improvement in the estimation of perfusable tissue fraction and myocardial flow reserve in the ischemic myocardial lesions using ECG-gated dynamic myocardial PET with 15O-water.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Perfusable tissue fraction (PTF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) from 15O-water dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) are parameters of myocardial viability. However, myocardial motion causes errors in these values. We aimed to develop accurate estimation of PTF and MFR in ischemic lesions using an electro-cardiogram (ECG)-gated dynamic myocardial PET with 15O-water.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with ischemic heart disease were enrolled. All patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). List mode 3D PET data and ECG signals were acquired using Philips Gemini TF64 instrument. For each scan, 500 MBq of 15O-water was infused slowly for 2 min, and the dynamic data were scanned for 6 min. Both non-gated dynamic images and ECG-gated diastolic dynamic images were reconstructed. On the myocardial PET images of each patient, the entire myocardial region of interest (ROI) was set and divided into 17 segments. Myocardial blood flow in the resting state (rest MBF), hyperemic state (stress MBF), PTF, and MFR in each segment were estimated from both non-gated and ECG-gated dynamic PET images. Coronary arteriograms were obtained for all patients. In total, 128 normal segments without stenosis and 50 ischemic segments with &gt; 90% stenosis were evaluated.
RESULTS: In the ischemic myocardial segments, the PTF with ECG-gated PET was estimated as significantly lower than that with non-gated PET (0.63 ± 0.09 vs. 0.72 ± 0.08 [mL/mL], p < 0.001). The ECG-gated PET estimated a significantly lower PTF in the ischemic segments than in the normal segments (0.63 ± 0.09 vs. 0.67 ± 0.07 [mL/mL], p < 0.01). In the normal segments, the ECG-gated PET detected no significant difference in MFR compared with those from the non-gated PET (2.15 ± 0.76 vs. 2.24 ± 0.79, p = 0.28). However, in the ischemic myocardial segments, the MFR with ECG-gated PET was estimated as significantly lower than that with the non-gated PET (1.23 ± 0.29 vs. 1.69 ± 0.71, p < 0.001). The ECG-gated PET presented a significantly higher inter-observer reproducibility of PTF and rest MBF than the non-gated PET (p < 0.01). Neither stress MBF nor MFR yielded significant differences in inter-observer reproducibility between the ECG-gated and non-gated PET.
CONCLUSIONS: The ECG-gated dynamic 15O-water PET suppressed the myocardial motion effect and resulted in a lower PTF and MFR in ischemic myocardial lesions than the non-gated PET. The ECG-gated PET seemed to be better than the conventional non-gated dynamic PET for the detection of ischemic myocardial lesion.
