Title: Trends in diagnosis, referral, red flag onset, patient profiles and natural outcome of de novo cardiac amyloidosis and their multidisciplinary implications.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is often overlooked or misdiagnosed. Effects of growing disease awareness, diagnostic ameliorations and novel treatment options on CA diagnosis and management are scarcely reported.
OBJECTIVE: To report trends in diagnosis, referral routes, clinical presentation, early onset diagnostic red flags and outcome in de novo CA subjects.
METHODS: An unselected cohort of 139 de novo CA patients over an 8-year period in a tertiary referral hospital was recruited.
RESULTS: Transthyretin (ATTR, 82%, n = 114) was the most common CA form; Light-chain (AL, 15%, n = 21) and secondary (AA, 3%, n = 4) are less prevalent. Increased awareness over time led to a marked ATTR diagnostic surge, steep non-invasive diagnostic approach increment and increased nuclear medicine and external cardiologist referrals (all p &lt; 0.001). A total of 41% (n = 57/139) of patients were referred by non-cardiology specialist disciplines. Specific referral to rule out CA (24-36%) and diagnostic time lag from symptom onset (9 ± 12 to 8 ± 14 months), however, did not improve (all p &gt; 0.050). Multiple early red flag events preceded CA diagnose several years in ATTR: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, 60%, 4.9 ± 4.3 y), heart failure (54%, 2.5 ± 3.5 y), atrial fibrillation (47%, 5.9 ± 6.7 y), bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (43%, 9.5 ± 5.7 y) and spinal stenosis (40%, 7.4 ± 6.5 y). LVH ≥ 12 mm was absent in 11% ATTR (n = 13/114) and 5% AL (n = 1/21) patients. Hypertension was common in both ATTR (n = 70/114, 62%) and AL (n = 10/21, 48%). 56% (n = 78/139) of CA presented with heart failure. Cumulative 1 and 5-year mortality of 10%/66%, 40%/52% and 75%/75% for ATTR, AL, and AA, respectively, remains high.
CONCLUSIONS: Although CA diagnostic uptake and referral improve, specialist-specific disease and diagnostic red flag ignorance result in non-timely diagnosis and unfavourable outcome.
