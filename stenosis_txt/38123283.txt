Title: Endovascular Treatment of Venous Outflow and Portal Venous Complications After Liver Transplantation.

Abstract: Liver transplantation continues to rapidly evolve, and in 2020, 8906 orthotopic liver transplants were performed in the United States. As a technically complex surgery with multiple vascular anastomoses, stenosis and thrombosis of the venous anastomoses are among the recognized vascular complications. While rare, venous complications may be challenging to manage and can threaten the graft and the patient. In the last 20 years, endovascular approaches have been increasingly utilized to treat post-transplant venous complications. Herein, the evaluation and interventional treatment of post-transplant venous outflow complications, portal vein stenosis, portal vein thrombosis, and recurrent portal hypertension with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) are reviewed.
