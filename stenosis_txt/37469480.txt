Title: Prognostic utility of 99mTc-MIBI single photon emission computerized tomography myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with ischemia and non-obstructive coronary artery disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic value of gated SPECT MPI in non-obstructed coronary arteries (INOCA) patients, sought to stratify patients more accurately and thus derive more reliable prognostic information.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 167 patients with INOCA were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups according to their SSS. Patients were followed-up regularly in terms of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), including cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, re-hospitalization with angina pectoris, and recurrent angina pectoris. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox's proportional hazards models were used to analyze survival and identify predictive factors.
RESULTS: Adverse cardiac events occurred in 33 cases (19.8%). The rate of MACE was higher in the summed stress score (SSS) ≥4 group than in the SSS 0-3 group (30.1% vs. 9.5%, respectively, P = 0.001) and MACE-free survival was lower (annual MACE-free rates of 87.5% vs. 96.2%, respectively, P = 0.003). Event-free survival was consistently higher in patients with normal arteries than in those with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (annual MACE-free rates of 96.1% and 88.4%, P = 0.035). When the SSS and the CAG results were combined, patients with normal coronary arteries (SSS 0-3) had the best prognosis and those with non-obstructive coronary artery stenosis (SSS ≥ 4) had the worst. However, the early prognosis of patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease and SSS of 0-3 was comparable to that of patients with normal coronary arteries and SSS ≥ 4 (annual MACE-free rates of 100%, 94.6%, 93.1%, and 78.2%, respectively). Multivariate Cox's regression indicated that the SSS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.126, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.042-1.217, P = 0.003] and non-obstructive coronary artery disease (HR = 2.559, 95% CI 1.249-5.246, P = 0.01) were predictors of adverse cardiac events.
CONCLUSION: SPECT MPI data were prognostic for INOCA patients, thus identifying groups at high risk. The long-term predictive efficacy of such data exceeded that of CAG data. A combination of the two measures more accurately stratified INOCA patients in terms of risk.
