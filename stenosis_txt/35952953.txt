Title: Improvement following restoration of inline flow argues against comprehensive thrombus removal strategies and for selective stenting in acute symptomatic iliofemoral venous thrombosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Randomized trials have demonstrated the benefit of thrombus removal strategies in iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IFDVT) in providing early symptom relief and decreasing the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), especially severe PTS. However, the impact of quantum of residual thrombus burden (RTB) on PTS as determined by intravascular ultrasound examination and the role of venous stenting in the acute setting have not been evaluated and represent the focus of this study.
METHODS: Sixty-nine limbs (65 patients) undergoing thrombus removal for acute symptomatic IFDVT between 2015 and 2021 formed the study cohort. The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) (range, 0-27) grade of swelling (GOS) (range, 0-4), and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores (range, 0-10) were evaluated initially and at 6, 12, and 24 months after thrombus removal. Quality of life was appraised using the CIVIQ-20 instrument. The extent of initial and RTB after the intervention was estimated using intravascular ultrasound examination. Grading was done as less than 50% (1), 50% to 99% (2), or 100% (3) of luminal thrombus fill within each segment (common femoral vein, external iliac vein, and common iliac vein) by a blinded rater and then combined to generate a total score. The use of stenting, both concurrent (severe residual stenosis/persistent occlusion) and delayed (quality of life impairing residual or recurrent symptoms), was evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 69 limbs, 53 underwent pharmacomechanical/mechanical thrombectomy (PMT), whereas 16 patients underwent PMT and catheter-directed thrombolysis with restoration of inline flow in all limbs. Post-intervention VCSS improved from 6 to 2 at 24 months (P < .0001). GOS improved from 4 to 0 at 24 months (P < .0001). The VAS pain score went from 5 to 0 at 6 months (P < .0001) and remained at 0 at 12 months (P < .0001), but increased to 3 at 24 months (P = .02). The CIVIQ-20 score improved from 38 to 22 (P = .001) over a median follow-up of 19 months. The median RTB total score improved from 9 to 4 (P < .0001). There was no impact of RTB total score (<3 vs >3) on VCSS (P = NS), GOS (P = NS), VAS pain score (P = NS) or CIVIQ-20 score (P = NS) at the various time points. Concurrent stenting was used in 23 limbs (33%) and delayed stenting was carried out in 10 limbs (14%). The median time to delayed stenting was 4 months after the initial thrombus removal intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing PMT or PMT with catheter-directed thrombolysis for acute symptomatic IFDVT, the restoration of inline flow seems to be adequate to provide symptom relief and decrease the incidence of PTS. The extent of RTB does not seem to impact the VCSS, GOS, VAS pain score, or quality of life after such restoration. Stenting can be pursued selectively in the acute setting to help restore inline flow.
