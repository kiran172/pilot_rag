Title: Role of CT in the Staging of Colorectal Tumors: A Preliminary Study on 10 Dogs.

Abstract: This study aimed to define the CT features of colorectal tumors in dogs and assess CT's role in tumor staging. It was a retrospective, multicenter, descriptive study involving dogs with a cyto-histopathological diagnosis of colorectal tumors and high-quality pre- and post-contrast CT scans of the abdomen. CT successfully identified colorectal lesions in all cases, showing variations such as wall thickening, presence of masses, and luminal stenosis. It also detected lymph node involvement. Overall, this study helps us to understand the CT features of both epithelial and mesenchymal colorectal tumors, emphasizing CT's importance in staging and surgical planning for affected dogs. Larger studies are needed to identify specific CT findings for different colorectal neoplasms.
