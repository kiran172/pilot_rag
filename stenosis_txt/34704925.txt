Title: [Tracheal stenosis as a complication to dilatational tracheotomy].

Abstract: This is a case report of a 54-year-old male, who developed a considerable tracheal stenosis after dilatational tracheotomy. Other causes than sequelae after tracheotomy were investigated and excluded. There are two types of tracheotomy: surgical and dilatational tracheotomy. Surgical tracheotomy is the preferred method in complicated cases, while dilational tracheotomy is easier accessible and has become increasingly prevalent. The objective of this case report is to highlight possible complications as well as advantages.
