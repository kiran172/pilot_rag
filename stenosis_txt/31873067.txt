Title: Cheyne-Stokes respiration and cardiovascular oscillations ending abruptly when deploying transfemoral aortic valve.

Abstract: A 86-yr-old man was referred for transfemoral aortic valve implantation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a severe stenosis (mean gradient: 58 mmHg, aortic valve area: 0.4 cm2), and after multidisciplinary discussion, the risk of surgery was judged too high (logistic Euroscore: 51%), and the patient was proposed for a transfemoral aortic valve implantation (TAVI). On arrival in the operating room, the patient, fully conscious, was noted to have Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSB), which persisted after 40% oxygen administration. TAVI procedure was successful, and the CSB pattern was interrupted within 8 s. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to show an acute disappearance of CSB, occurring only seconds after TAVI and restoration of a normal hemodynamic situation. To explain such rapid changes in breathing pattern, we hypothesize a role played by the acute release of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary volume overload.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Acute disappearance of Cheyne-Stokes breathing after transfemoral aortic valve implantation suggests a reflex pathway originating from the fall in pulmonary vessels congestion.
