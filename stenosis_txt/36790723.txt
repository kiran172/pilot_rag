Title: Surgical treatment of laryngeal amyloidosis: a systematic review.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to study the surgical management of laryngeal amyloidosis and estimate the rate of recurrence after surgery.
METHODS: A systematic review searching PubMed and EMBASE was performed. A qualitative synthesis of data regarding the surgical management of LA and a quantitative analysis of the recurrence rate after surgery was conducted.
RESULTS: This systematic review included 14 retrospective studies, one of whom is retrospective controlled. A total of 515 subjects were included, the mean age ranged from 43.3 to 58 years with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.3. All cases had a localized laryngeal amyloidosis. The supraglottic region was the most affected laryngeal site and multiple sites were commonly involved. Surgical treatment consists of endoscopic excision using laser, cold or powered instruments. Open surgery is required for severe primary case or revision surgery. Surgical complications such as granulomatosis scar tissue formation, tracheostomy, laryngotracheal stenosis, pneumothorax and concomitant malignancy were developed in 17.5% of patients. The time onset to diagnosis varied from 1 months to 15 years and the duration of follow-up from 3 months to 25 years. The rate of recurrence was 28.4% (95% CI 24.5-32.6) and the timing of recurrences ranged from 3 months to 10 years.
CONCLUSION: The recurrence rate after primary surgery for laryngeal amyloidosis is high. A tailored surgical treatment based on the disease extension and a long-term follow up are recommended.
