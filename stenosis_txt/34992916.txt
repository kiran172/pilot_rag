Title: Posterior resection of sacral osteosarcoma utilizing cement-infused chest tube interbody reconstruction and lumbopelvic fusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary osteosarcoma (OS) of the spine is very rare. En bloc resection of spinal OS is challenging due to anatomical constraints. Surgical planning must balance the benefits of en bloc resection with its potential risks of causing a significant neurological deficit. In this case, we successfully performed a posterior-only approach for decompression with S1 reconstruction via a cement-infused chest tube interbody device, along with a navigated L4 to pelvis fusion.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 49-year-old female presented with a primary sacral OS. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed an S1 lytic vertebral body lesion with severe stenosis and progressive L5 on S1 anterior subluxation. Surgical decompression with tumor resection and S1 corpectomy with S1 reconstruction via a cement-infused 32-French chest tube interbody device accompanied by L4 -pelvis fusion utilizing S2-alar-iliac screws was completed. 6 months postoperatively, the patient continues to have significant pain relief and the instrumentation remains intact.
CONCLUSION: A 49-year-old female with an S1 OS successfully underwent a posterior-only approach that included an S1 corpectomy with anterior column reconstruction via a cement-infused chest tube interbody plus a navigated L4 to pelvis fusion.
