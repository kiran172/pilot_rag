Title: Visceral adiposity index and cervical arterial atherosclerosis in northeast China: a population based cross-sectional survey.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The burden of cervical arterial atherosclerosis, which is an important risk factor of stroke, is huge in China. The visceral adiposity index (VAI) is a convenient index that is related to a series of metabolic abnormalities and a variety of diseases, including cerebrovascular diseases. This study aimed to explore the relationship between VAI and cervical arterial atherosclerosis.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the multistage stratified random cluster sampling method to acquire a representative sample of residents aged ≥40 in the general population of northeast China. All participants completed a detailed questionnaire and provided blood samples. Cervical vascular ultrasound was performed by experienced ultrasound doctors. VAI was calculated by a well-established formula and analyzed by quartiles (Q1-Q4).
RESULTS: A total of 3688 people aged ≥40 years who underwent cervical arterial ultrasound were finally included, amongst whom 3.2% had increased intima-media thickness (IMT), 48.6% had carotid plaque and 4.0% had cervical artery stenosis (CAS). After adjusting for several parameters, little statistical significance was found between VAI and increased IMT; compared with the VAI-Q1 group, the VAI-Q2, VAI-Q3 and VAI-Q4 groups were more likely to have CAS [odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.43; OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.05-3.15; OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.03-3.12] and the VAI-Q3 and VAI-Q4 groups were at greater risk of carotid plaque (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.62; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07-1.67).
CONCLUSIONS: The VAI was related to carotid plaque and CAS in the general population that is older than 40 years.
