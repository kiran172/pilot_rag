Title: Dual-layered stents reduce cerebral embolism compared with first-generation stents during carotid stenting of high lipid core plaque lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Periprocedural lipid core plaque (LCP) has been detected in carotid arteries assessed by catheter-based near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). High LCP is associated with cerebral embolism after carotid artery stenting (CAS) using a first-generation stent. We aimed to evaluate whether dual-layered stents reduce embolic infarcts in patients with high LCP and change of lipid signal as assessed by NIRS during CAS.
METHODS: Participants comprised 210 consecutive patients undergoing CAS. The study was divided into two distinct periods, with first-generation closed-cell stents used in the earlier period and dual-layered stents used in the later period. NIRS was performed at baseline, after stent implantation, and after balloon post-dilatation to analyze maximal lipid core burden index at minimal luminal area (max-LCBI<sub>MLA</sub>).
RESULTS: The ipsilateral cerebral embolism rate was significantly lower with dual-layered stents (9%) than with first-generation stents (33%, p&lt;0.001), particularly with highly lipidic lesions (12% vs 60%, p&lt;0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, high LCP and first-generation stent usage were factors related to ipsilateral cerebral embolism (both p&lt;0.001; OR 8.28 (95% CI 3.49 to 19.64) and OR 8.07 (95% CI 2.33 to 27.93), respectively). Max-LCBI<sub>MLA</sub> decreased significantly after stenting in both groups (both p&lt;0.01) and max-LCBI<sub>MLA</sub> after balloon post-dilatation was significantly lower with dual-layered stents (22.4±65.6) than with first-generation stents (124.2±208.2; p=0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Dual-layered stents reduce embolic infarcts in patients with highly lipidic plaque lesions as assessed by NIRS who undergo CAS. Dual-layered stents significantly reduced NIRS-derived lipid signals after stenting.
