Title: Efficacy and safety of flexible endoscopic intervention via laryngeal mask airway for endobronchial hamartoma removal.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics, efficacy and safety of flexible endoscopic intervention for endobronchial hamartoma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with endobronchial hamartoma who underwent flexible endoscopic intervention at a single center were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical characteristics and efficacy of flexible endoscopic intervention were described.
RESULTS: Nine patients were cured after one single flexible endoscopic intervention, three patients underwent second flexible endoscopic interventions due to late tumor recurrence, while one patient who eventually became stable with a 40% stenosis of the airway lumen, received a third intervention because of two relapses. Pneumothorax occurred in one patient who was cured after oxygen therapy. There were no serious complications such as massive hemorrhage, airway perforation, airway ignition and suffocation associated with the therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Flexible endoscopic intervention appeared to be safe and effective for the treatment of patients with endobronchial hamartoma.
