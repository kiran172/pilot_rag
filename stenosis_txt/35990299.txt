Title: Multidetector Computer Tomography Angiography Protocol in the Context of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a procedure in the context of non-suitable for open surgery. Measurements of aortic root width, aortic valve surface area, and measurements of the aortic tree, coronary vessels, femoral, and subclavian arteries are of critical importance. In the TAVI procedure, the dimensions of the valve to be placed on the patient are determined by the computed tomography method. Appropriate protocols should be selected for coronary scoring and inclusion of coronary arteries in TAVI imaging and after the shooting, images of coronary arteries such as curved MPR and VRT should be processed, and these images should be prepared to guide the physician who will perform the procedure. The device to be used in imaging must be a tomography device with at least 64 MCDT sections. There are two methods for these shots using ECG triggering. These methods are as follows: Retrospective scan and prospective scan. Bolus tracking method for TAVI imaging is one of the most accurate contrast giving methods that can be used. Automatic dose calibration is used. With the success of the method day by day, the importance of "Computerized Tomography TAVI," which guides physicians during the method, has increase.
