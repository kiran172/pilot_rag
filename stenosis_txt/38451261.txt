Title: Ultra-long-term efficacy and safety of catheter-based renal denervation in resistant hypertension: 10-year follow-up outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Randomized sham-controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of catheter-based renal denervation in hypertension. Data on the very long-term effects of renal denervation are scarce.
AIMS: This study evaluates the 10-year safety and efficacy of renal denervation in resistant hypertension.
METHODS: This prospective single-center study included patients with resistant hypertension undergoing radio-frequency renal denervation between 2010 and 2012. Office blood pressure, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, color duplex sonography, and renal function were assessed after 1-, 2- and 10-years.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients completed the 10-year follow-up (mean follow-up duration 9.4 ± 0.7 years). Baseline office and 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure were 164 ± 23 mmHg and 153 ± 16 mmHg, respectively. After 10 years, 24-h ambulatory and office systolic blood pressure were reduced by 16 ± 17 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001) and 14 ± 23 mmHg (P = 0.001), respectively. The number of antihypertensive drugs remained unchanged from 4.9 ± 1.4 to 4.5 ± 1.2 drugs (P = 0.087). The estimated glomerular filtration rate declined within the expected range from 69 (95% CI 63 to 74) to 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (95% CI 53 to 68; P &lt; 0.001) through 10-year follow-up. Three renal artery interventions were documented for progression of pre-existing renal artery stenosis in two patients and one patient with new-onset renal artery stenosis. No other adverse events were observed during the follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Renal denervation was safe and sustainedly reduced ambulatory and office blood pressure out to 10 years in patients with resistant hypertension.
