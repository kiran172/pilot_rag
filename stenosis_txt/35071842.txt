Title: Endovascular recanalization for symptomatic intracranial internal carotid and middle cerebral artery occlusion lasting longer than 72 h: Experience in a single center.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and outcomes of endovascular recanalization for symptomatic intracranial internal carotid and middle cerebral artery occlusion lasting longer than 72 h.
METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with symptomatic occlusion of the anterior circulation and failure of medical therapy underwent endovascular recanalization and were included in this retrospective study. Patient characteristics, atherosclerotic risk factors, successful recanalization rates, and angiographic data were collected.
RESULTS: Recanalization was successful in 37 cases (94.9%). The average residual stenosis immediately after intervention was 11.6 ± 4.3%. The patients who underwent balloon angioplasty alone had similar residual stenosis to those who also underwent stent placement (15.6 ± 7.3% vs. 9.0 ± 6.4%, P = 0.184). Intra- and perioperative complications occurred in three cases (7.69%). One patient (2.7%) developed severe in-stent restenosis with transient ischemic attack symptoms at 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular recanalization is feasible for symptomatic occlusion of the anterior circulation lasting longer than 72 h. Recanalization provides a higher success rate when performed within 6 months of the qualifying event.
