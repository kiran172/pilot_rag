Title: Natural orifice specimen extraction with a modified reverse puncture device technique for total laparoscopic colorectal resection: feasibility and efficacy.

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the modified reverse puncture device (mRPD) technique for transanal anastomosis in total laparoscopic colorectal resection with natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES).Methods: From August 2015 to September 2017, 34 patients underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection using the mRPD technique to place the anvil in the abdominal cavity and complete transanal anastomosis.Results: All patients who underwent total laparoscopic colorectal resection with NOSES were analyzed. The anvil placement time was 5-14 min, with an average of 6.7 min. The postoperative pain visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 1-4 points, with an average of 2.2 points. The postoperative hospital stay was 7-13 days, with an average of 8.7 days. No complications, such as anastomotic bleeding or stenosis, occurred. During a 14- to 28-month follow-up period (average, 19.5 months), no cases of long-term complications were observed.Conclusion: Total laparoscopic colorectal resection using mRPD is a technically feasible and safe procedure with satisfactory short-term efficacy.
