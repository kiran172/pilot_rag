Title: The impact of the Naples Prognostic Score on the short- and long-term prognosis of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Preoperative systemic inflammation and nutritional status have been shown to affect prognosis in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In this study, we investigated the effect of the Naples Prognostic Score (NPS), which consists of four different parameters including these two components on short- and long-term prognosis in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: In 343 patients (mean age 78.1 ± 8.4 years, 51.3% female) who underwent TAVI, the NPS score was calculated from the blood tests obtained before the procedure and the study population was divided into three according to the NPS value: those with 0 and 1 were divided into Group-1, those with 2 into Group-2, and those with 3 and 4 into Group-3. The relationship between NPS group and in-hospital adverse events and long-term survival was evaluated.
RESULTS: Systolic pulmonary artery pressure, STS score, presence of chronic lung disease and being in NPS Group-3 [adjusted odds ratio (adjOR): 3.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.02-15.17), P  = 0.047] were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. According to the multivariate Cox-regression model, both Group-2 NPS [adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR): 4.81, 95% CI (1.09-21.14), P  = 0.037] and Group-3 NPS [adjHR: 10.1, 95% CI (2.31-43.36), P  = 0.002] was an independent predictor of 2-year all-cause mortality after TAVI. There was no significant difference in perioperative adverse events between the groups except for postprocedural acute kidney injury. According to receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the optimal predictive value of NPS for in-hospital and long-term mortality was 2.5.
CONCLUSION: In patients who will be candidates for TAVI, NPS is a simple and effective tool for determining both short- and long-term prognosis.
