Title: Usefulness of perioperative transoesophageal echocardiography during paediatric cardiac surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Paediatric transoesophageal echocardiography probes allow perioperative evaluation during paediatric congenital heart disease surgery.
AIM: To assess the usefulness of perioperative transoesophageal echocardiography in evaluating the severity of residual lesions, based on the type of congenital heart disease repaired in paediatric patients.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on paediatric patients who underwent open-heart surgery at our tertiary centre over a four-year period. Perioperative transoesophageal echocardiography studies were performed, and residual lesions were classified as mild, moderate or severe.
RESULTS: Overall, 323 procedures involving 310 patients with a median age of 13.8 (0.07-214.4) months and a median weight of 8.2 (2-96) kg at intervention were enrolled in the study. Twenty-one (6.5%) residual lesions led to immediate reintervention: severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n=12); severe aortic regurgitation (n=3); superior vena cava stenosis (n=2); moderate residual ventricular septal defect (n=2); severe mitral regurgitation (n=1); and severe mitral stenosis (n=1). Three (0.9%) neonates had ventilation difficulties caused by the transoesophageal echocardiography probe having to be removed, but experienced no sequelae.
CONCLUSION: Perioperative transoesophageal echocardiography is a safe procedure, providing information on severe residual lesions, leading to the immediate revision of several paediatric congenital heart disease cases.
