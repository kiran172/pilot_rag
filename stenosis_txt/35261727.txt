Title: Coronary artery aneurysm, ectasia and stenosis in a 53-year-old man with HIV infection.

Abstract: The impact of long-standing human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and potent anti-retroviral therapy on the coronary circulation is unknown; however, scattered reports are emerging of coronary aneurysms in this population. We report what we believe to be the first described case of both coronary stenosis and coronary artery aneurysms in a person living with HIV and discuss management options.
