Title: Periprocedural anemia management in severe aortic stenosis patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Preoperative anemia is a common finding in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and it has been shown to be associated with high mortality. The present review provides an overview of current management strategies of perioperative anemia in TAVI patients, including red blood cell transfusion, blood conservative protocol, iron supplementation, and erythropoietin administration. The goal is to recognize the treatable causes of anemia and treat them, in order to reduce transfusions and improve the outcome.
