Title: Management of Benign Salivary Gland Conditions.

Abstract: In this section, we discuss the management of benign salivary gland disease. Pathologies vary from sialolithiasis, salivary duct stenosis, sialadenitis, infectious glandular disease, autoimmune glandular disease, and radioactive iodine-induced disease. We discuss both novel techniques in the diagnosis and management of these diseases, including ultrasound, sialendoscopy, minor salivary gland biopsy, and botulinum toxin injection, which allow for both the alleviation of symptoms and gland preservation.
