Title: [Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling Characteristics of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Mouse Model Induced by Left Pneumonectomy and Jugular Vein Injection of Monocrotaline Pyrrole].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare and investigate the differences and characteristics of pulmonary vascular remodeling in three mouse models of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) constructed by left pneumonectomy, jugular vein injection of monocrotaline pyrrole, and left pneumonectomy combined with jugular vein injection of monocrotaline pyrrole, to explore for a PAH animal model that approximates the clinical pathogenesis of PAH, and to create a model that will provide sound basis for thorough investigation into the pathogenesis of severe PAH.
METHODS: 59 male C57/BL mice (10-12 weeks, 24-30 g) were randomized into four groups, a control group ( n=9), a group that had left pneumonectomy (PE, n=15), a group that had jugular vein injection of monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTP, n=15), and the last group that had left pneumonectomy combined with jugular injection of monocrotaline pyrrole (P+M, n=20). To evaluate the effect of modeling and the characteristics of pulmonary vascular remodeling, hemodynamic and morphological parameters, including right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricle/(left ventricle plus septum) (RV/LV+S), percent of wall thickness in the pulmonary artery (WT%), muscularization of non-muscular arteries, neointima formation, and vascular obstruction score (VOS), were measured in each group.
RESULTS: 1) Compared with those of the control group, the RVSP, RV/LV+S, WT%, and the degree of small pulmonary arteries muscularization in the P+M group were significantly increased ( P&lt;0.01). The MCTP group had just slightly higher findings for these indicators ( P&lt;0.05), while no significant change in these indicators was observed in the PE group ( P&gt;0.05). 2) Neointima formation in the acinus pulmonary arteries, which caused obvious stenosis of the lumen, was observed in the P+M group, the VOS being 1.25Â±0.80 points ( P&lt;0.001). In contrast, neointima formation was not observed in the MCTP group or the PE groups, the VOS being 0 point ( P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Left pneumonectomy combined with jugular intravenous injection of MCTP could induce severe PAH formation in mouse. The model provides a good simulation of neointima formation, the characteristic pathological change of clinical severe PAH.
