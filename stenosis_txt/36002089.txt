Title: Recurrent UPJ obstruction following paediatric pyeloplasty is associated with an initial <2.5cm incision open surgical approach.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk factors that affect surgical outcomes for pediatric pyeloplasty, and whether this may be related to the choice of operative approach.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate clinicodemographic and operative characteristics of children undergoing dismemberment pyeloplasty by 2 senior pediatric urologists in our tertiary institution between Jan 2008 - Dec 2017. Outcomes included overall complications, re-stenosis, and revision pyeloplasty based on clinic-radiological parameters. Bivariate analysis with Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test followed by multivariate logistic regression with backward likelihood analysis determined an adjusted effect estimate of the identified significant indicators for inferior peri-operative outcomes related to management.
RESULTS: A total of 185 (93 open, 92 Laparoscopic) cases with an average follow-up of 31.3Â±27.4 months were analyzed. Complications occurred in 21 (11.4%) patients. 12 (6.5%) experienced recurrent UPJ obstruction with 10 (5.4%) undergoing redo-pyeloplasty. Of these, 9 were performed open and 1 laparoscopically. Multivariate logistic regression identified open pyeloplasty as an independent predictor for overall complications (HR 3.29, 95%CI 1.14, 9.51), recurrent UPJ obstruction (HR 49.8, 95%CI 3.09, 803.2) and redo-pyeloplasty (HR 9.75, 95%CI 1.21, 78.6) compared to a laparoscopic approach. Missed crossing vessels were identified in seven redo-cases, which all were from prior open pyeloplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: An initial open approach was identified as an independent predictor of future complications due to a higher incidence missed crossing vessels at initial repair. Surgeons need to remain especially mindful of this phenomenon when working in a confined open field.
