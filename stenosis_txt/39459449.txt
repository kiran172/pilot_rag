Title: Contemporary Management and Prognostic Factors of Arrhythmia Recurrence in Patients with High-Energy Discharge of Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Understanding the underlying causes of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) discharges is vital for effective management. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients admitted following ICD discharge, focusing on myocardial ischemia as a potential exacerbating factor and potential risk factors for VT recurrence. Materials and Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included 81 patients with high energy discharge from cardiac implantable electronic device admitted urgently to the cardiology department from 2015 to 2022. The exclusion criterion was ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. Data were collected anonymously from electronic medical records. Patients were categorized based on coronary angiography, percutaneous angioplasty, presence of significant stenosis, recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT), and catheter ablation. Clinical variables, including demographic data, echocardiographic parameters, and pharmacotherapy, were analyzed. The primary endpoint was the recurrence of VT during in-hospital stay. Results: Among 81 patients, predominantly male (86.4%), with a mean age of 63.6 years, 55 (67.9%) had coronary artery disease (CAD) as the primary etiology for ICD implantation. Coronary angiography was performed in 34 patients (42.0%) and showed significant stenosis (&gt;50%) in 18 (41.8%) patients, while 8 (26.0%) individuals underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Recurrent VT occurred in 21 subjects (26.3%), while ventricular catheter ablation was performed in 36 patients (44.0%). Referral for urgent coronary angiography was associated with presence of diabetes (p = 0.028) and hyperlipidemia (p = 0.022). Logistic regression analysis confirmed NYHA symptomatic class (OR 4.63, p = 0.04) and LVH (OR 10.59, p = 0.049) were independently associated with relapse of VT. CAD patients underwent catheter ablation more frequently (p = 0.001) than those with dilated cardiomyopathy. Conclusions: The study showed a low referral rate for coronary angiography among patients with ICD discharge. Presence of LVH and preexisting symptomatic class influence arrhythmia recurrence. Understanding these associations can guide personalized management strategies for ICD recipients.
