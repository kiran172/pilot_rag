Title: Anesthesia Management in Laparoscopic Donor Hepatectomy: The First Report from Turkey.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to report a single-center experience in laparoscopic donor left-side and right-side hepatectomy cases regarding preoperative evaluation, perioperative and anesthetic management protocols, and postoperative follow-up.
METHODS: Laparoscopic donor left-side and right-side hepatectomy cases were included in the study because of their excessive transection area and bleeding potential. Medical records of living donors were reviewed in terms of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), presence of consanguinity with the recipient, perioperative and early postoperative biochemical parameters, hemodynamic changes during surgery, duration of surgery, the ratio of liver volume to total liver volume, perioperative complications, and length of hospital stay.
RESULTS: Eighty-one laparoscopic living-donor hepatectomy procedures were performed in our unit between 2018 and 2022. Six laparoscopic donor right-side cases and two left-side cases were retrospectively reviewed. Donors' mean age and BMI were 29.6 ± 8.6 years and 23.1 ± 4.3, respectively. The average weights of the right and left lobe liver grafts were 727 g and 279 g, respectively, constituting 65.8% and 22.7% of the total liver volume, respectively. The mean operation time was 593 ± 94 minutes, and the mean volume of blood loss was 437 ± 294 mL. A major complication, namely portal vein stenosis, developed in 1 donor (1/8), and portal vein patency was achieved postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia management and teamwork between surgeons and anesthesiologists are the most important building blocks for donor safety, which is of the utmost priority. Effective communication and cooperation in the operating room may prevent potential donor complications and improve postoperative recovery time.
