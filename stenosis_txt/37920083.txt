Title: Research and Prediction of Factors Related to High Degree Atrioventricular Block after TAVI Surgery Based on Logistic Regression Model.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Based on the logistic regression model, analyze the risk factors for high degree atrioventricular block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) surgery and further analyze its predictive value.
METHODS: 402 patients who underwent TAVI surgery at Henan Thoracic Hospital for "aortic stenosis" between January 2020 and January 2023 were selected as the study subjects. The study subjects were divided into A group (N = 89) and B group (N = 313) based on whether high degree atrioventricular block occurred after surgery. The age, biochemistry and other general data of patients were systematically collected through inpatient cases, and the preoperative Right bundle branch block, I degree atrioventricular block, QRS duration, and indoor block were collected through our hospital's electrocardiogram (ECG) system, Calcification integral of Aortic valve was calculated by computed tomography (CT) results. Logistic regression analysis was performed on the clinical data, and the predictive value of related factors was further analyzed through the Receiver operating characteristic.
RESULTS: The preoperative QRS wave duration in the A group (165.06 ± 61.25) was significantly higher than that in the B group (108.30 ± 16.30), and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Compared with the B group, the incidence of Right bundle branch block in the A group was significantly higher before operation. The calcification score of Aortic valve in the A group (97.58 ± 61.25) was significantly higher than that in the B group (43.59 ± 7.56), with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Further multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the duration of QRS wave before operation and Aortic valve calcification score were independent risk factors for high atrioventricular block after TAVI (p < 0.05). Through Receiver operating characteristic analysis, it was found that preoperative QRS wave duration and Aortic valve calcification score had a high predictive value for the occurrence of high atrioventricular block after TAVI. The optimal cutoff value of QRS wave duration for predicting high atrioventricular block was 152, area under curve (AUC): 0.780 (95% CI: 0.718-0.841, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff value for predicting high degree atrioventricular block with aortic calcification score is 61.5, AUC: 0.997 (95% CI: 0.992-1.000, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative QRS wave duration and Aortic valve calcification score are independent risk factors for high degree atrioventricular block after TAVI, and they have high predictive value. In clinical work, risk factors should be found early and responded in time.
