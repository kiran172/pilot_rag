Title: Palatal dysgenesis in a feline causing complete obstruction of the nasopharynx: A case report.

Abstract: The nasopharyngeal disease is common in felines. Nasopharyngeal stenosis is uncommonly a congenital problem, with most cases being secondary to other diseases. An 8-month-old male neutered domestic shorthair presented with a chief complaint of chronic nasal congestion, open-mouth breathing, and discharge. CT was performed, and palatal dysgenesis resulting in complete nasopharyngeal obstruction, secondary nasopharyngitis, and rostral nasal turbinate lysis were found. This was confirmed by an endoscopic evaluation of the nasopharynx region, which demonstrated a lack of connection between the nasopharynx and oropharynx. This is the first CT report documenting congenital palate dysgenesis resulting in complete obstruction of the nasopharynx.
