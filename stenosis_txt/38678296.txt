Title: Feasibility and efficacy of minimally invasive limited resection for primary duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The primary duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare type of gastrointestinal tract tumor. Limited resection (LR) has been increasingly performed for duodenal GIST. However, only a few studies reported minimally invasive limited resection (MI-LR) for primary duodenal GIST.
METHODS: The clinical data of 33 patients with primary duodenal GIST from December 2014 to February 2024 were retrospectively analyzed including 23 who received MI-LR and 10 who received laparoscopic or robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD/RPD).
RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with primary duodenal GIST were enrolled and retrospectively reviewed. Patients received MI-LR exhibited less OT (280 vs. 388.5min, P=0.004), EBL (100 vs. 450ml, P<0.001), and lower morbidity of postoperative complications (52.2% vs. 100%, P=0.013) than LPD/RPD. Patients received LPD/RPD burdened more aggressive tumors with larger size (P=0.047), higher classification (P<0.001), and more mitotic count/50 HPF(P=0.005) compared with patients received MI-LR. The oncological outcomes were similar in MI-LR group and LPD/RPD group. All the patients underwent MI-LR with no conversion, including 12 cases of LLR and 11 cases of RLR. All of the clinicopathological data of the patients were similar in both groups. The median OT was 280(210-480) min and 257(180-450) min, and the median EBL was 100(20-1000) mL and 100(20-200) mL in the LLR and the RLR group separately. The postoperative complications mainly included DGE (LLR 4 cases, 33.4% and RLR 4 cases, 36.4%), intestinal fistula (LLR 2 cases, 16.7%, and RLR 0 case), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (LLR 0 case and RLR 1 case, 9.1%), and intra-abdominal infection (LLR 3 cases, 25.0% and RLR 1 case, 9.1%). The median postoperative length of hospitalization was 19.5(7-46) days in the LLR group and 19(9-38) days in the RLR group. No anastomotic stenosis, local recurrence or distant metastasis was observed during the follow-up period in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive limited resection is an optional treatment for primary duodenal GIST with satisfactory short-term and long-term oncological outcomes.
