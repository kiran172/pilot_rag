Title: Safety and efficacy of repeated balloon aortic valvuloplasty in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) are poor, and this procedure needs to be repeated in selected cases.
AIMS: We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of repeated BAV (reBAV).
METHODS: We included consecutive patients who underwent reBAV in three Polish centers between 2010 and 2019. Baseline clinical, echocardiographic, procedural, and outcome data were analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (median age 81.5 years, 57.1% women) who underwent reBAV were enrolled. In 42.9% of the patients, index BAV was considered a palliative treatment, and in 54.3% a bridge to definitive treatment. Index BAV decreased peak aortic valve gradient (pAVG) from a median of 78.0 mm Hg to 46.0 mm Hg (P <0.001). After a mean of 255.8 days, reBAV was performed. In most cases (71.4%), the reason for reBAV was the worsening of heart failure symptoms and in 54.3% of patients, reBAV was still considered a palliative option. A decrease in pAVG max from a median of 73.0 mm Hg to 45.0 mm Hg (P <0.001), comparable to index BAV, was observed. The frequency of complications were numerically higher for repeated procedures. During the median (IQR) follow-up of 403.0 (152.0-787.0) days from the index procedure, 80.0% of the patients died.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute hemodynamic results of reBAV are comparable to those achieved during index BAV. However, reBAV may carry an increased risk of complications. Moreover, mortality is high due to unfavorable risk profiles or delays in receiving definitive therapy.
