Title: Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction caused by a right coronary cusp prolapse: An unusual finding.

Abstract: Patients with large sub-pulmonic ventricular septal defect (VSD) present early as a results of their complications. Some present late, due to the restriction of VSD by the right coronary cusp (RCC) due to its prolapse. In this report, we present a rare case of sub-pulmonic VSD in a 33-year-old man who developed a sub-pulmonic stenosis due to the prolapse of the RCC into the right ventricular outflow tract.
