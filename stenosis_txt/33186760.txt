Title: Digestive involvement in a severe form of Snyder-Robinson syndrome: Possible expansion of the phenotype.

Abstract: Snyder-Robinson syndrome (OMIM #309583) is a rare X-linked condition, caused by mutation in the SMS gene (MIM *300105), characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical signs including developmental delay, epilepsy, asthenic habitus, dysmorphism, osteopenia, and renal or genital anomalies. Here we describe two maternal half-brothers who both presented with severe neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, hearing loss, facial dysmorphism, renal and ophthalmologic anomalies, failure to thrive and premature death. A novel p.(Gly203Asp) variant was found at the hemizygous state in the two boys, and an elevated Spermidine/Spermine ratio confirmed the diagnosis of Snyder-Robinson syndrome. One of the brothers presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, with jejunal stenosis, enteral feeding intolerance, failure to thrive due to a dysfunctional gastrointestinal system, cholestasis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Although more studies will be needed to understand its mechanisms, this observation lends further support to the possibility of severe digestive involvement in Snyder Robinson syndrome.
