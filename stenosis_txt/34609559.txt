Title: [ESC/EACTS guidelines 2021 on the management of valvular heart diseases : What are the most important innovations?].

Abstract: In August 2021 the European Society for Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) updated their guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease. Since the publication of the previous version in 2017 new evidence regarding epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of valvular heart diseases has been accumulating, which led to reassessment of several recommendations. Most importantly, the critical role of the heart team in treatment decision-making was reemphasized, the criteria for choosing the mode of aortic valve interventions were clarified, the definition of severe secondary mitral regurgitation was revised and the recommendation for transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair in patients with this condition was upgraded. Additionally, antithrombotic therapeutic regimens in patients with native valvular heart diseases and bioprostheses were reappraised, the indications for early surgery in selected asymptomatic patient groups were expanded and the potential of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions in inoperable and high-risk patients was acknowledged, although the latter needs to be further evaluated. This review article summarizes the most important recommendations of the new guidelines.
