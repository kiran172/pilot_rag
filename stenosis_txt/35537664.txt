Title: [Fetal aortic valvuloplasty in critical aortic stenosis: indication, technique and postnatal outcomes].

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is a complex heart disease that involves the aortic valve and the left ventricle. Impairment of the left ventricle, abnormalities in its size, systolic and diastolic function determine the postnatal outcomes in the same way as the aortic valve. In the most severe forms, the left ventricle cannot provide systemic circulation at birth and the physiology is that of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Fetal aortic valvuloplasty has been developed in the 90s to prevent in utero progression of aortic stenosis to hypoplastic left heart syndrome. In the present article, the most recently reported data about indications, procedure details and postnatal outcomes were reviewed.
