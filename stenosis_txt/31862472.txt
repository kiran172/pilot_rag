Title: Impact of preprocedural left ventricle hypertrophy and geometrical patterns on mortality following TAVR.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In contrast to surgical aortic valve replacement, left ventricle (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) had not been clearly associated with mortality following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in the Israeli multicenter TAVR registry for whom preprocedural LV mass index (LVMI) data were available. Patients were divided into categories according to LVMI: normal LVMI and mild, moderate, and severe LVH. Mild LVH was regarded as the reference group. Additionally, LV geometry patterns were examined (concentric and eccentric LVH, and concentric remodeling).
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1,559 patients, 46.5% male, with a mean age of 82.2 (±6.8) years and mean LVMI of 121 (±29) g/m2. Rates of normal LVMI and mild, moderate, and severe LVH were 31% (n = 485), 21% (n = 322), 18% (n = 279), and 30% (n = 475), respectively. Three-year mortality rates for normal LVMI and mild, moderate, and severe LVH were 19.8%, 18.3%, 23.7%, and 24.4%, respectively. Compared to mild LVH, moderate LVH and severe LVH were independently associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% CI 1.15-2.18, P = .005; HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.1-1.95, P = .009; respectively). Concentric LVH was independently associated with a decreased risk for mortality compared to normal LV geometry (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63-0.89, P = .001). Compared to concentric LVH, eccentric LVH was independently associated with a 33% increased risk for mortality (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11-1.60, P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild concentric LVH confers a protective effect among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR. However, hypertrophy becomes maladaptive, and an increased baseline LVMI, eccentric pattern particularly, may be associated with all-cause mortality in this population.
