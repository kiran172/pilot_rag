Title: Increasing the Yield: When More Is Better.

Abstract: Indeterminate biliary strictures pose a diagnostic challenge, and current approaches in the evaluation of such strictures lack diagnostic sensitivity. The most common method of tissue acquisition remains endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with brush cytology, however, little is known about optimal brush technique. In this paper by Wang et al., the authors compare the diagnostic sensitivity of brush cytology for 10, 20, and 30 passes in patients with malignant biliary strictures. The authors found an increase in sensitivity with an increasing number of passes, without an associated increase in adverse events. This well-designed study offers a simple and safe intervention which can increase the diagnostic sensitivity of ERCP-based brushing without requiring significant time, expense, or additional expertise.
