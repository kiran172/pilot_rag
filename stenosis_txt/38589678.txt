Title: Relationship between New York functional class and duke activity status index with the severity of mitral valve stenosis and echocardiographic parameters: is left atrial strain a better predictor?

Abstract: Purpose This study aimed to investigate the relationship between symptoms of patients with severe mitral stenosis (MS), evaluated by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) score, and echocardiographic parameters. We evaluated patients with severe rheumatic MS diagnosed as mitral valve area (MVA) less than 1.5 cm2. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography and the left atrium (LA) reservoir auto-strain (LASr) analysis. In addition, DASI and NYHA scores were determined to evaluate the functional capacity and symptoms of MS patients. We evaluated 60 patients with MS with a mean age of 50.13 ± 10.28 and a median DASI score of 26.95 (26.38). There were 6 (10%) and 28 (46.7%) patients with NYHA class I and II, and 25 (40.0%) and 2 (3.3%) patients with NYHA class III and IV, respectively. NYHA class was positively correlated with LA area (LAA, r = 0.638), LA volume (LAV, r = 0.652), LAV index (LAVI, r = 0.62), E (r = 0.45), A (r = 0.25), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP, r = 0.34), while negatively correlated with LASr (r = - 0.73) and MVA (r = - 0.417). Furthermore, the DASI score was positively associated with LASr (r = 0.81) and MVA (r = 0.52) while negatively correlated with LAA (r = - 0.62), LAV (r = - 0.65), LAVI (r = - 0.56), E (r = - 0.46), A (r = - 0.3), and PAP (r = - 0.32). Our findings indicate that LAA, LAV, LAVI, E, A, PAP, MVA, and LASr are associated with NYHA and DASI scores in MS patients. Additionally, the LASr had the strongest correlation between all measured parameters in severe MS patients.
