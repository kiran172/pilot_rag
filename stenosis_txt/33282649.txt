Title: Two Barricades in a Row Mixed Lesion of Dynamic Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction and Aortic Stenosis: Finding the Culprit for Decision Making.

Abstract: Concurrent lesions of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (DLVOTO) with aortic stenosis pose a challenge in the measurement of the pressure gradient and severity of each lesion. Determining the true culprit lesion is difficult and challenging. The establishment of true culprit lesion is crucial in deciding the future course of action. We present two cases of concurrent DLVOTO and aortic stenosis. Although the composition of lesions is similar, the severity of each lesion was different and described a variety of technical problems. Finding the culprit through the shape of the stenotic jet from the continuous wave Doppler as well as other different technical approaches is the critical point of this case report. The first patient showed nonsignificant DLVOTO with severe aortic stenosis in which transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) alone was sufficient to find the culprit. Meanwhile, the second patient concluded to have significant DLVOTO with moderate aortic stenosis based on TTE and transesophageal echocardiography examination data. Jet morphology from Doppler examination is a crucial finding to differentiate DLVOTO with aortic stenosis, along with other parameters that might help find the dominant lesion. Multiple modalities with several tailor-made technical considerations might be needed to establish a culprit lesion.
