Title: Outcomes and hemodynamics of Enable bioprosthesis in 432 patients: an afterword.

Abstract: AIMS: To report the largest single-center experience in surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) using the Enable sutureless bioprosthesis concerning the clinical outcome and hemodynamic behavior.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From April 2010 to May 2017, a total of 432 patients (36.3% of them women) received the Enable sutureless prosthesis for aortic valve stenosis, regurgitation, and/or endocarditis. The endpoints were overall survival after operation for 30 days and adverse events.
RESULTS: No intraoperative complications occurred; intraoperative mortality was 0%. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.5% overall and 0.9% for isolated procedure. No valve-related deaths were observed. There was a need for prosthesis replacement during the early postoperative period in eight patients (1.9%): seven patients (1.6%) had a significant paravalvular leak and one patient (0.2%) developed early postoperative endocarditis. The maximum and mean pressure gradients across the prosthesis were 19.2 ± 7.1 mmHg and 11.1 ± 4.6 mmHg, respectively. A permanent pacemaker was necessary in 6.5% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The Enable sutureless prosthesis showed a reliable clinical outcome with low perioperative mortality and morbidity. The hemodynamic performance was satisfactory. Our data confirmed the safety of SAVR using the Enable bioprosthesis. However, a higher rate of pacemaker implantation (6.5%) has to be mentioned.
