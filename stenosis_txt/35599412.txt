Title: [Efficacy and safety of carotid endarterectomy combined with endovascular therapy in hybrid operating room for patients with segmental atherosclerotic internal carotid artery occlusion].

Abstract: The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of carotid endarterectomy combined with endovascular therapy in hybrid operating room for patients with segmental atherosclerotic internal carotid artery occlusion, and share the experience of preoperative screening of patients suitable for vascular reconstruction. A total of 20 patients with internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) who were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from May 2018 to May 2020 were collected, and 15 patients met the inclusion criteria. All patients received hybrid surgery. The total success rate of recanalization was 14/15, and only 1 patient developed ICA re-occlusion at 1 year follow up.Therefore, carotid endarterectomy combined with endovascular treatment in hybrid operating room was an alternative treatment for patients with segmental atherosclerotic internal carotid artery occlusion.
