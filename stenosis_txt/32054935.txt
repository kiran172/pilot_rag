Title: Distinct pressure half-time values by transthoracic echocardiography for grading of paravalvular regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Postprocedural aortic regurgitation (AR) has negative impact on patient outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Standard assessment of AR severity by echocardiography is hampered after TAVR. Measurement of pressure half-time (PHT) by echocardiography is not limited in these patients but it may be affected by concomitant left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This study sought to evaluate distinct cut-off values of PHT differentiating between patients without and with more than mild LVH for grading of AR after TAVR with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as the reference method for comparison. 71 patients (age 81 ± 6 years) with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR were included into the study. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and CMR were performed after TAVR. Left ventricular mass index was calculated by TTE. PHT was measured by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography of aortic regurgitation jet. In 18 patients (25%) PHT could not be obtained due to no or very faint Doppler signal. Aortic regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction were calculated by CMR by flow analysis of the ascending aorta. In 14 of 53 patients (26%) AR after TAVR was moderate or severe as categorized by CMR analysis. More than mild LVH was present in 27 of 53 patients (51%). PHT correlated inversely less to regurgitant fraction by CMR analysis in patients with LVH (r = -0.293; p = 0.138) than in patients without LVH (r = -0.455; p = 0.020). In patients without relevant LVH accuracy of PHT to predict moderate or severe paravalvular regurgitation AUC was 0.813 using a cut-off value of 347 ms and AUC was 0.729 in patients with more than mild LVH using a cut-off value of 420 ms. Analysis of PHT by TTE with distinct cut-off values for patients without and with more than mild LVH allows detection of moderate or severe AR after TAVR as defined by CMR. In none of the patients in which PHT could not be measured AR was categorized as more than trace by CMR analysis.
