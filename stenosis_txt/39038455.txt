Title: Intracardiac Echocardiography-Applications in the Electrophysiology and the Cardiac Catheterization Labs.

Abstract: Background. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is routinely used in cardiac electrophysiology and catheterization labs. It plays a vital role in understanding cardiac anatomy, procedural planning, and early identification of complications. In this review, we describe the utility of ICE for procedures in the electrophysiology lab, including atrial fibrillation ablation, left atrial appendage occlusion device implantation, and cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) extraction. Intracardiac echocardiography also helps in the identification of complications such as pericardial effusion, pulmonary vein stenosis, and left atrial appendage thrombus. Compared with traditional echocardiographic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), ICE has equivalent image quality, requires less sedation, and possesses no risk of esophageal injury. The disadvantages of ICE include a learning curve and necessity for central vascular access.
