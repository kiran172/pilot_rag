Title: Lumbar decompression and fusion for symptomatic spinal stenosis in a patient with chronic thoracic sensory level from prior transverse myelitis: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many patients with transverse myelitis suffer from sensory loss below the spinal level of the lesion. This is commonly associated with chronic neuropathic pain. However, the presence of somatic pain below a complete thoracic sensory level after transverse myelitis is exceptionally rare, and it is unclear if surgical decompression is an effective form of treatment for these patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we describe a 22-year-old Caucasian female who suffered from chronic lumbar back pain despite a complete thoracic sensory level secondary to prior transverse myelitis. Imaging demonstrated multilevel central stenosis below the sensory level, and her pain improved after surgical decompression. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of symptomatic lumbar stenosis below a sensory level after transverse myelitis successfully treated with surgical decompression.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of a patient with symptomatic lumbar stenosis after transverse myelitis whose lower back pain and quality of life improved following surgical decompression and fusion. This case provides evidence that typical lumbago is possible in patients with sensory loss from transverse myelitis, and standard lumbar decompression may provide benefit for these patients.
