Title: Improving outcomes in atherosclerotic renovascular disease: importance of clinical presentation and multi-disciplinary review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis may cause hypertension, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, but large randomized control trials to date have shown no major additional benefit of renal revascularization over optimal medical management. However, these trials did not consider outcomes specifically in relation to clinical presentations. Given that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a heterogenous condition, measures of success likely differ according to the clinical presentation. Our retrospective study objectives were to determine the effects of revascularization when applied to specific clinical presentations and after careful multi-disciplinary team review.
METHODS: All patients presenting to our centre and its referring hospitals with radiological findings of at least one renal artery stenosis > 50% between January 2015 and January 2020 were reviewed at the renovascular multi-disciplinary team meeting with revascularization considered in accordance with international guidelines, notably for patients with anatomically significant renal artery stenosis, adequately sized kidney and presentations with any of; deteriorating kidney function, heart failure syndrome, or uncontrollable hypertension. Optimal medical management was recommended for all patients which included lipid lowering agents, anti-platelets and anti-hypertensives targeting blood pressure ≤ 130/80 mmHg. The effect of revascularization was assessed according to the clinical presentation; blood pressure and number of agents in those with renovascular hypertension, delta glomerular filtration rate in those with ischaemic nephropathy and heart failure re-admissions in those with heart failure syndromes.
RESULTS: During this 5-year period, 127 patients with stenosis ≥ 50% were considered by the multidisciplinary team, with 57 undergoing revascularization (17 primarily for severe hypertension, 25 deteriorating kidney function, 6 heart failure syndrome and 9 for very severe anatomical stenosis). Seventy-nine percent of all revascularized patients had a positive outcome specific to their clinical presentation, with 82% of those with severe hypertension improving blood pressure control, 72% with progressive ischaemic nephropathy having attenuated GFR decline, and no further heart failure admissions in those with heart failure. Seventy-eight percent of patients revascularized for high grade stenosis alone had better blood pressure control with 55% also manifesting renal functional benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: Multi-disciplinary team discussion successfully identified a group of patients more likely to benefit from revascularization based on 3 key factors: clinical presentation, severity of the renal artery lesion and the state of the kidney beyond the stenotic lesion. In this way, a large proportion of patients can clinically improve after revascularization if their outcomes are considered according to the nature of their clinical presentation.
