Title: Analysis of mortality and long-term outcomes of pediatric patients with tracheoesophageal fistula/esophageal atresia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: This study analyzed factors that affect mortality in patients surgically treated for EA, then explored the long-term problems encountered by these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 252 patients with EA who were either diagnosed, treated, and subsequently followed at the Department of Pediatric Surgery, Dicle University Medical Faculty Hospital, or were treated surgically elsewhere but followed at our center, between January 2010 and January 2020,214 patients were included in the study.
RESULTS: Early complications:One or more early complications were observed in 132(62.5%) of the 211 patients who underwent surgical EA repair. The most common early complication was AS, which developed in 106(50.2%) patients. Anastomosis leakage. Was detected in 48 (22.7%) patients. Late complications: The late findings of 161 patients who underwent definitive surgery and had a mean follow-up period of 68 months (range, 6-120 months) were evaluated. The most common late complication was GER.
MORTALITY: Of the 214 patients in our study, 63(29.4%) died, including 48(76.2%) during the early period after the first surgery. Of the 10(15.9%) patients who died during the late period.
CONCLUSION: In our study, the most common early complication was anastomotic stenosis in patients with esophageal atresia. We recommend balloon dilation in the treatment of anastomotic stenosis.Gastroesophageal reflux is the most common long-term complication. Most of these can be treated conservatively and medically. The association of low birth weight, cardiac anomalies, prematurity and VACTERL increased mortality in patients with esophageal atresia in our study.
