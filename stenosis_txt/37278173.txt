Title: [Efficacy of high-frequency electrotome combined with balloon dilatation and cryotherapy through electronic bronchoscope in the management of lumen occlusion type of tracheobronchial tuberculosis].

Abstract: The lumen-occlusion type of tracheobronchial tuberculosis is the most severe type of tracheobronchial stenosis of tuberculosis, often leading to atelectasis or even lung damage in patients. Some patients require surgical resection of the diseased airways and lungs, which can seriously affect their quality of life and even be life-threatening. In order to improve the treatment ability of bronchoscopy physicians for lumen occlusion type of tracheobronchial tuberculosis, this article retrospectively analyzed 30 cases of tracheobronchial tuberculosis with lumen occlusion in Hunan Chest Hospital, and summarized the experience of achieving better results by high-frequency electrotome combined with balloon dilatation and cryotherapy.
