Title: Endovascular Perclose ProGlide complication puncture site, treated successful by cutting balloon dilatation: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: Perclose ProGlide were created as preferred for puncture site closure of femoral artery. Femoral artery occlusion is one of the serious device-related complications. This report presents a continuous endovascular technique combined with peripheral cutting balloon (PCB) treatment for a case of a 32s woman diagnosed with lower extremity ischaemia caused by right superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusion following the use of the Perclose ProGlide system in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. During the primary operation, limb ischaemia symptoms were relieved with vessel perfusion and reconstruction after regular balloon dilatation. A secondary operation was conducted 6 weeks later, and the obstructive lesions were recanalised without residual stenosis after PCB dilatation. No vessel-related adverse events such as dissection, rupture or distal embolisation occurred during the perioperative period. The patient recovered uneventfully after the operation, with complete alleviation of symptoms. Follow-up computed tomography angiography 3 month post-operatively revealed an undeformed shape and excellent patency of the right SFA.
