Title: Fractional flow reserve [FFR] guided stenting of left main coronary artery in acute coronary syndrome: A single centre experience.

Abstract: The present study assesses the clinical outcomes after left main coronary stenting, using clinical evaluation, angiography, and Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). A prospective observational study was conducted on 72 patients undergoing left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenting, transthoracic echocardiography, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention were done and FFR was recorded. At the end of 6 months, follow up check angiography, FFR study were performed. The stent was placed from LMCA to left anterior descending artery (LAD) artery among 45.83% of patients and 9.72% had from LMCA to Left circumflex artery. The mortality rate was 8.33%. The fractional flow reserve was 0.81 on an average ranging from 0.58 to 0.90. Relatively low incidence of major cardiac event was noted among patients with single vessel disease and ostial LMCA disease.
