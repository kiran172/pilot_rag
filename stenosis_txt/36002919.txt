Title: Gastric Peroral Endoscopic Pyloromyotomy for Infants With Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (CHPS), the most common infantile disease requiring surgical intervention, is routinely treated with open or laparoscopic pyloromyotomy. Recently, gastric peroral endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) has been used for adult gastroparesis. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of G-POEM in treating infantile CHPS.
METHODS: We reviewed data from 21 G-POEM-treated patients at 3 tertiary children's endoscopic centers in China between January 2019 and December 2020. Clinical characteristics, procedure-related parameters, perioperative management, and follow-up outcomes were summarized.
RESULTS: G-POEM was performed successfully in all patients. The median operative duration was 49 (14-150) minutes. The submucosal tunnels were successfully established along the greater curvature of the stomach in 19 cases, and 2 cases were switched to the lesser curvature because of difficulty. No perioperative major adverse events occurred. Minor adverse events included inconsequential mucosal injury in 5 cases and unsatisfactory closure of the mucosal incision in 1 case. Upper gastrointestinal contrast radiography in all patients showed smooth passage of the contrast agent through the pylorus on postoperative day 3. The growth curves of the patients reached normal levels 3 months after the procedure. No recurrent clinical symptoms occurred in any patient during the median follow-up period of 25.5 (14-36) months.
DISCUSSION: G-POEM is feasible, safe, and effective for infants with CHPS, with satisfactory clinical responses over a short-term follow-up. Further multicenter studies should be performed to compare the long-term outcomes of this minimally invasive technique with open or laparoscopic pyloromyotomy.
