Title: Coronary artery patch augmentation for congenital left coronary ostial stenosis in Williams syndrome.

Abstract: Left coronary ostial stenosis, which is associated with sudden death, occasionally occurs in individuals with Williams syndrome. However, surgical methods that provide reliable long-term revascularization remain unknown among infants and young children with coronary ostial stenosis. We describe the case of an 18-month-old boy with Williams syndrome who presented with cardiogenic shock due to left coronary ostial stenosis. We performed patch augmentation of the left coronary ostium using glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium. At the last follow-up, the patient was well without any adverse events or myocardial ischemia.
