Title: Correlation Between Plasma Matrix Metalloproteinase-28 Levels and Severity of Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Calcific aortic valve disease is a common cardiovascular disorder worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between plasma matrix metalloproteinase-28 (MMP-28) levels and the severity of calcific aortic valve stenosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Calcific aortic valve stenosis patients who were admitted to the heart center of our hospital between January 2016 and January 2019 to undergo surgery were successively enrolled in this study (55 males and 24 females with an average age of 58.5±9.6). Information on echocardiography, plasma MMP-28 levels, and other clinical data of the patients was retrospectively collected. RESULTS The average plasma MMP-28 level was 2.43±2.22 ng/mL (range, 0.22-8.27 ng/mL). Plasma MMP-28 levels in patients with mild (n=24), moderate (n=31), or severe (n=24) aortic valve stenosis were 0.74 (0.25-2.23), 1.46 (0.50-3.22), and 4.13 (1.54-6.18) ng/mL, respectively, indicating that the patients with severe aortic valve stenosis had significantly higher MMP-28 levels than the patients with moderate or mild aortic valve stenosis (both P<0.01). Regression analysis using the general linear model further revealed that plasma MMP-28 level was correlated with the peak blood flow velocity and mean pressure gradient of the transaortic valve, and the correlations were statistically significant (both P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS MMP-28 level is significantly elevated in severe cases of calcific aortic valve stenosis. Moreover, plasma MMP-28 levels are positively correlated with the mean pressure gradients and peak blood flow velocity of the transaortic valve.
