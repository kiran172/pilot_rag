Title: Drug-Coated Balloon Versus Plain Balloon Angioplasty for Hemodialysis Dysfunction: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.

Abstract: Background Both drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty and conventional plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) can be implemented to treat hemodialysis dysfunction. The present study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of these 2 approaches by conducting a meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials. Methods and Results PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were queried from establishment to January 2021. A total of 18 randomized controlled trials including 877 and 875 patients in the DCB and PBA groups, respectively, were included in the present meta-analysis. Target lesion primary patency, circuit patency, target lesion revascularization, and mortality were pooled. Odds ratios (ORs) were reported with 95% CIs. Publication bias was analyzed with funnel plot and Egger test. Target lesion primary patency was higher among patients who underwent DCB (OR, 2.93 [95% CI, 2.13-4.03], P&lt;0.001 at 6 months; OR, 2.47 [95% CI, 1.53-3.99], P&lt;0.001 at 1 year). Also, the DCB group had a higher dialysis circuit patency at 6 months (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.56-3.77 [P&lt;0.001]) and 1 year (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.22-3.00 [P=0.005]). Compared with the PBA group, the DCB group had lower odds of target lesion revascularization during follow-up (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.23-0.82], P=0.001 at 6 months; OR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.32-1.73], P=0.490 at 1 year). The OR of mortality was comparable between 2 groups at 6 months (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.42-3.33 [P=0.760]) and 1 year (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.58-1.48 [P=0.750]). Conclusions Based on evidence from 18 randomized controlled trials, DCB angioplasty is superior to PBA in maintaining target lesion primary patency and circuit patency among patients with dialysis circuit stenosis. DCB angioplasty also reduces target lesion revascularization with a similar risk of mortality compared with PBA.
