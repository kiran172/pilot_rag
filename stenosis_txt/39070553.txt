Title: Diagnostic efficacy of absolute and relative myocardial blood flow of stress dynamic CT myocardial perfusion for detecting myocardial ischemia in patients with hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Stress dynamic computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) is an accurate quantitative method for diagnosing myocardial ischemia in coronary artery disease (CAD). However, its clinical application has been limited, partly due to the varied cutoff values for absolute myocardial blood flow (MBFa) and the uncertain value of the relative myocardial blood flow ratio (MBF-ratio). This study aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy of and investigate the optimal cutoff values for MBFa and the MBF-ratio in CT-MPI for diagnosing myocardial ischemia in patients with hemodynamically significant CAD.
METHODS: Patients with suspected or known hemodynamically significant CAD who underwent CT-MPI + CT angiography and invasive coronary angiography (ICA)/fractional flow reserve (FFR) between October 2020 and December 2023 were retrospectively evaluated. ICA ≥80% or FFR ≤0.8 were set as the diagnostic standards for functional ischemia. The patients and vessels were categorized into ischemic and non-ischemic groups, and differences in MBFa and the MBF-ratio were compared between the groups. The area under the curve (AUC) and optimal cutoff values were calculated. Diagnostic efficacy parameters, such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, were also compared. In addition, a consistency test was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 46 patients (mean age: 65.37 ± 8.25 years; 120 vessels) were evaluated. Hemodynamically significant stenosis was detected in 30/46 patients (48%) and 81/120 vessels (67.5%). The MBFa and MBF-ratio values were significantly lower in the ischemic than in the non-ischemic group; in the per-vessel analysis, the MBFa values were 73 vs. 128 (P &lt; 0.001) and the MBF-ratio values were 0.781 vs. 0.856 (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. The optimal cutoff values for MBFa and the MBF-ratio were 117.71 and 0.67, respectively. MBFa demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, AUC, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and kappa value of 97.44%, 74.07%, 81.66%, 0.936 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.876-0.973, P &lt; 0.001], 63.33%, 98.36%, and 0.631 (95% CI: 0.500-0.762), respectively. The corresponding values for the MBF-ratio were 92.31%, 85.19%, 87.5%, 0.962 (95% CI: 0.911-0.989, P &lt; 0.001), 75%, 95.83%, and 0.731 (95% CI: 0.606-0.857, P &lt; 0.001), with no significant difference (P = 0.1225).
CONCLUSION: Both MBFa and the MBF-ratio exhibit excellent diagnostic performance for myocardial ischemia in patients with hemodynamically significant CAD. The MBF-ratio is more robust than MBFa for interpreting CT-MPI findings in clinical practice, which is useful for radiologists and clinicians implementing CT-MPI.
