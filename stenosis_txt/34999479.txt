Title: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema complicating balloon valvuloplasty and stent angioplasty of severe pulmonary valve stenosis in four dogs.

Abstract: In dogs, balloon valvuloplasty is considered the treatment of choice for severe pulmonary valve stenosis, and this technique is currently performed routinely in specialist referral practices with low morbidity and mortality. Stent angioplasty has also been recently proposed as a viable treatment option. The present case series describes the clinical course of four dogs with severe pulmonary valve stenosis, treated with balloon valvuloplasty or stent angioplasty at four different institutions, which developed non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema perioperatively after apparently successful dilation of the pulmonary valve. In three cases, there was evidence of some degree of pulmonary hypertension before ballooning. Despite intensive care, the complication proved fatal in three cases. Clinicians should therefore be aware of this life-threatening complication, previously undescribed in dogs.
