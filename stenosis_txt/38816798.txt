Title: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy with sustained ventricular tachycardia: a case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an infrequent hereditary disorder distinguished by fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium in the right ventricular, which predisposes individuals to life-threatening arrhythmias. This case delineates an ARVC patient who suffered recurrent bouts of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). In this case, we mainly discuss the application of myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) in displaying myocardial fibrosis in patients with ARVC.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old male experienced three episodes of unexplained VT over an eight-year period, accompanied by symptoms of chest discomfort, palpitations and dizziness. Coronary angiography revealed no significant coronary stenosis. The electrocardiogram (ECG) results indicated characteristic epsilon waves in right precordial leads, and subsequent echocardiography identified right ventricular enlargement and right ventricular systolic dysfunction. MCE further disclosed regional myocardial ischemia at the epicardium of the left ventricular apex. Ultimately, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) corroborated the ARVC diagnosis, highlighting linear intensification in the right ventricle during the delayed enhancement.
CONCLUSION: Prompt identification of ARVC is crucial for timely intervention and management. MCE may offer an effective and valuable technique for the detection of myocardial involvement in ARVC patient.
