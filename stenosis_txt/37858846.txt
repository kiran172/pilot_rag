Title: Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair in Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis: A USRDS Registry Study.

Abstract: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of the mitral valve has become standard of care for the treatment of high-risk patients with severe mitral regurgitation. Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis were either excluded or severely underrepresented in all seminal trials proving the safety and efficacy of TEER. There have been few studies that evaluated the effectiveness or complications of TEER in ESRD patients. Using the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), we identified all ESRD patients who underwent TEER from October 2015 to December 31, 2019. Major comorbidities were recorded and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for survival and freedom from hospitalization or death. The study population included 965 patients, of which 576 (59.7%) were male. The median age at the time of TEER was 72.5 (IQR: 64.4-79.1) years. There were 130 (13.2%) patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), 110 (11.2%) with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and 745 (74.6%) with an indeterminate ejection fraction. During follow-up, strokes occurred in 61 (6.3%) patients, infective endocarditis in 42 (4.4%) patients, mitral stenosis in 13 (1.3%) and valve embolism in less than 11 patients. One-year survival was 56.9%, and 2-year survival was 33.9%. In patients with ESRD undergoing TEER, only a preserved ejection fraction (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.99, P = 0.041) was a significant predictor of survival in a cox proportional hazards model. Despite favorable in-hospital outcomes one-year mortality rates surpass those reported in broader patient cohorts. The increased incidence of infective endocarditis and mitral stenosis is likely related to increased risk intrinsic to those with ESRD.
