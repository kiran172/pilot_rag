Title: Impact of digestive-surgical cross-disciplinary management in patients with esophageal atresia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze whether patients undergoing esophageal atresia (EA) surgery benefit from a cross-disciplinary follow-up program, based on current clinical guidelines, implemented in our institution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, analytical, retrospective study of patients undergoing EA surgery from 2012 to 2022 was carried out. The results of a joint pediatric surgery and gastroenterology consultation program -which was implemented in 2018 and applies a protocol based on the new ESPGHAN-NASPGHAN guidelines- were analyzed. Patients were divided according to whether they had been treated before or after 2018. Quantitative variables -follow-up losses, anti-reflux treatment initiation and duration, and enteral nutrition initiation- and qualitative variables -prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux, anti-reflux surgery, respiratory infections, anastomotic stenosis, re-fistulizations, dysphagia, impaction episodes, need for gastrostomy, and endoscopic results- were compared.
RESULTS: 38 patients were included. 63.2% had gastroesophageal reflux. 97.4% received anti-reflux treatment in the first year of life, with treatment being subsequently discontinued in 47.4%. Discontinuation time decreased by a mean of 24 months following program implementation (p< 0.05). A 4.6-fold increase in the frequency of pH-metries was noted following program implementation. The protocol standardized endoscopies in asymptomatic patients when they turn 5 and 10 years old. 25 endoscopies with biopsy were carried out after 2018, with histological disorders being detected in 28% of them. The number of follow-up losses significantly decreased following protocol implementation (p< 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Digestive-surgical cross-disciplinary follow-up of EA patients has a positive impact on patient progression. Applying the guidelines helps optimize treatment and early diagnosis of complications.
