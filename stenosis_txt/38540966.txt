Title: Open Retrograde Stenting of Proximal Innominate and Common Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The evidence regarding the treatment of open retrograde stenting of innominate artery (IA) or common carotid artery stenosis (CCA) is limited, and is suspected to carry a high risk of stroke and death. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of such hybrid procedures.
METHODS: A retrospective, monocentric study of all patients who underwent retrograde stenting of proximal IA and CCA stenosis via surgical cutdown of the CCA, with or without concomitant CEA, between 2016 and 2023 was performed.
RESULTS: Overall, 33 patients were treated. A total of 15 patients (45.5%) were male, with the mean age being 67 Â± 9.1 years, and 58% (n = 19) of the patients presented with neurological symptoms. Open retrograde stenting was performed in 67% (n = 22) in ACC, and in 33% (n = 11) in IA stenosis. A total of 20 patients (61%) underwent retrograde stenting with synchronous ipsilateral CEA for concomitant stenosis of the carotid bifurcation. There was no 30-day mortality. The perioperative stroke rate was 3% (n = 1) with complete symptom recovery. During the follow up at 32 months (95% CI: 24-39), three late deaths (9.1%) and one symptomatic stent occlusion were observed and, in five patients (15.2%), re-intervention for restenosis was necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: Open retrograde stenting for of proximal IA or CCA stenosis with or without CEA, in case of tandem carotid lesions, can be performed safely with a low rate of early adverse events. Continuous follow up examinations are necessary due to relevant instent re-stenosis rates.
