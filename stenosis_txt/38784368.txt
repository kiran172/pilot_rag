Title: Differential Lung Ventilation Under the Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Assistance in a Patient With a Giant Thoracic Tumor: A Case Report.

Abstract: Airway compression resulting from thoracic tumors requires evaluation of the possibility of fatal ventilation failure when securing the airway. A woman presenting with a thoracic mass on the right side causing airway compression at the level of tracheal bifurcation required tumor removal to alleviate the compression; however, securing the airway proved challenging. Furthermore, differential lung ventilation was necessary for surgical management. We planned to secure the airway and manage breathing with the assistance of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) through an interdisciplinary conference and proceeded according to the plan. The intended tracheal tube could be placed, differential lung ventilation was initiated, and the ECMO was removed. The surgical procedure was carried out. In patients presenting with airway stenosis, the possibility of difficulty in securing the airway and ventilation should be assessed in advance. Creating a detailed treatment plan before surgery is recommended.
