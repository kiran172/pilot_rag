Title: Two-year outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation in degenerated surgical valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) has emerged in recent years as a safe alternative to redo surgery in high-risk patients. Although early results are encouraging, data beyond short-term outcomes are lacking. Herein, we aimed to assess the 2-year outcomes after ViV-TAVI.
METHODS: Patients undergoing ViV-TAVI for degenerated surgical valves between 2013 and 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic were reviewed. The coprimary endpoints were all-cause mortality and congestive heart failure (CHF) hospitalizations. We used time-to-event analyses to assess the primary outcomes. Further, we measured the changes in transvalvular gradients and the incidence of structural valve deterioration (SVD).
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-eight patients were studied (mean age = 76 years; 65% males). At 2 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality and CHF hospitalizations occurred in 15 (8%) and 28 (14.9%) patients, respectively. On multivariable analysis, the postprocedural length of stay was a significant predictor for both all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.19) and CHF hospitalization (HR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.27). However, the internal diameter of the surgical valve was not associated with significant differences in both primary endpoints. For hemodynamic outcomes, nine patients (4.8%) developed SVD. The mean and peak transvalvular pressure gradients remained stable over the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: ViV-TAVI for degenerated surgical valves was associated with favorable 2-year clinical and hemodynamic outcomes. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of ViV-TAVI as a treatment option in the life management of aortic valve disease.
