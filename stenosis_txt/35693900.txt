Title: Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation to Facilitate Transcutaneous Mitral Valve Replacement in Critical Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: Biological mitral valve restenosis after replacement in rheumatic heart disease is a rare complication. This case illustrates venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate transcatheter mitral valve replacement in a patient with suprasystemic pulmonary pressure and cardiogenic shock with multiorgan failure secondary to critical mitral stenosis of a bioprosthetic valve.(Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
