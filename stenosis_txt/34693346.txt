Title: Dynamic Changes in Coronary Flow Pattern During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Coronary flow reserve in patients with severe aortic stenosis decreases even in the absence of coronary stenosis. In this case, the dynamic changes in the coronary flow pattern around transcatheter aortic valve replacement were observed by periprocedural transesophageal echocardiography. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
