Title: Successful Avoidance of Cicatricial Tracheobronchial Stenosis in a Patient With Endobronchial Tuberculosis by Early Administration of Systemic High-Dose Corticosteroids: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 63-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital due to dry cough, fever, hoarseness, stridor, and difficulty breathing. Chest computed tomography showed circumferential wall thickening in the trachea, carina, right main bronchus, and right upper lobe bronchus, and granular and nodular shadows in right S2. Flexible laryngofiberscopy showed yellowish dry respiratory secretions adhering to the subglottis. Bronchoscopic findings showed that the tracheobronchial mucosa was swollen, hyperemic, and covered with yellowish-white, cheese-like materials, and ulcerative lesions with white coatings were observed from the subglottis to the trachea, carina, right main bronchus, and right upper lobe bronchus. A diagnosis of endobronchial tuberculosis (EBTB) was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing, and cultures were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition to anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone reduced her severe respiratory symptoms and prevented cicatricial tracheobronchial stenosis. Early administration of systemic high-dose corticosteroids may be effective for EBTB patients with severely active tracheobronchial mucosal and submucosal lesions.
