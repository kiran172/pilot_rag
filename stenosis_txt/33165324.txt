Title: A Modified Two Kidney One Clip Mouse Model of Renin Regulation in Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis is a common condition in patients with coronary or peripheral vascular disease where the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is overactivated. In this context, there is a narrowing of the renal arteries that stimulate an increase in the expression and release of renin, the rate-limiting protease in RAAS. The resulting rise in renin expression is a known driver of renovascular hypertension, frequently associated with kidney injury and end organ damage. Thus, there is a great interest in developing novel treatments for this condition. The molecular and cellular mechanism of renin control in renal artery stenosis is not fully understood and warrants further investigation. To induce renal artery stenosis in mice, a modified 2 kidney 1 clip (2K1C) Goldblatt mouse model was developed. The right kidney was stenosed in wild type mice and sham operated mice were used as control. After renal artery stenosis, we determined renin expression and kidney injury. Kidneys were harvested, and fresh cortices were used to determine protein and mRNA expression of renin. This animal model is reproducible and can be used to study pathophysiological responses, molecular and cellular pathways involved in renovascular hypertension and kidney injury.
