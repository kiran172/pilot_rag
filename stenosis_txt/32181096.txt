Title: Anastomotic Breakdown Five Years After Neoadjuvant Radiochemotherapy and Ultralow Anterior Resection for Rectal Adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: For carefully selected patients with low-lying rectal cancers, ultralow anterior resection (ULAR) can be an effective alternative to abdominal perineal resection, and together with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy can provide the opportunity for sphincter preservation. However, ULAR is not without potential postoperative complications, particularly anastomotic dehiscence which increases in likelihood after receiving radiation therapy. While surveillance imaging is not indicated three years beyond initial surgical resection, changes in chronic symptoms refractory to conservative management may warrant further investigation. In this case report, we present an interesting case of late-onset stenosis and anastomotic breakdown following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy, ULAR, and coloanal anastomosis for a low-lying rectal adenocarcinoma. Effective patient education, reliable symptom assessment, and multidisciplinary collaboration are essential to assessing for long-term treatment-related complications and providing appropriate treatment in a timely manner.
