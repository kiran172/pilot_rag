Title: Percutaneous spinal decompression.

Abstract: Symptoms arise when narrowing of the spinal canal, lateral recesses, or intervertebral foramina impinge upon the neural structures that traverse the spinal column. Pathology involving the structures that make up the spine can narrow the relevant spaces. Here a description of percutaneous procedures that address narrowing from disc disease, ligamentum Flavum hypertrophy, and devices that open and stabilize the spine at individual levels are presented.
