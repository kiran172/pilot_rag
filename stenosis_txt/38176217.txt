Title: Use of a stent-retriever for treatment of iatrogenic vasospasm secondary to mechanical thrombectomy.

Abstract: The treatment strategy for iatrogenic intracranial vasospasm has not been established. We reported a rare case of stent-retriever use for the treatment of iatrogenic vasospasm after mechanical thrombectomy. The patient presented acute ischemic stroke due to the occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). The patient underwent a successfully mechanical thrombectomy, however, severe stenosis was visualized in MCA, which was considered to be an iatrogenic mechanical vasospasm. This vasospasm was successfully treated with the Solitaire stent device, and the patient recovered from ischemic symptoms. A stent-retriever is a safe and effective treatment for iatrogenic vasospasm after mechanical thrombectomy.
