Title: Central Auditory Processing Skills in Individuals with Takayasu Syndrome.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The current study was done to assess the central auditory processing in individuals with Takayasu's Syndrome. The Takayasu Syndrome is a rare disease, hence a case series was conducted with consecutive sampling. In this study, five patients diagnosed with Takayasu's syndrome were evaluated on the central auditory processing tests. The tests were administered using standard operating protocols. It was observed that the score on the dichotic digit test was drastically reduced suggesting difficulty in auditory integration skills in all the participants. There was an observed difficulty in speech perception in noise for all the participants indicating abnormal auditory closure ability. It was concluded that the reduced blood supply to the cortex would have caused a reduction in auditory skills. The current attempts to document the central processing disorder in a rare syndrome.
