Title: Intracranial venous stenting for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence in the literature to support venous sinus stenting in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension who fail first-line therapy. Venous sinus stenting is a safe and successful technique compared with cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedures. This study examines the clinical outcomes of patients post intracranial venous stenting for intracranial hypertension across three tertiary hospitals in Western Australia.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 83 consecutive patients treated with intracranial venous stenting for IIH at three tertiary hospitals from October 2013 to March 2020. Data were collected from outpatient clinic letters, electronic discharge letters, electronic radiological imaging and procedural reports.
RESULTS: 89.2% patients were able to cease Acetazolomide post stenting. 78.3% patients reported resolution of headaches. 84.3% patients demonstrated resolution of their papilloedema. 91.6% patients demonstrated improvement of their visual acuity. Compared with a recent meta-analysis by Satti and Chaudry in 2015, our results demonstrated a higher technical success rate and lower complication rates.
CONCLUSION: Our study findings support the paradigm shift from CSF diversion procedures to venous sinus stenting in patients with IIH who fail first-line therapy. Venous sinus stenting has a high technical success rate and significantly lower complication rates than other invasive treatments.
