Title: Microvascular spasm in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction without culprit lesion (MINOCA).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Up to 30% of patients with acute coronary syndrome have no culprit lesion. Coronary microvascular spasm is an alternative cause for such a clinical presentation. However, this has rarely been investigated systematically. The aim of our study was to assess the frequency of coronary microvascular spasm in patients with NSTEMI without culprit lesion (MINOCA) by intracoronary acetylcholine testing (ACH-test).
METHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, 940 patients with NSTEMI underwent coronary angiography and 125 (13%) had no culprit lesion (< 50% stenosis on visual assessment). Of the latter, 29 patients had other causes for the clinical presentation (e.g. tako-tsubo-syndrome or myocarditis). The remaining 96 patients were recruited for the study and underwent ACH-testing according to a standardized protocol.
RESULTS: The ACH-test was normal in 40 (42%) and abnormal in the remaining 56 (58%) patients. Of the latter, 26 patients (46%) had epicardial spasm (epicardial narrowing ≥ 90%, reproduction of symptoms and ischemic ST-segment changes) and 30 (54%) microvascular spasm (ischemic ST-shifts and angina without epicardial vasoconstriction ≥ 90%). The peak high-sensitive troponin-T concentration was 113 (42-255) pg/ml. Patients with coronary spasm had more often a positive family history compared to those without and patients with epicardial compared to microvascular spasm were more often smokers.
CONCLUSION: Coronary microvascular spasm is frequently found in patients with NSTEMI without culprit lesion and represents a likely cause of myocardial injury. ACH-testing is useful for detection of vasomotor disorders allowing tailored treatment with calcium antagonists and/or nitrates in addition to secondary prevention to improve symptoms and prognosis.
