Title: Long-Term Results of Autologous Bifurcated Carotid Artery Reconstructions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid bifurcation revascularization using interposition grafts is rare. While internal carotid artery (ICA) revascularization is regarded as mandatory, the external carotid artery (ECA) is severed in most instances. Long-term results of an autologous bifurcated carotid artery reconstruction are discussed.
METHODS: Single-center, retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of patients treated at an academic vascular surgery center.
RESULTS: From December 2006 to November 2019, fifty-one patients underwent reconstruction of the carotid artery using an autologous bifurcated interposition graft (38 males, 75%; median age: 68.7 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 60.2-76.5). Thirty-eight patients were asymptomatic (74.5%). Indication for reconstruction was recurrent carotid stenosis unfavorable for endovascular treatment/redo patch plasty (n = 32, symptomatic: n = 7), carotid aneurysm (n = 11, symptomatic: n = 5), neck tumor with vascular involvement (n = 7), trauma (n = 1). Nonreversed valve depleted saphenous vein y-graft from the groin was used in 49 (94.2%) and reversed cubital vein bifurcation in 3 (5.8%) procedures. The median ICA cross-clamp time was 15 min (IQR: 13-20 min). In four procedures (7.7%), a shunt was inserted because of a significant decrease of cerebral perfusion. In one patient, additional intraoperative stent placement of a proximal common carotid artery (CCA) stenosis was performed. Six patients suffered from ischemic neurological deficits (11.5%), all but 1 recovered with no or moderate symptoms. After a median follow-up of 5.2 years (IQR: 1.1-8.7 years), 7 significant asymptomatic stenoses (13.5%) and 2 occlusions (3.8%, one symptomatic) of the ICA, two significant asymptomatic CCA stenoses (3.8%), five significant stenoses (9.6%) and 7 asymptomatic occlusions (13.5%) of the ECA were observed. This prompted 7 re-redo-interventions in 5 patients. Twenty-eight patients (54.9%) died after a median follow-up of 3.3 years (IQR: 0.5-5.6 years). Two of these patients died due to conditions related to the performed carotid artery reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: Autologous bifurcated carotid artery interposition graft provides results comparable to other complex ICA revascularizations. Overall survival in this heterogeneous patient cohort is poor. Due to the high risk of stroke and poor long-term outcome, this procedure should be reserved for symptomatic patients with no other option for revascularization.
