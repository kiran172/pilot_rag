Title: Treatment Strategy for Acute Cholecystitis Induced by a Metallic Stent Placed in Malignant Biliary Strictures: Role of Percutaneous Transhepatic Gallbladder Aspiration.

Abstract: Objective The present study evaluated the strategic role of percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder aspiration (PTGBA) for acute cholecystitis (AC) induced by a metallic stent (MS) placed in a malignant biliary stricture in comparison with percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD). Methods The treatment outcomes for 31 patients who underwent PTGBA as the initial intervention for MS-induced AC were evaluated and compared with those for 12 who underwent PTGBD. Results The technical success rate was 100% for both groups. PTGBA was ineffective for 11 patients, all of whom recovered with additional intervention, whereas PTGBD was effective for all patients except for 1 who died of sepsis (clinical success rate, 65% vs. 90%, p=0.16). Adverse events (AEs) were observed in only 1 case (3%) in the PTGBA group (mild bile peritonitis). Among the clinically effective cases, AC recurred in 20% of the PTGBA group and 33% of the PTGBD group (p=0.72). In the PTGBA group, the clinical success rate was significantly higher for patients without cancer invasion to a feeding artery of the gallbladder than in those with invasion (75% without invasion vs. 29% with invasion; p=0.036). According to the multivariate analysis, this factor was an independent factor for clinical success of PTGBA (odds ratio, 9.27; p=0.040). Conclusion Although the clinical success rate of PTGBA for MS-induced AC was lower than that of PTGBD, PTGBA remains a viable option because of its safety and procedural simplicity, especially for cases without tumor invasion to a feeding artery.
