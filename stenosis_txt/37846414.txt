Title: Iatrogenic tracheal laceration due to rigid bronchoscopy treated by endoscopic stent placement: a case report.

Abstract: Although rigid bronchoscopy may lead to tracheal injury, the incidence is unknown. A 59-year-old woman diagnosed with clinical stage IV esophageal cancer was scheduled to undergo placement of a silicon Y-stent by rigid bronchoscopy to address tracheal stenosis. When the tumor was cored out by rigid bronchoscopy, perforation of the lower trachea occurred, and a silicon Y-stent was inserted to cover the tracheal fistula. Chest X-ray revealed right pneumothorax, and chest drainage was performed. When spontaneous ventilation was confirmed, the patient was weaned from the ventilator in the operating room. Chest computed tomography immediately after surgery showed an air space on the right side of the stent. The space gradually disappeared over time, and no air leakage was observed. The chest drain was removed on postoperative Day 12. Conservative treatment using a silicon Y-stent for iatrogenic tracheal injury due to rigid bronchoscopy is safe.
