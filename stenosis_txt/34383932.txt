Title: Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.

Abstract: Carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been shown to be equally effective as carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for carotid stenosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease.1 In patients who are considered high risk for endarterectomy, CAS is safe and effective.2 While this is a common procedure, proper technique is crucial to ensure that the procedure is safe with minimal risk of stroke. This patient consented to treatment. The following is a video detailing the CAS procedure in a 77-yr-old male with a symptomatic 65% carotid stenosis (by NASCET criteria3) in a patient with prior CEA.
