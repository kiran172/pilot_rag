Title: Acute abdominal aortic occlusion due to gastric dilatation caused by pyloric stenosis in a 62-year-old patient.

Abstract: Acute gastric dilatation leading to compromised vascular visceral vascular flow is an exceptionally rare complication typically described in patients with bulimia or anorexia following binge episodes. We present a fatal case involving a non-bulimic patient who experienced an acute gastric dilatation secondary to pyloric stenosis. Despite intensive treatment, the patient succumbed to complications arising from acute reperfusion syndrome. Managing such patients is highly challenging, and the prognosis is often poor, as supported by the limited reports available in the literature.
