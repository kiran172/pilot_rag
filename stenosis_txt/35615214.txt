Title: Giant Localized Atheroma Mimicking a Coarctation of the Aorta: A Rare Entity to Consider.

Abstract: We describe the case of a patient who developed resistant hypertension due to a giant atheroma with acquired physiologic mimic of coarctation of the aorta. This presentation illustrates an extremely rare etiology to consider in adultsÂ in whom aortic isthmus stenosis remains often of congenital origin. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
