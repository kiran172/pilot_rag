Title: Microscopic Replantation of Penile Glans Amputation Due to Circumcision.

Abstract: Circumcision using a disposable stapler is becoming quite popular in China. However, improper surgical procedures also bring the risk of penile glans amputation, which is a very rare iatrogenic genital injury. Such complication is conventionally treated by simple hemostasis to achieve self-healing, early gross replantation, or delayed plastic surgery. However, these may lead to obvious unfavorable outcomes such as amputated glans loss, necrosis, malformation healing, or urethral orifice stenosis. In the present study, we adopted microscopic replantation as an emergency approach to achieve the precise anastomoses and anatomic reconstruction of penile glans. The goal of this protocol is to present a detailed emergency management strategy with meticulous surgical skills for the penile glans amputation. The postoperative results showed that the original shape of the glans was perfectly restored with satisfactory cosmetic appearance. The micturition function was completely restored to normal without any obvious complications. There was also no significant reduction in the sensation of amputated glans area. Hence, early meticulous microscopic replantation as soon as possible is an ideal emergency management strategy for the penile glans amputation due to circumcision.
