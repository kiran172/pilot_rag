Title: Choroidal vascularity index of patients with coronary artery disease.

Abstract: We investigated the changes in subfoveal choroidal thickness and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) and their relationship with the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD). Ninety patients who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) for evaluation of their coronary artery status and cardiac symptoms were included. Forty-two patients showed no evidence of CAD; 31 patients had one to two vessel disease; and 17 had a triple vessel disease. There were no significant differences in the subfoveal choroidal thickness among the three groups; however, the CVI in the triple vessel disease group was lower than those in the other groups. The CVI values were good predictors of the presence of triple-vessel disease (p = 0.020). Multivariate logistic regression analysis results revealed that male sex (odds ratio 5.4, p = 0.049), hypertension (odds ratio 4.9, p = 0.017), and CVI (%, odds ratio 0.8, p = 0.016) were significant factors associated with the presence of triple vessel disease. Although CVI may not be a sensitive marker for detecting early changes in the coronary artery, it may be helpful in indicating severe CAD.
