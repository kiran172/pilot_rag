Title: The evolution and future directions of bypass surgery.

Abstract: Cerebral bypass surgery is one of the most complex and elegant procedures in neurosurgery. It involves several meticulous steps that test the skills of even the most prepared neurosurgeons. This surgery has transcended its traditional role in arterial stenosis and atherosclerosis, expanding its applications to include flow preservation techniques for complex conditions such as aneurysms, tumors, and vascular malformations. The decreased number of procedures performed across many hospitals reflects the development of newer endovascular therapies but is also due to the results of the extracranial-intracranial bypass study, the Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study, and the Carotid and Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Surgery Study, which have raised questions about the efficacy of cerebral bypass surgery for individuals with carotid artery occlusion who are prone to ischemic stroke. Despite this, there is still a potential benefit of bypass surgery for patients with hemodynamic impairment refractory to medical management. Also, revascularization in moyamoya vasculopathy is an effective strategy for preventing ischemic and hemorrhagic events in both children and adults. Additionally, innovations in the technique, such as the flow-regulated bypass and intraoperative flow assessment, aim to minimize perioperative morbidity. Despite bypass surgery being less performed in this current era, the teaching and development of these skills are still encouraged for future neurosurgeons, as a role for bypass will exist for the foreseeable future.
