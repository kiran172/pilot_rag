Title: The clinical significance of the incorporation of tissue Doppler imaging into low-dose Dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients with aortic stenosis prior to Transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is indicated in patients with low flow (stroke volume index [SVi] &lt; 35 ml/m2) low gradient (mean pressure gradient &lt; 40 mmHg) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% aortic stenosis (AS) to assess LV contractile reserve (&gt; 20% increase in SVi) and severity grade of AS. Severe AS is defined by a mean pressure gradient of 40 mmHg occurring at any time during the test when aortic valve area remains &lt; 1.0 cm2.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case report highlights the utility of mitral annular systolic velocity (S') by tissue Doppler imaging and peak LV outflow tract (LVOT) velocity as markers of LV intrinsic contractile function during DSE in a patient with low flow low gradient AS and reduced EF prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
CONCLUSIONS: Mitral annular S' and peak LVOT velocities are reliable markers of LV intrinsic contractile function and should be incorporated into routine low-dose DSE.
