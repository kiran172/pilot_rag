Title: Tricuspid regurgitation and in-hospital outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in high-risk patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognostic impact of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is uncertain, and the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis and significant TR undergoing TAVR is unclear.
METHODS: Retrospective study investigating the role of TR severity on hospital outcomes in high risk patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR.
RESULTS: A total of 174 participants were included in the present study. The median age was 84 years and 48% were women. The median (IR) STS score was 7.3 (4.7-13.6). The pre-procedural mean (SD) aortic valve area (AVA) was 0.69 (0.2) cm2 and the average (SD) peak and mean gradients were 71 [23]/42 [15] mmHg. Pre TAVR, 28.7% of patients had significant (moderate or severe) TR. Significant TR pre-TAVR increased the risk of in-hospital cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause and mortality [adjusted relative risk (RR) (95% CI): 14.67 (1.35-159.51) and 5.09 (1.14-22.72), respectively], and those with severe TR post-TAVR had longer hospital stay [median (IR): 9.9 (2.9-17.0) days]. No improvement or worsened TR (greater than mild) post-TAVR was associated with higher CV and all-cause mortality [adjusted RR (95% CI): 21.5 (1.81-255.96) and 8.19 (1.67-40.29), respectively]. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was independently associated with TR severity pre and post TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant TR was common among patients undergoing high risk TAVR, and is associated with increased in hospital mortality and longer hospital stay. Patients with elevated RVSP and persistent moderate or severe TR after TAVR are at higher risk of in hospital death.
