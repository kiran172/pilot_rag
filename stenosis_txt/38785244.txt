Title: [Dynamic functional assessment of internal carotid artery tortuosity in patients with multifocal atherosclerosis].

Abstract: A personalized approach with attention to anamnesis and specific symptoms is necessary in patients with internal carotid artery tortuosity. Neuroimaging (especially before elective surgery) or functional stress tests following ultrasound of supra-aortic vessels may be necessary depending on medical history and complaints. In addition to standard Doppler ultrasound, these patients should undergo rotational and orthostatic transformation tests. We analyze changes in shape and hemodynamic parameters within the tortuosity area in various body positions. This is especially valuable for patients with concomitant carotid artery stenosis. The article presents a clinical case illustrating the importance of such approach.
