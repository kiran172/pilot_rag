Title: Bench-Top Comparison of Three Different Types of Stents Used for Treatment of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Four key bench-top tests, including trackability, conformability, wall-apposition, and bending stiffness, were performed to understand the mechanical characteristics in 3 different types of stents applicable for treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis: Balloon-expandable D+Storm, Pro-Kinetic Energy, and self-expandable Wingspan stents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trackability was assessed by measuring the tracking forces of each stent with its delivery systems. Conformability and wall apposition were quantified and analyzed using curved vessel models. A 3-point bending test was employed to evaluate bending stiffness.
RESULTS: D+Storm showed the lowest tracking forces while the conformability of the Wingspan stent was superior to that of the tested stents. Pro-Kinetic Energy and D+Storm had better wall apposition in curved vessels than the Wingspan stent. Bending stiffness of the Wingspan stent was notably lower, whereas no significant differences were found between D+Storm and Energy. Pro-Kinetic Energy and D+Storm not only indicated lower gap ratios between the struts and the vessel wall but also maintained good wall apposition even in the curved model.
CONCLUSION: These bench-top measurements may provide clinicians with useful information in regard to selecting suitable stents for treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.
