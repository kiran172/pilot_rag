Title: Evaluation of paediatric pulmonary vein stenosis by cardiac CT angiography: a comparative study with transthoracic echocardiography and catheter angiogram.

Abstract: AIM: To compare prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and cardiac catheter angiography (CCA) for paediatric pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review was undertaken of all patients who underwent CCTA for PV evaluation over a 4-year period. Patient demographics, findings of CCTA, TTE, and CCA, as well as interventions performed, were recorded for each PV.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included (23 male patients). All patients had a prior TTE with time interval between TTE and CCTA ranging from 0 to 90 days. CCTA detected 92 abnormalities in 32 patients. TTE missed 16 PV abnormalities (16/92, 17%), detected 37 abnormalities with certainty (37/92, 40%), and was suggestive in 39 abnormalities (39/92, 42%). CCTA was negative for PV abnormalities when TTE was positive or suspicious in three patients. Nineteen patients underwent CCA (18 patients with 52 abnormalities and one patient with normal PV), confirming CCTA findings. Thirty-nine were treated with angioplasty/stenting (39/52,75%). Failed recanalisation occurred in three PVs (3/52, 6%) and no intervention was attempted for the rest as the gradient was not significant (10/52,19%). Nine patients underwent surgical repair (26/92, 28%). Five patients (14/92, 15%) were managed with no intervention based on CCTA findings and poor clinical prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: CCTA plays an important role in detecting paediatric PV stenosis and identifies additional findings compared to TTE that have direct surgical/interventional implications. CCTA complements TTE in imaging these patients and helps guide management.
