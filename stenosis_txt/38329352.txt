Title: Technical Nuances of the Posterior Transpedicular Thoracic Diskectomy: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.

Abstract: Thoracic disk herniations are relatively rare when compared with cervical and lumbar disk pathology accounting for less than 3% of spinal disk herniations.1 In addition to this, a larger proportion of thoracic disk herniations are calcified making them challenging to remove because of adherence to the dura and anatomy of the thoracic spinal canal.2,3 Owing to these unique features of thoracic disk herniations, typical posterior approaches are not always feasible to provide adequate decompression of the thecal sac.4 In this video, we present a 64-year-old male patient who presented with progressive paraplegia and a large ventral, eccentric, calcified thoracic disk herniation causing severe canal stenosis. Because of the size and location of the disk, a thoracic laminectomy with costotransversectomy and pediculectomies for resection of the disk was performed. Ventral decompression was achieved, and the patient made a full neurologic recovery. This video highlights the principles and technical nuances used during thoracic disk resection. The patient provided informed consent for surgery and video recording.
