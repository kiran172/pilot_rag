Title: Case Report: A Cluster of Complications During Carotid Artery Stenting Managed With Peripheral, Coronary, and Imaging Techniques.

Abstract: We describe the case of a 72-year-old man with severe, asymptomatic in-stent restenosis detected 4 years after index carotid artery stenting (CAS). The patient was deemed at low risk and scheduled for re-angioplasty with a drug-coated balloon as per institution protocol. What at first seemed a simple case suddenly turned into a series of cerebral and vascular complications that were successfully managed with a mix of peripheral, coronary, and imaging techniques.
