Title: Distribution and prognostic value of left ventricular global longitudinal strain in elderly patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIMS: The aim of present study was to examine the preoperative prevalence and distribution of impaired left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) in elderly patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and to determine the predictive value of LVGLS on survival.
METHODS: We included 411 patients with symptomatic severe AS treated with TAVR during a 5-year period, where a baseline echocardiography including LVGLS assessment was available.
RESULTS: Mean age was 80.1 ± 7.1 years and aortic valve area (AVA) index 0.4 ± 0.1 cm2. 78 patients died during a median follow-up of 762 days. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 50 ± 13% and mean LVGLS was - 14.0%. LVEF was preserved in 60% of patients, while impaired LVGLS &gt; - 18% was seen in 75% of the patients. Previous myocardial infarction, LVEF &lt; 50%, LVGLS &gt; - 14%, low gradient AS (&lt; 4.0 m/s), tricuspid regurgitant gradient &gt; 30 mmHg were identified as significant univariate predictors of all-cause mortality. On multivariate analysis LVGLS &gt; - 14% (HR 1.79 [1.02-3.14], p = 0.04) was identified as the only independent variable associated with all-cause mortality. Reduced survival was observed with an impaired LVGLS &gt; - 14% in the total population (p &lt; 0.002) but also in patients with high AS gradient with preserved LVEF. LVGLS provided incremental prognostic value with respect to clinical characteristics, AVA and LVEF (χ2 19.9, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic AS undergoing TAVR, impaired LVGLS was highly prevalent despite preserved LVEF. LVGLS > - 14% was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, and survival was reduced if LVGLS > - 14%.
