Title: Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Transthyretin (TTR) cardiac amyloidosis is a severe, progressive, infiltrative disease caused by the deposition of TTR at cardiac level. It may be due to a genetic alteration in its hereditary form (ATTRv) or as a consequence of an age-related degenerative process (ATTRwt). Thanks to advances in imaging techniques and the possibility of achieving a non-invasive diagnosis, we now know that ATTR is more frequent than traditionally considered and that it is particularly relevant in patients over 65 years with heart failure or with aortic stenosis. With the appearance of several treatment options capable of modifying the natural history of ATTR, it is necessary for clinicians to be familiar with the diagnostic process and treatment of this disease. This review will cover the clinical spectrum of presentation of ATTR, its diagnosis and treatment.
