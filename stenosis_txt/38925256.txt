Title: Calcified coronary lesions: Imaging, prognosis, preparation and treatment state of the art review.

Abstract: Calcific coronary artery stenosis is a complex disease associated with adverse outcomes and suboptimal percutaneous treatment. Calcium plaque modification has emerged as a key strategy to tackle the issues that accompany calcific stenosis - namely reduced device deliverability, unpredictable lesion characteristics, and difficult dilatation. Atherectomy has traditionally been the treatment modality of choice for heavily calcified coronary stenoses. Contemporary technologies have emerged to aid with planning, preparation, and treatment of calcified coronary stenosis in an attempt to improve procedural success and long-term outcomes. In this State Of The Art Review, we synthesize the body of data surrounding the diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of calcific coronary disease, with a focus on i) intravascular imaging, ii) calcific lesion preparation, iii) treatment modalities including atherectomy, and iv) updated treatment algorithms for the management of calcified coronary stenosis.
