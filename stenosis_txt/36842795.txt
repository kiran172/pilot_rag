Title: Williams Syndrome: Supravalvar Aortic, Aortic Arch, Coronary and Pulmonary Arteries: Is Comprehensive Repair Advisable and Achievable?

Abstract: Williams syndrome, and various elastin protein mediated arteriopathies, presents a clinical challenge to pediatric cardiovascular specialists. In the severest phenotypes, multilevel obstruction to the systemic and pulmonic arterial systems result in biventricular dysfunction which can be imminently life-threatening. As a longstanding, quaternary referral center for complex pulmonary arteriopathies and pediatric connective tissue disease, Stanford Medicine Children's Health has developed a sizeable experience managing these patients. This manuscript is a summary of our current strategies, with a focus on our surgical techniques, peri-procedural considerations on timing and staging of various interventions, and long-term results.
