Title: Critical carotid artery stenosis involving a persistent primitive hypoglossal artery.

Abstract: Persistent primitive hypoglossal artery (PPHA) is a rare internal carotid-vertebrobasilar anatomic variant. Awareness of this anomaly and its propensity for atherosclerotic disease is important to avoid misinterpretation of diagnostic studies and to allow appropriate interventional planning. As the predominant vascular supply to the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation, its luminal compromise can lead to devastating ischemic complications. Carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting have both been performed to treat lesions involving a PPHA. Herein, we report a case of carotid endarterectomy involving a PPHA and discuss the clinical and surgical implications of a carotid lesion in the presence of a PPHA.
