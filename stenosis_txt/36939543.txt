Title: Revision Endoscopic Posterior Costal Cartilage Grafting: Is It Feasible?

Abstract: The objective of this work is to examine the feasibility of revision endoscopic posterior costal cartilage graft (EPCCG) placement for posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) and bilateral vocal fold immobility (BVFI). Revision and primary cases were compared with respect to decannulation rates, and it was hypothesized that there would be no difference in outcomes. Twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria (14 primary, 7 revision). Thirteen (62%) had a primary indication of PGS, and 8 (42%) were for BVFI. There were no differences between revision and primary groups with respect to age, gender, or comorbidities (p > .05). There was no difference between groups with respect to decannulation rate (85% primary vs 100% revision, p = .32). Thus, revision EPCCG appears to have comparable results to primary EPCCG with respect to decannulation rate and time to decannulation. EPCCG may be a feasible alternative to open airway reconstruction for PGS and BVFI in selected patients.
