Title: Symptomatic bifid insertion of the Flexor Carpi Radialis Brevis.

Abstract: A 35 year-old right-handed female presented with persistent wrist pain lasting two years. Imaging disclosed an accessory tendon-shaped structure, identified as a Flexor Carpi Radialis Brevis, strangling the Flexor Carpi Radialis tendon at the wrist during effort. Surgical exploration found the insertion of the Flexor Carpi Radialis Brevis to be bifid. Resection of the stenosing branch and the fibrotic tendon sheath restored strength in the right wrist and painless symmetrical motion compared to the left wrist ten weeks postoperatively.
