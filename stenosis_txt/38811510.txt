Title: Relapsing sclerosing mesenteritis with multiple strictures of the small intestine.

Abstract: Sclerosing mesenteritis (SM) is a rare disorder that involves the mesenteric adipose tissue with chronic fibrosing inflammation. Few reports mention the natural history of severe SM cases. Here, we report a severe and relapsing SM case in which a long-term natural history could be followed. The patient had undergone surgery for small bowel stenosis of unknown cause 10 years earlier. He had stopped visiting the hospital at his discretion. He was admitted to the hospital 10 years later due to recurrent symptoms, and a close examination revealed multiple small intestinal strictures; thus, surgery was performed again. The pathological results revealed that the patient had SM, corticosteroid administration dramatically improved his symptoms, and he has maintained remission for a long time.
