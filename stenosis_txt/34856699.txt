Title: [Clinical application of sacral alar screw fixation in surgical treatment of lumbosacral degenerative disease].

Abstract: Objective: To verify the safety and feasibility of sacral alar screw fixation and fusion surgery in lumbosacral area. Methods: The clinical and radiological data of patients receiving L<sub>5</sub>/S<sub>1</sub> single-level cortical bone trajectory screw combined with sacral alar screw decompression fixation and fusion in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital due to lumbar spinal stenosis from January 2019 to January 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical data included operation duration, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, pain and function scores during follow-up. The radiological data included preoperative and postoperative follow-up X-rays and three-dimensional reconstruction of lumbar spine CT. The fusion status and complication of internal fixation, such as screw loosening and fixation failure were evaluated by the radiological examination. Results: According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 16 patients (7 males and 9 females) were included, with an average age of (69.6±5.2) years. The patients were followed-up for (16.2±1.7) months. The average operation duration was (144±21) min, the intraoperative blood loss was (103±20) ml, and the postoperative drainage was (80±34) ml. The patient's low back pain visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 6.8±1.0 before surgery, and it was improved to 0.9±0.7 at the last follow-up; leg pain VAS score was 6.1±0.9 before the operation and it improved to 0.9±0.7 at the last follow-up; Oswestry disability index (ODI) function score was 66.2%±8.0% before the surgery and it decreased to 26.6%±7.2% at the last follow-up. No neurological complications, surgical site infection, screw loosening, internal fixation failure or cage displacement were observed during the follow-up. The fusion rate was 68.8% (11/16) at 6 months post operation. Conclusion: It is safe, feasible and effective to apply cortical screws combined with sacral alar screws in short-segment decompression, fixation and fusion surgery on the lumbosacral region to treat lumbosacral spinal stenosis.
