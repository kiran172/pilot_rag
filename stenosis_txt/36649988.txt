Title: [Correlation between unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis and asymmetric distribution of enlarged perivascular spaces in patients with acute cerebral infarction].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the correlation between unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and asymmetrical distribution of enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) in patients with acute cerebral infarction. Methods: Acute cerebral infarction patients with unilateral ICA stenosis hospitalized in Changzhou Second People's Hospital from October 2020 to December 2021 were collected. Routine cranial MRI and CT angiography were completed for each patient. The 3D Slicer software was used to quantitatively analyze the volume of patient's EPVS. Patients were divided into moderate stenosis group and severe stenosis/occlusion group according to the degree of ICA stenosis. Baseline data were compared between the two groups. Patients were further divided into three groups: moderate stenosis, severe stenosis and occlusion groups, and the ipsilateral and contralateral EPVS volume of ICA stenosis patients was compared. The asymmetry index (AI) was calculated for EPVS in the basal ganglia region (BG-EPVS) and EPVS in the centrum semiovale (CSO-EPVS). Patients with AI≥0.2 were included in the EPVS asymmetry group, while the rest were in the EPVS symmetry group, and the degree of unilateral ICA stenosis was compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between ICA severe stenosis/occlusion and the asymmetric distribution of BG-EPVS. Results: A total of 122 patients (96 males and 26 females) were enrolled, aged (70±10) years, with 81 cases in the unilateral ICA severe stenosis/occlusion group (46 cases of severe stenosis and 35 of occlusion) and 41 cases in the moderate stenosis group. Patients in the unilateral ICA severe stenosis/occlusion group had greater BG-EPVS volume [(4.08±0.76) mm3]and proportion of asymmetric distribution of BG-EPVS [75.3%(61/81)] than those of the moderate stenosis group [(3.12±0.85) mm3 and 39.0% (16/41)], with statistically significant differences (both P&lt;0.001). The BG-EPVS volumes of the ipsilateral side of the stenosis in the severe stenosis group and the occlusion group [(3.34±0.86) mm3 and (3.93±0.60) mm3] were significantly greater than those of the contralateral side [(2.65±1.28) mm3 and (3.21±0.88) mm3], with statistically significant differences (both P&lt;0.001). Correlation analysis indicated that the degree of unilateral ICA stenosis was positively correlated with the BG-EPVS volume on the stenosis side (r=0.62, P&lt;0.001). Further comparison of the degree of unilateral ICA stenosis between the EPVS symmetric and asymmetric groups showed that the proportion of unilateral ICA severe stenosis/occlusion in the BG-EPVS asymmetry group was higher than that in the symmetric group [79.2%(61/77) vs 44.4%(20/45),P&lt;0.001]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that unilateral ICA severe stenosis/occlusion (OR=4.280, 95%CI: 1.743-10.508, P =0.002) and age (OR=1.055, 95%CI: 1.001-1.112, P=0.044) were risk factors for asymmetric distribution of BG-EPVS. Conclusions: The severe stenosis/occlusion of the unilateral ICA and age are the risk factors for the asymmetric distribution of the BG-EPVS in patients with acute cerebral infarction. The ipsilateral EPVS volume of unilateral ICA stenosis is larger than that of the contralateral side, and the degree of ICA stenosis is positively correlated with the severity of BG-EPVS.
