Title: The clinical utility of FFR<sub>CT</sub> stratified by age.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: CT coronary angiography (CTA) with Fractional Flow Reserve as determined by CT (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) is a safe alternative to invasive coronary angiography. A negative FFR<sub>CT</sub> has been shown to have low cardiac event rates compared to those with a positive FFR<sub>CT</sub>. However, the clinical utility of FFR<sub>CT</sub> according to age is not known.
METHODS: Patients' in the ADVANCE (Assessing Diagnostic Value of Non-invasive FFRCT in Coronary Care) registry, were stratified into those ≥65 or &lt;65 years of age. The impact of FFR<sub>CT</sub> on clinical decision-making, as assessed by patient age, was determined by evaluating patient management using CTA results alone, followed by site investigators submitting a report on the treatment plan based upon the newly provided FFR<sub>CT</sub> data. Outcomes at 1-year post CTA were assessed, including major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality or unplanned hospitalization for ACS leading to revascularisation) and total revascularisation. Positive FFR<sub>CT</sub> was deemed to be ​≤ ​0.8.
RESULTS: FFR<sub>CT</sub> was calculated in 1849 (40.6%) subjects aged &lt;65 and 2704 (59.4%) ​≥ ​65 years of age. Subjects ≥65 years were more likely to have anatomic obstructive disease on CTA (≥50% stenosis), compared to those aged &lt;65 (69.7% and 73.2% respectively, p ​= ​0.008). There was a similar graded increase in recommended and actual revascularisation with either CABG or PCI, with declining FFR<sub>CT</sub> strata for subjects above and below the age of 65. MACE and revascularisation rates were not significantly different for those ​≥ ​or &lt;65, regardless of FFR<sub>CT</sub> positivity or stenosis severity &lt;50% or ≥50%. With a negative FFR<sub>CT</sub> result, and anatomical stenosis ≥50%, those ​≥ ​and &lt;65 years of age, had similar rates of MACE (0.2% for both, p ​= ​0.1) and revascularisation (8.7% and 10.4% respectively p ​= ​0.4). Logistic regression analysis, with age as a continuous variable, and adjustment for Diamond Forrester Risk, baseline FFR<sub>CT</sub> and treatment (CABG, PCI, medical therapy), indicated a statistically significant, but small increase in the odds of a MACE event with increasing age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.006-1.08, p ​= ​0.02). Amongst patients with a FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80, there was no effect of age on the odds of revascularisation.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study point to a low risk of MACE events or need for revascularisation in those aged ​≥ ​or &lt;65 with a FFR<sub>CT</sub>&gt;0.80, despite the higher incidence of anatomic obstructive CAD in those ≥65 years. The findings show the clinical usefulness and outcomes of FFR<sub>CT</sub> are largely constant regardless of age.
