Title: Chronic Abdominal Pain, an Overlooked Diagnosis of Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome (MALS).

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare condition that is often overlooked as a result of its nonspecific symptoms. It is usually presented with nausea, bloating, abdominal postprandial pain, and weight loss. The diagnosis of MALS is usually delayed and made by excluding other causes for the symptoms. The diagnosis of this syndrome is based on clinical presentation and radiological findings on computer tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Surgery is treatment of choice, with promising results from laparoscopic surgery.
