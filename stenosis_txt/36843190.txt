Title: Hepaticojejunostomy for bile duct injury: state of the art.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) is the goldÂ standard procedure for the reconstruction of the bile duct in many benign and malignant situations. One of the major situation is the bile duct injury (BDI) after cholecystectomy, either for early or late repair. This procedure presents some specificities associated to a debated management of BDI.
PURPOSE: This article provides a state-of-the-art of the hepaticojejunostomy procedure focusing on bile duct injury including its indications and outcomes CONCLUSION: Performed at the right moment and respecting the technical rules, HJ provides a restoration of the biliary patency in the long term of 80 to 90%. It is the main surgical technique to repair BDI. Complications and failure of this procedure can be difficult to manage. That is why the primary repair requires an appropriate multidisciplinary approach associated with an expert high quality surgical technique.
