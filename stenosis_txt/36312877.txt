Title: Oblivion: autopsy findings of a 31-year-old man with sudden cardiac arrest, a case report of a sequalae of Kawasaki disease.

Abstract: A 31-year-old man presented to the hospital after suffering a sudden cardiac arrest. Despite optimal therapy, the patient passed away. His medical history included febrile rash at age 2. At autopsy, there was aneurysmal dilation and severe coronary artery stenosis by atherosclerotic plaques and myocardial fibrosis. These findings were presumed to be due to complications of Kawasaki disease, given the remote history of severe febrile rash as a toddler and the presence of chronic coronary artery injury, recanalization, and thrombosis with ischemic heart disease leading to sudden cardiac collapse and death.
