Title: Progress in moyamoya disease.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and their proximal branches, resulting in ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with high rate of disability and even death. So far, available treatment strategies are quite limited, and novel intervention method is being explored. This review encapsulates current advances of moyamoya disease on the aspects of epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, imaging diagnosis and treatment. In addition, we also bring forward our conjecture, which needs to be testified by future research.
