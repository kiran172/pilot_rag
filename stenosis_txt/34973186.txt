Title: Endoscopic Surgery Using Ultrasonic Energy Device for Tracheal Metastatic Tumor.

Abstract: We describe a rare case of tracheal metastasis from endometrial carcinoma obstructing the central airway. A 57-year-old woman who underwent previous surgery for endometrial serous adenocarcinoma presented with severe tracheal stenosis caused by a stalked tracheal tumor. Urgent debulking surgery was performed under rigid bronchoscopy. The tumor stem was dissected using ultrasonically activated device blades. Rigid bronchoscopy combined with an ultrasonically activated device is an effective option for relieving tracheal stenosis and resecting the intratracheal tumor.
