Title: Robotic Cardiac Surgery.

Abstract: Robotic minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass is the most common robotic coronary procedure performed worldwide. It can be used to treat isolated left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis or can be coupled with percutaneous coronary intervention to diseased non-LAD targets in patients with multivessel disease. Virtually all types of mitral valve repair can be performed using the robot; valve replacement can also be undertaken. The robot can be used to repair atrial septal defects and resect cardiac myxoma. Increased cost of the robotic procedure may be offset by fewer perioperative complications, shorter hospital stay, and faster postoperative recovery.
