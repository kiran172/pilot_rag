Title: Can prenatal diagnosis of parachute mitral valve be achieved? A case report of fetal parachute mitral valve.

Abstract: Parachute mitral valve (PMV) is a common form of congenital mitral stenosis and is difficult to diagnose prenatally. This report describes a fetal case of PMV with coarctation of the aorta that was diagnosed at 25â€‰weeks' gestation by echocardiography and confirmed at autopsy. We describe the ultrasonographic features in this case and present a useful sign for making a prenatal diagnosis of PMV.
