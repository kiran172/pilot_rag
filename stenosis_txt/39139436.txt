Title: Age and Vasodilator Response to Different Hyperemic Agents: Adenosine versus Contrast Medium.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Age-related remodelling has the potential to affect the microvascular response to hyperemic stimuli. However, its precise effects on the vasodilatory response to adenosine and contrast medium, as well as its influence on fractional flow reserve (FFR) and contrast fractional flow reserve (cFFR), have not been previously investigated. We investigate the impact of age on these indices.
METHODS: We extrapolated data from the post-revascularization optimization and physiological evaluation of intermediate lesions using fractional flow reserve (PROPHET-FFR) and The Multi-center Evaluation of the Accuracy of the Contrast MEdium INduced Pd/Pa RaTiO in Predicting (MEMENTO) studies. Only lesions with a relevant vasodilatory response to adenosine and contrast medium were considered of interest. A total of 2080 patients, accounting for 2294 pressure recordings were available for analysis. The cohort was stratified into three age terciles. Age-dependent correlations with FFR, cFFR, distal pressure/aortic pressure (Pd/Pa) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) were calculated. The vasodilatory response was calculated in 1619 lesions (with both FFR and cFFR) as the difference between resting and hyperaemic pressure ratios and correlated with aging. The prevalence of FFR-cFFR discordance was assessed.
RESULTS: Age correlated positively to FFR (r = 0.062, p = 0.006), but not with cFFR (r = 0.024, p = 0.298), Pd/Pa (r = -0.015, p = 0.481) and iFR (r = -0.026, p = 0.648). The hyperemic response to adenosine (r = -0.102, p â‰¤ 0.0001) and to contrast medium (r = -0.076, p = 0.0023) showed a negative correlation with age. When adjusted for potential confounders, adenosine induced hyperaemia was negatively associated with age (p = 0.04 vs p = 0.08 for cFFR). Discordance decreased across age terciles (14.64% vs 12.72% vs 10.12%, p = 0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: As compared to adenosine, contrast induced hyperaemia appeared to be less affected by age. cFFR may be considered a more stable and reproducible tool to assess epicardial stenosis in elderly patients.
