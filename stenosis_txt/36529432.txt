Title: Effect of Stent Porosity, Platelet Function Test Usage, and Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Duration on Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes After Stenting for Cerebral Aneurysms: A Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The use of stents with various porosities for treating cerebral aneurysms requires dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) without clear guidelines on the utility of platelet function tests (PFTs) and the duration of DAPT. We sought to determine the effects of stent porosity, PFT usage, and DAPT duration on the radiographic and clinical outcomes after stenting of cerebral aneurysms.
METHODS: PubMed was searched on March 29, 2021 for studies of cerebral aneurysm stenting that had specified the stent type and DAPT duration. A random effects meta-analysis was used to measure the prevalence of nonprocedural thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, clinical outcomes, aneurysm occlusion, and in-stent stenosis stratified by stent porosity, PFT usage, and DAPT duration.
RESULTS: The review yielded 105 studies (89 retrospective and 16 prospective) with 117 stenting cohorts (50 high porosity, 17 intermediate porosity, and 50 low porosity). In the high-, intermediate-, and low-porosity stenting cohorts, PFT usage was 26.0%, 47.1%, and 62.0% and the mean DAPT duration was 3.51 ± 2.33, 3.97 ± 1.92, and 5.18 ± 2.27 months, respectively. The intermediate-porosity stents showed a reduced incidence of hemorrhagic events (π = 0.32%) compared with low-porosity stents (π = 1.36%; P = 0.01) and improved aneurysm occlusion (π = 6.18%) compared with high-porosity stents (π = 14.42%; P = 0.001) and low-porosity stents (π = 11.71%; P = 0.04). The prevalence of in-stent stenosis was lower for the intermediate-porosity (π = 0.57%) and high-porosity (π = 1.51%) stents than for the low-porosity stents (π = 3.30%; P < 0.05). PFT use had resulted in fewer poor clinical outcomes (π = 3.54%) compared with those without PFT use (π = 5.94%; P = 0.04). The DAPT duration had no effect on the outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present meta-analysis, which had selected for studies of cerebral aneurysm stenting that had reported the DAPT duration, intermediate-porosity stents and PFT use had resulted significantly improved outcomes. No effect of DAPT duration could be detected.
