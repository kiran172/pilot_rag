Title: Single running suture technique is associated with low rate of bronchial complications after lung transplantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation has evolved to a routinely performed surgical procedure in patients with end-stage pulmonary disease. Bronchial healing problems are rare but represent a potential life-threatening complication. Herein, we aimed to define the incidence, classification, and treatment of bronchial complications after lung transplantation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients receiving lung transplantation between January 1999 and December 2017 were included in this retrospective study. All bronchial anastomoses were performed in a standardized technique using a single, polydioxanone running suture. The rate of anastomotic complications requiring an intervention, type of complication according the 2018 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation classification, and the clinical management were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 2941 anastomoses were performed in 1555 patients. The overall incidence of relevant anastomotic complications was 1.56%, 0.68% for left anastomoses, and 2.44% for right anastomoses. In 6 patients, a surgical revision or retransplantation was performed, whereas endoscopic treatment alone was sufficient in 39 patients. One patient underwent right-sided retransplantation 6 months after the first lung transplantation after failed endoscopic treatment attempts. International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade "S Lc Ec" was the most common type of anastomotic complication. The overall incidence decreased within the study period from 2.4% in the era 1999 to 2003 to 0.8% in the era 2014 to 2017. We found no significant difference in overall survival of patients with and without anastomotic complications (P = .995; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.58).
CONCLUSIONS: The single running suture technique is associated with a very low rate of true anastomotic complications. Close follow-up and early endoscopic treatment of patients with anastomotic complications result in excellent long-term outcomes.
