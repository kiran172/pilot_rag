Title: Imaging of anorectal malformations: where are we now? Abdominal imaging task force of the European Society of Paediatric Radiology.

Abstract: Anorectal and cloacal malformations are a broad mix of congenital abnormalities related to the distal rectum and anus. Confusion exists between all the forms in this large and heterogeneous group. The spectrum includes everything from anal stenosis, ventral anus, anal atresia (with and without fistula) and the full spectrum of cloacal malformations. Imaging in these conditions is done through the whole armamentarium of radiologic modalities, with very different imaging strategies seen across the centres where these conditions are managed. In 2017, the European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) abdominal imaging task force issued recommendations on the imaging algorithm and standards for imaging anorectal malformations. This was followed by further letters and clarifications together with an active multispecialty session on the different imaging modalities for anorectal malformations at the 2018 ESPR meeting in Berlin. Through this paper, the abdominal task force updates its guidelines and recommended imaging algorithm for anorectal malformations.
