Title: [Efficacy and safety of anti-tumor necrosis factor α monoclonal antibodies in 16 patients with severe/refractory vasculo Behcet's disease].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the efficacy and safety of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for severe/refractory vasculo-Behcet's disease (BD). Method: The clinical data of severe/refractory vasculo-BD patients treated with anti-TNFα mAbs were retrospectively analyzed. Response of anti TNFα mAbs was analyzed. The dosage changes of glucocorticoid, the level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) before and after treatment were recorded, as well as side effects. Result: Sixteen patients were enrolled. Arterial lesions were reported in 12 patients, including 9 with arterial aneurysm, 6 with arterial dilation, 2 with stenosis and 2 with occlusion. Seven patients presented venous thrombosis, including lower extremity veins (n=6), cerebral venous sinus (n=2) and inferior vena cava system (n=2). Two cases had both arterial and venous involvement. Before the application of TNFα mAbs, all 16 patients failed to response to prednisone or its equivalent dose of 40 (7.5-90) mg/d in combination with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, thalidomide or azathioprine for median 4 (0-156) months. After a mean duration of treatment for (17.1±6.5) months, 15 patients achieved complete remission and 1 patient achieved partial remission. Three patients received surgery without any postoperative complications. After using anti TNFα mAbs, the dosage of prednisone [5(0-12.5)mg/d vs. 40(7.5-90)mg/d, P&lt;0.01], ESR [(7.3±4.6) mm/1h vs. (33.5±26.7) mm/1h, P&lt;0.01] and hsCRP [1.9(0.2-11.4) mg/L vs. 24.3(0.4-113.9) mg/L, P&lt;0.01] were significantly decreased. Side effects were observed in 2 patients. One developed pulmonary infection 12 months after adalimumab with conventional treatment. Another patient had allergy to infliximab then switched to adalimumab. Conclusion: In combination with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, anti-TNF α mAbs are effective and well-tolerated in severe/refractory vasculo-BD, with a favorable steroid -sparing effect and rare postoperative complications.
