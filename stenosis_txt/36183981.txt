Title: Meeting Report from 2nd ICCBH-ERN BOND Spinal Complications in Children and Adults with Achondroplasia Workshop, Dublin, Ireland, 2nd July 2022.

Abstract: A pre-meeting workshop on spinal complications in children and adults with achondroplasia was held in Dublin, Ireland at the 10th International Conference on Children's Bone Health (ICCBH) 2-5 July 2022. The pathophysiology, natural history and medical/surgical management of thoraco-lumbar kyphosis and spinal stenosis remains poorly described in the literature. The structure of the workshop consisted of lectures, a debate and an interactive round table discussion. In total over 100 delegates affiliated to over 70 institutions from 20 countries were in attendance.
