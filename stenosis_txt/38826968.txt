Title: Pyloric Stenosis in a Patient with CEDNIK Syndrome.

Abstract: We present a rare neurocutaneous genetic disorder where patients develop a combination of cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma, commonly known as CEDNIK syndrome. It is an autosomal recessive inheritance involving the SNAP29 protein, mapped to the 22q11.2 gene. Phenotypic variation is seen with this disease, with clinical manifestation of developmental milestone delays ranging in severity. With only a handful of documented cases, available research, management of the syndrome, and prognosis are not well established. As CEDNIK syndrome has systemic implications, care coordination between specialists is essential in improving patient outcomes. Particularly important is preventing patients from meeting the criteria of failure to thrive, a commonly reported issue. In this case, we present a four-month-old male with a past medical history of pyloric stenosis status/post pyloromyotomy who has failure to thrive, gastroesophageal reflux disease, profound hypotonia, and delayed progression of developmental milestones. Additionally, the case isÂ complicated by idiopathic pyloric stenosis, further contributing to the patient's failure to thrive. We aim to discuss the pathophysiology of this syndrome, explore the timeline of disease progression, as well as compare our case to the current literature.
