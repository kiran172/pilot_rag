Title: Echocardiographic findings on aortic stenosis: an observational, prospective, and multi-center registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this aortic stenosis registry was to investigate the changes of routine echocardiographic indices and strain in patients with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis over a 6-month follow-up period.
METHODS: Our aortic stenosis registry is observational, prospective, multicenter registry of nine countries, with 197 patients with aortic valve area less than 1.5 cm2. The enrolment took place from January to August 2017. We excluded patients with uncontrolled atrial arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension or cardiomyopathies, as well as those with hemodynamically significant valvular disease other than aortic stenosis. We included patients who did not require intervention and who had a complete follow-up study.
RESULTS: In patients with preserved ejection fraction, left ventricular mass has significantly increased between baseline and follow-up studies (218 ± 34 grams vs 253 ± 29 grams, p = 0.02). However, when indexed to body surface area, there was no significant difference. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain significantly decreased (-19.7 ± -4.8 vs (-16.4 vs -3.8, p = 0.01). Left atrial volume was significantly higher at follow-up (p = 0.035). Right ventricular basal diameter and mid-cavity diameter were greater at the follow-up (p = 0.04 and p = 0.035, respectively). Patients with low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis had significantly lower global longitudinal strain (-12.3% ± -3.9% vs -19.7% ± -4.8%, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Left atrial dilatation is one of the first changes to take place in low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis patients even when left ventricular dimensions and function remains intact. Global longitudinal strain is an important determinant of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and right ventricular function is an important parameter of aortic stenosis assessment. Accordingly, our registry has further shed the light on these indices role as multisite follow-up of aortic stenosis.
