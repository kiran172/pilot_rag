Title: Paraspinal muscle characteristics on MRI in degenerative lumbar spine with normal bone density, osteopenia and osteoporosis: a case-control study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the difference of paraspinal muscles in patients with normal bone density, osteopenia and osteoporosis.
METHODS: Patients undergoing surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis were included. Thirty-eight patients with osteoporosis were matched to patients with osteopenia and patients with normal bone density in a 1:1 manner according to WHO criteria. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and lumbar CT were performed preoperatively to measure the BMD of lumbar, femur and hip and HU values of L1-L4 respectively. The relative total cross-sectional area (rTCSA) and fat infiltration (FI) of multifidus (MF) and erector spinae (ES), and the relative functional CSA (rFCSA) of psoas major (PS) were measured at L4-5 and L5-S level on preoperative MRI.
RESULTS: Osteoporotic patients showed lower BMI, higher MF FI and higher ES FI when compared with normal bone density group (25.57 ± 3.71 vs 27.46 ± 3.11; 0.38 ± 0.1 vs 0.32 ± 0.08; 0.33 ± 0.1 vs 0.28 ± 0.08; all adjusted p < 0.05). Both the MF FI and ES FI were significantly correlated with lumbar T-score (r = - 0.223, p < 0.05; r = - 0.208, p < 0.05) and the averaged lumbar HU value (r = - 0.305, p < 0.01; r = - 0.239, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis and paraspinal muscle degeneration might interact with each other and coexist in patients with degenerative lumbar diseases. It is recommended that the paraspinal muscle degeneration should be considered simultaneously when finding a patient with low bone mass before surgery.
