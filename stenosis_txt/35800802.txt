Title: Ultra-Short-Term Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Treating Unruptured Brain Aneurysm With the Pipeline Flex-Shield Embolization Device.

Abstract: Ruptured cerebral aneurysms can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Endoluminal devices to treat aneurysms such as the Pipelineâ„¢ Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology (PFES) (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) integrate phosphorylcholine on the surface of the device in order to reduce platelet adherence that causes periprocedural thromboembolic events and subsequent long-term intrastent stenosis. In addition to the Shield Technology, patients are commonly placed on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for six months to reduce thromboembolic events and subsequent long-term intrastent stenosis. There is a strong positive correlation between the length of DAPT use and bleeding. Here, we present a case of a 66-year-old female with a right supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm treated with a PFES who was placed on dual antiplatelet therapy for the first 31 days postoperative and subsequently maintained on aspirin (ASA) 81 mg monotherapy. At two months, a follow-up diagnostic cerebral angiogram showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm with a patent stent. Our case sets the stage for further research into the optimal length of dual antiplatelet therapy required in PFES to prevent short and long-term thromboembolic events. This report indicates that it may be safe for patients with PFES to intermittently halt the use of DAPT to manage bleeding complications or perform surgery.
