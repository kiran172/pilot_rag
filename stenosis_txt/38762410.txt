Title: Diode laser hemorrhoidoplasty versus conventional Milligan-Morgan and Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy for symptomatic hemorrhoids: Meta-analysis.

Abstract: Conventional hemorrhoidectomy is the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic haemorrhoids, but reported postoperative complications remains the main concern. On the contrary, with its minimally invasive nature, laser hemorrhoidoplasty showed the potential to reduce postoperative complications and discomfort. Therefore, we performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the postoperative outcome of laser hemorrhoidoplasty compared to conventional hemorrhoidectomies, including Milligan-Morgan and Ferguson techniques. Of all studies from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, we included 17 trials with 1196 patients, of whom 596 (49.8 %) underwent laser hemorrhoidoplasty and 600 (50.2 %) underwent conventional hemorrhoidectomy. The primary outcomes were operative blood loss and postoperative haemorrhage, and the secondary outcomes were the operative time, postoperative pain score, complications, and haemorrhoid recurrence. In this study, we found that laser hemorrhoidoplasty showed benefits in operative blood loss (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -16.43 ml, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: -23.82 to -9.04), postoperative hemorrhage/bleeding (odds ratio [OR]: 0.16, 95 % CI: 0.10 to 0.28), operative time (WMD: -12.42 min, 95 % CI: -14.56 to -10.28), postoperative pain score on day 1 (WMD: -2.50, 95 % CI: -3.13 to -1.88), and anal stenosis (OR: 0.14, 95 % CI: 0.03 to 0.65) in comparison with conventional hemorrhoidectomy. However, incidence of fecal/flatus incontinence, urinary retention and hemorrhoid recurrence were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Consistent results were found in 5 subgroup analyses, including studies with low risk of bias, studies using 1470 nm laser, and studies using 980 nm laser, studies conducted in Asia, and studies conducted in Europe and America.
