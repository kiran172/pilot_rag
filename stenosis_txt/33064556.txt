Title: Acute effects of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on the ventricular-aortic interaction.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is increasingly used to treat severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients. However, little is known regarding the direct effect of TAVR on the ventricular-aortic interaction. In the present study, we aimed to investigate changes in central hemodynamics after successful TAVR. We retrospectively examined 33 cases of severe AS patients (84 ± 6 yr) who underwent TAVR. Invasive measurements of left ventricular and aortic pressures as well as echocardiographic aortic flow were acquired before and after TAVR (maximum within 5 days). We examined alterations in key features of central pressure and flow waveforms, including the aortic augmentation index (AIx), and performed wave separation analysis. Arterial parameters were determined via parameter-fitting on a two-element Windkessel model. Resolution of AS resulted in direct increase in the aortic systolic pressure and maximal aortic flow (131 ± 22 vs. 157 ± 25 mmHg and 237 ± 49 vs. 302 ± 69 mL/s, P &lt; 0.001 for all), whereas the ejection duration decreased (P &lt; 0.001). We noted a significant decrease in the AIx (from 42 ± 12 to 19 ± 11%, P &lt; 0.001). Of note, the arterial properties remained unchanged. There was a comparable increase in both forward (61 ± 20 vs. 77 ± 20 mmHg, P &lt; 0.001) and backward (35 ± 14 vs. 42 ± 10 mmHg, P = 0.013) pressure wave amplitudes, while their ratio, i.e., the reflection coefficient, was preserved. Our results highlight the impact of TAVR on the ventricular-aortic interaction by affecting the amplitude, shape, and related attributes of the aortic pressure and flow pulse and challenge the interpretation of AIx as a solely vascular measure in AS patients.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is linked with an immediate increase in aortic systolic blood pressure and maximal flow, as well as steeper aortic pressure and flow wave upstrokes. After TAVR, the forward wave pumped by the heart is enhanced. Although the arterial properties remain unchanged, the central augmentation index (AIx) is markedly decreased after TAVR. This challenges the interpretation of AIx as a solely vascular measure in patients with aortic valve stenosis.
