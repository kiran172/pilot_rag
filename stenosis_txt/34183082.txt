Title: Melody valve insertion for relief of "Tricuspid" stenosis in an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect.

Abstract: A Melody valve was successfully placed across a very stenotic right-sided component of a common atrioventricular valve because of ongoing troublesome arrhythmias in a young woman with an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect, a very dilated right atrium and a hypoplastic right ventricle. Four years later, she remains well.
