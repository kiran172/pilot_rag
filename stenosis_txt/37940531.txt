Title: Lipoprotein (a) is a risk factor of aortic valve calcification in patients with a risk of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Aortic valve calcification (AVC), which causes aortic stenosis (AS), is more common in elderly persons. Controlling for conventional risk variables did not, however, reduce the incidence of AS. Thus, residual risk factors of AS should be identified. We enrolled 513 patients who underwent coronary angiography with computed tomography because of suspicion of coronary artery disease (CAD) or ruling out of CAD before aortic valve replacement. Calcium volume was calculated with a commercially available application. Conventional and lipid-related risk factors including serum levels of Lp(a) were evaluated for all patients. Calcium volume and Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement than in those who did not. A single regression analysis showed that the calcium volume was positively associated with age and the Lp(a) levels and negatively associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate. No statistical significance was observed for other risk factors, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein, omega-3 fatty acids levels. The multiple regression analysis revealed that age (P<0.001), female sex (P<0.05), Lp(a) (P<0.01), and hemoglobin A1c (P<0.01) were determinants of the calcium volume. The area under the curve in receiver operating characteristic analysis of Lp(a) for implementation of AVR was 0.65 at an Lp(a) cut-off level of 16 mg/dL. In conclusion, the serum Lp(a) level is a potent risk factor of AVC in patients with high risk of atherosclerosis. J. Med. Invest. 70 : 450-456, August, 2023.
