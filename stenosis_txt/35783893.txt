Title: Comparison Between Intravenous and Intramuscular Octreotide in the Management of Heyde's Syndrome.

Abstract: Heyde's syndrome is defined as a triad of aortic stenosis, anemia due to angiodysplasia-related bleeding, and von Willebrand syndrome type 2A. It is a rare disease and a diagnostic challenge. Treatment modalities include symptomatic management, blood transfusions, aortic valve replacement, and medications such as octreotide. Here, we report the case of a patient who was resistant to symptomatic management, aortic valve replacement, as well as intravenous octreotide.
