Title: Endovascular Treatment of a Migrated Superior Vena Cava Stent in the Right Atrium.

Abstract: A 42-year-old female with end-stage chronic kidney disease, who was on maintenance hemodialysis for the last 3 years, presented with facial and upper-limb swelling of 2-month duration. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed significant stenosis of the superior vena cava (SVC). Following discussion in a multidisciplinary meeting, it was proposed to perform a repeat endovascular intervention to relieve the SVC obstruction and manage the migrated stent.
