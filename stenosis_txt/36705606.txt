Title: Neurovascular Outcomes in Relation With Carotid Artery Stenosis in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Data regarding the prevalence of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are scarce. Whether CAS, especially severe or bilateral, is a predictor of worse prognosis after TAVI is unknown. We aimed to address these questions.
METHODS: We included all patients who underwent TAVI between 2018 and 2021. Using pre-TAVI carotid Doppler ultrasound, atherosclerosis of the right and left carotid internal arteries was assessed. CAS was defined as moderate (50%-69% stenosis, peak systolic velocity of 125-230 cm/sec) or severe (≥70% stenosis, peak systolic velocity of >230 cm/sec). When both carotid arteries presented with ≥50% stenosis, CAS was defined as bilateral. Endpoints included the 30-day incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), 30-day all-cause mortality, and periprocedural complications.
RESULTS: Among 448 patients, 56 (12.5%) had CAS, of which 15 had bilateral and 15 had severe CAS. Patients with CAS were more often men and had higher rates of peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, and previous percutaneous coronary intervention. There was no association between CAS and 30-day stroke or TIA (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-8.91; P=.14), even when considering severe CAS only. However, a significant association was found between bilateral CAS and 30-day stroke or TIA (aHR, 8.399; 95% CI, 1.603-44.000; P=.01). No association between CAS and 30-day mortality or periprocedural complications was found.
CONCLUSIONS: CAS is common among TAVI patients. While CAS as a whole was not a predictor of neurovascular complications, the subgroup of bilateral CAS was associated with an increased risk of stroke.
