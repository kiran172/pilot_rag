Title: A case of vasospastic angina. Vasospasm physiopathology: a new therapeutic role for ranolazine?

Abstract: We report the case of a 40-year-old man, transferred from another hospital to our ICU because of acute coronary syndrome. Coronarography did not show coronary stenosis. Twenty-four hours monitoring EKG allowed diagnosis of Prinzmetal angina and appropriate therapy was administered. Six months after discharge due recurrence of symptoms, ranolazine was added to therapy. After one year the patient is symptoms free.
