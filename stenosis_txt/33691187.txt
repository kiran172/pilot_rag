Title: Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in the Elderly: It Is Worth It!

Abstract: To evaluate survival and quality of life of octogenarians after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), up to 10 year of follow-up. Retrospective observational study on octogenarians operated for an isolated or combined SAVR in 2 centers between 2005 and 2011. Preoperative data were collected for each patient and updated regularly with last follow-up on July 2018. Early postoperative course was assessed for all patients. The primary outcome was late survival after discharge. Health-related quality of life was evaluated in all surviving patients using the Short-Form 12 questionnaire. Nine hundred and nine patients were included. The median age was 82 ± 2.6 years, with 400/909 females (44%). Isolated AVR was performed in 452/909 patients (49.7%). Early in-hospital mortality occurred in 71/909 patients (7.8%). Mean follow-up was 5.9 ± 3.4 years. Survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in the overall cohort was 89%, 70%, and 28%, respectively, without significant difference between isolated or combined AVR. Survival was significantly higher in patients with a Euroscore <8% (P< 0.0001). Multivariate analysis found that older age at surgery, diabetes, history of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation and chronic renal failure were predictors of long-term mortality. Finally, the SF-12 physical score was 40.7 ± 10.4 and mental and emotional score was 52.7 ± 8.6 at last follow-up, which falls within the expected range for the general population (50 ± 10) with comparable age. SAVR remains an effective treatment for aortic valve disease in octogenarians, not only increasing life expectancy but also conferring a long-standing quality of life with excellent valve durability.
