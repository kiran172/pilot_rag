Title: Comparison of meatal-based flap (Mathieu) and tubularized incised-plate (TIP) urethroplasties for primary distal hypospadias: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We conducted this meta-analysis to compare postoperative outcomes between meatal-based flap (Mathieu) and tubularized incised plate (TIP) techniques for distal hypospadias.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PUBMED, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library was conducted. Outcomes evaluated in this review were fistula, meatal stenosis, wound dehiscence and flap necrosis. We calculated odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidential interval (CI) to compare postoperative outcomes between Mathieu and TIP after data extraction and literature identification. All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.2. In order to find potential affective factors, meta-regression and subgroup analyses were applied.
RESULTS: 16 studies, 1386 patients, including 762 patients receiving Mathieu and 624 individuals subjected to TIP met the inclusion criteria. The synthetic data suggested that Mathieu and TIP were comparable in terms of fistula (OR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.33; P = 0.70, I2 = 14%), wound dehiscence (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.33 to 2.39; P = 0.81, I2 = 11%), and flap necrosis (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 0.51 to 7.09; P = 0.20, I2 = 38%) without significant heterogeneity for each comparison group. Pooled estimates showed a significantly lower rate of meatal stenosis with Mathieu than with TIP (OR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.73; P = 0.002, I2 = 4%). Subgroup analyses showed that the difference between Mathieu and TIP was more obvious in the studies published before 2013 in meatal stenosis. The modified Mathieu technique and a running suture for urethroplasty might be relevant to a lower rate of meatal stenosis in the data, although no statistical significance in the present effects model overall was found. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the results were stable. There was no publication bias detected using both funnel plot and Egger's test.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that Mathieu and TIP technique were equivalent for primary distal hypospadias in terms of fistula, wound dehiscence, and flap necrosis. Pooled estimates indicated that there was a lower rate of meatal stenosis with Mathieu rather than with TIP significantly. The modified Mathieu technique and a running suture for urethroplasty might be relevant to a lower rate of meatal stenosis.
