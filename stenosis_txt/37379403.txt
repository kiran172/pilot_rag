Title: [Simultaneous surgery for upper gastrointestinal cancer and cardiovascular diseases].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the immediate and long-term results of simultaneous surgical treatment in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 9 patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and cardiovascular diseases who underwent simultaneous surgical treatment. We assessed safety and efficacy of this approach. Mean age of patients was 65.7Â±5.7 years. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed in 3 patients, aortic valve disease - 1 patient, abdominal aortic aneurysm - 2; 4 patients suffered from isolated mitral valve disease, stenosis of the left vertebral artery, internal and external carotid arteries and Leriche syndrome.
RESULTS: Considering immediate and long-term postoperative results, we can emphasize advisability of simultaneous surgeries in appropriate patients.
