Title: National Trends of Structural Heart Disease Interventions from 2016 to 2020 in the United States and the Associated Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic.

Abstract: The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic placed an enormous strain on the healthcare system. Data on the impact ofÂ COVID-19 on the utilization and outcomes of structural heart disease interventions in the United States are scarce. The National Inpatient Sample from 2016 to 2020 was queried to identify adult admissions for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), and transcatheter end-to-end repair (TEER). The primary outcome was temporal trends of procedure utilization rate per 100,000 admissions over quarters from 2016 to 2020. The secondary outcomes were adjusted rates of in-hospital mortality, major complications, and length of stay (LOS). Among 434,630 weighted admissions (TAVR: 305,550; LAAO: 89,300; TEER: 40,160), 95,010 admissions (22%) were during the COVID-19 era. There was a decline during the second quarter of 2020 followed by an increase to the pre pandemic levels (TAVR: 220 to 253, LAAO: 57 to 109, and TEER: 31 to 36 per 100,000 admissions, Ptrend<0.001). There were no differences in the mortality or major complication rates. Median LOS has decreased in TAVR (4 days-1 day) and in TEER (3 days-1 day) but remained stable in LAAO (1 day). This nationwide analysis showed that structural heart disease interventions decreased during the early waves of COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant reduction in hospital LOS without differences in in-hospital mortality or complication rates during the pandemic. These data suggest that hospitals adapted to the unprecedent challenges during the pandemic to provide advanced cardiac care to patients.
