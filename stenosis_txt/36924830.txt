Title: Characteristics and outcomes of the Spanish registry for pediatric patients with bicuspid aortic valve (REVAB).

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disorder is the most common congenital heart disease. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of 0- to 18-year olds with BAV in a population-based registry.
METHODS: Data from all pediatric patients were obtained from the Spanish registry for pediatric patients with bicuspid aortic valve (REVAB) (< 18 years). For data analysis, patients with BAV were divided into 2 groups by their features: isolated BAV and BAV with associated congenital heart disease.
RESULTS: We included 1681 patients from 33 hospitals. Males accounted for 69.6% (n = 1158). Valve morphology was horizontal in 63.4% (n = 1012) and pure (Sievers type 0) in 28.4% (n=469). Isolated BAV was present in 63.7% (n=1060), and concomitant left-sided obstructive lesions in 23.4% (n=390). Interventions were required in 8.6% (n=145).
CONCLUSION: These data represent the first large, population-based description of the clinical presentations and outcomes of patients enrolled in the Spanish registry for pediatric patients with bicuspid aortic valve.
