Title: Functional significance of intermediate coronary stenosis in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease: A comparison of dynamic SPECT coronary flow reserve with intracoronary pressure-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of coronary flow reserve (CFR) assessed by rest/stress myocardial perfusion imaging with dynamic single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with intracoronary pressure-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: Patients with suspected or known stable CAD who were referred for invasive coronary angiography were prospectively enrolled. Both invasive FFR and SPECT were performed in subjects with single-vessel intermediate coronary stenosis. A cutoff value of < 0.8 was used to define abnormal FFR.
RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were enrolled. The mean age of the subjects was 62.1 ± 6.7 years, and 79.4% were male. SPECT-derived CFR showed a significantly moderate correlation with FFR (r = 0.505, P = .003). The diagnostic performance for the identification of abnormal FFR in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 88.9%, 83.3%, and 87.9%, respectively, for CFR, with an optimized cutoff value of 1.73.
CONCLUSION: In patients with single-vessel CAD, SPECT CFR was useful for the detection of functionally significant stenosis. Our data support the use of this technique as an optional method for hemodynamic assessment, especially when FFR results are in normal range.
