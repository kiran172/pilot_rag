Title: Predictors of Adverse Prognosis in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome Caused by Plaque Erosion With a Nonstent Strategy.

Abstract: Background The EROSION (Effective Anti-Thrombotic Therapy Without Stenting: Intravascular Optical Coherence Tomography-Based Management in Plaque Erosion) study demonstrated that antithrombotic therapy without stenting was safe and feasible in selected patients with acute coronary syndrome caused by plaque erosion. However, the factors related to the prognosis of these patients are not clear. This study aimed to explore the predictors of an adverse prognosis of a nonstent strategy in a larger sample size. Methods and Results A total of 252 (55 patients were from the EROSION study) patients with acute coronary syndrome with plaque erosion who met the inclusion criteria of the EROSION study and completed clinical follow-up were enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which were defined as the composite of cardiac death, recurrent myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization, rehospitalization because of unstable or progressive angina, major bleeding, and stroke. Among 232 patients with acute coronary syndrome included in the final analysis, 50 patients (21.6%) developed MACE at a median follow-up of 2.9 years. Compared with patients without MACE, patients with MACE were older and had a higher degree of percentage of area stenosis (72.2%±9.4% versus 64.2%±15.7%, P&lt;0.001) and thrombus burden (24.4%±10.4% versus 20.4%±10.9%, P=0.010) at baseline. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that age, percentage of area stenosis, and thrombus burden were predictors of MACE. The best cutoff values of predictors were age ≥60 years, percentage of area stenosis ≥63.5%, and thrombus burden ≥18.5%, respectively, and when they were all present, the rate of MACE rose to 57.7%. Conclusions The nonstent treatment strategy of patients with acute coronary syndrome caused by plaque erosion was heterogeneous, and patients aged ≥60 years, percentage of area stenosis ≥63.5%, and thrombus burden ≥18.5% may predict a worse clinical outcome.
