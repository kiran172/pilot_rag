Title: Living in disadvantaged neighborhoods linked to less intervention for severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: To investigate the association between area deprivation index (ADI) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Patients aged 40-95 years with severe AS confirmed by echocardiography were included. The 9-digit zip code of patient residence address was used to identify the ADI ranking, based on which patients were divided into 5 groups (with Group E being most deprived). The rates of AV intervention were compared among 5 groups using competing risks analysis, with death as a competing event. We included 1751 patients with severe AS from 2013 to 2018 followed for a median 2.8 (interquartile range, 1.5-4.8) years. The more distressed ADI groups tended to be younger (P = 0.002), female (P < 0.001), and of African American race (P < 0.001), have higher presentation of sepsis (P = 0.031), arrhythmia (P = 0.022), less likely to have previous diagnosis of AS (P < 0.001); and were less likely to undergo AVR (52.5% vs 46.9% vs 46.1% vs 48.9% vs 39.7%, P = 0.023). Using competing risk analysis, the highest ADI group (E) were the least and the lowest ADI group (A) the most likely to undergo AVR (Gray's test, P = 0.025). The association between ADI ranking and AVR rates was influenced by sex and race. Within group analysis, there was significant association between race and AVR (Gray's test, P < 0.001), and between sex and AVR (Gray's test, P < 0.001). Patients with severe AS living in more deprived neighborhoods were less likely to undergo aortic valve interventions, which was influenced by female gender, and African American race.
