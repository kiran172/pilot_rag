Title: The Management of Perineal Trauma in Children.

Abstract: AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of perineal trauma in children and to a define protocol for their management.
METHODS: It is a retrospective study of children who presented with perineal injury between August 2012 and December 2020. The patients were classified into three groups: Group-1 included children with perineal and genitourinary injuries; Group-2 included patients with perineal and anorectal injuries; and Group-3 included patients with perineal, genitourinary, and anorectal injuries. All patients underwent primary repair. Those with full-thickness anorectal injury underwent an additional covering colostomy, while urethral disruption was initially managed by a diverting suprapubic cystostomy (SPC).
RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were studied. Impalement injury (n = 11; 27%) and sexual abuse (n = 11; 27%) were the most common mechanisms of injury. Twenty (49%) patients had anorectal injuries with 10 (24%) each of partial-thickness and full-thickness injury. There were 24 (59%) genital injuries and five (12%) urethral injuries. One patient each developed anal and vaginal stenosis, both were managed with dilatation. One patient developed a rectovaginal fistula repaired surgically at a later date.
CONCLUSION: Perineal injuries with resultant anorectal or genital damage require a careful primary survey. Following stabilization, an examination under anesthesia as a set protocol will help determine the treatment strategy. A colostomy is essential in the acute management of severe anorectal injuries to reduce local complications and preserve continence. Urethral injuries may warrant an initial diverting SPC in selected cases.
