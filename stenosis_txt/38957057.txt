Title: Aortic stenosis: Update in monitoring and management.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) remains one of the most commonly encountered valvular pathologies. Medical management does not alter the progression of the disease, making assessment of severity and timing of referral for valve replacement the most important aspects of caring for patients with AS.
OBJECTIVE: To review the contemporary management of AS, including signs and symptoms, echocardiography and decision making in management.
DISCUSSION: Severe symptomatic AS is frequently accompanied by dyspnoea, chest pain or syncope and a physical examination might reveal the presence of an ejection systolic murmur. Echocardiography is the first and most useful investigation to stratify risk and determine requirement for valve replacement by assessing valve gradients and left ventricular function. Surgical and transcatheter options now exist for treatment of AS and decision making is usually multidisciplinary and based on individual patient parameters.
