Title: Comparative Analysis of Cartilage Conduction Hearing Aid Users and Non-Users: An Investigative Study.

Abstract: Clinical findings on cartilage conduction hearing aids (CCHAs) have gradually become clear; however, few reports include a large number of cases. This study included 91 ears from 69 patients who underwent CCHA fitting in our hospital. Their ears were divided into six groups (i.e., bilateral aural atresia or severe canal stenosis, unilateral aural atresia or severe canal stenosis, chronic otitis media or chronic otitis externa with otorrhea, sensorineural hearing loss, mixed hearing loss, and conductive hearing loss) according to their clinical diagnosis and type of hearing loss. Most clinical diagnoses were aural atresia or meatal stenosis (bilateral, 21.8%; unilateral, 39.6%). The purchase rate of CCHAs was higher in the closed-ear group (bilateral, 77.3%; unilateral, 62.5%). In the bilateral closed-ear group, air conduction thresholds at 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz and aided thresholds with CCHAs at 4000 Hz were significantly lower in the purchase group than the non-purchase group. No significant difference was observed between the purchase and non-purchase groups in the unilateral closed-ear group. In the bilateral closed-ear group, air conduction thresholds and aided thresholds were associated with the purchase rate of CCHAs. In the unilateral closed-ear group, factors other than hearing might have affected the purchase rate of CCHAs.
