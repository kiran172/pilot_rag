Title: Outcomes of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and predictors of thirty-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and one-year mortality.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: TAVI is more frequently used to treat aortic stenosis with the mandate to have a low as possible rate of adverse events. We present our 30-day outcomes and one-year mortality and examine the factors associated with them.
METHODS: A prospective evaluation was performed of all patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI in Nicosia General Hospital from January 2015 until March 2020. MACE were defined as cardiac death, disabling stroke, and/or major vascular complications (VC). Multiple logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with 30-day MACE and one-year mortality, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 235 TAVI procedures were performed (178 balloon-expandable, 57 self-expandable). Thirty-day outcomes were MACE: 4.3%, cardiovascular death: 2.1%, disabling stroke: 1.3%, major VC: 1.7%, and contrast induced nephropathy (CIN): 4.3%. There was a rate of 6.2% new pacemaker implantations and 0.9% of more than mild aortic valve regurgitation (AR) at 30 days. Mortality at one year was 15.1%. The balloon-expandable valves appear to have less new pacemakers, less mild AR, lower contrast volume used, and less days of hospitalization, while the self-expandable valves have lower post-procedural gradients. Low hemoglobulin, history of atrial fibrillation (AF), and lower BMI were predictors of 30-day MACE. Serum creatinine >2 mg/dL, history of AF, RVSP >60 mmHg and major VC are predictors of one-year mortality.
CONCLUSION: We have shown excellent 30-day results with low incidence of adverse events for both the balloon-expandable and self-expandable valves. Clinical factors are the main predictors of both 30-day MACE and one-year mortality; major VC is a strong predictor of one-year mortality.
