Title: [Analysis of factors related to recanalization of intramural hematoma-type carotid artery dissection].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the factors related to recanalization of intramural hematoma-type carotid artery dissection (CAD). Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed on 56 patients (61 CADs) with intramural-hematoma type CAD confirmed by multimodal imaging examination based on cervical vascular ultrasound (CDU) in the Stroke Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University from August 2015 to May 2019. The clinical and imaging data were collected, and the time from onset to visit is bounded by 14 days. CDU follow-up was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after the onset. According to the results of the 12-month follow-up, patients were divided into complete recanalization group and incomplete recanalization group. The clinical data, ultrasonic manifestations and drug treatment of patients between the two groups were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the related factors affecting vascular recanalization. Results: Vascular recanalization: the rates of complete recanalization at 3, 6 and 12 months were 42.6% (26/61), 55.7% (34/61) and 59.0% (36/61), respectively. While among the 25 vessels in the incomplete recanalization group, 26.2% (16/61) showed residual stenosis and 14.8% (9/61) showed persistent occlusion. Comparison between the complete recanalization group and the incomplete recanalization group: the differences in the proportion of time from onset to visit ≤ 14 days, the echo type of intramural hematoma, and the proportion of vascular occlusion were statistically significant (all P&lt;0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the time from onset to visit ≤14 days (OR=5.625, 95%CI: 1.302-24.293, P=0.021), and the hypoechoic intramural hematoma (OR=4.888, 95%CI: 1.304-18.320, P=0.019) were positively correlated with complete recanalization, while the dissection vascular occlusion (OR=0.234, 95%CI: 0.059-0.932, P=0.039) was negatively correlated with complete recanalization. Conclusions: CDU showed that hypoechoic intramural hematoma-type CAD treated with standard medications in the acute phase had a higher complete recanalization rate, while the recanalization rate of patients with dissecting vessel occlusion decreased. Early evaluation can provide a basis for clinical individualized treatment.
