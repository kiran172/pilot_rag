Title: Factors Associated with Complications after Total Pharyngo-Laryngo-Esophagectomy and Free Jejunal Flap Reconstruction.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Free jejunal flap (FJF) reconstruction is a standard procedure for pharyngeal and cervical esophageal defects resulting from head and neck cancer resection. However, improvements in patients' quality of life after surgery require a further statistical approach.
METHODS: An observational, retrospective, multivariate analysis was designed to report the incidence of postoperative complications and their association with clinical factors in 101 patients who underwent total pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy and FJF reconstruction for head and neck cancer at a university hospital between January 2007 and December 2020.
RESULTS: Postoperative complications were observed in 69% of patients. In the reconstructive site, anastomotic leak, observed in 8% of patients was associated with vascular anastomosis in the external jugular vein system (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 9.05, p = 0.044) and anastomotic stricture, observed in 11% of patients was associated with postoperative radiotherapy (age-adjusted OR: 12.60, p = 0.02). Cervical skin flap necrosis was the most common complication (34%) and was associated with vascular anastomosis on the right cervical side (age- and sex-adjusted OR: 4.00, p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Although FJF reconstruction is a useful procedure, 69% of patients suffer a postoperative complication. We suppose that anastomotic leak is related to the low blood flow resistance of the FJF and inadequate drainage of the external jugular venous system, and anastomotic stricture is related to the vulnerability of the intestinal tissue to radiation. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the location of the vascular anastomosis may affect the mesenteric location of the FJF and the dead space in the neck, leading to the development of cervical skin flap necrosis. These data contribute to increasing our knowledge about postoperative complications related to FJF reconstruction.
