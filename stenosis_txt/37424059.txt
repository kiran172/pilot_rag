Title: Computerized nailfold video-capillaroscopy in type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional study on 102 outpatients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease that negatively affects vascular health. A careful assessment of chronic complications, including microcirculation, is mandatory. The computerized nailfold video-capillaroscopy (CNVC) accurately examines the nailfold microvasculature, but its suitability in T2D is currently under investigation.
AIMS: To describe nailfold microvasculature in T2D patients regarding the level of glucose control and chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study on 102 consecutive and unselected outpatients with T2D who had undergone CNVC examination. The examination was carried out by using an electronic video-capillaroscope with 300x magnification. Capillaroscopic appearance and capillary changes were described according to well-established parameters. Capillaroscopic parameters were compared between patients with poor glucose control (HbA1c ≥7%) and those with better glucose control (HbA1c <7%) and between patients with chronic complications and those without. Chronic complications were deduced from the anamnestic, laboratory, and instrumental data and the five-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire.
RESULTS: Nailfold capillaries in patients with HbA1c ≥7% were thicker (p = .019) and longer (p = .021) than in those with better glucose control. Ectasias (p = .017) and microaneurysms (p = .045) were more frequently observed in patients with HbA1c ≥7.0% than those with HbA1c <7.0%. Patients with ED, compared to those without, had a lower frequency of bizarre-shaped capillaries (p = .02). Microaneurysms (p = .02) were more frequently described in patients with carotid stenosis (>20%) than those without.
CONCLUSION: Relevant nailfold microvascular alterations were observed in T2D, most of which were associated with poor glycemic control, ED, and carotid stenosis. Further investigation is needed to recognize the role of CNVC in predicting the onset and evolution of chronic complications and monitoring the effectiveness of antihyperglycemic treatments on microcirculation.
