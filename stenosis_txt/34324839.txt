Title: Presentation, Diagnosis, and Management of Subglottic and Tracheal Stenosis During Systemic Inflammatory Diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Subglottic stenosis (SGS) and tracheal stenosis (TS) are characterized by a narrowing of the airways. The goal of this study was to describe the characteristics and prognosis of nontraumatic and nontumoral SGS or TS.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the inflammatory etiologies of SGS and TS, and what are their characteristics and prognosis?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, observational retrospective study was performed in patients with SGS or TS that was neither traumatic nor tumoral.
RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were included, 33 (41%) with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and 21 (26%) with relapsing polychondritis (RP). GPA-related stenoses exhibited circumferential subglottic narrowing in 85% of cases, without calcifications. In contrast, RP-related stenoses displayed anterior involvement in 76%, in a longer distance from vocal cords (4 cm), with calcifications in 62%, and extension to bronchi in 86%. Other diagnoses included bullous dermatoses (n = 3), amyloidosis (n = 3), sarcoidosis (n = 2), and Crohn's disease (n = 2); the remaining stenoses (n = 15) were idiopathic. SGS/TS was the initial manifestation of the disease in 66% of cases, with a median interval from stenosis to disease diagnosis of 12 months (interquartile range, 0-48 months). Despite the use of glucocorticoids in 80%, combined with methotrexate in 49%, endoscopic procedures were required in 68% of patients. Relapses of stenoses occurred in 76% without any difference between causes (82% in GPA, 67% in RP, and 75% in idiopathic SGS/TS). Three patients died due to the stenosis, two of RP and one of GPA.
INTERPRETATION: These data show that GPA and RP are the two main inflammatory diseases presenting with SGS/TS. GPA-related stenoses are mostly subglottic and circumferential, whereas RP-related stenoses are mostly tracheal, anterior, and calcified with a frequent extension to bronchi. Relapses of stenoses are common, and relapse rates do not differ between causes. Diagnosis and management of SGS/TS require a multidisciplinary approach.
