Title: The feasibility of endoscopic submucosal dissection for colorectal lesions larger than 10 cm.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) enables en bloc removal of colorectal neoplasms, its effectiveness for larger lesions (≥ 10 cm in diameter) is undetermined. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of ESD for colorectal lesions ≥ 10 cm wide.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 3591 consecutive colorectal lesions managed with ESD from June 2012 through December 2020. Clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes were compared between lesions ≥ 10 cm wide and lesions 5-10 cm wide.
RESULTS: There were 50 patients in the ≥ 10 cm group and 270 patients in the 5-10 cm group. Among patients in the ≥ 10 cm group, lesions were most often in the rectum (50.0%), and the laterally spreading tumor-granular nodular mixed type (LST-G-M) was most prevalent (41/50, 82%). Although patients in the ≥ 10 cm group a longer mean ESD procedure time (186.0 vs. 94.4 min, p &lt; 0.001), the dissection speed was significantly higher in this group (0.50 vs. 0.41 cm2/min, p = 0.003). The en bloc and curative resection rates were comparable between the ≥ 10 cm and 5-10 cm groups (100% vs. 99.6% and 86.0% vs. 88.5%, respectively). Although the stenosis rate was higher in the ≥ 10 cm group (4% vs. 0%), the delayed bleeding and perforation rates were similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: ESD for colorectal lesions ≥ 10 cm wide is feasible and curative, even though it is associated with higher technical difficulty and longer procedure times compared with ESD for smaller lesions (Number: UMIN 000044313).
