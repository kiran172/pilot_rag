Title: [Management of access site vascular complications in transcatheter aortic valve implantation].

Abstract: Since its advent, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has experienced a continuous expansion, thanks to extraordinary clinical results and to the dramatic increase of safety, enabled by improvements of prosthesis and delivery systems, refinement of implantation techniques, increasing operator experience, and use of computed tomography scan for procedural planning. However, complications rates are still not negligible. As vascular complications, and, particularly, access-related complications are among the most frequent adverse events, all TAVI operators should know how to prevent and how to manage those potentially catastrophic situations. Here we provide an overview of the most frequent access site vascular complications and the respective treatment options.
