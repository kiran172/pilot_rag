Title: Long-Term Outcomes of Aortic Stenosis Patients with Different Flow/Gradient Patterns Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Background: Few data exist on the comparative long-term outcomes of severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients with different flow-gradient patterns undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This study sought to evaluate the impact of the pre-TAVI flow-gradient pattern on long-term clinical outcomes after TAVI and assess changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of different subtypes of AS patients following TAVI. Methods: Consecutive patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI in our institution were screened and prospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into four subgroups according to pre-TAVI flow/gradient pattern: (i) low flow-low gradient (LF-LG): stroke volume indexed (SVi) ≤ 35 mL/m2 and mean gradient (MG) &lt; 40 mmHg); (ii) normal flow-low gradient (NF-LG): SVi &gt; 35 mL/m2 and MG &lt; 40 mmHg; (iii) low flow-high gradient (LF-HG): Svi 35 mL/m2 and MG ≥ 40 mmHg and (iv) normal flow-high gradient (NF-HG): SVi &gt; 35 mL/m2 and MG ≥ 40 mmHg. Transthoracic echocardiography was repeated at 1-year follow-up. Clinical follow-up was obtained at 12 months, and yearly thereafter until 5-year follow-up was complete for all patients. Results: A total of 272 patients with complete echocardiographic and clinical follow-up were included in our analysis. Their mean age was 80 ± 7 years and the majority of patients (N = 138, 50.8%) were women. 62 patients (22.8% of the study population) were distributed in the LF-LG group, 98 patients (36%) were LF-HG patients, 95 patients (34.9%) were NF-HG, and 17 patients (6.3%) were NF-LG. There was a greater prevalence of comorbidities among LF-LG AS patients. One-year all-cause mortality differed significantly between the four subgroups of AS patients (log-rank p: 0.022) and was more prevalent among LF-LG patients (25.8%) compared to LF-HG (11.3%), NF-HG (6.3%) and NF-LG patients (18.8%). At 5-year follow-up, global mortality remained persistently higher among LF-LG patients (64.5%) compared to LF-HG (47.9%), NF-HG (42.9%), and NF-LG patients (58.8%) (log-rank p: 0.029). At multivariable Cox hazard regression analysis, baseline SVi (HR: 0.951, 95% C.I.; 0.918-0.984), the presence of at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation at baseline (HR: 3.091, 95% C.I: 1.645-5.809) and at least moderate paravalvular leak (PVL) post-TAVI (HR: 1.456, 95% C.I.: 1.106-1.792) were significant independent predictors of late global mortality. LF-LG patients and LF-HG patients exhibited a significant increase in LVEF at 1-year follow-up. A lower LVEF (p &lt; 0.001) and a lower Svi (p &lt; 0.001) at baseline were associated with LVEF improvement at 1-year. Conclusions: Patients with LF-LG AS have acceptable 1-year outcomes with significant improvement in LVEF at 1-year follow-up, but exhibit exceedingly high 5-year mortality following TAVI. The presence of low transvalvular flow and at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation at baseline and significant paravalvular leak post-TAVI were associated with poorer long-term outcomes in the entire cohort of AS patients. The presence of a low LVEF or a low SVi predicts LVEF improvement at 1-year.
