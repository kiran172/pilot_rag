Title: Surgical management for an adult, female patient, with Ebstein Anomaly on Tricuspid Valve that has Subvalvular membrane with severe PS and multiple VSDs-A case report.

Abstract: Ebstein's anomaly is a rare and complexed heart defect that affects the tricuspid valve and is accountable for around 1% of congenital cardiac abnormalities. It is one of the most common congenital causes of tricuspid valve regurgitation. Ebstein's anomaly is often diagnosed prenatally due to its severe cardiomegaly. Some individuals with this anomaly do not experience any complications until adulthood and even then its mostly minor complaints like exercise intolerance. Â Atrial septal defect is most commonly (70-90%) associated with Ebstein's anomaly. However, ventricular septal defect (VSD) can be associated with 2-6% of the cases. This particular report presents a case of surgical intervention for a 20 years old female with Ebstein's anomaly that had multiple VSD's and a severe Pulmonary Stenosis (PS).
