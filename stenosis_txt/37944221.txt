Title: [France TAVI registry].

Abstract: The France TAVI Registry is a registry of the French Society of Cardiology that was launched in January 2013 and included the majority of patients hospitalised for TAVI in the 54 active TAVI centres in France, i.e. more than 90,000 patients. This national, multicentre, prospective registry was designed to collect basic patient characteristics as well as procedural aspects of TAVI. All the follow-up is carried out automatically from the national health data system, apart from imaging data, including echocardiography, which is entered manually into the eCRF.
