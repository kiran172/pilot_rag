Title: Transection and reimplantation of anomalous right coronary artery from single left coronary artery in a collegiate athlete.

Abstract: Coronary artery anomalies may induce myocardial ischaemia and sudden cardiac death when associated with areas of compression or stenosis. We present a case of transection and reimplantation of an anomalous interarterial right coronary artery arising from a single left main coronary artery. The 18-year-old collegiate athlete had exertional chest pain and haemodynamically significant compromise to coronary blood flow.
