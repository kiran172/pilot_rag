Title: Cardiac Rehabilitation Referral After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with improved outcomes; however, it remains relatively underutilized in this patient population. As part of a quality improvement initiative, we sought to increase the rate of cardiac rehabilitation referral after TAVR at our institution. We designed and implemented a multidisciplinary program that included education of cardiothoracic surgery providers discharging post-TAVR patients on the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation with participation of cardiac rehabilitation personnel during discharge rounds with the surgical team. The study period was defined as 12 months prior to and 6 months following the implementation of the education program. Overall referral rates increased from 5% to 56% ( P < 0.0001), and referrals placed before hospital discharge increased from 0.8% to 53% ( P < 0.0001) over the study period. In conclusion, a combination of education regarding the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation and cardiac rehabilitation personnel participation in discharge rounds significantly increased referral to cardiac rehabilitation after TAVR.
