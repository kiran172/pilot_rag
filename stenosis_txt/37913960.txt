Title: Commissural alignment during TAVR reduces the risk of overlap to coronary ostia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) showed safety and efficacy in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Commissural alignment (CA) during TAVR has the potential to reduce the impact of the prostheses on accessibility of coronary arteries, as misalignment of the neocommissures could cause partial overlap with coronary ostia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of CA on coronary overlap rates.
METHODS: We examined the techniques of CA and their impact on coronary access. Eligible studies were searched for on Pubmed, SCOPUS and DOAJ and selected using PRISMA guidelines. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a severe coronary overlap or failed coronary re-access. Results of the analysis are expressed as Risk Ratio (RR) with 95% CI.
RESULTS: Four studies were included in this analysis. In these, 681 patients underwent TAVR with CA and 210 underwent TAVR without CA. We examined Evolut valves and Acurate Neo valves. The primary endpoint occurred in 138 patients undergoing TAVR with CA and in 154 patients without CA (RR = 0.279; 95% CI 0.201-0.386; p < 0.001). Neither prosthesis-related, nor patient-related factors had a significant interaction with the measured effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Commissural alignment was associated with significantly lower rates of commissure-to-coronary ostia overlap and failure of coronary access. Consequently, a modified insertion technique could reduce coronary overlap and coronary occlusion, particularly in supra-annular valves. Therefore, controlled orientation of prostheses by CA during TAVR could favour coronary access, especially in younger patients that could require coronary re-access after TAVR.
