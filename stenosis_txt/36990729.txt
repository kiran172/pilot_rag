Title: [Refractory esophageal stricture of esophageal mucous membrane pemphigoid after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].

Abstract: Haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from her brother was performed on a 41-year-old lady with no prior history of pemphigoid to treat recurrent AML. On day 59 following transplantation, she experienced esophageal stenosis. During immunosuppressive therapy for graft vs. host disease, this condition was controlled with periodic esophageal dilatation (GVHD). Her esophageal stricture, which required periodic dilatation, grew worse after she stopped immunosuppressive therapy because of recurrent AML. The esophageal mucosa was easily hemorrhagic and desquamative. Histologic analysis revealed that the squamous cell layers had been divided. Indirect immunofluorescence was negative for IgG and positive for IgA on the epidermal layers, while direct immunofluorescence showed a linear deposition of IgG on the basement membrane zone. It was determined through immunoblotting utilizing recombinant protein of BP180 C-terminal domain that both IgG and IgA antibodies were present, supporting the diagnosis of mucous membrane pemphigoid with anti-BP180. After allogeneic transplantation, basal epidermal cell destruction by GVHD may result in autoimmune blistering disorders, which expose basement membrane proteins and antigen presentation. A similar mechanism could apply to our situation. For rare GVHD cases, a thorough histological diagnosis is required.
