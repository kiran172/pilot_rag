Title: One-Way Valve Method for Achieving Effective Flow Reversal on Carotid Artery Stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We report a simplified method of manual transfusion with a one-way valve during carotid artery stenting (CAS) with flow reversal.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old man with cervical internal carotid artery stenosis who developed vulnerable plaques was scheduled for CAS using flow reversal. Blood flow reversal was naturally caused by the arteriovenous pressure gradient, and a method with a one-way valve, which enables simplified manual transfusion using a syringe technique, was used for the patient. CAS was completed without distal embolization.
CONCLUSION: Manual transfusion can be simplified using a one-way valve in cases of flow reversal during CAS, which often require complicated procedures.
