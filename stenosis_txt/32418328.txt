Title: Cross-sectional imaging for assessing intestinal fibrosis in Crohn's disease.

Abstract: More than 30% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) develop fibrotic strictures in the bowel as the disease progresses. Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components in the submucosa and smooth muscle hypertrophy or hyperplasia are the main features of fibrosis in CD. Cross-sectional imaging technology provides a wealth of information on the anatomy, histological composition, and physiological function of the bowel, allowing for a non-invasive and complete evaluation of associated abnormalities. This review summarizes recent advances in and the potential technologies of cross-sectional imaging for assessing intestinal fibrosis in CD, including ultrasound imaging, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
