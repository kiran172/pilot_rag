Title: Effects of ABCA1 gene polymorphisms on risk factors, susceptibility and severity of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The relationships between the rs1800976, rs4149313 and rs2230806 polymorphisms in ATP binding cassette protein A1 and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) remain unclear.
METHODS: Four hundred and forty-two patients with CAD and 217 CAD-free subjects were enrolled in this study. The rs1800976, rs4149313 and rs2230806 polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Severity of CAD was evaluated by Gensini score system, number of stenotic coronary vessels and extent of coronary stenosis.
RESULTS: C allele of the rs1800976 polymorphism, G allele of the rs4149313 polymorphism and A allele of the rs2230806 polymorphism were found to be risk alleles for CAD (p<0.05 for all). In patients with CAD, C allele of the rs1800976 polymorphism was associated with high levels of hypersensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and cystatin c (CysC), and its frequency increased with percentiles of Gensini score, number of stenotic coronary vessels and extent of coronary stenosis (p<0.05 for all). The subjects with GA genotype of the rs4149313 polymorphism had higher levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B and hs-CRP than those with AA genotype (p<0.05 for all). The subjects with AA genotype of the rs2230806 polymorphism had higher levels of TC, LDL-C and uric acid than those with GA genotype (p<0.05 for all). No associations between the rs4149313 or rs2230806 polymorphism and severity of CAD were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: The rs1800976 polymorphism is significantly associated with the occurrence and severity of CAD, which is possibly mediated by hs-CRP and CysC.
