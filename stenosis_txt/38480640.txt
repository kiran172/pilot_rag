Title: Sclerotherapy with 3% polidocanol foam for the treatment of mucocutaneous bridges and/or residual piles after open excisional hemorrhoidectomy.

Abstract: Injection sclerotherapy is an effective and safe treatment in selected cases. It might be used as the first treatment for I-III degree hemorrhoidal disease (HD), but also as a bridge therapy for more severe cases not amenable to invasive treatments. However, concerning the long-term recurrence rate, open excisional hemorrhoidectomy remains the gold standard in cases of III- and IV-degree HD. In this context, it is recommended to perform the excision of no more than three piles and to preserve the muco-cutaneous bridges to avoid post-operative anal stenosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate surgical outcomes and efficacy of the combined treatment of open excisional hemorrhoidectomy and the use of ST on the remnant muco-cutaneous bridges/residual piles. This was a single-center retrospective study and a total of 18 patients with IV-degree HD, aged between 18 and 75 years with symptomatic HD according to the Goligher classification, were enrolled between January 2023 and June 2023 and their follow-up continued until October 2023 after reaching 3 months of follow-up. The Hemorrhoidal Disease Symptom Score (HDSS), the Short Health Scale for HD (SHS-HD) score and the Vaizey Incontinence Score were used to assess symptoms and their impact on quality of life and continence. A total of 77.8% (14/18) of the patients were symptom-free (hemorrhoidal disease symptom score (HDSS) score = 0) after 3 months. Moreover, a statistically significant decrease in the median HDSS and short health scale for HD (SHS-HD) score was registered from 16 preoperatively (T0) to 2 at 3-month follow-up (T3). Neither post-operative bleeding nor any type of complications occurred. The use of sclerotherapy in combination with the traditional open excisional hemorrhoidectomy has shown promising results. Further structured studies are needed and greater dissemination and education of the general surgeon on the subject is necessary.
