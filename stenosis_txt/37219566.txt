Title: [Tracheostomy managment and tube weaning within a framework of dysphagia intervention].

Abstract: Persistent dysphagia is a major predictor of prolonged ventilation weaning and unsuccessful attempts at decannulation. Due to the high incidence of dysphagia in tracheotomized patients, tracheal cannula management and dysphagia treatment must be coordinated. A central element of tracheal cannula management in dysphagia treatment is the establishment of physiological airflow. This enables voluntary clearing functions, such as coughing and throat clearing and significantly reduces aspiration. A distinction is made between spontaneous and staged decannulation pathways with expansion of cuff unblocking times and occlusion training. Other therapeutic measures include secretion and saliva management, cough function training with improvement of strength and sensitivity, pharyngeal electrical stimulation, adaptation of tracheal tubes to optimize respiratory and swallowing function, control and treatment of airway stenosis, and standardization of processes for quality assurance.
