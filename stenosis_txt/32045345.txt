Title: Impact of Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Calcification on Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With Second-Generation Devices.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of left ventricular outflow tract calcification (LVOT-CA) localization and extension on permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) rates after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with second-generation devices.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included all consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI with second-generation devices at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy from January 2014 to June 2017. The localization and extension of LVOT-CA were evaluated using computed tomography imaging; LVOT regions were categorized according to the overlying coronary cusps.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 377 patients, of which LVOT-CA was present in 133 patients (35.3%). Patients with LVOT-CA had significantly a higher rate of post-TAVI PPI (32.0% vs 19.2% in patients with no LVOT-CA; P<.01). Multivariable analysis demonstrated LVOT-CA in the non-coronary cusp, as well as preprocedural right bundle-branch block, age, body mass index, and mechanically expanded prosthesis implantation, to be strong independent predictors of PPI.
CONCLUSIONS: LVOT-CA in the non-coronary cusp is a strong independent predictor of PPI after TAVI with second-generation devices. Further studies are needed to confirm these data in a larger, multicenter population.
