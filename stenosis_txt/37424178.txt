Title: Intensive mannitol slow infusion post-stenting may attenuate stenting-related early adverse effects in patients with cerebral venous sinus stenosis.

Abstract: AIMS: To analyze intensive slow mannitol poststenting on attenuating stenting-related early adverse effects in cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS).
METHODS: This real-world study enrolled subacute or chronic CVSS patients from January 2017 through March 2022 and divided them into DSA only and stenting post-DSA groups. The later group was subdivided into control (without extra mannitol use) and intensive slow mannitol subgroup (immediate extra mannitol 250-500 mL, 2 mL/min infusion post-stenting) after signed informed consent. All data were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 95 eligible patients entered into final analysis, in which 37 cases underwent DSA only and 58 cases underwent stenting post-DSA. Finally, 28 patients were entered into intensive slow mannitol subgroup and 30 in control. Stenting group vs. DSA group, HIT-6 scores and WBC counts were higher in the former (both p &lt; 0.001). Intensive slow mannitol subgroup vs. control on the third day post-stenting, a statistically significant reductions were noticed in the former on WBC counts (6.19 ± 1.86 × 109 /L vs. 9.59 ± 2.05 × 109 /L); HIT-6 scores (degree of headache) (40.00 (38.00-40.00) vs. 49.00 (41.75-55.25)) and brain edema surrounding the stent on CT maps (17.86% vs.96.67%), all p &lt; 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: Stenting-related severe headache, inflammatory biomarkers elevation, and brain edema aggravation can be attenuated by intensive slow mannitol infusion.
