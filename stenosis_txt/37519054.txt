Title: Long-term bio-functional performance of a novel, self-positioning balloon expandable transcatheter biological aortic valve system in the ovine aortic banding model.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate bio-functionality of a novel, proprietary balloon-expandable biological transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system (InFlow, CardValve Consortium, Poland) in an ovine model of aortic banding.
METHODS: Surgical ascending aorta banding was created in 21 sheep. Two weeks later, 18 biological valves were implanted within the model using 15-16 F InFlow TAVI systems and carotid cut-down approach. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography was performed at 30, 90, and 180-day. At designated time, animals were euthanized and valves harvested for analysis.
RESULTS: All sheep survived the banding procedure. There were 4 (22%) procedure related deaths within a 7-day period. During the observation an additional 2 sheep died. In one, the valve dislocated after the procedure - the animal was excluded. Two animals completed 30-day follow up, five 90-day follow-up and four terminal follow-up of 180 days. Valves examined via transesophageal echocardiography showed proper hemodynamic parameters without evidence of structural valve deterioration. The maximum and average flow gradients at 180 days were 31.4 (23.3-37.7) and 17.5 (13.1-20.2) mmHg, respectively. There was one case of moderate insufficiency and no case of perivalvular leaks. By histopathology, there were no inflammation, thrombosis, nor calcifications in any tested valves at long-term follow-up. Neointimal coverage of stent struts increased with time from basal part in "early" groups to nearly 3/4 of stent length in the 180-day group. The pannus tissue showed maturation that increased with time with no stenotic "collar" visible in orthotopically implanted valves.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed good hemodynamic performance, durability and biocompatibility of the novel biological THV.
