Title: Renal Hyperperfusion Injury After Percutaneous Angioplasty for Renovascular Hypertension as a Sequela of Neuroblastoma.

Abstract: Hyperperfusion injury is a rare but critical complication associated with revascularization for long-standing severe artery stenosis. Here we report a rare case of a patient with renal hyperperfusion injury after undergoing percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty for renovascular hypertension as a sequela of neuroblastoma after radiation therapy. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
