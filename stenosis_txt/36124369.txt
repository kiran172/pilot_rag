Title: Black-blood Venous Imaging (BBVI): A Contrast-Free and High-Resolution Magnetic Resonance Approach for Diagnosing IVCS - a Proof of Concept Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS) diagnosis heavily relies on an imaging test. However, non-invasive and contrast-free imaging test for the diagnosis of IVCS remains a big challenge. To address this issue, this prospective study aimed to assess the image quality and diagnostic performance of a magnetic resonance imaging technique, black-blood venous imaging (BBVI), in detecting IVCS by comparing it with contrast-enhanced computed tomography venography (CTV) and using invasive digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the reference.
METHODS: We enrolled 105 patients, and all patients underwent BBVI, CTV, and DSA examinations. We compared the consistency of CTV and BBVI image quality and their consistency in diagnosing the rate of iliac vein stenosis in IVCS patients. Using the consensus DSA as a reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of BBVI and CTV and their diagnostic agreement with DSA were calculated.
RESULTS: BBVI demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the diagnosis of IVCS, without contrast agents. BBVI and CTV are quite in diagnosis IVCS. Quite SE (67.8% vs 68.3%), SP (94.8% vs 94.8%), PPV (98.0% vs 98.0%), NPV (46.2% vs 46.9%) and ACC (75.3% vs 75.7%) were obtained by BBVI in comparison with CTV.
CONCLUSION: BBVI has comparable diagnostic performance with CTV. It may be a viable alternative to CTV techniques in screening the IVCS without contrast agents and free of ionizing radiation.
