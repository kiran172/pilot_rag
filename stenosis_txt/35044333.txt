Title: Single-nucleotide polymorphism of ADRβ2 and CDKN1B genes in Egyptian patients with coronary artery in-stent restenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In-stent restenosis is a common complication after percutaneous coronary intervention. The purpose of the current study is to look for associations of genetic variation in adrenergic beta-2 receptor (ADRβ2), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) genes in patients diagnosed with in-stent restenosis (ISR) after percutaneous coronary intervention in the Egyptians.
METHODS: Polymorphisms in ADRβ2 and CDKN1B were determined using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 200 Egyptian patients who underwent coronary angioplasty and stent placement of whom 100 patients developed ISR.
RESULTS: We found that the GG genotype of ADRβ2 and CC genotype of CDKN1B were more likely to develop restenosis after stenting (odds ratio = 3.7 and 3.2; P = 0.001, respectively). Our study considered that male sex, diabetes, obesity, bare-metal stents type of implanted stents, longer stents, GG genotype of ADRβ2, and CC genotype of CDK1B were significant independent predictors for ISR.
CONCLUSION: our results indicate that ADRβ2 (rs1042713) and CDKN1B (rs36228499) could be associated with the development of ISR in Egyptians.
