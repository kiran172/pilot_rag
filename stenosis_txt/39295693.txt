Title: Transverse Sinus Stenosis as an Underdiagnosed Cause of Chronic Headache: A Case Report.

Abstract: Transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) is an abnormality in the cerebral venous system in which the narrowing of the transverse sinus of the brain leads to obstructed cerebral venous outflow. It is an infrequent, incidental radiological finding. However, it is not uncommon among patients with chronic headaches of unclear cause, particularly those that remain unexplained after initial evaluation or those that are refractory to medical treatment. Its diagnosis frequently eludes the initial workup, and a high degree of suspicion should be maintained since its identification can leadÂ to potentially curative treatment. This report describes the case of a 36-year-old female with a history of chronic headache who was found to have TSS. This paper discusses its etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, radiological findings, and management.
