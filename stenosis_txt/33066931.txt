Title: Prognosis of Subtypes of Acute Large Artery Atherosclerotic Cerebral Infarction by Evaluation of Established Collateral Circulation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognosis of acute ischemic stroke is related to collateral circulation, which is different with different pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the prognosis of acute large atherosclerotic (LAA) cerebral infarction with different pathogenesis by assessing the establishment of collateral circulation.
METHODS: 108 patients with acute LAA cerebral infarction in our hospital, who failed to thrombolytic or thrombectomy in the acute phase were selected and classified by Chinese ischemic stroke subclassification (CISS). They were evaluated by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). CT angiography (CTA) of head and neck were used to evaluate the collateral circulation for patients with large vessel stenosis or occlusion within one week of admission. The CTA collateral scores (CS) were recorded in a dichotomized fashion (ie, poor vs good).
RESULTS: Patients with good CS had significantly lower NIHSS score and good prognosis at 2 weeks and 3 months than patients with poor CS (P < 0.001). The arterial-to-arterial embolization mechanism was the highest in the ratio of good CS and good prognosis at 3 months (P < 0.001). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that baseline NIHSS score (OR=1.407, 95%CI:1.153-1.717, P=0.001) was an independent factor affecting poor CS. The NIHSS score at baseline (OR=0.604, 95%CI:0.436-0.837, P=0.002) and good CS (OR=39.552, 95%CI:8.908-175.618, P=0.000) were important predictors of good prognosis at 3 months.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis and collateral circulation of acute LAA cerebral infarction with different pathogenesis was different. Baseline NIHSS score and collateral circulation had great impact on prognosis at 3 months.
