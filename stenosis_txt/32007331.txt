Title: Diabetes influences cancer risk in patients with increased carotid atherosclerosis burden.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Atherosclerosis and cancer share several risk factors suggesting that at least in part their pathogenesis is sustained by common mechanisms. To investigate this relation we followed a group of subjects with carotid atherosclerosis at baseline up for malignancy development.
METHODS AND RESULTS: we carried out an observational study exploring cancer incidence (study endpoint) in subjects with known carotid atherosclerosis at baseline (n = 766) without previous cancer or carotid vascular procedures. During the follow-up (160 ± 111 weeks) 24 cancer occurred, corresponding to an overall annual incidence rate of 0.11%. 10 diagnosis of cancer occurred in individuals with a carotid stenosis >50% (n = 90) whereas 14 in patients with a carotid stenosis <50% patients (n = 676) (p < 0.001). Respect to patients without cancer, diabetes was markedly more common in subjects with cancer diagnosis during the FU (37.3%vs75.0%, p < 0.001). After controlling for classic risk factors, carotid stenosis >50% (HR = 2.831, 95%CI = 1.034-5.714; p = 0.036) and diabetes (HR = 4.831, 95%CI = 1.506-15.501; p = 0.008) remained significantly associated with cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: to our knowledge this is the first study reporting a significant risk of cancer development in subjects with diabetes and high risk of cerebrovascular events, highlighting the need of a carefully clinical screening for cancer in diabetic patients with overt carotid atherosclerosis.
