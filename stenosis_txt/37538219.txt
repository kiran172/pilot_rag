Title: Association of Cervical Spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging Abnormalities with Chronic Neck Pain in Southern Nigeria.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study was done to evaluate the relationship between cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and clinical features in adults with chronic neck pain (NP) at our tertiary hospital.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study of the cervical spine MRI of 90 adult patients with chronic NP. The clinical history, biodata, and cervical spine MRI findings were analysed. Statistical tests were considered significant at P â‰¤ 0.05.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 54.72 (13.51) years (range = 28-79 years). There were 52 (58%) males and 38 (42%) females. Cervical disc desiccation and disc herniation were the most prevalent MRI findings. C4/C5 and C5/C6 disc levels were most commonly affected. Disc height reduction correlated with shoulder pain (r = 0.23, P = 0.030), unsteady gait (r = 0.27, P = 0.010), and lower limb weakness (r = 0.23, P = 0.029). Vertebral collapse correlated with shoulder pain (r = 0.22, P = 0.036), upper limbs burning sensation (r = 0.33, P = 0.001), and loss of dexterity (r = 0.22, P = 0.037). Spondylolisthesis correlated significantly with unsteady gait (r = 0.34, P = 0.001), dizziness/vertigo (r = 0.29, P = 0.005), painful neck movement (r = 0.32, P = 0.002), loss of dexterity (r = 0.37, P &lt; 0.001) and sphincteric dysfunction (r = 0.23, P = 0.031). Modic changes correlated with loss of dexterity (r = 0.39, P &lt; 0.001) and upper limbs burning sensation (r = 0.21, P = 0.048). Cervical canal stenosis did not correlate significantly with any symptom.
CONCLUSION: Cervical disc disease (C4/C5 and C5/C6 levels) was the most prevalent finding on MRI. Disc height reduction, vertebral collapse, spondylolisthesis, and Modic changes correlated with various clinical symptoms.
