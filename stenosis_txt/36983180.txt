Title: The Global Burden of Valvular Heart Disease: From Clinical Epidemiology to Management.

Abstract: Valvular heart disease is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and a major contributor of symptoms and functional disability. Knowledge of valvular heart disease epidemiology and a deep comprehension of the geographical and temporal trends are crucial for clinical advances and the formulation of effective health policy for primary and secondary prevention. This review mainly focuses on the epidemiology of primary (organic, related to the valve itself) valvular disease and its management, especially emphasizing the importance of heart valve centers in ensuring the best care of patients through a multidisciplinary team.
