Title: [Analysis of anxiety, depression and related factors in patients with chronic lumbocrural pain before minimally invasive surgery].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate anxiety and/or depression status of patients with chronic lumbocrural pain, and to further analyze related risk factors of anxiety and/or depression .
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the medical data of patients who suffered from chronic lumbocrural pain caused by lumbar disc herniation and/or lumbar spinal stenosis and received minimally invasive surgery from March 2018 to April 2018. General data (including age, gender, education levels, past history, sleep order and medical insurance), numeric rating scale(NRS), Japanese Orthopedic Association(JOA) back pain scale and hospital anxiety and depression scale(HADS) were collected for analysis. The basic demographic data and clinic data were analyzed, possible related risk factors associated were analyzed by univariate analysis, and multivariate Logistic regression analysis was further used to find the relative independent risk factors and included all the predictive variables with P values less than 0.05 as covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 91 patients met the inclusion criteria and finished this study, the mean HADS score for anxiety was 8.1±4.2, 48(52.7%) respondents were screened positive for anxiety, while the rest 43(47.3%) patients had negative anxiety state, the mean HDDS score for depression was 6.9±4.9, 38(41.8%) respondents were screened positive for depression, and the rest 53(58.2%) patients were not depressed, and 56(61.5%) patients experienced anxiety or depression. There were significant difference in sleep disorder, JOA score and leg NRS score between the patients with and without anxiety(P<0.05), and the significant differences were also found in age, sleep disorder and JOA score between the patients with and without depression(P<0.05), Logistic regression analysis further showed that the JOA score and sleep disorder were risk factors for anxiety, and the JOA score was risk factor for depression.
CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic lumbocrural pain are often accompanied by anxiety and/or depression before minimally surgery, the low JOA score and sleep disturbance increased the risk of presenting anxiety, and the low JOA score increased the risk of developing depression. It is necessary to evaluate mental status and related risk factors before surgery.
