Title: Post-TAVR conduction abnormalities leading to permanent pacemaker implantation: Risk factors, prevention, and management.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) often leads to conduction abnormalities, necessitating pacemaker implantation. This review of 38 meta-analyses identified preexisting right bundle branch block (RBBB), LAHB, and new-onset left bundle branch block as key risk factors, with a higher PPM risk in male and older patients. Procedural factors like transfemoral access and self-expandable valves also increase this risk. Prevention focuses on tailoring TAVR to individual electrophysiological and anatomical profiles. However, there's a lack of consensus in managing these conduction disturbances post-TAVR, highlighting the need for further research and standardized treatment strategies.
