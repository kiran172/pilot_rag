Title: Multiple Sites of Arterial Thrombosis in A 35-Year Old Patient after ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) Vaccination, Requiring Emergent Femoral and Carotid Surgical Thrombectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vaccine Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare complication following ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) vaccination. Venous thrombosis in unusual sites such as splachnic or intracranial thrombosis, is the commonest manifestation.
CASE REPORT: We report a 35-year-old male patient who presented with acute left leg ischemia and thrombocytopenia 11-days after vaccination requiring emergent thrombectomy. During work-up, a localized thrombus was detected in the left carotid bifurcation mandating carotid thrombectomy. Localized right iliac thrombus causing a non-limiting flow stenosis was treated conservatively. The platelet aggregating capacity of patient's plasma was confirmed in a functional assay, thereby establishing VITT.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge this is the first case presenting multiple arterial thromboses requiring surgical treatment after ChAdOx1 vaccination.
