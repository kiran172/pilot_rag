Title: Advantages of retrograde flexible ureteroscopy in determining the etiology of painless hematuria originating from the upper urinary tract.

Abstract: The present study investigated the use of retrograde flexible ureteroscopy (RFU) in the discrimination of the etiology of hematuria that originates from the upper urinary tract (UUT). The present study collected retrospective data for patients who presented with hematuria and cystoscopy-detected bleeding from the UUT between June 2006 and August 2018 in Ningbo First Hospital. All patients accepted RFU to determine the etiology of hematuria. Data regarding imaging examinations, surgery, pathology and complications were also collected and analyzed. In total, 65 patients (males, 38; females, 27) with a mean age of 63 years underwent RFU to determine the etiology of hematuria originating from the UUT. Using RFU, UUT tumors were found in 29 cases. Stones, polyps and atypical hyperplasia were found in two cases, and a definite diagnosis was not found in three cases. There were 17 cases without obvious abnormalities and nine cases were unable to undergo RFU due to ureteral stenosis. In patients who could not be diagnosed by imaging examination, 34.4% (11/32) were diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma by RFU, and these results were also confirmed by postoperative pathology. In the present study, no patient had severe complications after RFU. The present results suggested RFU may be used as a sensitive method to diagnose UUT tumors (78.4%; 29/37) and has strong specificity. RFU could be performed as a routine examination for patients with hematuria from the UUT.
