Title: Comparison of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and surgical revision after intraoperative dilatation with biliary tract probes for arteriovenous fistula stenosis at juxta-anastomosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is widely used for stenosis of vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of both PTA and surgical revision after intraoperative dilatation with biliary tract probes for juxta-anastomotic stenosis in autogenous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (RCAVFs).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of PTA and surgical revision after intraoperative dilatation with biliary tract probes; these were the first interventions after RCAVF establishment in 112 patients with juxta-anastomotic stenosis. Anatomical (number of stenoses) and clinical variables (age and gender of the patient, time of hemodialysis, AVF age, presence of diabetes mellitus, and cause of end-stage renal disease) were reviewed. Technical success, clinical success, and post-intervention primary patency were evaluated.
RESULTS: Our study enrolled 35 patients in the PTA group and 77 patients in the surgical revision group. Clinical and technical success rates of both groups were 100%. There were no complications, such as bleeding or hematomas. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the post-intervention primary patency rates at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months in the PTA group were 100%, 94.28%, 77.1%, 60%, 54.29%, and 45.71%, respectively, and those in the surgical revision group were 100%, 94.81%, 92.2%, 90.91%, 81.82%, and 76.62%, respectively. The post-intervention primary patency rates at 9-24 months in the surgical revision group were significantly higher than those in the PTA group (χ2 = 19.04, p &lt; 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The post-intervention long-term primary patency rate of surgical revision after intraoperative dilatation with biliary tract probes is higher than that of PTA for the first intervention of patients with juxta-anastomotic stenosis in RCAVFs. The surgical revision method is safe and effective, especially in hospitals that have not yet carried out PTA.
