Title: Variables associated with progression of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Determine the variables associated with hospitalisations in patients with Crohn's disease and those associated with surgery, intestinal resection, hospital readmission, need for multiple operations and immunobiological agent use.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted from 2019 to 2021, using two centres for inflammatory bowel diseases in the Brazilian Public Health System.
RESULTS: This study included 220 patients. Only perianal disease was associated with hospitalisation (31.6% vs 13.0%, p=0.012). Stricturing or penetrating behaviour (35.8% vs 12.6%, p&lt;0.001) and perianal disease (45.9% vs 9.9%, p&lt;0.001) were associated with surgery. Ileal or ileocolonic location (80.0% vs 46.5%, p=0.044) and stricturing or penetrating behaviour (68.0% vs 11.2%, p&lt;0.001) were associated with intestinal resection. Steroids use at first Crohn's disease occurrence and postoperative complications were associated with hospital readmission and need for multiple operations, respectively. Age below 40 years at diagnosis (81.3% vs 62.0%, p=0.004), upper gastrointestinal tract involvement (21.8% vs 10.3%, p=0.040) and perianal disease (35.9% vs 16.3%, p&lt;0.001) were associated with immunobiological agent use.
CONCLUSION: Perianal disease and stricturing or penetrating behaviour were associated with more than one significant outcome. Other variables related to Crohn's disease progression were age below 40 years at diagnosis, an ileal or ileocolonic disease localisation, an upper gastrointestinal tract involvement, the use of steroids at the first Crohn's disease occurrence and history of postoperative complications. These findings are similar to those in the countries with a high prevalence of Crohn's disease.
