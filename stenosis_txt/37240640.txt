Title: Patient Selection Criteria and Procedural Standardization for Carotid Artery Stenting-A Single Center Experience.

Abstract: The gold standard for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis is the carotid endarterectomy (CEA). According to current guidelines, carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an alternative. Randomized control trials (RCTs) show significantly higher rates of peri-interventional strokes after CAS compared to CEA. However, these trials were usually characterized by a great heterogeneity in the CAS procedure. In this retrospective analysis from 2012 to 2020, 202 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were treated with CAS. Patients were carefully pre-selected according to anatomical and clinical criteria. In all cases, the same steps and material were used. All interventions were performed by five experienced vascular surgeons. Primary endpoints of this study were perioperative death and stroke. Asymptomatic carotid stenosis was present in 77% of the patients and symptomatic in 23%. The mean age was 66 years. The average degree of stenosis was 81%. The CAS technical success rate was 100%. Periprocedural complications occurred in 1.5% of cases, including one major stroke (0.5%) and two minor strokes (1%). The results of this study indicate that through a strict patient selection based on anatomical and clinical criteria, CAS can be performed with very low complication rates. Furthermore, standardization of the materials and the procedure itself is crucial.
