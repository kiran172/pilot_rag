Title: Association of Palmar Arch Collateral Function and Radial Artery Occlusion After Transradial Access.

Abstract: The prevalence and implications of radial artery occlusion (RAO) after transradial catheterization are an intensely discussed topic, resulting in numerous preventive strategies such as adjusted anticoagulation, residual-patency hemostasis, or distal puncture site. The present study aimed at assessing an association of palmar arch, in particular radial artery collateral function and RAO after transradial access (TRA) catheterization. Radial artery collateral function was determined using radial artery pressure signals in the nonobstructed vessel and during brief manual occlusion of the more proximal radial artery. Collateral flow index, the ratio of mean occlusive divided by mean nonocclusive arterial blood pressure, both subtracted by central venous pressure, was determined during manual RAO (radial artery collateral flow index [CFI<sub>rad</sub>]). The presence or absence of RAO was determined by Doppler ultrasound at least 3 months after TRA. A total of 630 patients with TRA coronary angiography underwent palmar arch, that is, radial and radial plus ulnar artery collateral function assessment. CFI<sub>rad</sub> was equal to 0.808 ± 0.144 (95% confidence interval 0.797 to 0.819). A total of 200 patients underwent Doppler ultrasound examination of their forearm arterial circulation 301 ± 140 days after TRA. Eight (4%) patients showed signs of RAO, 4 of whom (2%) had a complete RAO and 4 (2%) a stenosis above 30%. Patients with RAO showed a higher CFI<sub>rad</sub> than those without RAO: 0.900 ± 0.074 versus 0.801 ± 0.154 (p = 0.006). In conclusion, complete RAO as determined by Doppler ultrasound later than 3 months after TRA is rare (2%). In the long run, RAO appears to be related to a very well-developed radial artery collateral function.
