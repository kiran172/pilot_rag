Title: Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System: A Comprehensive Review.

Abstract: The Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) is a standardized reporting method for coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). It summarizes the findings of CCTA in 6 categories ranging from CAD-RADS 0 (complete absence of coronary artery disease) to CAD-RADS 5 (total occlusion of at least one vessel). It is applied on per patient basis for the highest grade of the stenotic lesion. The CAD-RADS also provides category-specific treatment recommendations, helping patient management. The main objectives of the CAD-RADS are to improve the consistency in reporting, facilitate the communication between interpreting and referring clinicians, recommend the best course of patient management, and produce consistent data for quality improvement, research and education. However, CAD-RADS has many limitations, resulting into the misclassification of the observed findings, misinterpretation of the final category, and misguidance for the treatment based upon the single score. In this review, the authors discuss the CAD-RADS categories and modifiers, along with the strengths and limitations of this new classification system.
