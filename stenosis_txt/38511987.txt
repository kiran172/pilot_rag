Title: Successful Anesthesia Management of Pediatric Living Donor Liver Transplant With Mild Bilateral Pulmonary Artery Stenosis Due to Alagille Syndrome: A Case Report.

Abstract: Alagille syndrome is an autosomal-dominantinherited disease characterized by intrahepatic bile duct involvement, congenital heart disease, eye anomalies, skeletal and central nervous system involvement, kidney anomalies, and facial appearance. Liver transplant is the only treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease and Alagille syndrome. Bilateral peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is a contraindication for liver transplant due to high mortality, and the decision for liver transplant in patients with bilateral peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is extremely challenging for anesthesiologists andtransplant surgeons.Wepresent a 2-year-oldfemale patient with successful anesthetic management of a pediatric living donor liver transplant with mild bilateral pulmonary artery stenosis, mild aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation due to Alagille syndrome. Anesthesiologists should know the underlying pathophysiological condition and perform a comprehensive preoperative evaluation to determine the correct anesthesia plan in patients with Alagille syndrome who will undergo liver transplants to treat multiple system disorders. Successful perioperative management of Alagille syndrome requires effective communication and collaboration between specialists through a multidisciplinary team approach.
