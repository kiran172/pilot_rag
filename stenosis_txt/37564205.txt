Title: Recombinant IL-37 Exerts an Anti-inflammatory Effect on Human Aortic Valve Interstitial Cells through Extracellular and Intracellular Actions.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with slow progression that involves soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Previously, we found that recombinant interleukin (IL)-37 suppresses aortic valve interstitial cells (AVIC) inflammatory response through the interaction with IL-18 receptor α-chain (IL-18Rα) on the cell surface. Endogenous IL-37 can be retained in the cytoplasm or released into extracellular spaces. It remains unknown whether recombinant IL-37 exerts the anti-inflammatory effect through intracellular action. Here, we found that recombinant IL-37 suppressed AVIC inflammatory response to soluble ECM proteins. Interestingly, recombinant IL-37 was internalized by human AVICs in an IL-18Rα-independent fashion. Blocking endocytic pathways reduced the internalization and anti-inflammatory potency of recombinant IL-37. Overexpression of IL-37 in human AVICs suppressed soluble ECM proteins-induced NF-κB activation and the production of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. However, IL-37D20A (mutant IL-37 lacking nucleus-targeting sequences) overexpression had no such effect, and the inflammatory response to soluble ECM proteins was essentially intact in AVICs from transgenic mice expressing IL-37D20A. Together, recombinant IL-37 can be internalized by human AVICs through endocytosis. Intracellular IL-37 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect through a nucleus-targeting mechanism. This study highlights the potent anti-inflammatory effect of recombinant IL-37 in both extracellular and intracellular compartments through distinct mechanisms.
