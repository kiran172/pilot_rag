Title: Contributions of residual hypoxemia to exercise hyperventilation in Fontan patients.

Abstract: It is unsettled whether increased exercise ventilation in Fontan subjects is due to increased pulmonary dead space or augmented ventilatory drive. Twenty-six Fontan patients underwent symptom-limited treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Two groups of age- and sex- matched subjects served as controls: the biventricularly repaired (Bi, n = 18), and the "true" control (C, n = 29) groups. Peak oxygen uptake (V̇O<sub>2peak</sub>) was not different among groups (41.0 +/- 8.4 ml/min/kg, 43.5 +/- 6.6 ml/min/kg, and 45.9 +/- 11.6 ml/min/kg for Fontan, Bi, and C groups, respectively, p = 0.16). Fontan subjects, however, showed steeper alveolar ventilation/carbon-dioxide (V̇A/V̇CO<sub>2</sub>) regression slope (35.5 +/- 5.3, 28.7 +/- 3.8, and 29.5 +/- 3.0 l/ml, for Fontan, Bi, and C groups, respectively, p&lt;0.0001), and lower end-expiratory carbon-dioxide fraction (FetCO<sub>2VAT</sub>) at ventilatory threshold (VAT) (4.4 +/- 0.5%, 5.5 +/- 0.5%, and 5.5 +/- 0.4%, for Fontan, Bi, and C groups, respectively, p&lt;0.001). The dead-space ventilation fraction at VAT was similar among groups (0.33 +/- 0.06, 0.33 +/- 0.04, 0.35 +/- 0.05 for Fontan, Bi, and C groups, respectively, p = 0.54). In Fontan subjects, arterial oxygen saturation at rest (SaO<sub>2rest</sub>) was correlated with V̇A/V̇CO<sub>2</sub> regression slope (r = -0.41, p = 0.04) and with FetCO<sub>2VAT</sub> (p = -0.53, p&lt;0.01). We conclude that Fontan patients show exercise hyperventilation due to augmented central and/or peripheral ventilatory drive, which is further augmented by residual hypoxemia.
