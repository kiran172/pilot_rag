Title: Modified slide tracheoplasty technique in the management of a long-segment tracheoesophageal fistula.

Abstract: Post-tracheotomy tracheoesophageal fistula remains a challenge because it frequently involves a considerable length of the trachea. We report a case in which a modified slide tracheoplasty was successfully used to repair a long-segment, subglottic post-tracheotomy tracheoesophageal fistula. This technique not only shortened the length of the resected tracheal segment but also maintained the patency of the tracheal lumen.
