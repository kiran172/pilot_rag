Title: Photon-counting CT-angiography in pre-TAVR aortic annulus assessment: effects of retrospective vs. prospective ECG-synchronization on prosthesis valve selection.

Abstract: To compare the diagnostic value of ultrahigh-resolution CT-angiography (UHR-CTA) compared with high-pitch spiral CTA (HPS-CTA) using a first-generation, dual-source photon-counting CT (PCD-CT) scanner for preprocedural planning of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Clinically referred patients with severe aortic valve stenosis underwent both, retrospective ECG-gated cardiac UHR-CTA (collimation: 120 × 0.2 mm) and prospective ECG-triggered aortoiliac HPS-CTA (collimation: 144 × 0.4 mm, full spectral capabilities) for TAVR planning from August 2022 to March 2023. Radiation dose was extracted from the CT reports, and the effective dose was calculated. Two radiologists analyzed UHR-CTA and HPS-CTA datasets, assessing the image quality of the aortic annulus, with regard to the lumen visibility and margin delineation using a 4-point visual-grading scale (ranges: 4 = "excellent" to 1 = "poor"). Aortic annulus area (AAA) measurements were taken for valve prosthesis sizing, with retrospective UHR-CTA serving as reference standard. A total of 64 patients were included (mean age, 81 years ± 7 SD; 28 women) in this retrospective study. HPS-CTA showed a lower radiation dose, 4.1 mSv vs. 12.6 mSv (p &lt; 0.001). UHR-CTA demonstrated higher image quality to HPS-CTA (median score, 4 [IQR, 3-4] vs. 3 [IQR, 2-3]; p &lt; 0.001). Quantitative assessments of AAA from both CTA datasets were strongly positively correlated (mean 477.4 ± 91.1 mm2 on UHR-CTA and mean 476.5 ± 90.4 mm2 on HPS-CTA, Pearson r2 = 0.857, p &lt; 0.001) with a mean error of 22.3 ± 24.6 mm2 and resulted in identical valve prosthesis sizing in the majority of patients (91%). Patients with lower image quality on HPS-CTA (score value 1 or 2, n = 28) were more likely to receive different sizing recommendations (82%). Both UHR-CTA and HPS-CTA acquisitions using photon-counting CT technology provided reliable aortic annular assessments for TAVR planning. While UHR-CTA offers superior image quality, HPS-CTA is associated with lower radiation exposure. However, severely impaired image quality on HPS-CTA may impact on prosthesis sizing, suggesting that immediate post-scan image evaluations may require complementary UHR-CTA scanning.
