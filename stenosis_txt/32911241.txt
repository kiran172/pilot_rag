Title: Diagnostic considerations prior to pediatric tracheocutaneous fistula closure.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: An airway assessment often occurs prior to tracheocutaneous fistula (TCF) closure in children. Bronchoscopy (MLB) with or without fistula-occluded polysomnography (PSG) helps determine candidacy and localize potential obstruction. To date, little has been published on MLB or PSG findings in children before surgically closing a TCF.
METHODS: A case series with chart review of children between 2017 and 2020 who underwent repair of a TCF after tracheostomy decannulation.
RESULTS: Thirty-six children were included for review. Mean age was 5.9 years (95% CI: 4.5-7.3), 58.3% were male, and 50% had chronic lung disease. Surgery occurred 13.3 months (95% CI: 11.9-14.8) after decannulation, with 80.6% by primary closure and 19.4% by secondary intention. There was one unsuccessful closure and two patients (5.6%) presented with a postoperative complication. An MLB was performed in 97.2% of children, where 22.9% identified supraglottic pathology, 11.4% had grade 2 subglottic stenosis, and 11.4% had difficult exposure of the larynx. Further, one child had a non-obstructing subglottic cyst, one had a supraglottoplasty for redundant arytenoid mucosa, and two children had suprastomal granulomas requiring removal. A PSG was obtained in 36.1%, with a mean Apnea-Hypopnea Index of 2.4 events/hour (95% CI: 0.9-3.9), nadir Oxygen saturation of 90.5% (95% CI: 87.9-93.0), and peak end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> of 46.1Â mmHg (95% CI: 43.7-48.5).
CONCLUSION: The selection of candidates for pediatric TCF closure requires careful evaluation of the airway. Surgeons should be familiar with the potential findings on MLB and PSG prior to closure.
