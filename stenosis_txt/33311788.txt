Title: Esophageal Dilation for Strictures: A 36-Year Prospective Experience in Private Practice Setting.

Abstract: The author dilated 3,112 patients with esophageal strictures over 36 years. Most strictures were peptic, esophageal rings, cervical webs or eosinophilic. Strictures were assessed for presence of hiatal hernia, hernia size, stricture diameter, and type and size of dilator used. Complex strictures were present in 19.7% of patients. Re-dilation was needed in 30% of patients within five years. Three adverse reactions occurred, one perforation and two bleeds in 3,112 patients (0.1%) and 5,960 dilations (0.05%).
