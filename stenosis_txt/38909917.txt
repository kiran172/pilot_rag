Title: Proximalization of arterial inflow for treatment of hemodialysis access-induced distal ischemia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Hemodialysis access-induced distal ischemia (HAIDI) is a known complication of hemodialysis (HD) access. Distal revascularization and interval ligation (DRIL) is the preferred treatment for HAIDI by many surgeons. Proximalization of arterial inflow (PAI) is a promising alternative technique that, unlike DRIL, preserves the native arterial inflow. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with PAI on a series of 64 patients.
METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients with both arteriovenous (AV) fistulas and grafts who underwent PAI for HAIDI from 2017 to 2023. A 4 × 7 tapered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft was used to connect HD access inflow to the axillary artery in the majority of cases. The primary outcome of the study is resolution of HAIDI (complete, partial, or no resolution). Secondary outcomes include functional patency (primary and secondary) and 30-day complications following PAI.
RESULTS: Of the 71 patients identified to have had PAI between May 2017 to August 2023, seven were lost to follow-up. In total, 64 patients were included, with an average age of 65 years (standard deviation, 15 years), 59.4% (38/64) female, and 37.5% (24/64) African American. The study population was notable for numerous comorbid conditions including 95.3% (61/64) hypertension; 50% (32/64) coronary artery disease; 79.7% (51/64) diabetes; and 43.8% (28/64) smoking history. Following PAI intervention for HAIDI, 55 of 64 patients (85.9%) experienced complete resolution of ischemic symptoms; five of 64 patients (7.8%) had partial resolution; two of 64 patients (3.1%) had no resolution, and two of 64 patients (3.1%) had unknown resolution. Primary patency at 1, 12, and 24 months was 94%, 81%, and 71%, respectively. Secondary patency at 1, 12, and 24 months was 97%, 87%, and 84%, respectively. The 30-day complication rate was 10.9% (7/64), with five of 64 (7.8%) thromboses, one of 64 (1.6%) thrombosis and infection, and one of 64 (1.6%) upper extremity swelling secondary to central venous stenosis (resolved with angioplasty of central venous system). Failure rate due to thrombosis at 12 and 24 months was 14% (9/64) and 15.6% (10/64), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study, the largest case series of PAI to date, demonstrates that PAI is a reliable option for HAIDI intervention and has comparable safety and efficacy results to DRIL, despite the use of a synthetic graft. Furthermore, PAI has the added benefit of maintaining the native arterial pathway. Further investigation of PAI is warranted as a promising alternative to DRIL for HAIDI management.
