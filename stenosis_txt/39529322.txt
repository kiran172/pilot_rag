Title: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastroenterostomy for the treatment of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to acute pancreatitis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE) is a minimally invasive technique for treating gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of EUS-GE in managing benign GOO caused by duodenal stenosis in patients with acute pancreatitis.
METHODS: This international retrospective study analyzed patients treated with EUS-GE for GOO caused by acute pancreatitis until December 2023, evaluating technical and clinical success, adverse events, and reintervention.
RESULTS: 39 patients (median age 55 years, 15 women) were included. There was a 92.3% technical success rate, with only three patients unable to undergo EUS-GE owing to a long distance between the stomach and small bowel or an inadequate window for puncture. Clinical success was observed in 34 patients (87.2%). The median Gastric Outlet Obstruction Scoring System (GOOSS) improved from 0 before EUS-GE to 2 afterward (P &lt;0.001). Follow-up (â‰¥3 months) was available in 25 patients. During a median follow-up of 23 months, four patients required reintervention. It was possible to remove the lumen-apposing metal stent in 18 patients. The only adverse event was a gastrocolic fistula detected incidentally after 3 months.
CONCLUSION: EUS-GE is an effective and safe method for managing benign GOO in the setting of acute pancreatitis.
