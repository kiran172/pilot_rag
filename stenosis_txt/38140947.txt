Title: Association between frailty and locomotive syndrome in elderly patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: A retrospective longitudinal analysis.

Abstract: AIMS: With the aging society worldwide, lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) has become common, and its incidence has been increasing worldwide. Frailty and locomotive syndrome significantly overlap as disorders in older people. The current study aimed to validate the association between frailty and locomotive syndrome in patients with LSS. In particular, the involvement of frailty in locomotive syndrome following surgery was examined.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the time-course data of consecutive patients aged ≥65 years who underwent lumbar spinal surgery for LSS. The locomotive syndrome stages were determined using the 25-Question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale: stage 0, score ≤6; stage 1, score ≥7; stage 2, score ≥16; and Stage 3, score ≥24. Robust, pre-frailty, and frailty were defined as a modified frailty index-11 score of 0, <0.21, and >0.21, respectively.
RESULTS: This study included 234 patients. All patients except one were diagnosed with locomotive syndrome preoperatively. Approximately 24.8% of participants were diagnosed with frailty. LSS surgery improved locomotive syndrome regardless of frailty severity. Meanwhile, multivariable analysis indicated that frailty could significantly inhibit improvement in locomotive syndrome after surgery in old patients with LSS (estimated relative risk: 0.6; 95% confidence interval: 0.4-0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: This study first assessed the association between locomotive syndrome and frailty in patients with LSS. Locomotive syndrome could be managed effectively with surgery regardless of frailty severity in old patients with LSS. However, our findings emphasize the need to screen for frailty preoperatively in this patient group. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2024; 24: 116-122.
