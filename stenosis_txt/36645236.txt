Title: The interaction of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide with outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Low forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP) have been individually associated with poor outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We hypothesized a combination of the 2 would provide prognostic indication after TAVR.
METHODS: We categorized 871 patients who received TAVR from 2008 to 2018 into 4 groups according to baseline FEV1 (<60% or ≥60% predicted) and NT-Pro-BNP (<1601 or ≥1601 pg/ml): group A (n = 312, high FEV1, low NT-Pro-BNP), group B (n = 275, high FEV1, high NT-Pro-BNP), group C (n = 123 low FEV1, low NT-Pro-BNP) and group D (n = 161, low FEV1, high NT-Pro-BNP). The primary end point was survival at 1 and 5 years.
RESULTS: Patients in group A had more severe aortic stenosis and achieved the best long-term survival at 1 [93% (95% CI: 90-96)] and 5 [45.3% (95% CI: 35.4-58)] years. Low FEV1 and high NT-Pro-BNP (group D) patients had more severe symptoms, higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of operative mortality, lower ejection fraction and aortic valve gradient at baseline. Patients in group D had the worst survival at 1 [76% (95% CI: 69-83)] and 5 years [13.1% (95% CI: 7-25)], hazard ratio compared to group A: 2.29 (95% CI: 1.6-3.2, P < 0.001) with 25.7% of patients in New York Heart Association class III-IV. Patients in groups B and C had intermediate outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of FEV1 and NT-Pro-BNP stratifies patients into 4 groups with distinct risk profiles and clinical outcomes. Patients with low FEV1 and high NT-Pro-BNP have increased comorbidities, poor functional outcomes and decreased long-term survival after TAVR.
