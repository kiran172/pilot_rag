Title: Synergistic Coronary Artery Calcium Modification With Combined Atherectomy and Intravascular Lithotripsy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe coronary artery calcification (CAC) remains challenging during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and often requires 1 or more advanced calcium modification tools.
OBJECTIVES: We describe the combination use of rotational (RA) or orbital atherectomy (OA), with intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), termed rotatripsy and orbital-tripsy, respectively, for modifying CAC prior to stent implantation during PCI.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated with rotatripsy or orbital-tripsy at our center between July 2019 and March 2022. The primary efficacy endpoint was procedural success (successful stent implantation, <30% residual stenosis visually, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 3 flow; absence of types C to F dissection/perforation or loss of side branch ≥2.0mm visually) without in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE, defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction [MI], target-vessel revascularization).
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients (14 rotatripsy and 11 orbital-tripsy) were included in our study. The mean age was 72.2 ± 7.6 years and 76% were men. PCI was guided by intravascular imaging in 24 patients (96%). All cases were treated with either RA or OA before utilization of IVL. Procedural success was achieved in 22 cases (88%) with 1 sidebranch loss without periprocedural MI (4%) and 2 in-patient deaths (8%) unrelated to the procedure (1 intracerebral hemorrhage and 1 cardiac arrest).
CONCLUSION: We describe efficacious use of both rotatripsy and orbital-tripsy to modify severe CAC during PCI in a real-world setting. Intravascular imaging can guide appropriate use of these devices to complement each other to modify severe CAC to achieve optimal outcomes.
