Title: Conservative Management of Rectovaginal Deep Endometriosis: Shaving Should Be Considered as the Primary Surgical Approach in a High Majority of Cases.

Abstract: Deep endometriosis infiltrating the rectum remains a challenging situation to manage, and it is even more important when ureters and pelvic nerves are also infiltrated. Removal of deep rectovaginal endometriosis is mandatory in case of symptoms strongly impairing quality of life, alteration of digestive, urinary, sexual and reproductive functions, or in case of growing. Extensive preoperative imaging is required to choose the right technique between laparoscopic shaving, disc excision, or rectal resection. When performed by skilled surgeons and well-trained teams, a very high majority of cases of deep endometriosis nodule (>95%) is feasible by the shaving technique, and this is associated with lower complication rates regarding rectal resection. In most cases, removing a part of the rectum is questionable according to the risk of complications, and the rectum should be preserved as far as possible. Shaving and rectal resection are comparable in terms of recurrence rates. As shaving is manageable whatever the size of the lesions, surgeons should consider rectal shaving as first-line surgery to remove rectal deep endometriosis. Rectal stenosis of more than 80% of the lumen, multiple bowel deep endometriosis nodules, and stenotic sigmoid colon lesions should be considered as indication for rectal resection, but this represents a minority of cases.
