Title: Tibial nerve SEPs in diagnosing lumbar spinal stenosis: The utility of segmental evaluation using P15 and N21.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To establish the utility of the additional evaluation of the P15 potential generated at the greater sciatic foramen in the tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in diagnosing lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed tibial nerve SEP findings in patients having MRI-confirmed LSS at the cauda equina or conus/epiconus region. P15 and N21 potentials were recorded and the following findings were defined as localizing abnormalities: 1) normal P15 latency either with prolonged P15-N21 interval or with absent N21; 2) decreased ratio of the N21 amplitude to P15 amplitude. As non-localizing abnormalities, N21 and P38 latencies were also evaluated. Tibial nerve F-wave findings were also investigated.
RESULTS: According to the entry criteria, 18 patients were included, 15 with cauda equina lesions and 3 with conus/epiconus lesions. Localizing abnormalities in SEPs were found in 67% of patients, achieving significantly higher sensitivity than delayed P38 latency (28%), and higher sensitivity than N21 abnormalities (39%), though this was not significant. Localizing abnormalities were observed even in 6 out of 11 patients lacking both sensory symptoms and signs. Tibial nerve F-wave was abnormal in 36% of 14 patients with F-wave examinations, whereas the localizing abnormalities in SEPs were found in 64% of the same patient population. P15 amplitude was depressed in 4 patients (22%), which may indicate the involvement of the dorsal root ganglion in LSS, although its latency was normal even for these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Tibial nerve SEPs with the recording of P15 and N21 potentials achieved sufficiently high sensitivity in diagnosing LSS. They have the advantage over F-wave in that they can localize the lesion at the cauda equina or conus/epiconus level.
SIGNIFICANCE: Tibial nerve SEPs are promising in evaluating LSS, especially in documenting sensory tract involvement in cases lacking sensory symptoms/signs.
