Title: Analysis of carotid vulnerable plaque MRI high-risk features and clinical risk factors associated with concomitant acute cerebral infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the high-risk characteristics of high-resolution MRI carotid vulnerable plaques and the clinical risk factors and concomitant acute cerebral infarction (ACI).
METHODS: Forty-five patients diagnosed with a single vulnerable carotid plaque by MRI were divided into two groups based on whether they had ipsilateral ACI. The clinical risk factors and the observation values or frequency of occurrence of high-risk MRI phenotypes of plaque volume, LRNC, IPH and ulcer were statistically compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 45 vulnerable carotid artery plaques were found in 45 patients, 23 patients with ACI and 22 patients without ACI. There were no significant differences in age, sex, smoking, serum TC, TG and LDL between the two groups (all P > 0.05), but the ACI group had significantly more patients with hypertension (P < 0.05) and the without ACI group coronary heart disease (P < 0.05). The volume of vulnerable carotid plaque in the group with ACI (1004.19 ± 663.57 mm3) was significantly larger than that in the group without ACI (487.21 ± 238.64 mm3) (P < 0.05). The phenotype of vulnerable carotid artery plaque was 13 cases of LRNC, 8 cases of LRNC + IPH, 5 cases of LRNC + Ulcer, and 19 cases of LRNC + IPH + Ulcer. There was no significant difference in this distribution between the two groups (all P > 0.05) with the exception of LRNC + IPH + Ulcer. The 14 cases of LRNC + IPH + LRNC + IPH + Ulcer (60.87%) in the group with ACI and was significantly greater than the 5 (22.73%) in patients without ACI (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: It is preliminarily thought that hypertension is the main clinical risk factor for vulnerable carotid plaques with ACI and the combination of plaque volume with vulnerable carotid plaque and LRNC + IPH + Ulcer is a high-risk factor for complicated ACI. It has high clinical therapeutic value due to the accurate diagnosis of responsible vessels and plaques with high-resolution MRI.
