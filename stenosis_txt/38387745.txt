Title: Multimodality imaging for the global evaluation of aortic stenosis: The valve, the ventricle, the afterload.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease growing in parallel to the increment of life expectancy. Besides the valve, the degenerative process affects the aorta, impairing its elastic properties and leading to increased systemic resistance. The composite of valvular and systemic afterload mediates ventricular damage. The first step of a thorough evaluation of AS should include a detailed assessment of valvular anatomy and hemodynamics. Subsequently, the ventricle, and the global afterload should be assessed to define disease stage and prognosis. Multimodality imaging is of paramount importance for the comprehensive evaluation of these three elements. Echocardiography is the cornerstone modality whereas Multi-Detector Computed Tomography and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance provide useful complementary information. This review comprehensively examines the merits of these imaging modalities in AS for the evaluation of the valve, the ventricle, and the afterload and ultimately endeavors to integrate them in a holistic assessment of AS.
