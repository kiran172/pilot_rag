Title: Tract embolization with gelatin sponge after percutaneous transhepatic portal vein intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bleeding from the puncture tract after percutaneous transhepatic portal vein intervention can become life-threatening. To date, studies about tract embolization with gelatin sponge after percutaneous transhepatic portal vein intervention are only with small numbers of patients, or non-consecutive or pediatric patients with a relatively small sheath in diameter.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of tract embolization with gelatin sponge strips after percutaneous transhepatic poral vein access.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September 2017 and February 2024, 100 consecutive patients (61 men, 39 women; mean age = 53 ± 15 years) underwent a total of 105 portal vein interventions using a percutaneous transhepatic approach. Tract embolization for the removal of 6-8 Fr sheath was performed using gelatin sponge strips in all procedures, including 71 portal vein embolization before major hepatectomy, 27 portal balloon venoplasty or stent placement after liver transplantation, and seven other interventions.
RESULTS: No bleeding occurred after tract embolization with gelatin sponge strips. Minor portal vein thrombosis was detected in three procedures after liver transplantation and in one procedure for portal vein stenosis caused by essential thrombocytopenia. Thrombosis occurred in the punctured portal vein branch in all procedures. Thrombosis was not clinically relevant in any patient, and it was difficult to differentiate whether thrombosis was caused by sheath placement or the inserted gelatin sponge.
CONCLUSION: Tract embolization with gelatin sponge strips after percutaneous transhepatic portal vein intervention is a safe and feasible method for preventing hemorrhage from the puncture tract.
