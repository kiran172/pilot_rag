Title: Differentiation of Pontine Infarction by Size.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We hypothesized that the current criteria may be unsuitable for lacunar pontine infarctions (LPI) diagnosis and that size criteria may indicate different stroke mechanisms.
METHODS: A total of 102 patients with isolated pontine infarctions were divided into a parent artery disease (PAD) and non-PAD groups according to stenosis of basilar artery. Further, 86 patients from the non-PAD group were divided into paramedian pontine infarction (PPI) and LPI groups. Data were collected from the three groups. The "golden" criterion for LPI was established based on the location of the infarction. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the optimal cutoff value to use as an LPI diagnostic indicator.
RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of patients with PAD in both asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (ACAS) and PPI groups. Patients with PPI had a higher prevalence in diabetes and ACAS than those with LPI. Based upon the ROC curve, the optimal lesion size cutoff value for use as an LPI diagnostic indicator was 11.8 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) cutoff points for predicting LPI may differ from that of the middle cerebral artery territory. The diameter of LPI may also indicate different stroke mechanisms.
