Title: Post-procedure protocol to facilitate next-day discharge: Results of the multidisciplinary, multimodality but minimalist TAVR study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Evidence is lacking to standardize post-procedure care after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVE: We report on the findings of the post-procedure sub-study of the multimodality, multidisciplinary but minimalist TAVR (3M TAVR) study.
METHODS: A standardized protocol to guide monitoring, early mobilization, reconditioning, communication, and criteria-driven discharge was implemented in a multicenter, prospective, sequential case series study in 13 North American low, medium, and high-volume centers in 2015-2017. Outcome measures pertaining to post-procedure care included avoidance of invasive lines and delirium, in-hospital bed utilization, patient disposition at the time of discharge, and 30-day use of nonelective medical services.
RESULTS: Four hundred eleven participants were enrolled. In the post-procedure phase, 365 (88.8%) participants were admitted without a temporary pacemaker; urinary catheterization was avoided in 402 (97.8%) participants. Of note, 91.7% received care in a single unit (critical care: 72.5%; cardiac telemetry: 19.2%); 99.0% were discharged home. At the time of 30-day follow-up, 6 (1.6%) participants required admission to a rehabilitation or a skilled nursing facility; 30-day emergency department visits were 13.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the 3M TAVR standardized accelerated reconditioning protocol is a safe and effective strategy to facilitate next-day discharge home after TAVR in centers of varying size.
