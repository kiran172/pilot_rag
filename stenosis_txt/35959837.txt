Title: [Idiopatic subglottic trancheal stenosis].

Abstract: Subglottic stenosis (SGS) is a rare condition. The aetiology of SGS can be congenital, iatrogenic, idiopathic or caused by infectious and vascular diseases. In this case report, a 49-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital due to acute respiratory insufficiency. During intubation attempt SGS was found, and acute tracheotomy was performed. Biopsies from SGS and serology did not support an underlying vascular disease and the patient was diagnosed with an idiopathic SGS. SGS is a rare cause of acute respiratory insufficiency but is important to consider as a differential diagnosis.
