Title: Infective endocarditis following a valve-in-valve procedure.

Abstract: An 83-year-old man had aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis with a pericardial bioprosthesis and subsequent implantation of a CoreValve™ prosthesis as a valve-in-valve procedure. Approximately 4 years later, he developed endocarditis on the CoreValve™ with severe prosthetic stenosis, a periannular abscess and systemic embolization. At reoperation both prostheses were removed and another bioprosthesis inserted after reconstruction of the aortic root. Endocarditis after transaortic valve implantation is an uncommon event with dismal prognosis. Infection of a self-expandable device as a valve-in-valve has not been previously reported. This complication represents a surgical challenge which, however, can be successfully managed.
