Title: Nutritional Status and the Outcomes of Endoscopic Stenting in Benign and Malignant Diseases of Esophagus.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic stenting (ES) is a widely known method for palliative dysphagia treatment in esophageal strictures. Esophageal cancer is often associated with advanced malnutrition, which may increase the risk of complications of the procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate complication rates and the impact of nutritional status on the outcomes of ES.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study was conducted at Copernicus Hospital in Gdańsk, Poland. Adult patients who underwent endoscopic stenting between February 2014 and December 2018 were included. The influence of patient characteristics (age, sex, indications for esophageal stenting, and location of stenosis) and nutritional status (BMI, NRS 2002, GLIM, and dysphagia score) on complication rates and survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (69% men) were enrolled in the study. In 69%, the indication for ES was malignancy (mainly esophageal cancer). The median dysphagia score significantly decreased from 2.8 to 0.6 after the procedure (p &lt; 0.001). Complications were observed in 27% (n = 22) of the patients. Early complications were bleeding (2.5%), stent unexpansion (2.5%), and stent migration during the procedure (3.7%). There were no early fatal complications of the procedure. Late complications included: stent migration (6.2%), tissue overgrowth (6.2%), food impaction (2.2%), fistula formation (3.7%), bleeding (3.7%), and stent malposition (1.2%). A total of 76% of the participants scored ≥ 3 points in nutritional screening (NRS2002) and 70% were diagnosed with severe malnutrition (GLIM -stage 2). A stent diameter of &lt; 2.2 cm compared with ≥ 2.2 was associated with a higher rate of migrations (15.5% vs. 2.5%). The median survival time in the malignant group was 90 days. Histopathological diagnosis and patients' nutritional status (BMI, NRS 2002, GLIM, and dysphagia score) had no significant effect on complication rates and survival after esophageal stent insertion.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic stenting is a relatively safe procedure for the palliative treatment of esophageal strictures. Severe malnutrition, although common, does not affect the outcomes of the procedure.
