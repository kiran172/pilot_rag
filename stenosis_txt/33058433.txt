Title: Contemporary transcatheter aortic valve implantation related thrombocytopenia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation related thrombocytopenia (TAVI-rTP) is an inevitable phenomenon. However, no study has been performed on TAVI-rTP in the current setting of extended clinical indications combined with technology improvements.
METHODS: Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral TAVI, from January 2016 to December 2019 were enrolled.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and one consecutive patients (mean age 81.1 ± 7.1 years, 96 men) enrolled. Platelet count was recorded before and after aortic valve implantation. Dropped platelet count (DPC) occurred in all but 11 patients who were included. Two groups were created: DPC <30 and DPC ≥30%. DPC was compared with in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events. The mean DPC was 26 ± 14%. We found that 67 patients (33.3%) had DPC of more or equal to 30%. In the univariable analysis, the time of the procedure (94.4 ± 32.7 vs 79.4 ± 21.9, p = .002), the amount of the contrast used (125.4 ± 55.4 vs 108.4 ± 44.1, p = .02) and the residual AV gradient (13.3 ± 7.2 vs 14.7, p = .05) were related to a DCP ≥30%. A DPC ≥30% was associated with increased risk of life-threatening/major bleeding (11.9% vs 1.5%, p = .001), major vascular complications (16.4% vs 5.2% p = .009) and death (3.0% vs 0%, p = .044) at 30 days. After multivariable analysis, the factors associated with a higher DPC were time and contrast.
CONCLUSION: Contemporary TAVI-rTP in this cohort of patients continues to be a common phenomenon but severe thrombocytopenia is less frequent. Patients developing a DPC ≥30% are associated with poor outcomes at 30 days.
