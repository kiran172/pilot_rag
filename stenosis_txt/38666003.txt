Title: Hybrid repair of tandem high-grade innominate and carotid artery stenosis in an asymptomatic male.

Abstract: Tandem atherosclerotic lesions of the innominate artery (IA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) are challenging and represent an inherent risk of cerebrovascular accident. Treating asymptomatic patients is controversial; therefore, it is critical to minimize the risk of a cerebrovascular accident if repair is undertaken. An asymptomatic 78-year-old man with a chronically occluded left ICA and tandem stenoses of the IA and right ICA underwent a hybrid intervention with stenting of the IA lesion and right ICA endarterectomy. The intra- and postoperative course was successful, without anyÂ signs of neurological sequelae. Sixteen months later, the patient remained asymptomatic, with patent reconstructions.
