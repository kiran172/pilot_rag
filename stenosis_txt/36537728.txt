Title: Surgical management of severe mitral annular calcification.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical management of severe mitral annular calcification (MAC) presents a challenging problem for even the most experienced surgeons. Preoperative planning is the most effective strategy to mitigate risk in these scenarios. MAC alone should not disqualify a patient from consideration for mitral valve repair, although the presence of concurrent greater than moderate stenosis warrants consideration of mitral valve replacement.
METHODS: While repair and replacement techniques for mitral regurgitation in the setting of MAC overlap with those used to repair a non-calcified mitral apparatus, there are unique considerations to the surgical conduct of these procedures. Specifically, this article describes techniques that may be employed when the severity of MAC precludes typical repair or replacement strategies.
RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2021, 77 patients were operated on by a single surgeon for mitral valve disease complicated by severe MAC. Using the systematic approach described herein, 1-year mortality was 7.8% and overall mortality over a follow-up period extending 1 to 8 years was 9.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent challenges of mitral valve repair or replacement in the setting of severe MAC, a systematic approach beginning with preoperative planning, modification of annular suture placement, and techniques to mitigate severe complications have, in our experience, resulting in a reliable methodology for managing severe MAC with excellent outcomes.
