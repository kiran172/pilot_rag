Title: Emergency esophagectomy for esophageal perforation following balloon dilation due to stenosis post-endoscopic submucosal dissection for esophageal cancer: a case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Esophageal perforation from endoscopic dilation is rare (0.53-0.6% incidence) but serious, with mortality rates of 12.5-20%. Optimal treatment is debated and depends on the medical facility's capabilities, the patient's symptoms, the extent of perforation, and the severity of associated lesions. Treatment options include medical management (fasting, antibiotics), esophageal stenting, surgical closure, or emergency esophagectomy. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce mortality and hospital stay.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old male with lower third esophageal cancer (stage cT1aN0M0) underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and developed esophageal stenosis. Dilation attempts led to esophageal perforation, necessitating emergency esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction. The patient improved and was discharged on day 10 post-operation without complications.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Managing esophageal perforation post-endoscopic dilation is complex. This case highlights the importance of rapid recognition and intervention. Esophageal dilation, while effective for stenosis, carries a perforation risk. Treatment decisions must be tailored to individual patients, considering perforation severity, patient's health, and facility resources. Here, severe perforation and clinical condition warranted emergency esophagectomy. The successful outcome underscores the efficacy of this surgical intervention when performed timely at specialized centers.
CONCLUSION: Emergency esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction for treating esophageal perforation due to stenosis post-endoscopic submucosal dissection for esophageal cancer is considered a safe procedure and can be performed at an experienced esophageal surgery center.
