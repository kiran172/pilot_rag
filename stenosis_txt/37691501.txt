Title: Clinical and Morphological Features of Myocardial Infarction in Patients With a New Coronavirus Infection COVID-19.

Abstract: Aim      To analyze fatal outcomes of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients after COVID-19.Material and methods  Data of pathoanatomical protocols and case histories of 612 patients managed in clinics of the Siberian State Medical University from 01.01.2020 through 31.12.2021 were studied. 68 (11%) of these patients were transferred to the clinics from respiratory hospitals for rehabilitation after the novel coronavirus infection. The main condition for hospitalization was a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA. 544 (89%) of patients had no history of COVID-19. The incidence of MI was 14% (7/68) in patients after COVID-19 and 10% (74/544) in patients who have not had it. In pathoanatomical protocols and case histories of 81 patients diagnosed with MI, macroscopic and histological changes in the heart, pericardial cavity, coronary arteries, and laboratory results were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with a STATISTICA version 10.0 software package.Results The patients after COVID-19 had a lower percentage stenosis, more frequent coronary artery thrombosis, and a positive D-dimer. According to our data, MI emerged 10.0 (2.0; 21.0) days after admission to the hospital, had a larger area, always was transmural, and rapidly resulted in death; the time of necrotic changes in all cases did not exceed 24 h. Upon admission to the hospital, the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was negative, and acute inflammatory changes were stopped at the previous stage of hospitalization.Conclusion      The risk of coronary thrombosis in patients after COVID-19 remains after the relief of acute inflammatory response and elimination of the infectious agent, thereby creating a risk of MI, that often leads to a fatal outcome.
