Title: [Successful Treatment with Nab-Paclitaxel for Stage Ⅳ Gastric Cancer in an Elderly Patient on Hemodialysis].

Abstract: An 84-year-old man on hemodialysis was referred to our department for an advanced gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis. Pre-operative CT showed thickening of the stomach wall at the primary lesion and regional lymph node metastasis, while no clear peritoneal metastasis was found. However, we found peritoneal disseminations during the operation, so gastrojejunal bypass was performed. After the operation, he hoped chemotherapy despite risk factors such as renal failure and old age. We introduced a reduced dose of weekly nab-paclitaxel to him. After 3 courses, CT showed the primary lesion had decreased in size, and after 6 courses, serum CA19-9 level decreased to 61.8 U/mL from 2,343 U/mL at the before treatment. No serious adverse events were observed during the chemotherapy. However, after 8 courses, the tumor markers was gradually re-increased, and CT showed the primary tumor re-increased after 9 courses. Therefore, he received irinotecan alone as the second-line. He is still alive 1 year and 8 months after diagnosis of gastric cancer. It is generally said that the risk of cancer chemotherapy for dialysis patients and the elderly is high. However, we suggest that it could be safely performed by examining the appropriate drug and dose. Weekly nab-paclitaxel regimen could be one of the promising options for these patients.
