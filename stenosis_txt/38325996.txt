Title: Measuring Absolute Coronary Flow and Microvascular Resistance by Thermodilution: JACC Review Topic of the Week.

Abstract: Diagnosing coronary microvascular dysfunction remains challenging, primarily due to the lack of direct measurements of absolute coronary blood flow (Q) and microvascular resistance (R<sub>μ</sub>). However, there has been recent progress with the development and validation of continuous intracoronary thermodilution, which offers a simplified and validated approach for clinical use. This technique enables direct quantification of Q and R<sub>μ</sub>, leading to precise and accurate evaluation of the coronary microcirculation. To ensure consistent and reliable results, it is crucial to follow a standardized protocol when performing continuous intracoronary thermodilution measurements. This document aims to summarize the principles of thermodilution-derived absolute coronary flow measurements and propose a standardized method for conducting these assessments. The proposed standardization serves as a guide to ensure the best practice of the method, enhancing the clinical assessment of the coronary microcirculation.
