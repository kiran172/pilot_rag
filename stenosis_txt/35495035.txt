Title: Radiomics Nomogram for Predicting Stroke Recurrence in Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for predicting stroke recurrence in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (SICAS).
METHODS: The data of 156 patients with SICAS were obtained from the hospital database. Those with and without stroke recurrence were identified. The 156 patients were separated into a training cohort (n = 110) and a validation cohort (n = 46). Baseline clinical data were collected from our medical records, and plaque radiological features were extracted from vascular wall high-resolution imaging (VW-HRMRI). The imaging sequences included 3D-T1WI-VISTA, T2WI, and 3D-T1WI-VISTA-enhanced imaging. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis were used to select the radiomics features associated with stroke recurrence. Then, multiple logistic regression analysis of clinical risk factors, radiological features, and radiomics signatures were performed, and a predictive nomogram was constructed to predict the probability of stroke recurrence in SICAS. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated.
RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus, plaque burden, and enhancement ratio were independent risk factors for stroke recurrence [odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-3.79, p = 0.018; OR = 1.76, per 10% increase, 95% CI, 1.28-2.41, p &lt; 0.001; and OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.27-3.09, p &lt; 0.001]. Five features of 3D-T1WI-VISTA, six features of T2WI, and nine features of 3D-T1WI-VISTA-enhanced images were associated with stroke recurrence. The radiomics signature in 3D-T1WI-VISTA-enhanced images was superior to the radiomics signature of the other two sequences for predicting stroke recurrence in both the training cohort [area under the curve (AUC), 0.790, 95% CI: 0.669-0.894] and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.779, 95% CI: 0.620-0.853). The combination of clinical risk factors, radiological features, and radiomics signature had the best predictive value (AUC, 0.899, 95% CI: 0.844-0.936 in the training cohort; AUC, 0.803, 95% CI: 0.761-0.897 in the validation cohort). The C-index of the nomogram was 0.880 (95% CI: 0.805-0.934) and 0.817 (95% CI: 0.795-0.948), respectively, in the training and validation cohorts. The decision curve analysis further confirmed that the radiomics nomogram had good clinical applicability with a net benefit of 0.458.
CONCLUSION: The radiomics features were helpful to predict stroke recurrence in patients with SICAS. The nomogram constructed by combining clinical high-risk factors, plaque radiological features, and radiomics features is a reliable tool for the individualized risk assessment of predicting the recurrence of SICAS stroke.
