Title: Right ventricular assessment in patients undergoing transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative treatment option to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in selected high-risk patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of right ventricular (RV) functional imaging to predict clinical response to TAVR and SAVR.
METHODS: One hundred and ten patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS) undergoing successful TAVR and 32 controls undergoing SAVR were prospectively enrolled. Six months follow up (FU) included two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with RV deformation imaging.
RESULTS: Baseline TTE showed no significant differences between groups (TAVR and SAVR) in conventional left ventricular (LV) and RV functional parameters (LV ejection fraction [LV-EF]: p = .21; tricuspidal annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE]: 1.8 ± 0.5 cm, 1.9 ± 0.4 cm, p = .21), and RV strain (right ventricular-global longitudinal strain [RV-GLS] -11.6 ± 5.2%, -11.5 ± 6.5%, p = .70). At FU LV function was unchanged in both groups (p > .05); RV function was significantly improved after TAVR (RV-GLS: -11.6 ± 5.2%, -13.4 ± 6.1%, p = .005; TAPSE: 1.8 ± 0.5 cm, 1.9 ± 0.3 cm, p = .05), and worsened after SAVR (RV-GLS: -11.5 ± 6.5%, -8.9 ± 5.2%, p = .04; TAPSE: 1.9 ± 0.4 cm, 1.5 ± 0.3 cm, p < .001). Functional New York Heart Association (NYHA) class remained unchanged in patients after SAVR (p = .21), and improved after TAVR (p < .001). Baseline RV function was linked with clinical response to TAVR (TAPSE, p < .0001; RV-GLS, p = .04), and the development of RV-GLS was associated with functional worsening after SAVR (p = .05).
CONCLUSION: Baseline RV function and changes of right heart mechanics are closely associated with functional improvements after AVR. SAVR, but not TAVR, seems to have detrimental effects on RV-function.
