Title: Rheumatic heart disease of the mitral valve alongside the papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve: A case report.

Abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Besides thromboses, it's crucial to also consider the rare possibility of tumors like papillary fibroelastomas when evaluating worsening cardiopulmonary symptoms in patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation.
ABSTRACT: Cardiac papillary fibroelastoma is a rare and benign endocardial tumor typically found on the aortic valve. The simultaneous occurrence of rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral valve and papillary fibroelastoma on the aortic valve is infrequent, with limited documented instances. This unique case can enhance our understanding of the clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches, management options, and implications for patient outcomes in these two conditions. We present the case of a 47-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital due to worsening dyspnea and fatigue, during which time she discovered an aortic valve papillary fibroelastoma. Further investigations revealed two thrombi in her left atrium and left atrial appendage, along with significant rheumatic mitral valve stenosis. The patient underwent thrombectomy, mitral valve replacement, and valve-sparing aortic valve tumor resection. Following surgery, the patient's recovery was unremarkable. This case report emphasizes the need for a comprehensive evaluation in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, considering all possible etiologies. While thrombi are typical in mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation, the rare presence of tumors like papillary fibroelastomas should be recognized, underscoring the importance of further assessment when suspicion arises. Importantly, individuals with asymptomatic cardiac papillary fibroelastomas should undergo surgical treatment to minimize the potential risk of tumoral embolization.
