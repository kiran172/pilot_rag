Title: Use of an Aortic Cannula for Tracheal Intubation in a Patient With Severe Tracheal Stenosis and Tracheoesophageal Fistula: A Case Report.

Abstract: A one-day-old girl was brought to the OR for the repair of a type C esophageal atresia (EA) [EA with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF)]. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed to locate the fistula, and it revealed a severe long-segment tracheal stenosis. Therefore, the airway could not have been secured past the fistula using normal-sized endotracheal tubes (ETTs). A nontraditional airway using an aortic cannula was used to intubate the stenotic tracheal segment, and the patient received ventilation during the TEF/EA repair.
