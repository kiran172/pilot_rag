Abstract: Objective:The aim of this study is to o explore the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of idiopathic subglottic stenosis （ISS） Method:The clinical data of 15 patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis treated in our department were analyzed retrospectively. The degree of stenosis was classified by the Cotton Airway grading system of Myer, with 8 cases of gradeⅡ, 4 cases of grade Ⅲ and 3 cases of grade Ⅳ. Result:The time of follow-up of HTSS was 0.5-10 years. All 15 patients were successfully extubated without asphyxia, decannulation and wound nonunion. Conclusion:For patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis in the non-progressive stage, active surgical treatment strategy should be adopted and treated individually. The prognosis is satisfactory.
