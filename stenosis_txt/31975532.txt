Title: Clinical and structural aspects of tracheal stenosis and a novel embryological hypothesis of left pulmonary artery sling.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To identify the imaging features peculiar to congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) complicated with left pulmonary artery sling (LPAS) with the aim of presenting a hypothesis of tracheal stenosis embryology in LPAS.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed CTS patients (with complete cartilaginous rings) admitted between April 2010 and July 2018. All the patients were classified into the LPAS or non-LPAS group, and their clinical characteristics and qualitative variables on computed tomography (CT) imaging were compared.
RESULTS: Of the 72 patients enrolled, 61 had bilateral lungs. Among the bilateral lung patients, 26 (43%) had LPAS. The tracheal bifurcation was significantly deeper, the stenotic region was longer, and the bronchial angle (especially in the right) was wider, in the LPAS group. The cut-off values for the thoracic vertebral level at the tracheal bifurcation (>4.8), subcarinal angle (>118.1), and right bronchial angle (>61.9) were useful for diagnosing suspected cases of LPAS. In the time-dependent course, LPAS complicated with a congenital heart defect was a statistically significant risk factor of respiratory symptoms (hazard ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-7.37; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: The CT findings described here should immediately raise suspicion of LPAS on chest X-ray and also suggest tracheal "squeezing and milking" by the surrounding vessels in the embryo. Patients with LPAS complicated with a heart defect should be followed carefully to determine the optimal timing of intervention.
