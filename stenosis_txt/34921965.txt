Title: Impact of the first COVID-19 pandemic peak and lockdown on the interventional management of carotid artery stenosis in France.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trends of carotid revascularization (endarterectomy [CEA], transfemoral carotid artery stenting [TFCAS]) for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis before, during, and after the end of the first lockdown in 2020 in France.
METHODS: Nationwide data were provided by the French National Hospital Discharge database (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information). We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted for CEA or TFCAS in all French public and private hospitals during a 9-month period (January-September) in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Procedures were identified using the French Common Classification of Medical Procedures. Stenoses were considered symptomatic in the presence of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack codes (according to the International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Revision) during the stay, and asymptomatic in the absence of these codes. Hospitalization rates in 2020 were compared with the rates in the same period in the 3 previous years.
RESULTS: Between January and September 2020, 12,546 patients were hospitalized for carotid artery surgery (CEA and TFCAS) in France. Compared with the 3 previous years, there was a decrease in hospitalization rates for asymptomatic (-68.9%) and symptomatic (-12.6%) CEA procedures in April, starting at the pandemic peak concomitant with the first national lockdown. This decrease was significant for asymptomatic CEA (P < .001). After the lockdown, while CEA for asymptomatic stenosis returned to usual activity, CEA for symptomatic stenosis presented a significant rebound, up 18.52% in August compared with previous years. Lockdown also had consequences on TFCAS procedures, with fewer interventions for both asymptomatic (-60.53%) and symptomatic stenosis (-16.67%) in April.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a severe decrease for all interventions during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. However, the trends in the postlockdown period were different for the various procedures. These data can be used to anticipate future decisions and organization for cardiovascular care.
