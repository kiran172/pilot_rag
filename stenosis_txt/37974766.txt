Title: Incidence of Airway Complications in ICU.

Abstract: To show the incidence of airway complications in ICU. Endotracheal intubation is an essential skill performed by multiple medical specialists to secure a patient's airway as well as provide oxygenation and ventilation through the oral route or nose. The goal of endotracheal intubation in the emergency setting is to secure the patient's airway and obtain first-pass success. There are many indications for endotracheal intubation, including poor respiratory drive, questionable airway patency, hypoxia, and Hypercapnia. These indications are assessed by evaluating the patient's mental status, conditions that may compromise the airway, level of consciousness, respiratory rate, respiratory acidosis, and level of oxygenation. In the setting of trauma, a Glasgow Coma Scale of 8 or less is generally an indication for intubation. There are many different complications of intubation as hoarseness of voice, dental injuries, arytenoid dislocation, laryngeal stenosis, tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia. . 150 patients who were sat in the ICU that developed certain complications. 86 patients (57.3%) were sitting in the ICU develoed certain complications. Liver diseases were the main cause of ICU admission 34 (22.7%) patients then shock 32 (21.3%) patients. Blockage of endotracheal tube was the main ICU complications 18 (12%) patients then sinusitis 16 (10.7%) patients. Endotracheal intubation is a lifesaving procedure and its complications are significant problems in ICUs. A successful procedure of intubation avoids complications. Skilled endotracheal intubation in the ICU decreases the complications.
