Title: Handmade tri-leaflet ePTFE conduits versus homografts for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the performance of handmade tri-leaflet expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) conduits in the absence of a suitable homograft.
METHODS: Patients who underwent right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with tri-leaflet ePTFE conduits or homografts between December 2016 and August 2020 were included. The primary endpoint was the incidence of moderate or severe conduit stenosis (≥ 36 mmHg) and/or moderate or severe insufficiency. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of severe conduit stenosis (≥ 64 mmHg) and/or severe insufficiency.
RESULTS: There were 102 patients in the ePTFE group and 52 patients in the homograft group. The median age was younger [34.5 (interquartile range: 20.8-62.8) vs. 60.0 (interquartile range: 39.3-81.0) months, P = 0.001] and the median weight was lower [13.5 (10.0-19.0) vs. 17.8 (13.6-25.8) kg, P = 0.003] in the ePTFE group. The conduit size was smaller (17.9 ± 2.2 vs. 20.5 ± 3.0 mm, P < 0.001) and the conduit Z score was lower (1.48 ± 1.04 vs. 1.83 ± 1.05, P = 0.048) in the ePTFE group. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoints (log rank, P = 0.33) and secondary endpoints (log rank, P = 0.35). Multivariate analysis identified lower weight at surgery [P = 0.01; hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.94] and homograft conduit use (P = 0.04; hazard ratio: 8.43; 95% CI 1.14-62.29) to be risk factors for moderate or severe conduit insufficiency. No risk factors were found for moderate or severe conduit stenosis or conduit dysfunction on multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Handmade tri-leaflet ePTFE conduits showed acceptable early and midterm outcomes in the absence of a suitable homograft, but a longer follow-up is needed.
