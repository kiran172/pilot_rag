Title: The Significance of Recognizing Myocardial Bridge in the Coronary Spasm Diagnosis in Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries.

Abstract: A 61-year-old man experienced chest oppression for 1 hour. He was positive for troponin T and underwent emergent coronary angiography (CAG), which did not reveal significant coronary stenosis. He was diagnosed with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). We performed a spasm-provocation test, which revealed a focal spasm at the segment of the myocardial bridge. After receiving a calcium-channel blocker, he exhibited a good clinical course. Coronary spasm is considered an underlying cause of MINOCA; therefore, the presence of a myocardial bridge may help with the diagnosis.
