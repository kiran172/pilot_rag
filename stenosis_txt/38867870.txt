Title: Moderate aortic stenosis in the dysfunctional ventricle: should it be treated?

Abstract: Moderate aortic stenosis is associated with a worse prognosis than milder degrees. Pathophysiologically, this condition in a dysfunctional ventricle could lead to a further mechanism of haemodynamic worsening, so its treatment should lead to clinical advantages for the patient. The low risk of complications associated with percutaneous correction of aortic valve disease (transcatheter aortic valve implantation) should also be considered, which would seem to favour an interventional approach even in the aforementioned condition. However, sparse data and small population studies make this approach still controversial. Three randomized controlled trials are underway to shed definitive light on the topic.
