Title: Rehabilitation in a Pediatric Patient Who Underwent Correction Surgery for Tetralogy of Fallot: A Case Report.

Abstract: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a congenital heart defect characterized by four distinct heart abnormalities, which include an overriding aorta (where the aorta crosses both ventricles), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), right ventricular hypertrophy (the right ventricle muscle is thickened), and pulmonary stenosis (the pulmonary valve and artery are narrowed). Individuals suffering from TOF may exhibit pinkness, cyanosis at baseline, or episodes of hypercyanosis. The pathoanatomy of the TOF allows blood from the pulmonary and systemic circulations to mix. Cyanosis is caused by the addition of deoxygenated blood from a shunt that runs from right to left to the systemic circulation. In this case report, we present a five-year-old female patient with a known case of TOF. The results were recorded using the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Questionnaire, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Dyspnoea Scale, Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale, and arterial blood gas analysis. Therapy goals were to improve overall functional ability, to remove secretions from airway, and the return of acceptable cardiovascular function. This case report focuses on the success of the cardiorespiratory rehabilitation program based on the patient's current state of health. The outcomeÂ parameters confirm that patients can experience improved functional recovery.
