Title: Hybrid surgery with PEEK rods for lumbar degenerative diseases: a 2-year follow-up study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Finite element analyses and biomechanical tests have shown that PEEK rods promote fusion and prevent adjacent segment degeneration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects and complications of hybrid surgery with PEEK rods in lumbar degenerative diseases.
METHODS: From January 2015-December 2017, 28 patients who underwent lumbar posterior hybrid surgery with PEEK rods were included in the study. The patients were diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis, or degenerative grade I spondylolisthesis. Before the operation and at the last follow-up, the patients completed lumbar anteroposterior and lateral X-ray, dynamic X-ray, MRI examinations. In addition, at the last follow-up the patients also completed lumbar CT examinations. The radiographic parameters, clinical visual analog scale (VAS) score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) score were compared.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 44.8 ± 12.6 years, and the average follow-up duration was 26.4 ± 3.6 months. The VAS score improved from 6.3 ± 1.6 to 1.0 ± 0.9, and the ODI score decreased from 38.4 ± 10.8 to 6.8 ± 4.6. The fusion rate of the fused segment was 100%. There were no significant changes in the modified Pfirrmann classifications or disc height index for the nonfused segments and the upper adjacent segments from pre- to postoperatively. No cases of screw loosening, broken screws, broken rods or other mechanical complications were found.
CONCLUSION: Hybrid surgery with PEEK rods for lumbar degenerative diseases can yield good clinical results and effectively reduce the incidence of complications such as adjacent segment diseases.
