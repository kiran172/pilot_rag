Title: Quality of Life Assessment in Patients Undergoing Trans-Catheter Aortic Valve Implantation Using MacNew Questionnaire.

Abstract: The MacNew questionnaire is a disease-specific quality of life measure that has been used in patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure. We aimed to investigate the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using MacNew Questionnaire and identify predictors associated with a change in its score. This was a prospective multi-center study performed across 5 National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom performing TAVI between 2016 and 2018. HRQoL was assessed using MacNew Questionnaire, Euro Quality of Life-5D-5L, and Short Form 36 questionnaires collected at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12 months after the procedure. Out of 225 recruited patients, 19 did not have TAVI and 4 withdrew their consent, and hence 202 patients were included. HRQoL was assessed in 181, 161, and 147 patients at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Using MacNew, there was a significant improvement in all domains of HRQoL as early as 3 months after TAVI which was sustained up to 12 months with improved discrimination of change in HRQoL compared with other scales. Poor mobility at baseline and history of myocardial infarction were independent predictors of reduced improvement in HRQoL at 3 months. HRQoL increased in all subgroups of patients including frail ones. In conclusion, the MacNew assessment tool performed well in a representative TAVI cohort and could be used as an alternative disease-specific method for assessing HRQoL change after TAVI.
