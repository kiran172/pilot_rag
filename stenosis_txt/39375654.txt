Title: Fabry disease in female monozygotic twins with complex intronic haplotype variants: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by the impairment of α-galactosidase A. The complex intronic haplotype (CIH) variants, located in promoter and intronic regulatory lesions, has been found in patients with classical forms of Fabry disease. We present a case of Fabry disease in female monozygotic twins exhibiting the CIH mutation and classical manifestations.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old woman with a history of stroke, carotid artery occlusion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease was referred to the nephrology clinic for management of her chronic kidney disease. Her monozygotic twin sister also presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial flutter, carotid stenosis, and proteinuria. Clinical symptoms and a comprehensive family history strongly suggested the presence of Fabry disease. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of 5 variants within a complex intronic haplotype (CIH): c.-10 C > T, c.369 + 990 C > A, c.370 - 81_370-77delCAGCC, c.640-16 A > G, and c.1000-22 C > T. We conducted a review of the patient's previous kidney biopsy findings, which demonstrated the presence of lamellated inclusion bodies in electron microscopy. Remarkably, both the monozygotic twin sister and her son exhibited the same genetic mutation. Enzyme replacement therapy was initiated for the patient. Her kidney function decreased throughout a thorough 2-year follow-up period, while there was a slight decrease in the left ventricular mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of female monozygotic twins with the CIH variants representing cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal manifestations suggestive of Fabry disease.
