Title: The Retrograde Basilic Approach for Balloon-Assisted Maturation of Brachiocephalic Arteriovenous Fistulas.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and outcomes of an approach utilizing transbasilic access for balloon-assisted maturation (BAM) of brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (BCAVFs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis comprised 28 patients (mean age, 63 years ± 10.8) who underwent endovascular treatment of their immature BCAVFs via a basilic approach from December 2016 to December 2018. The mean age of the BCAVFs was 3.3 months ± 1.4 at the time of BAM. Other demographic data, vascular access characteristics, procedural data, technical and clinical success rates, and adverse events were also evaluated.
RESULTS: All patients had inflow juxta-anastomotic stenoses, with 4 patients (14%) having concomitant outflow tract stenoses and 1 patient (4%) having a short-segment occlusion at the stenotic juxta-anastomotic segment. Technical success was achieved in 27 patients (96%). The mean diameter of the largest balloon used was 5.7 mm ± 0.6. Clinical success was achieved in 22 patients (79%), with 6 patients (21%) requiring a subsequent additional intervention before successful cannulation. No perioperative adverse events were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The retrograde basilic approach is feasible, safe, and effective for BAM of BCAVFs.
