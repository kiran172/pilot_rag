Title: Balloon valvuloplasty for annular- and leaflet-level tricuspid stenosis: Report of cases and literature review.

Abstract: Congenital tricuspid valve stenosis is extremely rare. We describe 2 cases of patients with adult congenital heart disease with hypoplastic tricuspid valve annulus who were symptomatic from annular- and leaflet-level tricuspid stenosis. The patients underwent transcatheter balloon valvuloplasty with good clinical outcomes. An extensive literature review and analysis of various procedural strategies suggests that percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty may be a reasonable therapeutic choice as a first-line therapy or when open surgical repair is associated with prohibitively high mortality. This procedure can be performed either as a destination therapy or as a bridge to valve replacement.
