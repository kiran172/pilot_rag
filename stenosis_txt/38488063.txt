Title: Quality of life in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: tools and evidence.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is the most prevalent valvular heart disease requiring intervention, especially in the elderly population. Surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are well established treatment options for symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, as they provide a significant survival benefit. Aortic stenosis may have an important impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). However, advanced age, comorbidities and frailty may limit the beneficial effect of aortic stenosis interventions in terms of QoL. Current guidelines mention the importance of frailty and avoiding the futility of interventions, but lack specific indications about decision-making. Also, there are limited data on how to specifically assess QoL in aortic stenosis patients since the most used questionnaires are validated in different populations (i.e. heart failure). The aim of this review is to summarize all the available tools for QoL assessment in patients with aortic stenosis; to report current evidence on the impact of TAVI on QoL; and to discuss the role of frailty and comorbidities in this setting.
