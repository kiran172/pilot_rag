Title: Synchronous Low-Grade Central Osteosarcoma and Ewing Sarcoma: A Rare Case Report.

Abstract: A 23-year-old female patient presented with radicular back pain, perineal numbness, and urinary retention. The patient was diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed an enhancing osseous lumbar lesion causing severe central stenosis. A core needle biopsy of the lumbar spine showed microscopic features compatible with a small round blue cell tumor. CD99 and FLI1 were positive in the tumor cells. Next-generation sequencing demonstrated a EWSR1::FLI1 fusion. Given these findings, the spine lesion was diagnosed as Ewing sarcoma. The patient underwent surgical decompression of L2. On further workup, an MRI revealed an ill-defined enhancing mass of the right distal femur. This area was biopsied, demonstrating a fibro-osseous lesion with osteoblast proliferation containing nuclear atypia, low mitotic activity, and SATB2 positivity, diagnosed as low-grade central osteosarcoma (LGCOS). The patient underwent resection, which showed a classic LGCOS by histomorphology. Although fluorescence in-situ hybridization study for MDM2 gene amplification was negative, the overall findings are most consistent with LGCOS. These neoplasms are considered to be synchronous due to the presentation of each entity within 6 months. Considering the aggregate yearly incidence of Ewing sarcoma (approximately 1 case per 750â€…000 per year) and LGCOS (approximately 1 case per 10 million per year), the aggregate yearly probability of developing both of these genetically unrelated tumors in a single individual is 1 per 7.5 trillion per year, and it is likely such an event has never happened in the past.
