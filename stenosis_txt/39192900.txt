Title: Navigating Through the Rare and Accepting the New Shift: Laparoscopic Gastro-Jejunostomy for Gastric Outlet Obstruction Secondary to Eosinophilic Gastritis in a Pediatric Patient.

Abstract: Eosinophilic gastritis, a rare variant of gastritis, presents with inflammation of the stomach lining due to eosinophil infiltration. This case report describes a complex presentation of eosinophilic gastritis in a 12-year-old boy, highlighting the challenges encountered in management. A 12-year-old male presented with symptoms consistent with gastritis, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Despite extensive medical workup to identify potential etiologies (parasitic infections, autoimmune conditions), the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis was established. Unfortunately, the patient exhibited persistent symptoms despite aggressive medical management. The case was further complicated by pyloric stenosis, a narrowing of the stomach outlet. Laparoscopic intervention, a minimally invasive surgical approach, was initially attempted but deemed challenging due to the patient's specific condition. The presence of metabolic abnormalities added further complexity. Alternative approaches, such as endoscopic dilatation, were considered but ultimately deemed unsuitable due to the severity of the stenosis and the desire for a minimally invasive solution compared to laparotomy. This case exemplifies the challenges associated with managing rare gastrointestinal conditions like eosinophilic gastritis, particularly in pediatric patients. The report emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between gastroenterologists, surgeons, and potentially other specialists depending on the specific complications, to achieve optimal outcomes. This case highlights the complexities in managing this patient, especially when accompanied by complications like pyloric stenosis. It underscores the crucial role of a multidisciplinary team in navigating challenging presentations and exploring minimally invasive surgical options when feasible.
