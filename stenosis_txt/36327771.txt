Title: Generating robust human valvular interstitial cell cultures: Protocol and considerations.

Abstract: Research in heart valve biology is a growing field that has yet to elucidate the fundamentals of valve disease. Human valvular interstitial cells (hVICs) are the best option for studying the cellular mechanisms behind valvular pathologies. However, there is a wide range of isolation procedures for these cells published in the literature. To what extent various isolation methods, patient pathologies, and seeding densities influence the behaviour of hVICs remains unclear. Here, we present an optimised method of hVIC isolation from diseased human valves donated at the time of surgery. We show that two rounds of 1000 U/mL collagenase digestion for not &gt;2 h results in a phenotypically stable cell culture with a near complete absence of endothelial cell contamination. We also suggest that cells should be seeded at 10,000 cells/cm2 for experimentation. We found that patient pathology does not affect the success of the isolation procedure, and that instead, successful cultures are predicted by ensuring &gt;500 mg valve tissue as starting material.
