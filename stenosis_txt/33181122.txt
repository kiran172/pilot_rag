Title: Multicentered Assessment of Clinical Outcomes and Factors Associated With Failure of the Adjustable TransObturator Male System (ATOMS).

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess postoperative outcomes from the Adjustable TransObturator Male System (ATOMS) and identify factors influencing failure to achieve continence.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicentered analysis was performed on all patients treated for postprostatectomy incontinence using the third-generation ATOMS at 9 Canadian tertiary referral centers. The primary outcome was continence (defined as requiring ≤1 pad postoperatively for patients requiring ≥2 pads preoperatively and 0 pads for those requiring 1 pad preoperatively). Secondary outcomes included improvement (>50% change in pad use), patient satisfaction, explantation, and postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty nine patients with a mean age of 68.9 years were analyzed. Pre-operatively mean pad per day use was 4.2 (1-12), 31.5% of patients reported severe incontinence (≥5 pads/day), 33.9% had concurrent radiotherapy and 19.4% had failed previous incontinence surgery. Overall continence rate was 73.3% (n = 212) at a mean follow-up of 19.6 months. More than eighty nine percent (89.3%) (n = 258) of patients experienced >50% improvement, 84.4% (n = 244) of patients were satisfied with the results of surgery. More than seven percent (7.9%) (n = 23) required device explantation. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, concurrent radiotherapy (hazard ratio [H.R.] 2.3, P < .001), diabetes (H.R. 2.2, P = .007) and increased pre-operative pad usage (H.R. 1.1, P = .02) were each associated with failure to achieve continence, while patient age (P = .60), obesity (P = .08), prior urethral stenosis (P = .56), and prior incontinence surgery (P = .13) were not. Radiation therapy was also associated with device explantation (H.R. 2.7, P = .02).
CONCLUSION: ATOMS is a safe and efficacious for treatment of postprostatectomy incontinence. However, patients with prior radiation, increased pre-operative pad use, or diabetes are less likely to achieve continence.
