Title: Selective sinus replacement for aortic root repair in bicuspid aortopathy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the results after selective sinus replacement (SSR) for aortic root remodeling in bicuspid aortopathy.
METHODS: Among 662 patients who underwent root repair using SSR between 2005 and 2020, there were 114 with bicuspid aortopathy. SSR was performed either as an isolated procedure (31) or as an adjunct to aortic valve repair (83) and was adjusted to the existing aortic annulus diameter rather than a downsized diameter. In valves with asymmetrical commissural orientation, the repair aimed for the achievement of a 180°-commissural orientation.
RESULTS: Abolishment of aortic insufficiency (AI) ≥2+ using root repair alone was only possible in 2 patients with acute-dissection-related AI, yet isolated root repair was also performed in 29 further patients with no/mild AI. All remaining patients with AI ≥2+ presented cusp-related regurgitation and necessitated an additional valve repair. During the mean follow-up of 91 months (range, 13-196), a relevant valve defect (AI ≥3+ in 8, stenosis in 2) occurred in 10 patients (all after combined repair) resulting in an estimated freedom from a relevant aortic valve defect and/or reoperation of 96 ± 2%, 89 ± 4%, and 82 ± 6% at 5, 10, and 12 years, respectively. Echocardiographically, no patient revealed a considerable change of form or size of the repaired root nor was any root reintervention necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-tailored root repair using SSR is a very effective and durable valve-sparing approach for bicuspid aortopathy. Aortic cusp repair is decisive for both abolishment of AI in bicuspid aortopathy and for the functional durability of the repaired aortic valve.
