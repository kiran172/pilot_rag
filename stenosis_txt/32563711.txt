Title: Shockwave™ Lithoplasty in Combination With Atherectomy in Treating Severe Calcified Femoropopliteal and Iliac Artery Disease: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Calcium is a predictor of poor outcome in the treatment of infrainguinal arterial disease. Rotational atherectomy can effectively debulk atherosclerotic calcium but is less likely to significantly modify medial and adventitial calcinosis. Shockwave IVL provides circumferential sonic pressure waves capable of disrupting deeper calcium and theoretically complements the debulking process of atherectomy. We present acute and intermediate outcome data from patients with severe femoral or iliac artery calcified disease treated with the combination of rotational atherectomy and Shockwave IVL at a single center.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data on rotational atherectomy (Jetstream (Boston Scientific) and orbital atherectomy (CSI)) from a single operator at a single center with core laboratory analysis of angiographic imaging. All patients that received the combination treatment of rotational atherectomy and Shockwave IVL were included in this study. Patient follow-up was done from medical records with data extracted by an experienced research coordinator. Primary safety endpoint was freedom from major adverse events including major dissection (NHLBI C or higher), perforation, distal embolization, or major amputation defined as amputation above the ankle. Primary effectiveness endpoint was procedural success (≤ 30% residual at end of procedure). 23/24 (95.8%) patients were treated with drug coated balloons (DCB) post combination therapy. Secondary endpoint on follow-up was target lesion revascularization (TLR).
RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were included. Mean age was 70.7 ± 9.9 years. Lesions were in the femoropopliteal 79.1%, common femoral 12.5% and iliac 8.3% arteries. 87.0% were claudicants and 58.3% diabetics. Chronic total occlusion was 12.5%, severe calcium 100%, lesion length 84.5 ± 37.1 mm, baseline stenosis 57.1 ± 18.9% and baseline minimal luminal diameter (MLD) 2.2 ± 1.1 mm. Patients were treated with Jetstream (n = 19) or Orbital (n = 5) atherectomy. Embolic filter was used in 58.3% of cases. Post atherectomy stenosis was 36.4 ± 17.5%, post adjunctive IVL 21.1 + 15.7%, and final stenosis 13.0 ± 10.9%. Bailout stenting was 4.6% and primary stenting 13.6% (total stenting rate 18.2%). Final MLD was 4.7 ± 0.8 mm, resulting in an acute gain of 2.5 mm. No infrapopliteal embolization or amputation was noted. At a mean follow up of 591.4 ± 175.2 days, 2 patients died (unrelated to procedure or device). Target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 12 months occurred in 2 patients or 2/22 (9%). At 18-month of follow up TLR occurred in 7/22 (31%) patients.
CONCLUSION: The combination of atherectomy and shockwave IVL followed by adjunctive DCB is safe and appears to be effective in treating severe calcified disease with acceptable TLR on long term follow-up in a population of severe femoropopliteal disease.
