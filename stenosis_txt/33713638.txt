Title: The Outcomes of the Inclusion Ross in Select Patients Aged ≥ 50 Years, Compared to a Younger Cohort.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Ross procedure is rarely considered in older patients. The aim of this study is to compare the perioperative and long-term outcomes of patients aged 50 years and older with younger patients after the Ross procedure.
METHODS: Between 1992 and 2018, 455 patients underwent the Ross procedure utilizing the inclusion technique. Patients with redo surgery, nonaortic procedures, and unsupported root replacement were excluded. The remaining were matched for native valve morphology, valve lesion, and annular manipulation and yielded 96 matched pairs. Preoperative and operative characteristics, perioperative outcomes, survival rates, valve-related adverse events, and valve hemodynamics were assessed.
RESULTS: There was no in-hospital mortality. The median follow-up was 11 years for both cohorts. Overall survival at 15 years was similar: 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 89.8%-99.8%) for patients aged ≥50 years and 98% (95% CI 89.3-99.7%) for younger patients. Patients 50 years and older had a notable freedom from Ross-related reintervention at 15 years: 94% (95% CI 84.8%-97.7%) vs 90% (95% CI 80.2%-95.6%) in younger patients. The mixed model analysis revealed that being 50 years and older was not significantly associated with higher autograft gradient or regurgitation. Interestingly, being 50 years and older correlated with decreased allograft regurgitation and stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients undergoing the Ross procedure had comparable outcomes to younger patients. Patients aged 50 years and over who are high-functioning with minimal comorbidities should be considered for the Ross procedure.
