Title: Clinical Treatment Analysis and Imaging Study of Patients with Acute Angina in Cardiovascular Medicine.

Abstract: With the accelerating pace of life, increasing stress and unhealthy diet make cardiovascular disease one of the important diseases that endanger human health, among which the incidence of acute angina is gradually increasing. At present, there are many clinical treatment studies on acute angina pectoris, but the relevant imaging analysis is very lacking. In order to study the clinical treatment of patients with acute angina pectoris and analyze the relevant medical images, to arrive at a more effective treatment method, this article launched an in-depth study. First, we selected 88 patients with acute angina in a hospital as the research object and randomly divided them into a control group (n = 44) and an experimental group (n = 44) Yan et al. (2020). The control group was treated with conventional acute angina pectoris drugs, while the experimental group was treated with clopidogrel on this basis. The two groups were treated at the same time, and the treatment time lasted for 3 months. Then, the risk factors of the two groups of patients were analyzed, and the differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). Then, the medical images of the two groups of patients were analyzed, and the diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and coronary artery stenosis were compared before and after treatment. After treatment, the diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure of the experimental group were 88.31 ± 3.15 mmHg and 125.63 ± 4.16 mmHg, respectively. The proportion of patients with zero-vessel disease and single-vessel disease in the experimental group increased to 15.91% and 56.82%. The treatment plan received by the experimental group patients had a better improvement effect. Finally, the clinical efficacy was compared. The total effective rates of the control and experimental groups were 72.7% and 88.6%, respectively. This shows that the treatment method adopted by the experimental group of patients has a better curative effect and is worthy of clinical promotion.
