Title: Lumbar Epidural Hematoma as a Rare Complication From Minimally Invasive Lumbar Decompression.

Abstract: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common and debilitating pathology globally. Conservative and surgical treatment options exist for patients. Recently, minimally invasive lumbar decompression (MILD) has been described as a less invasive technique for the treatment of early spinal stenosis â‰¥2.5mm ligamentum thickening or in patients at high risk for general anesthesia. Often, MILD is performed by interventional pain providers and shows low complication rates. We describe a 76-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department immediately after undergoing a MILD procedure at an outside surgery center with lower back/sacral pain resulting from an acute epidural hematoma extending from T12-L3. Early recognition and surgical evacuation resulted in a good outcome with no complications. Our goal is to increase awareness of this rare complication and encourage multidisciplinary approaches to managing LSS between spine surgeons and pain providers.
