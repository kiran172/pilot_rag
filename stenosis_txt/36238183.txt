Title: [Ischemic Colitis due to Fibromuscular Dysplasia Limited to the Inferior Mesenteric Artery: A Case Report].

Abstract: Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatheromatous, noninflammatory arterial disorder that results in stenosis and/or aneurysm formation and rarely involves the mesenteric arteries. Herein, we report a case of fibromuscular dysplasia limited to the inferior mesenteric artery, which manifested with arterial aneurysms and ischemic colitis.
