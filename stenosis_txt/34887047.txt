Title: The Role of Invasive Hemodynamics in Guiding Contemporary Transcatheter Valvular Interventions.

Abstract: Recent advances in transcatheter interventions have refueled the interest in utilizing invasive hemodynamics in the catheterization laboratory. The authors review contemporary invasive techniques used to confirm valve disease and guide transcatheter valve interventions. They also discuss the available data and the remaining questions on the role of invasive hemodynamics in current practice and in the future.
