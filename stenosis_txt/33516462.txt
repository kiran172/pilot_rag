Title: Aortic valve repair in children without use of a patch.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the long-term outcomes of children in whom the aortic valve could be repaired without the use of patch material. We hypothesized that if the aortic valve is of sufficiently good quality to perform repair without patches, a durable repair could be achieved.
METHODS: All children (n = 102) who underwent aortic valve repair without the use of a patch between 1980 and 2016 were reviewed.
RESULTS: The median patient age at operation was 2 years (interquartile range, 1 month to 9.6 years). There were 25 neonates and 17 infants. There was no operative mortality. Mean overall survival at 10 years was 97.7% ± 0.01% (95% confidence interval, [CI] 91.0%-99.4%). Forty-three patients (42.2%) required 56 aortic valve reoperations, including 24 redo aortic valve repairs, 22 Ross procedures, 8 mechanical aortic valve replacements, and 2 homograft aortic valve replacements. Mean freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 10 years was 57.4% ± 0.06% (95% CI, 44.9%-68.1%), and freedom from aortic valve replacement at 10 years was 74.5% ± 0.05% (95% CI, 63.0%-82.9%) at 10 years. Freedom from aortic valve reoperation at 10 years was 33.1% ± 0.1% (95% CI, 14.5%-53.2%) in neonates and 68.9% ± 0.06% (95% CI, 54.5%-79.6%) in older children (P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: In approximately one-third of children undergoing aortic valve repair, the repair could be achieved without patches. In these children, aortic valve repair was achieved without operative mortality. Infants and older children have low reoperation rates, whereas reoperation rates in neonates are higher. Initial repair allows valve replacement to be delayed to later in childhood, when a more durable result may be achieved.
