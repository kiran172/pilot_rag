Title: The Effect of Coronary Lesion Complexity and Preprocedural Revascularization on 5-Year Outcomes After TAVR.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) frequently coincide. However, the management of coexisting CAD in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains controversial.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether the presence of CAD, its complexity, and angiography-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are associated with outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: All patients undergoing TAVR at a tertiary referral center between 2008 and 2020 were included in a prospective observational study. Baseline SYNTAX (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score (SS) and, whenever applicable, a residual SS after PCI were calculated. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the effect of CAD, stratified according to complexity, and PCI on 5-year outcomes.
RESULTS: In 604 patients, the presence of CAD and its complexity were significantly associated with worse 5-year survival (SS 0: 67.9% vs SS 1-22: 56.1% vs SS >22: 53.0%; log-rank P = 0.027) and increased cardiovascular mortality (SS 0: 15.1% vs SS 1-22: 24.0% vs SS >22: 27.8%; log-rank P = 0.024) after TAVR. Having noncomplex CAD (SS 1-22) was an independent predictor for increased all-cause mortality (HR: 1.43; P = 0.046), while complex CAD (SS >22) increased cardiovascular mortality significantly (HR: 1.84; P = 0.041). Angiography-guided PCI or completeness of revascularization was not associated with different outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CAD and its anatomical complexity in patients undergoing TAVR are associated with significantly worse 5-year outcomes. However, angiography-guided PCI did not improve outcomes, highlighting the need for further research into physiology-guided PCI.
