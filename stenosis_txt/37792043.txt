Title: Feasibility and outcomes of living-donor liver transplantation utilizing the right hemi-liver graft with portal vein anatomical variations.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Portal vein (PV) reconstruction is a key factor for successful living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Anatomical variations of right PV (RPV) are encountered among potential donors.
METHODS: To evaluate a single center experience of reconstruction techniques for the right hemi-liver grafts with PV variations during the period between May 2004 and 2022.
RESULTS: A total of 915 recipients underwent LDLT, among them 52 (5.8%) had RPV anatomical variations. Type II PV was found in 7 cases (13.5%), which were reconstructed by direct venoplasty. Type III PV was found in 27 cases (51.9%). They were reconstructed by direct venoplasty in 2 cases (3.8%), Y graft interposition in 2 cases (3.8%), and in situ double PV anastomoses in 23 cases (44.2%). Type IV PV was found in 18 cases (34.6%) and was reconstructed by Y graft interposition in 9 cases (17.3%), and in situ double PV anastomoses in 9 cases (17.3%). Early right posterior PV stenosis occurred in 2 recipients (3.8%). Early PV thrombosis occurred in 3 recipients (5.8%). The median follow-up duration was 54.5 months (4 - 185). The 1-, 3-, and 5-years survival rates were 91.9%, 86%, and 81.2%, respectively. Late PV stenosis occurred in 2 recipients (3.8%) and was managed conservatively.
CONCLUSION: Utilization of potential living donors with RPV anatomic variations may help to expand the donor pool. We found that direct venoplasty and in situ dual PV anastomoses techniques were safe, feasible, and associated with successful outcomes.
