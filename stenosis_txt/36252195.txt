Title: Minimally invasive microsurgical decompression in patients with monosegmental lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is an actual problem of modern spinal surgery and orthopedics.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of minimally invasive microsurgical decompression (MI-MD) in patients with monosegmental lumbar spinal stenosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was performed. We analyzed medical records of patients who underwent MI-MD for monosegmental degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. Clinical and objective results of MI-MD, as well as the types and prevalence of adverse clinical events were studied.
RESULTS: The study included 96 medical records (50 (52%) males and 46 (48%) females aged 18-84 years). Analysis of pain in lower back and lower extremities in 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months after MI-MD showed a significant decrease of this indicator (p&lt;0.001). There was significant improvement of capacity according to ODI score up to 5-12% in 72.9% of patients in early postoperative period (p=0.055). In delayed postoperative period, we also observed significant improvement of working capacity according to ODI score and gradual decrease in disability index (p&lt;0.001). Adverse clinical events occurred in 6 (6.2%) patients.
CONCLUSION: MI-MD is a highly effective surgical method for monosegmental lumbar spinal stenosis with minimal incidence of adverse clinical events.
