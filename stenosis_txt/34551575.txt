Title: Comparison of clinical and radiological outcomes of full-endoscopic versus microscopic lumbar decompression laminectomy for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To determine the clinical and radiological outcomes of full-endoscopic (FE) versus microscopic (MI) lumbar decompression laminectomy in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), we performed a meta-analysis to explore the best choice for patients with LSS requiring surgical relief.
METHODS: Literature searches of the PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were performed. The searches covered all indexed studies published between 2008 and 2020, using keywords identifying the patient group (lumbar spine stenosis) and the interventions (full-endoscopic lumbar decompression laminectomy and microscopic lumbar decompression laminectomy). A total of 1,727 patients were included in 10 studies. The primary outcomes of the analysis were visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for leg and back pain, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis of the VAS score for low back pain showed that in the first 24 hours postoperatively, participants who underwent FE had better pain control than those who underwent MI [FE: mean difference (MD) =-0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.11, -0.45; MI: MD =-1.53, 95% CI: -1.94, -1.12]. In all subgroup analyses, the VAS score for back pain was lower in the FE group than in the MI group (MD =-0.71, 95% CI: -0.96, -0.47). Regarding the VAS score for leg pain, the FE group had a significantly lower score than the MI group in the first 24 hours (Total: MD =-1.02, 95% CI: -1.31, -0.73). The meta-analysis demonstrated that the FE group had a significantly lower ODI score than the MI group (MD =-1.03, 9% CI: -1.54, -0.51). At 6 months, the MI group had a significantly lower score than the FE group (MD =1.09, 95% CI: 0.53, 1.64), but at 12 months, the FE group had a significantly lower score than the MI group (MD =-2.40, 95% CI: -3.12, -1.67).
DISCUSSION: Compared to MI decompression, the FE decompression method resulted in better pain control in the early postoperative period, both in the lower back and legs, as well as shorter operative and shorter hospitalization times.
