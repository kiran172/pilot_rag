Title: Male infant with Noonan syndrome with RAF-1 gene mutation who survived hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-induced fatal heart failure and uncontrollable arrhythmias.

Abstract: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a congenital disease with characteristic facial features as well as heart disease, short stature and thoracic abnormalities. More than eighty per cent of patients with NS show several cardiac disorders including pulmonary valvular stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and/or atrial septal defects. HCM is a serious cardiac comorbidity in patients with NS, especially in those who are diagnosed within 6 months of age with congestive heart failure. Arrhythmia with or without HCM in NS is a rare comorbidity with a complicated clinical course and poor prognosis.In this manuscript, we present the case of a male infant with NS with RAF1 gene mutation, who showed various types of arrhythmias. He developed life-threatening heart failure and uncontrollable arrhythmias. We attempted several antiarrhythmic agents and finally controlled the arrhythmias to establish a normal sinus rhythm with a combination of amiodarone and flecainide.
