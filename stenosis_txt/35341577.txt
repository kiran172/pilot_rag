Title: Relation of Monocyte Number to Progression of Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Rapid progression of aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with poor prognosis. However, the relation between monocyte number and AS progression is unknown. Here, we detected the relation between monocyte number and AS progression. We retrospectively analyzed 220 patients with AS with at least 2 echocardiograms with the maximal interval ≥180 days from January 2016 to June 2021. AS severity was categorized by aortic jet velocity (V<sub>max</sub>) and mean pressure gradient. Rapid progression of AS was defined when V<sub>max</sub> increased ≥0.3 m/s/year. Patients were divided into low and high monocyte groups according to the cut-off value of the receiver-operating characteristic curve. AS progression was compared between the 2 groups. Various models of binary logistic regression were used to reveal the association between monocyte number and rapid progression. During a median of 601 days of echocardiographic follow-up (interquartile range 353 to 909), 52.7% of the population was in rapid progression. Patients in the high monocyte group had more rapid progression in both V<sub>max</sub> and mean pressure gradient (p = 0.020 and p = 0.030, respectively). The percentage of patients with severe AS was increased by 5.4% in the low monocyte group and 16.9% in the high monocyte group. Different models of binary logistic regression showed that the monocyte number was positively associated with the rapid progression. In conclusion, a higher monocyte number was associated with the rapid progression of AS.
