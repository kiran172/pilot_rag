Title: Pediatric Cluster Headache Case Series: Symptomatic Cases and the Migraine Relationship.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Current criteria help differentiate cluster headache from migraine. However, children may have overlapping features making it difficult to distinguish the 2 conditions, which may delay diagnosis. Differentiating cluster headache from migraine is important regarding treatment as well as diagnostic workup of secondary headache etiologies.
METHODS: Cases at a single pediatric children's hospital from 2015 to 2023 diagnosed with cluster headache before the age of 18 years were reviewed.
RESULTS: Twenty-five cases were identified of which 22 cases met criteria for either chronic, episodic, or probable cluster headache. Three cases were diagnosed with cluster headache by their provider, but documentation was insufficient to meet criteria for cluster headache. There were 16 females and 9 males between ages 6 and 17 years. Five cases were identified as symptomatic, 2 cases as chronic, 7 cases as episodic, and 13 cases as probable cluster headache. Symptomatic etiologies include Graves disease, optic neuritis, prolactinoma, hypothalamic pilocytic astrocytoma with carotid stenosis, and congenital right eye blindness. Migrainous features were common, including 76% with nausea, 36% with vomiting, 68% with photophobia, and 56% with phonophobia. Patients with cluster headache also had an independent diagnosis of migraine in 64%.
CONCLUSION: Children with cluster headache have a high frequency of migrainous symptoms and co-occurrent diagnosis of migraine. A careful history may differentiate cluster headache from migraine and treated accordingly. Children with cluster headache features should undergo screening for secondary causes with appropriate imaging and other studies. Except for prolactinoma, the symptomatic associations noted in this case series have not been reported before.
