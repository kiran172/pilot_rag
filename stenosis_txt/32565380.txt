Title: Carotid Free-Floating Thrombus in a Stent 6 Months After Carotid Artery Stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid free-floating thrombus (CFFT) is defined as a blood clot attached to the arterial wall with surrounding blood flow at its distal component. Although rare, it is a clinically significant cause of embolic stroke. CFFT within a stent has not been previously reported.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 64-year-old man who underwent carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic right carotid artery stenosis. Six months after carotid artery stenting, he was admitted to the emergency department 1 hour after onset of left hemiparesis and dysarthria. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10. His medical history was notable for hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Carotid ultrasonography showed a dumbbell-shaped CFFT attached to the carotid stent that was moving in synchrony with his heartbeat. CFFT removal was performed via an endovascular approach with manual suction using a Luer Lock syringe. The CFFT was completely removed without residual stenosis. Histologic examination suggested plaque rupture associated with a lipid-rich necrotic core.
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid plaque formation and plaque rupture can occur within a carotid stent and present as a CFFT.
