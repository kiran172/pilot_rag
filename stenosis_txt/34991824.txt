Title: 1-Year Outcomes of Blinded Physiological Assessment of Residual Ischemia After Successful PCI: DEFINE PCI Trial.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify the post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) target value of instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) that would best discriminate clinical events at 1 year in the DEFINE PCI (Physiologic Assessment of Coronary Stenosis Following PCI) study.
BACKGROUND: The impact of residual ischemia detected by iFR post-PCI on clinical and symptom-related outcomes is unknown.
METHODS: Blinded iFR pull back was performed after successful stent implantation in 500 patients. The primary endpoint was the rate of residual ischemia, defined as iFR ≤0.89, after operator-assessed angiographically successful PCI. Secondary endpoints included clinical events at 1 year and change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency (SAQ-AF) score during follow-up.
RESULTS: As reported, 24.0% of patients had residual ischemia (iFR ≤0.89) after successful PCI, with 81.6% of cases attributable to angiographically inapparent focal lesions. Post-PCI iFR ≥0.95 (present in 182 cases [39%]) was associated with a significant reduction in the composite of cardiac death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization compared with post-PCI iFR <0.95 (1.8% vs 5.7%; P = 0.04). Baseline SAQ-AF score was 73.3 ± 22.8. For highly symptomatic patients (baseline SAQ-AF score ≤60), SAQ-AF score increased by ≥10 points more frequently in patients with versus without post-PCI iFR ≥0.95 (100.0% vs 88.5%; P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In DEFINE PCI, despite angiographically successful PCI, highly symptomatic patients at baseline without residual ischemia by post-PCI iFR had greater reductions in anginal symptoms at 1 year compared with patients with residual ischemia. Achieving post-PCI iFR ≥0.95 was also associated with improved 1-year event-free survival. (Physiologic Assessment of Coronary Stenosis Following PCI [DEFINE PCI]; NCT03084367).
