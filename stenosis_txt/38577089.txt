Title: Applications of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal tract disease.

Abstract: Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POME) is an emerging minimally invasive endoscopic technique involving the establishment of a submucosal tunnel around the pyloric sphincter. In 2013, Khashab et al used G-POME for the first time in the treatment of gastroparesis with enhanced therapeutic efficacy, providing a new direction for the treatment of gastroparesis. With the recent and rapid development of G-POME therapy technology, progress has been made in the treatment of gastroparesis and other upper digestive tract diseases, such as congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and gastric sleeve stricture, with G-POME. This article reviews the research progress and future prospects of G-POME for the treatment of upper digestive tract gastrointestinal diseases.
