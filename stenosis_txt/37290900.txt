Title: Clinical outcomes after aortic valve replacement with severe stenosis of trileaflet aortic valve and low valve calcium score.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Some patients have severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) despite a lower degree of aortic valve calcification (AVC). This study compared the clinical features and prognosis of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe AS with a low AVC score compared with those with higher AVC scores.
METHODS: This study included 1002 Korean patients with symptomatic severe degenerative AS who underwent AVR. We measured AVC score before AVR and defined low AVC as AVC score of <2000 units for male patients and <1300 units for female patients. Patients with bicuspid or rheumatic aortic valve disease were excluded.
RESULTS: The mean age was 75.6±7.9 years and 487 patients (48.6%) were female. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 59.4%±10.4%, and concomitant coronary revascularisation was performed in 96 patients (9.6%). The median aortic valve calcium score was 3122 units (IQR 2249-4289 units) among male patients and 1756 units (IQR 1192-2572) among female patients. A total of 242 patients (24.2%) had low AVC; they were significantly younger (73.5±8.7 years vs 76.3±7.5 years, p<0.001) and were more likely to be female (59.5% vs 45.1%, p<0.001) and on haemodialysis (5.4% vs 1.8%, p=0.006) than those with high AVC. During a follow-up (median: 3.8 years), the patients with low AVC had significantly higher risk of death from any cause (adjusted HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.52, p=0.04), mostly non-cardiac cause.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low AVC exhibit distinct clinical characteristics and a higher risk of long-term mortality compared with those with high AVC.
