Title: A Scoring System for Anterior Longitudinal Ligament Ossification of the Lumbar Spine in Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis: Relationship Between the Extent of Ligament Ossification and the Range of Motion.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the extent of ligament ossification and the range of motion (ROM) of the lumbar spine and develop a new scoring system.
METHODS: Forty-three patients (30 men and 13 women) with lumbar spinal canal stenosis who underwent decompression from January to December 2018. Ligament ossification at L1/2 to L5/S was assessed on plain X-ray (Xp) and computed tomography (CT) using a modified Mata scoring system (0 point: no ossification, 1 point: ossification of less than half of the intervertebral disc height, 2 points: ossification of half or more of the intervertebral disc height, 3 points: complete bridging), and the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the scoring was assessed. The relationship of the scores with postoperative lumbar ROM was investigated.
RESULT: Intra-rater reliability was high (Cronbach's α was 0.74 for L5/S on Xp but 0.8 or above for other sections), as was inter-rater reliability (Cronbach's α was 0.8 or above for all the segments). ROM significantly decreased as the score increased (scores 1 to 2, and 2 to 3). A significant moderate negative correlation was found between the sum of the scores at L1/2-L5/S and the ROM at L1-S (ρ = - 0.4493, P = 0.025).
CONCLUSION: Our scoring system reflects lumbar mobility and is reproducible. It is effective for assessing DISH in fractures and spinal conditions, and monitoring effects on treatment outcomes and changes over time.
