Title: Cardiac malformations in children with congenital hypothyroidism.

Abstract: Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common endocrine disease in children, according to literature, infants with CH have an increased risk of associated congenital malformations (CM), especially cardiac defects (CD), compared to the general population. We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 255 patients with a positive screening result for CH in the period 1991-2016 followed at our Center. At the time of enrollment, the clinical examination included looking for the presence of heart murmurs and dysmorphic features. In all patients an echocardiography with cardiological evaluation were performed. Of all patients, 191 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 51.3% (98/191) presented an eutopic normally sized thyroid gland while 48.7% (93/191) showed a thyroid dysgenesis. Among the studied infants, 13.6% (26/191) presented CD. The most frequent cardiac anomaly was atrial septal defect (ASD) which was found in 65.4% (17/26) of patients with CD. Other defects were ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), pulmonary valve stenosis (PvS), transposition of the great vessels (TGV), aortic valve stenosis (AvS). Six patients had multiple defects. In the analysed group, there was no significant relation with sex, type of CH, median blood-TSH (b-TSH) and serum-TSH (s-TSH) values and frequency of CD. There is a high prevalence of CD in CH, indicating the need of routine echocardiography in these patients to achieve an early diagnosis and management of CD.
