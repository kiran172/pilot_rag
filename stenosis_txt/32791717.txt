Title: Comparision of biportal endoscopic and microscopic decompression in treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: A comparative study protocol.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Microscopic bilateral decompression (MBD) has been suggested as an alternative to open laminectomy and fusion. Recently, percutaneous biportal endoscopic decompression (PBED) has begun to attract attention. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate postoperative pain, functional disability, symptom reduction and satisfaction, and specific surgical parameters between the MBD and PBED techniques in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: A retrospective review of LSS patients performed with MBD or PBED technique between May 2015 and June 2018 was conducted. Institutional review board approval in People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Nationality Autonomous Region was obtained prior to conducting chart review and analysis. We received informed consent from all patients before surgery. The primary outcomes assessed were the preoperative to postoperative changes in leg/back pain and disability/function, patient satisfaction with the procedure, and postoperative quality of life. The secondary outcomes including duration of postoperative hospital stay, time to mobilization, postoperative analgesic use, complication rates, and baseline patient characteristics were prospectively collected.
RESULTS: The hypothesis was that the PBED technique would achieve better clinical outcomes as compared to the MBD technique in LSS.
