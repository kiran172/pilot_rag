Title: Evaluation and Management of Nonculprit Lesions in STEMI.

Abstract: Nonculprit lesions are frequently observed in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Results from recent randomized clinical trials suggest that complete revascularization after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction improves outcomes. In this state-of-the-art paper, the authors review these trials and consider how best to determine which nonculprit lesions require revascularization and when this should be performed.
