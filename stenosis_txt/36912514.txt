Title: The Progression of Pathophysiology of Moyamoya Disease.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease that often leads to hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes; however, its etiology remains elusive. Surgical revascularization by either direct or indirect bypass techniques to restore cerebral hypoperfusion is the treatment of choice to date. This review aims to provide an overview of the current advances in the pathophysiology of MMD, including the genetic, angiogenic, and inflammatory factors related to disease progression. These factors may cause MMD-related vascular stenosis and aberrant angiogenesis in complex manners. With a better understanding of the pathophysiology of MMD, nonsurgical approaches that target the pathogenesis of MMD may be able to halt or slow the progression of this disease.
