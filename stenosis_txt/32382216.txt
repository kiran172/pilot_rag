Title: Cortical bone trajectory instrumentation provides favorable perioperative outcomes compared to pedicle screws for single-level lumbar spinal stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare perioperative outcomes between cortical bone trajectory (CBT) instrumentation with pedicle screws (PS) in patients undergoing laminectomy and posterolateral fusion for single-level lumbar spinal stenosis, and degenerative grade I spondylolisthesis.
METHODS: A consecutive series of 91 patients from a single institution between January 2017 and July 2019 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Patients in CBT group had significantly shorter operative time, lower blood loss and shorter length of stay.
CONCLUSION: CBT instrumentation demonstrated favorable perioperative outcomes that may enhance the overall value in patients undergoing laminectomy and posterolateral fusion for single-level lumbar spinal stenosis, and degenerative grade I spondylolisthesis.
