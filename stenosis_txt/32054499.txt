Title: Endoscopic radial incision method for two strictures of the esophagus after endoscopic submucosal dissection: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The development of severe esophageal stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early esophageal carcinoma is not uncommon. Dilation by Savary-Gilliard dilators or balloon dilators is the first-line treatment for such complex refractory benign stricture, but it has a high risk of treatment failure. So far, endoscopic radial incision (ERI) as a new technology for the treatment of post-ESD esophageal stricture has been rarely reported. We report a case, which we designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ERI technology for two severe strictures of the esophagus after ESD.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man had suffered from two complex refractory benign strictures of the esophagus after ESD for early esophageal carcinoma. The patient was refractory to multiple endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) therapy previously. Thus, the patient underwent ERI successfully and without postoperative complications such as fever, poststernal pain, bleeding, and perforation. During 3â€‰months of follow-up after ERI, the patient had no recurrence of dysphagia.
CONCLUSIONS: Refractory strictures of the esophagus after ESD are common. ERI is a safe and efficient strategy for treating such multiple refractory esophageal strictures.
