Title: Isolated Focal Basilar Artery Stenosis with Acute Stroke Treated with Emergency Thrombectomy and Stenting.

Abstract: Strokes due to basilar artery (BA) stenosis/occlusion are devastating. As it is an uncommon cause of stroke, its optimal management is not clearly defined. We present the case of a 68-year-old male with a background history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and smoking who developed a sudden onset of reduced consciousness, myoclonic jerks, generalised weakness, and nausea due to an occluded mid-segment BA with right occipital and left cerebellar infarcts. Emergent cerebral angiography was performed and he was immediately treated by clot retrieval and, due to underlying arterial stenosis, the immediate placement of a stent within 3 h of symptom onset. He had complete neurological recovery within 1 week, with no neurological deficits. He remained well at follow-up 3 months later. Emergency revascularisation of stroke due to BA occlusion should be considered as a treatment option.
