Title: Gadolinium(III) Complex-Backboned Branched Polymers as Imaging Probes for Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography.

Abstract: Compared to traditional branched polymers with Gd(III) chelates conjugated on their surface, branched polymers with Gd(III) chelates as the internal skeleton are considered to be a reasonable strategy for preparing efficient magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents. Herein, the Gd(III) ligand DOTA was chosen as the internal skeleton; four different molecular weights (3.5, 5.3, 8.6, and 13.1 kDa) and degrees of branching poly-DOTA branched polymers (P1, P2, P3, and P4) were synthesized by a simple "A<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>4</sub>"-type one-pot polymerization. The Gd(III) chelates of these poly-DOTA branched polymers (P1-Gd, P2-Gd, P3-Gd, and P4-Gd) display excellent kinetic stability, which is significantly higher than those of linear Gd-DTPA and cyclic Gd-DOTA-butrol and slightly lower than that of cyclic Gd-DOTA. The T<sub>1</sub> relaxivities of P1-Gd, P2-Gd, P3-Gd, and P4-Gd are 29.4, 38.7, 44.0, and 47.9 Gd mM-1 s-1, respectively, at 0.5 T, which are about 6-11 times higher than that of Gd-DOTA (4.4 Gd mM-1 s-1). P4-Gd was selected for in vivo magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) because of its high kinetic stability, T<sub>1</sub> relaxivity, and good biosafety. The results showed excellent MRA effect, sensitive detection of vascular stenosis, and prolonged observation window as compared to Gd-DOTA. Overall, Gd(III) chelates of poly-DOTA branched polymers are good candidates of MRI probes, providing a unique design strategy in which Gd chelation can occur at both the interior and surface of the poly-DOTA branched polymers, resulting in excellent relaxivity enhancement. In vivo animal MRA studies of the probe provide possibilities in discovering small vascular pathologies.
