Title: The Interest of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery in a New Bariatric Center.

Abstract: Background: With the creation of a new bariatric center in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the organization of this bariatric department according to the international guidelines, a new activity of bariatric surgery started in January 2015. The surgeon had 20 years of experience in this field and he had performed over 5000 major laparoscopic bariatric procedures before starting this new bariatric program. The concept of enhanced recovery after bariatric surgery (ERABS) was applied from the beginning of the program. We decided to analyze the first 2 years of ERAS activity after having split them in two different periods: the 1st year of activity included restrictive procedures and the 2nd year associated malabsorptive surgeries. Materials and Methods: The results of the use of a fast-track program could be measured by different parameters like operative time, length of hospital stay, rate of complications, and rate of readmission and reoperation. Results: Between January and December 2015, 116 patients underwent a bariatric procedure. The mean age was 34.6 years (16-61) and average body mass index (BMI) was 41.7 kg/sqm (32-72.2). Sixty percent of patients were women and 37% of patients had at least one comorbidity (diabetes type 2, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, or sleep apnea). Ninety-four percent of the procedures were laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), 2.6% were laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and 3.4% band removal. The mean operative time was 20 minutes for an LSG (14-45 minutes) and the average hospital stay was 1.2 days (standard deviation [SD]: 0.9-3.3). The rate of complications was 1.7% with 1 postoperative hematoma drained by CT scan on day 14 after the surgery and 1 relative stenosis endoscopically dilated on postoperative day 45. No reoperation was done. No leak was observed. At 1 year, the mean excess weight loss (EWL) was 64% (47-124) in 89 patients with a 76% rate of follow-up. For the 2nd year of activity in 2016, 142 patients went in the program. The mean age was 32.7 years (17-64) and average BMI was 42.3 kg/sqm (31-68). Seventy-two percent were women and 41% of the patients had one comorbidity or more. The majority of surgeries performed were LSG for 83.1% of the patients. RYGB was realized in 4.2% of cases, resleeve gastrectomy in 4.2%, and band removal in 1.4%. Some malabsorptive surgeries were performed as well, such as one anastomosis gastric bypass for 3 patients (4.2%), and single anastomosis duodeno-ilelal in 2 cases (2.8%). The average hospital stay was 1.5 days (SD: 0.9-3.5). No complication was observed. No reoperation was done. Two patients (1.4%) came back to the hospital on postoperative day 2 and 8 after a LSG for one or several episodes of vomiting without further complication. At 1 year, the mean EWL was 68% (49-154) in 98 patients with a 69% rate of follow-up. Conclusions: This new program of bariatric surgery in two steps using fast-track protocols, respecting international guidelines and with an experienced surgeon showed on its 1st year of implementation a 1.7% rate of readmission on 116 patients without reoperation or major complication and a hospital stay of 1.2 days. For the 2nd year of implementation with the inclusion of malabsorptive procedures only 2 patients (1.4%) were readmitted for a short episode of vomiting and the hospital stay was 1.5 days.
