Title: Persistent Hourglass Constriction in Recovered Anterior Interosseous Nerve Palsy Due to Neuralgic Amyotrophy: A Case Report.

Abstract: The current articles recommended the interfascicular neurolysis for anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) palsy with hourglass-like fascicular constrictions (FCs) detected by ultrasonography or surgical exploration to realign to the fascicular torsion for those who failed to recover spontaneously. We present the case report of spontaneous AIN palsy recovered after conservative treatment; however, ultrasonographic findings showed persistent FCs of AIN in the arm at the beginning, at 6 weeks, and subsequent 3-year follow-ups, even after complete clinical recovery of palsy. This finding calls into question the current notion that AIN paralysis is due to FCs and that neurolysis is the best surgical treatment when spontaneous recovery does not occur for a considerable observation period. Level of Evidence: Level V (Therapeutic).
