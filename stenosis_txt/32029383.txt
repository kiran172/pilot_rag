Title: Regadenoson dynamic computed tomography myocardial perfusion using low-dose protocol for evaluation of the ischemic burden. ULYSSES study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of low-dose dynamic regadenoson computed tomography perfusion (CTP) protocol, and to determine which parameters provide the best diagnostic yield for the presence and burden of ischemia in reference to the magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging (MR MPI).
METHODS: Fifty six patients with ≥1 intermediate (50-90%) coronary artery stenosis on CTA underwent dynamic stress CTP and MR MPI. The distribution of contrast agent in CTP was represented for each myocardial segment as either absolute or indexed: myocardial blood flow (MBF), myocardial blood volume (MBV), perfused capillary blood volume (PCBV), peak value (PV), time to peak (TTP), respectively.
RESULTS: Of 56 patients (25 females, 63.5 ± 8.5y), 15 (27%) were diagnosed with reversible ischemia and 3 (5%) with fixed ischemia on the MR MPI. The median radiation dose for dynamic CTP scan was 352.00 [276.4-496.6] mGy*cm. The optimal cut-off point for the prediction of reversible ischemia on MR MPI for the absolute parameters were: MBF ≤156.49 (AUC=0.899), MBV ≤15.06 (AUC=0.901), PCBV ≤7.90 (AUC=0.880), PV ≤ 88.30 (AUC=0.766), TTP ≥22.58 (AUC=0.595); and for the indexed: indexed MBF ≤0.78 (AUC=0.926), indexed MBV ≤0.81 (AUC=0.924), indexed PCBV ≤0.70 (AUC=0.894); indexed PV ≤ 0.79 (AUC=0.869), indexed TTP ≤0.87 (AUC=0.685). The best parameters for ischemia detection were indexed MBF and indexed MBV, with sensitivities 91% and 89%, specificities 97% and 96%, NPV 99% and 99%, PPV 76% and 69%, and accuracies 96% and 95%, respectively. In per patient analysis, indexed MBF correlated significantly better with the ischemia burden than any of the absolute parameters (p < 0.01 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS: Regadenoson dynamic CTP using low-dose protocol is feasible while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. The best diagnostic value may be provided by indexed parameters, of which indexed MBF and indexed MBV may provide best incremental value in identification of the presence and burden of ischemia.
