Title: Role of Quantitative Plaque Analysis and Fractional Flow Reserve Derived From Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography to Assess Plaque Progression.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the role of quantitative plaque analysis and fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) derived from coronary computed angiography (CCTA) in evaluating plaque progression (PP).
METHODS: A total of 248 consecutive patients who underwent serial CCTA examinations were enrolled. All patients' images were analyzed quantitatively by plaque analysis software. The quantitative analysis indexes included diameter stenosis (%DS), plaque length, plaque volume (PV), calcified PV, noncalcified PV, minimum lumen area (MLA), and remodeling index (RI). PP is defined as PAV (percentage atheroma volume) change rate >1%. CT-FFR analysis was performed using the cFFR software.
RESULTS: A total of 76 patients (30.6%) and 172 patients (69.4%) were included in the PP group and non-PP group, respectively. Compared with the non-PP group, the PP group showed greater %DS, smaller MLA, larger PV and non-calcified PV, larger RI, and lower CT-FFR on baseline CCTA (all P <0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that RI≥1.10 (odds ratio [OR]: 2.709, 95% CI: 1.447-5.072), and CT-FFR≤0.85 (OR: 5.079, 95% CI: 2.626-9.283) were independent predictors of PP. The model based on %DS, quantitative plaque features, and CT-FFR (area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve [AUC]=0.80, P <0.001) was significantly better than that based rarely on %DS (AUC=0.61, P =0.007) and that based on %DS and quantitative plaque characteristics (AUC=0.72, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative plaque analysis and CT-FFR are helpful to identify PP. RI and CT-FFR are important predictors of PP. Compared with the prediction model only depending on %DS, plaque quantitative markers and CT-FFR can further improve the predictive performance of PP.
