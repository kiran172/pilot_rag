Title: Unusual overlap of systemic sclerosis with Takayasu arteritis.

Abstract: Overlap syndromes are diseases that meet the criteria of two or more rheumatic diseases. In this case report, a woman in her 20s presented with a constellation of symptoms, including skin thickening, Raynaud's phenomenon, hypertension, absent pulse in both lower limbs with bilateral renal artery bruit. The antinuclear antibody profile revealed Scl-70 positivity. CT thorax identified early interstitial lung disease, and nailfold capillaroscopy showed severe capillary loss. CT angiogram features were suggestive of Takayasu arteritis. Notably, there have been only four documented cases of systemic sclerosis coexisting with Takayasu arteritis, highlighting the rarity of this overlap syndrome. The diagnosis of overlap syndrome was made after a thorough history recording and clinical examination. In the presence of bilateral renal artery stenosis, managing the scleroderma renal crisis may be challenging . This patient received treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and oral corticosteroids, aiming to address both systemic sclerosis and Takayasu arteritis effectively.
