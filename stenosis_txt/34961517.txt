Title: de Winter syndrome or inferior STEMI?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The de Winter electrocardiography (ECG) pattern is associated with acute total or subtotal occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) characterized by upsloping ST-segment depression at the J point in leads V<sub>1</sub>-V<sub>6</sub> without ST-segment elevation.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report an atypical style case of the de Winter ECG pattern accompanied by ST elevation in inferior leads. The patient underwent emergency coronary angiography, which revealed total occlusion of the proximal LAD with no observable stenosis in the right coronary artery.
CONCLUSION: ECG-related changes in acute total LAD occlusion can present with the de Winter pattern and ST elevation in inferior leads. Recognizing this atypical ECG pattern is critical for immediate reperfusion therapy.
