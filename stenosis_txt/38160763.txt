Title: Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Urethral Stenosis After Radiation Treatment for Prostate Cancer.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient-reported quality of life (PRQoL) in patients presenting with membranous urethral stenosis after prostate radiotherapy. Urethral stenosis is an under-reported complication after prostate radiotherapy with a particular deficiency in PRQoL.
METHODS: Patients presenting with urethral stenosis after radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed from 2004 to 2022. PRQoL was assessed via patient survey using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP).
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty patients were identified at a mean age of 67.7years and mean time to stricture diagnosis of 63.6months' postradiotherapy. Of 87 patients completing the survey, 29.9% recalled being aware of urethral stenosis as a potential complication and 51.7% had documentation of urethral stenosis as a potential complication. 33.5% of patients underwent urethroplasty, 59.6% repeat endoscopic treatment and 6.1% an indwelling catheter. 64.4% of patients reported urinary dysfunction as a "moderate" or "big" problem, 66.7% reported frequent or total incontinence, 64.4% required daily pad use and 50.6% reported incontinence as either a "moderate" or "big" problem. 85.0% reported poor or absent orgasmic dysfunction and 88.5% reported erections insufficient for sexual activity. Additionally, 47.1% of patients reported rectal pain and 31.0% reported dysuria. Depressive symptoms and fatigue were reported by 41.4% and 60.9% of patients respectively.
CONCLUSION: Urethral stenosis after radiotherapy is a clinically complex entity with a broad scope of associated symptoms including high rates of patient-reported incontinence, voiding dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, pain, bowel dysfunction and depression. This multifocal nature combined with often insidious presentation and patient unawareness creates a uniquely challenging condition to treat.
