Title: Totally robotic soave pull-through procedure for Hirschsprung's disease: lessons learned from 11 consecutive pediatric patients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Since Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) already proved to benefit from robotic surgery, we aimed at describing a wider series of patients with this rare disease who were operated on with a robotic approach.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive HSCR patients who underwent totally robotic soave pull-through (TRSPT), between October 2015 and June 2019, have been included. Ethical Committee approval was obtained. Data regarding clinical features, technical details, complications, hospital stay, and functional outcome have been prospectively collected for each patient.
RESULTS: Eleven patients have been included. Mean age at surgery was 29 months. Median length of surgery was 420 min. Median console time was 180 min. Six patients suffered from rectosigmoid aganglionosis, three from long HSCR (extending up to the hepatic flexure), two from total colonic aganglionosis. No major intraoperative complications occurred. Four patients (three of whom carrying a stoma) experienced minor mucosal tearing during dissection. One anastomotic stricture required dilatation under general anesthesia and two cuff strictures required cuff release (both occurring in patients who experienced intraoperative mucosal tearing). Follow-up lasted a median of 12 months. One patient experienced mild postoperative enterocolitis. Continence scored excellent-to-good in all patients who could be assessed on that regard (7 out of 11).
CONCLUSIONS: Provided a number of technical key points are respected, the outcome of TRSPT for HSCR is promising. Younger patients, particularly those carrying a stoma, proved to be technically demanding and deserve a longer learning curve. Accurate preoperative bowel preparation, correct trocar placement and patient positioning proved to be crucial aspects of treatment. To conclude, TRSPT is particularly suitable for older HSCR patients, even those requiring a redo, and represents a valid alternative to available surgical option for this delicate subgroup of HSCR patients.
