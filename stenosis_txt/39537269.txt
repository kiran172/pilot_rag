Title: Decision-Making Approach to the Treatment of Young and Low-Risk Patients With Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Over a decade of randomized controlled trial data demonstrate excellent outcomes with transcatheter aortic valve replacement or surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis regardless of surgical risk. The 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend both options for low-risk AS patients aged 65 to 80 years. However, the fastest growing population of patients receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the United States isÂ <65 years old, with little data to support the practice. The American College of Cardiology's Cardiac Surgery Team Section Leadership and Interventional Cardiology Councils, a multidisciplinary collaboration of cardiologists and cardiac surgeons, sought to summarize the relevant data into a decision-making tool for heart valve teams. A literature review was completed, and guidelines, randomized controlled trials, and large observational studies were summarized into a pragmatic decision-making approach to treating young and low-risk patients with AS.
