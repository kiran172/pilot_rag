Title: Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis.

Abstract: Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis (EIPD) is a disease of unknown pathogenesis characterized by usually systemic, cystic dilatation of the excretory ducts of esophageal submucosal glands. In this article, I review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings, esophagographic findings, and histopathology of EIPD. I also discuss the etiology and possible pathogenesis of EIPD based on my experiences with this disease and a review of the literature. EIPD usually presents with dysphagia in middle-aged individuals. It is often complicated with secondary infections, most commonly candidiasis. On esophagography, EIPD is delineated as small, multiple, flask-shaped outward projections within the esophageal wall. In recent years, EIPD has been mainly diagnosed by endoscopic findings of multiple, localized, small mucosal depressions. The orifices of the "pseudodiverticula" periodically open and close, and excrete mucus onto the mucosal surface. On histopathological examination, the luminal surface of dilated ducts in EIPD is covered by multilayered, hyperplastic epithelial cells, but myoepithelial cells in the glandular acini are well preserved. Treatment of EIPD is usually symptomatic therapy, and prevention of the infectious complications is important. The etiology and pathogenesis of EIPD are largely unknown, but functional abnormalities of autonomic nerve fibers innervating the esophageal glands likely play an important role, since the structures of the glands are basically preserved in this disease.
