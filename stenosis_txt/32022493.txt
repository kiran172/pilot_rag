Title: [When should unilateral renal stenosis not be dilated ?].

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis can lead to renovascular secondary hypertension. It can also induce an elevation of creatinine, but usually in the case of bilateral stenosis. In addition, it may be associated with the occurrence of heart failure and pulmonary edema. In this context, it may seem intuitive to want to dilate this artery to improve clinical outcome, but the data in current literature speak rather against this intervention. We will see that that there are some specific criteria for revascularization, but the procedure is not without risk. We present here a case of unilateral renal artery stenosis whose indication for invasive treatment was relative, exposing the patients to unnecessary risks.
