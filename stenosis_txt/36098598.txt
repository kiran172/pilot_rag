Title: [Renal autotransplant as a treatment method in a patient with ureteral stricture].

Abstract: The treatment of ureteral strictures is one of the most difficult problems of current urology. In recent years, an increase in post-radiation patients who have an iatrogenic ureteral damage during surgical procedures on the pelvic and abdominal organs is seen. We describe two cases in which a long ureteral stricture was diagnosed. The etiology of the strictures was associated with urolithiasis. After the removal of ureteral stones, long ureteral stricture developed in both patients. A nephrostomy tube was initially put. Considering the prolonged length of the stricture with a formation of obliteration, several treatment options were discussed, including nephrectomy. Nevertheless, due to the young age and the good functional state of the renal parenchyma, the decision was made about renal autotransplant, which was associated with a lower surgical risk. However, this procedure requires a high degree of training of the surgical team with appropriate experience.
