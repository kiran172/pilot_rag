Title: [Unilateral interlaminar approach 270° circular spinal canal decompression under the iLESSYS Delta for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis in the elderly].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effect of unilateral interlaminar approach 270° circular spinal canal decompression under the Interlaminar Endoscopic Surgical System(iLESSYS) Delta for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) in the elderly.
METHODS: Total of 29 patients with LSS treated with the iLESSYS Delta from December 2018 to January 2021 were retrospectively analyzed, including 12 males and 17 females with an average age of (71.52±10.82) years old ranging from 63 to 83 years old. All patients had definite intermittent claudication, mainly neurogenic symptoms of both lower limbs. All patients had single-level spinal stenosis, including L<sub>3,4</sub> 5 cases, L<sub>4,5</sub> 21 cases, and L<sub>5</sub>S<sub>1</sub> 3 cases. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and modified Macnab assessment criteria were used to evaluate pain, low back pain dysfunction index and clinical efficacy, respectively.
RESULTS: All 29 cases were successfully completed. The operation time was (73.45±5.89) min, the intraoperative blood loss was (9.93±0.83) ml, the hospital stay was (4.03±0.41) days, and the follow-up was more than 12 months. The VAS scores of low back pain before surgery and 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year after surgery were 2.31±0.88, 1.45±0.62, 1.21±0.61, 1.10±0.55, 1.03±0.49;VAS of leg pain were 6.48±0.49 0.56, 1.97±0.61, 1.31±0.59, 1.17±0.59, 1.10±0.55;ODI scores were 38.41±2.74, 18.14±1.17, 5.17±0.53, 5.07±0.45, 4.90±0.48;low back and leg pain VAS score and ODI score have statistically significant differences between preoperative and postoperative follow-up time points (P&lt;0.05). The MacNab efficacy evaluation at 1-year follow-up:excellent in 22 cases, good in 5 cases and fair in 2 cases.
CONCLUSION: The clinical effect of unilateral interlaminar approach 270° circular spinal canal decompression under the iLESSYS Delta for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis in the elderly is satisfactory, with the advantages of less trauma and less bleeding, large microscopic operation space, sufficient decompression, and ideal post-operative recovery, and at the same time, it can minimize the damage to the stable structure of the lumbar spine, which is an ideal surgical method for the treatment of elderly lumbar spinal stenosis.
