Title: Treatment of aortic stenosis in patients with chronic liver disease: Another win for transfemoral TAVR?

Abstract: Chronic liver disease is associated with increased operative risk of open-heart surgery. In this study, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) carried high periprocedural mortality, but transfemoral TAVR appeared to be superior to SAVR in terms of long-term survival. Better risk stratification tools are needed for patients with liver dysfunction to avoid futile TAVR and SAVR procedures.
