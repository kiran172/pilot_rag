Title: Carotid artery stenting and endarterectomy surgery techniques: A 30‑year time‑lapse.

Abstract: Carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting (CAS), are the most important axes in carotid artery interventional management. A bibliometric analysis permits an easier access to the current literature trends and information to design future studies. The aim of the present study was to identify the knowledge routes on CAS and examine the research front on the topic. The search was interpreted in Scopus, from 1994 to 2023, and included only original articles and reviews. The BibTex format was used to download all citation and bibliographic data. The present analysis was conducted in two parts, a descriptive one and a network extraction process. Between 1994 and 2023, 34,503 references and 7,758 authors were recorded. The annual growth rate was 21.64%. The CAVATAS trial was the most cited article. As regards word trends, since 2017, trans-carotid stenting, risk factors and plaque characteristics are highlighted. CAS remains an area of high interest with a publication growth rate of >20% per year. As numerous questions remain to be answered, the need to determine the role of CAS may drive further research.
