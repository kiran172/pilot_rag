Title: [Risk factors for adverse clinical events after carotid arteries stenting in elderly and senile patients.].

Abstract: The safety of the use of carotid arteries stenting (CAS) in elderly and senile patients remains a controversial issue. The reasons for the development of adverse events in this group of patients after CAS surgical procedure are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for the development of adverse clinical events after CAS surgical procedure in elderly patients group. The study included 147 patients (94 men, 53 women, average age -- 72,1±3,5 years) of elderly and senile patients hospitalized to perform CAS for stenosis of the carotid arteries. According to the constructed model of binary logistic regression, the following parameters are statistically significantly associated with the development of complications after CAS: the presence of stroke in the anamnesis (p=0,013), symptomatic stenosis of the carotid arteries (p=0,011) and the degree of disability according to mRS (Modified Rankin Scale) ≥3 (p=0,002). In order to identify the identified risk factors and minimize the incidence of complications in elderly patients who underwent CAS surgery, a detailed preoperative assessment of their somatic status is necessary with an emphasis on the state of the cardiovascular system.
