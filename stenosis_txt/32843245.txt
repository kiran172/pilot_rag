Title: Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization in Patients With Single Coronary Artery.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Single coronary artery (SCA) is a rare congenital coronary anomaly. Its incidence in various angiographic series is from 0.024% to 0.066%. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of coronary artery disease (CAD) in these patients is technically challenging.
METHODS: We retrospective analyzed the cardiac catheterization procedures of last 15 years and found 12 cases of SCA (incidence 0.084%). To determine the course of anomalous coronaries, angiographic "dot and eye" method and computed tomography (CT) were used. The course of the SCA was classified as per the modified Lipton criteria. PCI was performed as per the standard protocol for a significant epicardial coronary artery stenosis.
RESULTS: Out of total 12 patients of SCA, 9 patients had PCI of significant CAD. The mean age of 9 PCI patients was 63.8 ± 8.2 years (5 males, 4 females). The origin of the SCA was from the right sinus of Valsalva in 6 cases and from left sinus of Valsalva in 3 cases. Eleven successful PCI procedures were performed, which included PCI of left main, coronary bifurcation lesion, chronic total occlusion, and multi-vessel disease. Four patients had intravascular imaging and 3 patients had rotablation of calcified lesions.
CONCLUSION: PCI of SCA is technically challenging, which requires considerable expertise and experience. An appropriate selection of hardware along with technical expertise can make the procedure simpler with optimal end results.
