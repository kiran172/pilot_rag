Title: Impact of sigmoid septum on periprocedural outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve implantation using current-generation valves.

Abstract: The role of sigmoid septum (SS) observed using preprocedural transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains unknown. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes of TAVI using the current-generation transcatheter heart valves in patients with and without SS. We divided 140 consecutive patients, excluding four patients who underwent pacemaker implantation before TAVI, into two groups (those with and without SS) and compared the periprocedural outcomes, including new pacemaker implantation, within 30 days post-TAVI. Thirty-five patients (25%; 32 female patients) had SS before TAVI. The body surface area and aortic annulus area measured using computed tomography were significantly smaller in patients with SS than in those without SS (1.40 m2 vs. 1.48 m2, P = 0.03; and 372 mm2 vs. 409 mm2, P &lt; 0.01; respectively). Device success was achieved in all patients with SS. Postprocedural TTE on 30 days post-TAVI showed no significant differences in the valvular hemodynamics between patients with and without SS. No severe prosthesis-patient mismatch was noted on TTE, although the transcatheter heart valve size tended to be smaller in patients with SS. Within 30 days of the TAVI, three (8.6%) and eight (7.6%) patients with and without SS, respectively, had new pacemaker implantation (P = 0.86). The presence of SS was not associated with periprocedural outcomes following TAVI in patients without pre-existing pacemakers. No specific assessment or treatment strategy is required for the TAVI in patients with SS using the current-generation devices.
