Title: Navigating Complex Anatomy During Leadless Pacemaker Implantation.

Abstract: Transvenous pacemakers may lead to wound site complications, such as hematomas and infections. Leadless pacemakers have eliminated these risks. However, when the central venous and/or cardiac anatomy are challenging, their implantation technique may require modification(s). Here, we discuss 3 cases of successful leadless pacemaker implantation in patients with a challenging anatomy. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
