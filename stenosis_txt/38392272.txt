Title: Peri-Carotid Adipose Tissue and Atherosclerosis at Carotid Bifurcation.

Abstract: Vulnerable carotid plaques are responsible for 20% of the ischemic strokes. The identification of these asymptomatic carotid plaques that will become symptomatic is essential but remains unclear. Our main goal was to investigate whether the amount of the peri-carotid adipose tissue, estimated by the extra-media thickness (EMT), is associated with the atherosclerotic characteristics at the carotid bifurcation in patients with PAD. An observational, prospective, single-center, longitudinal study was conducted. Overall, 177 patients were subjected to carotid Doppler ultrasound at the study admission. The following data were collected: EMT, intima-media thickness (IMT), the presence of carotid plaques, the area of the highest plaque, the presence of "acute culprit" carotid stenosis, and the grade of internal carotid stenosis. "Acute culprit" carotid stenosis was defined as a significant atherosclerotic plaque that leads to a neurologic event within 15 days. From each carotid bifurcation, a right and a left EMT were determined. We analyzed both the mean EMTs (calculated as the mean between the right and the left EMT) and the EMT ipsilateral to the carotid bifurcation. The presence of carotid plaques was associated with a higher mean EMT [Median = 1.14; IQR = 0.66 versus Median = 0.97; IQR = 0.40; p = 0.001]. A positive correlation was found between the mean EMT and IMT (right: ρ = 0.20; p = 0.010; left: ρ = 0.21; p = 0.007) and between the mean EMT and the area of the largest carotid plaque (right: ρ = 0.17; p = 0.036; left: ρ = 0.22; p = 0.004). Left carotid stenosis ≥ 70% was associated with higher ipsilateral EMT [Median = 1.56; IQR = 0.70 versus Median = 0.94; IQR = 0.42; p = 0.009]. Patients with "acute culprit" carotid stenosis had a higher ipsilateral EMT [left ipsilateral EMT: Median = 1.46; IQR = 0.63; "non-acute": Median = 0.94; IQR = 0.43; p = 0.009; right ipsilateral EMT: Median = 2.25; IQR = 0.62; "non-acute": Median = 1.00; IQR = 0.51; p = 0.015]. This difference was not found in the contra-lateral EMT. Six months after the neurologic event, EMT ipsilateral to an "acute culprit" carotid stenosis decreased (p = 0.036). The amount of peri-carotid adipose tissue, estimated with EMT, was associated with atherosclerosis at the carotid arteries. The mean EMT was associated with the features of chronic atherosclerosis lesions: the presence of carotid plaques, IMT, and the area of the highest plaque. Ipsilateral EMT was linked with "acute culprit" atherosclerotic plaque.
