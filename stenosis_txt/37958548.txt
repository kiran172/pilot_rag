Title: Nipbl Haploinsufficiency Leads to Delayed Outflow Tract Septation and Aortic Valve Thickening.

Abstract: Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) patients, who frequently carry a mutation in NIPBL, present an increased incidence of outflow tract (OFT)-related congenital heart defects (CHDs). Nipbl+/- mice recapitulate a number of phenotypic traits of CdLS patients, including a small body size and cardiac defects, but no study has specifically focused on the valves. Here, we show that adult Nipbl+/- mice present aortic valve thickening, a condition that has been associated with stenosis. During development, we observed that OFT septation and neural crest cell condensation was delayed in Nipbl+/- embryos. However, we did not observe defects in the deployment of the main lineages contributing to the semilunar valves. Indeed, endocardial endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), analysed via outflow tract explants, and neural crest migration, analysed via genetic lineage tracing, did not significantly differ in Nipbl+/- mice and their wild-type littermates. Our study provides the first direct evidence for valve formation defects in Nipbl+/- mice and points to specific developmental defects as an origin for valve disease in patients.
