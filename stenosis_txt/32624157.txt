Title: Abdominal Magnetic Resonance Angiography.

Abstract: MR imaging hardware and software improvements have led to new applications for contrast-enhanced and noncontrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography in the abdomen and pelvis. Higher magnetic field strength MR imaging scanners have greater signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio, which is used to improve spatial resolution or temporal resolution for these techniques. New noncontrast-enhanced sequences offer high-resolution magnetic resonance angiography without contrast and provide additional hemodynamic information. Magnetic resonance angiography is particularly well suited to imaging patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia, renal vascular disease, pelvic congestion syndrome, and vascular malformations.
