Title: Risk factors affecting benign anastomotic stricture in anterior and low anterior resections for colorectal cancer: a single-center retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Although not as life-threatening as anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture reduces the quality of life. The risk factors for such an important life complication have not been revealed. This article examines the risk factors affecting anastomotic strictures due to colorectal cancers.
METHODS: Patients who underwent anterior and low anterior resection for colorectal cancer under elective conditions between 2015 and 2021 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups, those who developed anastomotic stricture and those who did not. The parameters determined between the two groups were compared, and multivariate analysis of statistically significant parameters was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 375 patients were included in the study. The anastomotic stricture was detected in 36 (9.6%) patients. In the multivariate analysis, non-mobilization of the splenic flexure and a proximal clean surgical margin of < 10 cm and a distal surgical margin of < 2 cm were identified as risk factors affecting anastomotic stricture. The risk factor with the highest odds ratio in the development of anastomotic stricture is the non-mobilization of the splenic flexure (p = 0.001, OR 11.375).
CONCLUSION: It is recommended that the mobilization of the splenic flexure to reduce the development of strictures. In addition, a clean surgical margin of 10 cm proximally and 2 cm distally and high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery may reduce the development of stricture.
