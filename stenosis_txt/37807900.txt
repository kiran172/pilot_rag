Title: Image-guided and sialendoscopy-assisted transoral approach for parotid duct stenosis and megaduct.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this communication was to introduce a novel combined image (magnetic resonance and computed tomography-guided and sialendoscopy-assisted transoral approach for the treatment of a parotid duct stenosis with megaduct.
METHODS: A 46-year-old woman was referred to our department for recurrent infections of the right parotid gland following unsuccessful multiple transoral surgical approaches for a Stensen's duct stricture with megaduct. An image (magnetic resonance and computed tomography)-guided and sialendoscopy-assisted transoral sialodochoplasty was planned and performed.
RESULTS: No complications occurred. The patient was discharged 2 days after surgery. No more swelling or infections occurred. The patient is currently symptom-free after a follow up of 11 months.
CONCLUSION: Although imaging navigation means more technical effort and costs, this novel approach can be considered a viable surgical opportunity for distal and mid-third parotid duct stenosis with concomitant megaduct, particularly in cases of persistent inflammation or iatrogenic scars due to previous surgery.
