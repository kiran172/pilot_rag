Title: How to Omit the Potential Pitfalls in Distal Radial Access: Lessons From Cadaveric and CTA Analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To verify the anatomical basis, ideal puncture sites, and potential pitfalls of the distal radial artery (dRA) in the anatomical snuffbox region for distal radial access (dTRA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overall, 26 formalin-fixed upper limbs and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the upper limbs of 168 consecutive patients were studied. Cadaveric dissection and dRA 3D reconstruction were used to evaluate the dRA route for dTRA. The puncture sites, dRA diameter, and angle of the dRA and tendons of the extensor pollicis brevis were also measured in the patients and cadavers.
RESULTS: The cadaver dissection provided more insights than did the dRA 3D reconstruction. However, preoperative evaluation had better diagnostic accuracy (p=0.024). Puncture sites 1 and 3 had a high success rate (63.2% possible success rate, 191/302). The DISFAVOR theory was put forward, in which 8 types of potential pitfalls that may interrupt puncture procedure or lead to a surgical failure were observed, including occlusion, stenosis, tortuosity, arteriovenous fistula, angioma, different radial artery (RA) ramifications, radial veins, and cephalic veins. The mean diameter of dRA based on cadaver dissection and CTA was 2.53 (SD=0.73) and 2.63 (SD=0.69) mm, respectively. Furthermore, the minimum distance from the outer layer of dRA to the skin was 5.71 (SD=2.0) mm based on CTA. The angle between the dRA and tendons of extensor pollicis brevis (TEPB) based on cadaver dissection and CTA was 58.0째 (SD=21.5째) and 51.8째 (SD=16.6째), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Puncture sites 1 and 3 were more suitable for the dTRA, and we put forward the DISFAVOR theory to summarize the 8 types of potential pitfalls during the use of dTRA.
