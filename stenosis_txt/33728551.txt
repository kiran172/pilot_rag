Title: Comparison between cryoballoon and hot balloon ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using balloon ablation was developed as a technique for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). While most studies examined cryoballoon ablation (CBA), there have also been many reports on hot balloon ablation (HBA). We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes between HBA and CBA.
METHODS: In a total of 103 consecutive patients with PAF who underwent catheter ablation, 60 propensity score-matched (30 CBA and 30 HBA) patients were enrolled. The procedural differences and clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed.
RESULTS: The requirement for additional touch-up ablation was more frequent in the left superior pulmonary vein (LSP) in the HBA group than in the CBA group. Pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) images showed that a thicker left pulmonary vein ridge and larger cross-sectional area of the LSPV were significantly associated with residual PV potentials after HBA. However, post-procedural CT images showed that PV stenosis (> 25%) was higher in the HBA group (33%) than in the CBA group (0%). PV stenosis after HBA was observed most frequently in the right superior PV (50%). The atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia-free survival rate during follow-up (365 Â± 102 days) was similar between the two groups (CBA vs. HBA, 83% vs. 90%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although both balloon modalities can relieve atrial arrhythmia after the procedure, careful attention is required during HBA procedures, especially for the right superior PV, to avoid PV stenosis.
