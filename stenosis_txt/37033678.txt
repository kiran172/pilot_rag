Title: Snakebite Induced Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but highly fatal neurological condition mostly caused by prothrombotic conditions like antiphospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden, and G20210A prothrombin polymorphism. Snake bites are a rare cause of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis that must be recognized and treated promptly to improve survival.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 25-year-old male who developed headaches and seizures following a Viper snake bite. The diagnosis was made based on a magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) showing transverse sinus thrombosis with sigmoid sinus stenosis. Initially, the patient was treated with antivenom and supportive treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). After the diagnosis of CVST, the patient was treated with rivaroxaban and levetiracetam. The patient improved within 1 week of treatment and was advised to follow up in 3 months.
CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is required if the patient presents with headaches, seizures, or abnormal vision following a snake bite. Early diagnosis and management can prevent further neurological damage.
