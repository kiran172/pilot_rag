Title: Transapical Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Real-World Early and Mid-Term Outcome of a Third-Level Centre.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TA-TAVR) is generally considered to be associated with higher morbidity compared with transfemoral-TAVR. However, TA-TAVR remains a feasible alternative for patients who are unsuitable for TF-TAVR. It has been shown that outcomes after TAVR are linked to the operator's expertise. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to report short- and mid-term outcomes after TA-TAVR performed by an expert Heart-Team of a third-level centre.
METHODS: From 2015 to 2022, 154 consecutive patients underwent TA-TAVR. The outcomes were analysed according to the VARC-3 criteria. Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated for major clinical events at mid-term follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean age of the population was 79.3 years and the STS risk-score of mortality was 4.2 Â± 3.6%. Periprocedural mortality was 1.9%. Acute kidney injury and prolonged ventilation occurred in 1.9%. Incidence of stroke was 0.6%. Pacemaker implantation rate was 1.9%. Freedom from cardiovascular mortality was 75.7%, and 60.2% at 3 and 5 years. Freedom from stroke was 92.3% and 88.9% at 3 and 5 years, respectively; freedom from endocarditis was 94.4% and 90.8% at 3 and 5 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: TA-TAVR may be considered a safe and effective alternative approach in patients unsuitable for TF-TAVR, especially when performed by a proficient Heart-Team.
