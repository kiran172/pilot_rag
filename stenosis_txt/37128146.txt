Title: Clinical features of ischemic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation combined with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) are major causes of ischemic stroke. Relatively few studies have focused on the risk factors and clinical features of ischemic stroke caused by NVAF combined with ICAS.
METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated NVAF and/or ICAS in patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted within 72 h after stroke. All patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). NVAF was detected by routine electrocardiogram or 24-h Holter examination, Doppler echocardiography, and contrast echocardiography of the right heart.
RESULTS: Among the 635 enrolled patients, NVAF, ICAS, and NVAF+ICAS were diagnosed in 170 (26.77%), 255 (40.16%), and 210 (33.07%) patients, respectively. Patients in the NVAF+ICAS group were older (p < .001), specifically aged ≥75 years (p < .001). The admission time of the NVAF+ICAS group was shorter (p < .001) than that of the ICAS group. The admission NIHSS score of the NVAF group was higher than that of the NVAF+ICAS group (p < .001). HsCRP, NTpro-BNP, and LEVF levels were significantly different among the three groups (p < .001). NVAF+ICAS ischemic stroke occurred mainly in the right hemisphere (52.4%).
CONCLUSION: NVAF with ICAS ischemic stroke is more likely to occur in older patients. Infarctions occurred mainly in the right cerebral hemisphere. Neurological deficits in NVAF are more severe than those in NVAF combined with ICAS and in simple ICAS ischemic strokes. HsCRP, LEVF, andNTpro-BNP seem to be closely associated with NVAF+ICAS ischemic stroke.
