Title: Diagnostic accuracy of carotid plaque magnetic resonance imaging compared to histopathology in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Vulnerable plaques have been shown to predict ipsilateral cerebral ischemic events and identifying them leads to appropriate secondary stroke prevention strategies. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MR carotid plaque imaging in identifying plaque vulnerability when compared with histopathological findings in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: A prospective cohort of forty-five consecutive patients with moderate to severe symptomatic carotid stenosis who underwent CEA at a tertiary Indian hospital had 3 T MRI plaque imaging with multi-parametric protocol between November 2021 and December 2022. Images were analyzed by a vascular radiologist blinded to histopathological data. High-risk plaque characteristics such as lipid rich necrotic core (LRNC), intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), thin fibrous cap and ulceration were assessed and correlated with histopathological findings as per American Heart Association (AHA) classification using Cohen's kappa statistics to obtain diagnostic accuracies.
RESULTS: Of the 45 patients, 38(84 %) were males. The mean age was 65 ± 7.7 years and mean duration to CEA from the most recent event was 57 days (57 ± 46 days). A significant correlation between MR plaque imaging and histopathology was noted for IPH (sensitivity-91 %, specificity-86 %, κ = 0.774, p < 0.001), LRNC (sensitivity-92.1 %, specificity-85.7 %, κ = 0.697, p < 0.001), and plaque ulceration (sensitivity-84.6 %, specificity-78.1 %, κ = 0.563, p < 0.001). MRI had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 92.3 % and 84.2 % respectively (κ = 0.77, p < 0.001) in discriminating high risk plaques.
CONCLUSION: MR plaque imaging shows a very good correlation with histopathology and can identify unstable high-risk plaques with high accuracy. This may have implication in selection of patients for carotid revascularization in symptomatic carotid stenosis.
