Title: Easy surgical explantation technique for sutureless Perceval S prosthesis, 'lasso technique': a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Due to structural valve deterioration of sutureless aortic prosthesis, there is a need for explantation of the prothesis. We introduce a surgical technique to explant sutureless aortic prosthesis, which has a self-expanding stent incorporated into the aortic wall.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 82-year-old man who had undergone sutureless aortic valve replacement 6 years previously underwent redo-aortic and mitral valve replacement because of severe prosthetic aortic valve stenosis and mitral regurgitation. The sutureless prosthesis was explanted using 'lasso technique'. The patient was discharged after 7 days without complications.
CONCLUSIONS: We presented a useful technique to explant a sutureless aortic prosthesis.
