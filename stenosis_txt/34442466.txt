Title: Significant Reduction in Vertebral Artery Dose by Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy: A Pilot Study for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

Abstract: Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) with the vertebral artery (VA)-sparing technique has been initially proposed in our institution. This pilot study was conducted to compare the dose to VAs between IMPT and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A total of six patients with NPC treated by IMPT were enrolled in the study. Target volumes and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated, including 12 samples of right and left VAs, respectively, for each patient. Treatment planning by IMPT and dual-arc VMAT was carried out for comparison. The IMPT plan significantly reduced VA mean dose, V10, V20, V30, V40, and V50, compared to the VMAT plan in all 12 samples (p &lt; 0.001). The average mean dose to VAs for IMPT was 35.2% (23.4-46.9%), which was less compared to VMAT (p &lt; 0.001). Adequate dose coverage was achieved with both IMPT and VMAT plans for three different dose levels of target volumes for all patients. IMPT significantly reduces VA dose while maintaining adequate dose coverage of all target volumes. For patients with head and neck cancer who seek to preserve their blood flow to the brain in order to decrease late vascular and neurologic sequelae, IMPT should be considered. A prospective study with longer follow-up is ongoing to confirm our preliminary results.
