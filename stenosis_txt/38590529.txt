Title: Left atrial dysfunction in bicuspid aortic valve patients with severe aortic stenosis is associated with post-operative atrial fibrillation following aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIMS: To investigate (i) the association between pre-operative left atrial (LA) reservoir strain and post-operative atrial fibrillation (AF) and (ii) the incidence of post-operative ischaemic stroke events separately in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients after surgical aortic valve replacement for isolated severe aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 227 patients (n = 133 BAV and n = 94 TAV) with isolated severe AS scheduled for aortic valve replacement. A comprehensive intra- and inter-observer validated pre-operative echocardiogram with an analysis of LA reservoir strain was performed. Post-operative AF was defined as a sustained (&gt;30â€…s) episode of AF or atrial flutter. The timing of neurological events was defined in accordance with the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria for stroke. Post-operative AF occurred in 114 of 227 patients (50.2%), with no difference between BAV and TAV patients (48.1 vs. 53.1%, P = 0.452). Persisting post-operative AF at discharge was more frequent in BAV patients (29.7 vs. 8.0%, P = 0.005). Pre-operative LA reservoir strain was independently associated with post-operative AF (odds ratio = 1.064, 95% confidence interval 1.032-1.095, P &lt; 0.001), with a significant interaction between LA reservoir strain and aortic valve morphology (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.002). The cumulative transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke incidence during follow-up was significantly higher in BAV patients (19.1 vs. 5.8% at 5 years).
CONCLUSION: Pre-operative LA function was associated with post-operative AF after aortic valve replacement in BAV AS patients, while post-operative AF in TAV AS patients likely depends on transient post-operative alterations and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. TIA/stroke during follow-up was more common in BAV AS patients.
