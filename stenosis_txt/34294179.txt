Title: Long-term results of percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty in Kawasaki disease.

Abstract: We report the long-term results of percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty for early appearing localised stenosis of the left anterior descending artery caused by Kawasaki disease in two 2-year-olds. One patient had 50% restenosis and newly appearing aneurysm at 21-year-old, and the other had no restenosis at 16-year-old. They had no symptoms or cardiac events for 20 years. It is useful in the early localised stenosis without aneurysm.
