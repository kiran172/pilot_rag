Title: Truncal Blocks for Emergency Laparotomy in a High-Risk Patient: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: In critically ill patients undergoing laparotomy, both general anesthesia (GA) and central neuraxial block (CNB) may pose significant risks. Peripheral truncal blocks have been reported to provide effective postoperative analgesia following laparotomy. However, there are a limited number of reports describing this technique as surgical anesthesia for laparotomy. An 86-year-old man with non-specific interstitial pneumonia under home oxygen therapy and aortic valve stenosis was diagnosed with an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Because of these comorbidities, both GA and CNB were considered relatively contraindicated. Thus, we chose an ultrasound-guided transverse abdominis plane block and ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric block supplemented with neuroleptanesthesia as surgical anesthesia for emergency laparotomy. The surgery was uneventful using this technique. Truncal blocks supplemented with titrated intravenous sedatives/analgesics could be an alternative in high-risk patients undergoing laparotomy in whom both GA and CNB are considered relatively contraindicated.
