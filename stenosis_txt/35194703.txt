Title: Effects of steroid use for stenosis prevention after endoscopic submucosal dissection for cervical esophageal cancer.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Esophageal stenosis is a serious complication after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for thoracic esophageal cancer (TEC), and steroid has been applied for stenosis prevention. However, the rate of stenosis and effect of steroid for ESD of cervical esophageal cancer (CEC) remain unknown. The aim was to clarify the rate and managements of post-ESD stenosis for CEC.
METHODS: A total of 325 lesions with 272 patients who underwent ESD for esophageal cancers were enrolled and were divided to the CEC group (43 lesions) or the TEC group (282 lesions). Patient characteristics, clinicopathological features, procedure-related outcomes of esophageal ESD, stenosis rate and clinical outcome of steroid use cases were evaluated.
RESULTS: More patients in the CEC group received preventive steroid treatment compared to the TEC group (37.2% vs 14.5%, P = 0.001). The rate of post-ESD stenosis tended to be higher in the CEC group (11.6%) than in the TEC group (6.7%). For cases of 3/4 ≤ of circumference, local injection with oral steroid had lower stenosis rate than local injection only in both groups (CEC 40% vs 100%, TEC 30.7% vs 56.3%). More sessions and longer duration of dilation were needed to release the stenosis in the CEC group (20 times vs. 5 times, P = 0.015; 196 days vs. 55 days, P = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: The post-ESD stenosis rate of CEC tended to be higher than that of TEC. More intensive preventive measures for post-ESD stenosis may be needed for CEC than TEC.
