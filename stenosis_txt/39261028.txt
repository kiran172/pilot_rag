Title: Comprehensive Assessment of Lipid Markers in Cardiovascular Events Prediction.

Abstract: Many studies have reported a relationship between various lipids, such as cholesterol, fatty acids, and lipoproteins, and cardiovascular events. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is often cited as a representative marker. However, there is still room for discussion regarding which markers, among other lipids, should take clinical precedence.This observational study focused on patients without residual stenosis on post-coronary angiography. It was based on blood tests, including lipid profiles at that time, and assessed the association with the subsequent occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of all-cause mortality, hospitalization due to heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and all revascularizations).Of the 375 patients analyzed, 134 experienced MACE (median follow-up duration: 1031 days). When comparing the MACE and non-MACE groups, significant differences were observed in lipid markers such as non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) (non-HDL-C; P = 0.003, RLP-C; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the area under the curve for RLP-C was 0.656 (95% CI: 0.598-0.714). Improvement in MACE risk discrimination was observed when LDL-C was replaced with non-HDL-C or RLP-C, in addition to atherosclerosis risk factors (non-HDL-C; net reclassification improvement (NRI) = 0.366, 95% CI: 0.159-0.572, RLP-C; NRI = 0.224, 95% CI: 0.016-0.433).It is highly likely that non-HDL-C and RLP-C can serve as significant lipid markers for predicting the occurrence of MACE.
