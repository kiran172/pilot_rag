Title: Mechanical Ablation of the Posterior Urethral Valve Omitting Thermal Energy: A Brief Report.

Abstract: Management of the posterior urethral valve (PUV) is a clinical challenge in pediatric urology. We report the results of a modified valve ablation method without using a pediatric resectoscope and thermal energy. Patients were selected from children with PUV who were referred to the pediatric urology clinic of Shahid Labbafinejad Hospital, Tehran, Iran, and have undergone endoscopic valve ablation surgery between May 2019 to May 2021. Ten male patients with PUV underwent mechanical valve ablation without the use of the conventional pediatric resectoscope, and thermal energy was replaced by a 6F semi-rigid urethroscope and 3Fr ureteral catheter. Patients were assessed both pre-and postoperatively using serum creatinine, urinary tract ultrasound imaging, and voiding cystourethrography. The mean age was 23.88Â±30.13 months (range= 25 days to 8 years). Four out of 10 patients (40%) had elevated serum creatinine, and seven had unilateral or bilateral hydroureteronephrosis (70%). No major complications were reported according to Clavien-Dindo Classification System. The level of serum creatinine, the grade of hydroureteronephrosis, and the ratio of the prostatic urethra to anterior urethra diameter in postoperative voiding cystourethrography were decreased. A decrease in serum creatinine level occurred in patients after valve ablation, but this decrease was not statistically significant (P=0.059). The decrease in hydroureteronephrosis grade on the right (P=0.006) and left (P=0.022) was statistically significant. There was no evidence of urethral stenosis or need for repeating resection. It can be concluded that our mechanical valve ablation method might be a safe and effective technique for PUV ablation.
