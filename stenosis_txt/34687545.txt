Title: Cormatrix® for vessel reconstruction in paediatric cardiac surgery-a word of caution.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to determine if Cormatrix® (CM) represents a safe alternative to conventional patch materials used in congenital heart surgery.
METHODS: A total of 57 paediatric patients who underwent cardiac surgery using an Extracellular Matrix Bioscaffold (CM) were categorized into 4 groups according to the patch implant location. Patch-related complications and reintervention rates were analysed. A subgroup of 18 patients was subsequently compared to a matched group of 36 patients who underwent similar surgical procedures with autologous pericardium as patch material.
RESULTS: No patient died during hospitalization. There were 2 late deaths, not related to the implanted CM patch. Fourteen (66.7%) out of 21 patients with arterial patch plasty developed progressive vessel/right ventricular outflow tract stenosis or aneurysm. All 3 patients with a valved CM conduit developed haemodynamically relevant valve stenosis or regurgitation. A total of 18 (31.5%) patients needed reintervention and 12 (21.1%) related to CM. Four (7%) patients needed surgical treatment with operative removal of the stenosis. Redo valve replacement was performed on 2 (3.5%) patients. Six (10.5%) patients required an interventional cardiology procedure at a median interval of 5 months from surgery. The subgroup analysis revealed a significantly lower patch-related reintervention rate in patients treated with autologous pericardium when compared to CM (P = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: CM is safe for atrial and ventricular defect closure. The use of CM for arterial vessel reconstruction is associated with higher reintervention rates when compared to autologous pericardium.
