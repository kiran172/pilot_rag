Title: ETV in infancy and childhood below 2 years of age for treatment of hydrocephalus.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Age and etiology play a crucial role in success of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) as a treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus. Outcome is worse in infants, and controversies still exist whether ETV is superior to shunt placement. We retrospectively analyzed 70 patients below 2 years from 4 different centers treated with ETV and assessed success.
METHODS: Children < 2 years who received an ETV within 1994-2018 were included. Patients were classified according to age and etiology; < 3, 4-12, and 13-24 months, etiologically; aqueductal stenosis, post-hemorrhagic-hydrocephalus (PHH), tumor-related, fourth ventricle outflow obstruction, with Chiari-type II and following CSF infection. We investigated statistically the predictors for ETV success through computing Kaplan-Meier estimates using patient's follow-up time and time to ETV failure.
RESULTS: We collected 70 patients. ETV success rate was 41.4%. The highest rate was in tumor-related hydrocephalus and fourth ventricle outlet obstruction (62.5%, 60%) and the lowest rate was in Chiari-type II and following infection (16.7%, 0%). The below 3 months age group showed relatively lower success rate (33.3%) in comparison to older groups which showed similar results (46.4%, 46.6%). Statistically, a previous VP shunt was a predictor for failure (p value < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Factors suggesting a high possibility of failure were age < 3 months and etiology such as Chiari-type II or following infection. Altered CSF dynamics in patients with PHH and under-developed arachnoid villi may play a role in ETV failure. We do not recommend ETV as first line in children < 3 months of age or in case of Chiari II or following infection.
