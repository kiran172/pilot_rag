Title: Long-term Sexual Function and Quality of Life in Women Following Substitution Urethroplasty.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the long-term quality of life (QOL) and sexual function (SF) in women who underwent either dorsal on-lay (DO) or ventral inlay (VI) urethroplasty for urethral stricture disease.
METHODOLOGY: Between January 2016 and September 2022, women who underwent either dorsal on-lay (DO) or ventral inlay (VI) urethroplasties and had at least a six-month follow-up been included. Using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and WHO-QOL bref questionnaires, the QOL and SF were evaluated. Scores were compared between the two groups after being examined for internal validity. A sub-group analysis was carried out based on the procedure's success.
RESULTS: With follow-up periods ranging from 6 to 86 months, 25 patients who received VI urethroplasty and 10 patients who underwent DO urethroplasty were included. Both scores demonstrated strong internal consistency. The cumulative QOL and FSFI scores were comparable in both groups (p = 0.53 and p = 0.83, respectively). Significantly high scores were noted in the physical health domain (76.5 ± 9.9 vs 62.33 ± 10.97; p = 0.03; (95% CI = 0.72-24.4)) and the environmental domain (75.75 ± 3.84 vs 66.00 ± 4.24; p = 0.01 (95% CI = 2.64-16.85) in patients with successful VI and DO urethroplasties respectively. Addictions, low socioeconomic status and protracted symptom duration were associated with low QOL scores. Old age was related to low FSFI scores.
CONCLUSION: Substitution urethroplasty, despite the approach, showed good QOL and SF scores. Long symptom duration, addictions, and poor socioeconomic status were associated with low QOL whereas old age independently influenced low FSFI scores.
