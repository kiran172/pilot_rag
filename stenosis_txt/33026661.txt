Title: Voice-Related Quality of Life Is Associated with Postoperative Change in Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To characterize the impact of subglottic stenosis (SGS) on voice-related quality of life (V-RQOL) and quantify the effect of treatment on voice outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Case series.
METHODS: Retrospective review of SGS patients treated from 1996 to 2018 at a single institution to assess for 1) V-RQOL association with individual patient cumulative treatment number and 2) V-RQOL correlation with treatment type, time between treatments, and degree of stenosis. Analysis included both parametric and nonparametric statistical comparison across treatment types and multivariable and univariate linear regression.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients, predominantly white (93%) and female (93%), were included. Etiology of SGS included idiopathic (61%), iatrogenic (16%), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (16%), and other (7%). The plurality of patients had four or more treatments (44%), with the remainder having one (28%), two (13%), or three treatments (15%). Analysis of change between pre- and postoperative V-RQOL scores was completed for 130 treatments. These included dilation with laser incision (52%), in-office injection (34%), dilation without division (8%), cricotracheal resection (1%), and all other treatment (8%). For every 10% improvement in airway caliber postoperatively, there was a 1.3-point improvement in calculated V-RQOL (r = 0.27, P = .02). After adjustment for treatment type, age, sex, and SGS etiology, this association held (beta = 1.5, P = .02). Change in V-RQOL was not associated with treatment type, treatment number, or time between treatments.
CONCLUSION: Patients with subglottic stenosis who have greater degree of change in airway caliber experience greater improvement in V-RQOL scores following treatment. V-RQOL scores are not associated with treatment type or time between individual treatments.
