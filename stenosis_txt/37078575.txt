Title: Computed tomography Coronary angiography in rural referral hospitals: A single-Centre experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe the first 9 months of a newly established computed tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA) over the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the first 9 months of a CT-CA program.
DESIGN: Data were collected for the period of June 2020 to March 2021. Information reviewed included demographics, risk factors, renal function, technical factors and outcomes including Calcium Score and Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS).
SETTING: A single Rural Referral Hospital in regional New South Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-six CTCAs were reviewed. Ages ranged from 29 to 81 years. 37 (39%) male, 59 (61%) female. 15 (15.6%) identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander.
MAIN OBJECTIVE OUTCOMES: CTCA is a viable alternative to invasive coronary angiogram in appropriate populations for regional areas.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight (91.6%) were considered technically satisfactory. Mean heart rate was 57 beats per minute with a range of 108. Cardiovascular risk factors included hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking status, family history and diabetes mellitus. Of patients with CAD-RADS scores 3 or 4 who underwent subsequent invasive coronary angiogram (ICA), 80% were determined to have operator-defined significant stenosis. Significant cardiac and non-cardiac findings were extensive.
CONCLUSIONS: CTCA is a safe and efficacious imaging modality for low- to moderate-risk chest pain patients. There was acceptable diagnostic accuracy and the investigation was safe.
