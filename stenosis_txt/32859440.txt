Title: Present and future economic impact of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on the Portuguese national healthcare system.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has changed the treatment paradigm of severe aortic stenosis (AS). Nevertheless, in Portugal the penetration rate of TAVR is still very low and there is a paucity of data regarding its economic impact on the Portuguese healthcare system.
AIMS: To perform an economic analysis of the present and future impact of TAVR in Portugal and to propose health policy recommendations for a new reimbursement model.
METHODS: Hospital data from a high-volume center were used as a sample to calculate the costs of TAVR in Portugal. Information regarding the national penetration rate was derived from the EAPCI Valve for Life initiative. To estimate the future demand for TAVR, three scenarios (S) were constructed: S1, TAVR penetration according to current guidelines; S2, including intermediate-risk patients; and S3, including low-risk patients aged over 75 years.
RESULTS: The total cost of each TAVR procedure in Portugal was 22 134.50 euros for the self-expanding valve (SEV) and 23 321.50 euros for the balloon-expanding valves (BEV). Most of the cost was driven by the price of the valve (SEV 74.5% vs. BEV 81.5%). The current national economic impact is estimated at 12 500 000 euros per year. In S1, the expected penetration rate would be 189 procedures per million population; in S2 we estimated an increase of 28% to 241 procedures per million population and in S3 an increase of 107% to 391 procedures per million population. The total economic impact would increase to 43 770 586 euros in S1 and to 90 754 310 euros in S3.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR is associated with a significant present and future economic impact on the Portuguese healthcare system. A new model of reimbursement in Portugal should be discussed and implemented.
