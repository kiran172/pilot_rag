Title: Main Bronchus Stenosis Due to Tuberculosis and Ogilvie's Syndrome: A Case Report of Two Unusual Diseases in the Same Patient.

Abstract: Main bronchus stenosis as a sequel of pulmonary tuberculosis is infrequent and should raise suspicion of other presentations of the infection. Given its non-specific symptomatology and the absence of a specific diagnostic method, tracheobronchial tuberculosis is usually not suspected and diagnosed despite its great impact on quality of life due to the high incidence of stenosis as a consequence. Ogilvie's syndrome, an uncommon condition, requires careful management and surveillance given the risk of ischemia and colonic perforation intrinsic to the disease. We present a case of a patient with main bronchus stenosis secondary to tuberculosis infection and Ogilvie's syndrome post-surgery.
