Title: Interventional treatment for portal vein complications utilizing a hybrid operating room after liver transplantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vascular complications after liver transplantation (LT) can be lethal and require immediate treatment to prevent graft failure. Nowadays, with interventional radiology (IR), approaches such as the percutaneous transhepatic (PTH) and transileocolic venous (TIC), have become major treatment options. We reviewed the safety and efficacy of a hybrid operating room (OR) for portal vein complications after LT.
METHODS: Patients who underwent IR for post-LT vascular complications in the hybrid OR from May 2014 to May 2022 were enrolled. Patients who underwent post-LT IR in conventional angiography rooms were excluded.
RESULTS: Nine patients developed portal vein complications; eight after living donor LT and one after deceased donor LT. Six patients had portal vein stenosis, two had portal vein thrombosis, and one had both. In the hybrid OR, PTH and TIC were used in five and three cases, respectively. The Rendezvous technique was used in one case. Angioplasty was performed in all patients. A stent was placed in four patients. The portal venous pressure gradient across the stenotic site significantly decreased after IR (P &= 0.031). The IR success rate in the hybrid OR was 100%.
CONCLUSION: The hybrid OR enables us to accomplish IR for post-LT vascular complications safely and effectively.
