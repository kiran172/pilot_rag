Title: Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis in Patients With Type 0 Bicuspid, Type 1 Bicuspid, and Tricuspid Aortic Valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data concerning the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in type 0 bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS) are scarce. The study aims to compare the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for AS in patients with type 0 bicuspid, type 1 bicuspid, and tricuspid aortic valve anatomy.
METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe AS between 2012 and 2022 in this single-center retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was mortality, while secondary outcomes included in-hospital complications such as stroke and pacemaker implantation and transcatheter heart valve hemodynamic performance.
RESULTS: The number of patients with AS with type 0 bicuspid, type 1 bicuspid, and tricuspid aortic valve anatomy was 328, 302, and 642, respectively. Self-expanding transcatheter heart valves were used in the majority of patients (n=1160; 91.4%). In the matched population, differences in mortality (30 days: 4.2% versus 1.7% versus 1.7%, P<sub>overall</sub>=0.522; 1 year: 10% versus 2.3% versus 6.2%, P<sub>overall</sub>=0.099) and all stroke (30 days: 1.0% versus 0.9% versus 0.0%, P<sub>overall</sub>=0.765; 1 year: 1.4% versus 1.6% versus 1.3%, P<sub>overall</sub>=NS) were nonsignificant, and the incidence of overall in-hospital complications was comparable among groups. Ascending aortic diameter was the single predictor of 1-year mortality in type 0 bicuspid patients (hazard ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.03-2.44]; P=0.035). The proportion of patients with a mean residual gradient ≥20 mm Hg was the highest in those with type 0 bicuspid anatomy, although the need for permanent pacemaker implantation was the lowest in this group.
CONCLUSIONS: Major clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement for AS in patients with type 0 bicuspid, type 1 bicuspid, and tricuspid aortic valve anatomy are equivalent at short- and mid-term follow-up. These observations merit further exploration in prospective international registries and randomized controlled trials.
