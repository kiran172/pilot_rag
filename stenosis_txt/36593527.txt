Title: The effectiveness of a motivational text-messaging program for smoking cessation after coronary angioplasty: a quasi-experimental study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Smoking is an important risk factor of coronary artery stenosis after angioplasty. Therefore, this investigation aimed to determine the effectiveness of a motivational text-messaging program for smoking cessation after coronary angioplasty. This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 100 patients after angioplasty. The patients were divided randomly into two intervention and control groups. The intervention group received 32 text messages about smoking cessation for 2 months. The control group received only routine training. The primary and secondary outcomes were success and self-efficacy in quitting smoking cigarettes, respectively. Both groups filled out the related questionnaires before and after the intervention. The data were analyzed using SPSS software version 22 and Chi-square tests, independent t-test, and paired t-test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Success in quitting cigarette smoking was significantly higher in the intervention group (n = 29, 61.7%) compared to the control group (n = 2, 4.3%) (p < 0.001). Moreover, after the intervention, the mean score of self-efficacy in the intervention group (11.01 ± 44.75) was significantly higher than the control group (6.51 ± 3.11) and also higher than before the intervention (5.51 ± 2.44) (P˂0.001). The motivational text-messaging program can improve self-efficacy and success in smoking cessation in patients after coronary angioplasty.
