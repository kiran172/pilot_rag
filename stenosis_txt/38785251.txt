Title: [Functional assessment of internal carotid artery tortuosity in patients with multifocal atherosclerosis].

Abstract: The review is devoted to diagnosis and treatment of internal carotid artery tortuosity. The authors consider modern classification, epidemiology and diagnostic options using neuroimaging or ultrasound-assisted functional stress tests depending on medical history and complaints. In addition to standard Doppler ultrasound, rotational and orthostatic tests are advisable due to possible changes of local shape and hemodynamic parameters following body position changes, especially in patients with concomitant atherosclerotic stenosis. Thus, a personalized approach is especially important for treatment and diagnostics of internal carotid artery tortuosity.
