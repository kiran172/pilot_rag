Title: TAVR and stroke: A common evolution.

Abstract: Periprocedural cerebrovascular events (CVE) after transcatheter aortic‐valve replacement (TAVR) are infrequent (but not rare) and fearsome complications. Stroke rates after TAVR remain below 4% in recent literature, but data on predictors of peri‐procedural CVE occurrence is generally controversial and inconsistent. The incidence of peri‐procedural stroke seems to be lower in patients treated with TAVR rather than surgical aortic valve replacement, especially among those patients with low‐surgical risk.
