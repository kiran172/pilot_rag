Title: Coronary intravascular brachytherapy for in-stent restenosis: A review of the contemporary literature.

Abstract: Intracoronary stent restenosis (ISR) is a clinically relevant challenge in the modern era. Heterogeneity in patient- and lesion-specific factors can further compound this clinical challenge. Coronary intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) was the standard therapeutic approach for ISR prior to the advent of drug-eluting stents (DES). Despite prospective data describing the superiority of DES over IVBT for treating de novo ISR, IVBT remains a treatment option for patients with complex disease. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the historical and contemporary literature surrounding IVBT in order to elucidate its role in modern cardiac care and to describe opportunities for future investigations to improve patient selection. Herein, we provide a review of the contemporary literature describing IVBT as a safe and effective treatment option for patients with recurrent, refractory ISR after multilayer DES and no good surgical or mechanical option. Combination therapy with emerging technologies such as DCBs may further increase efficacy.
