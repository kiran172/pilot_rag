Title: Phenotyping the hypertensive heart.

Abstract: Arterial hypertension remains the most frequent cardiovascular (CV) risk factor, and is responsible for a huge global burden of disease. Echocardiography is the first-line imaging method for the evaluation of cardiac damage in hypertensive patients and novel techniques, such as 2D and D speckle tracking and myocardial work, provide insight in subclinical left ventricular (LV) impairment that would not be possible to detect with conventional echocardiography. The structural, functional, and mechanical cardiac remodelling that are detected with imaging are intermediate stages in the genesis of CV events, and initiation or intensification of antihypertensive therapy in response to these findings may prevent or delay progressive remodelling and CV events. However, LV remodelling-especially LV hypertrophy-is not specific to hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and there are circumstances when other causes of hypertrophy such as athlete heart, aortic stenosis, or different cardiomyopathies need exclusion. Tissue characterization obtained by LV strain, cardiac magnetic resonance, or computed tomography might significantly help in the distinction of different LV phenotypes, as well as being sensitive to subclinical disease. Selective use of multimodality imaging may therefore improve the detection of HHD and guide treatment to avoid disease progression. The current review summarizes the advanced imaging tests that provide morphological and functional data about the hypertensive cardiac injury.
