Title: Moderate or Severe Functional MR and Severe AS: Is Mitral Valve Surgery Justified?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE:  Mitral regurgitation (MR) and severe aortic valve stenosis often coexist. Concomitant replacement of both valves is associated with a significantly higher morbidity and mortality. This study sought to investigate the progression of MR after isolated aortic valve replacement.
METHODS:  We analyzed the severity and progression of MR, survival and echocardiographic parameters in 506 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis and moderate to severe functional MR who received isolated aortic valve replacement during a 9-year period.
RESULTS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was performed in 381 patients and 125 patients received surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The median age of the cohort was 82 years. Median ejection fraction before and after TAVI or SAVR was 35 and 36% respectively (p = 0.64). There was a statistically significant reduction in the MR (p &lt; 0.001) within both groups. Survival in both groups at 5 years was at 25%.
CONCLUSION:  Isolated aortic valve replacement in patients with accompanying moderate to severe functional MR may present an adequate treatment option for this high-risk patient collective.
