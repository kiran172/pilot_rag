Title: Sex-differences in echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve in young adult LDLr-/-/ApoB100/100/IGF-II+/- mice.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: LDLr-/-/ApoB100/100/IGF-II+/- mice are used as a calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) model. However, normal aortic valve hemodynamics i.e. remotely from CAVD onset and the sex-related differences are poorly known.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Four groups of mice, intact males (IM, n = 49) and females (IF, n = 50), castrated males (CxM, n = 79) and ovariectomized females (OxF: 73), underwent a Doppler-echocardiography at 12 weeks of age. Gonadectomy was performed at 8 weeks. Aortic valve assessment using effective orifice area (EOA, using the continuity equation) and peak aortic transvalvular velocity (V<sub>Peak</sub>) was feasible in 89% of the mice with good to excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.90 to 0.98, p &lt; 0.001). Mean V<sub>Peak</sub> was 104 ± 17 cm/s and mean EOA was 1.18*10-2 ± 0.22*10-2 cm2. EOA indexed to body surface area was 1.5 ± 0.3 cm2/m2. The 95th percentile of Vpeak was 132 cm/s and the 5th percentile of indexed EOA was 1.0 cm2/m2. Interestingly, IM had the highest V<sub>Peak</sub> (114 ± 14 cm/s) vs each of the other groups (CxM: 106 ± 19 cm/s, OxF: 97 ± 13 cm/s and IF: 96 ± 12 cm/s, ANOVA and corrected p &lt; 0.001). This was mostly explained by a higher stroke volume (ANOVA and corrected p &lt; 0.001) in IM compared to other groups. There were no major sex-differences in ventricular systolic function parameters.
CONCLUSION: In LDLr-/-/ApoB100/100/IGF-II CAVD mice model, an aortic EOA &lt;0.8*10-2 cm2 (or indexed EOA &lt;1.0cm2/m2), and a peak aortic valve velocity &gt; 132 cm/s may be proposed as thresholds to define CAVD. Intact male mice appear to have higher velocities.
