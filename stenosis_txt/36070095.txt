Title: Cellular-scale sex differences in extracellular matrix remodeling by valvular interstitial cells.

Abstract: Males acquire calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) twice as often as females, yet stenotic valves from females display significantly higher levels of fibrosis compared to males with similar extent of disease. Fibrosis occurs as an imbalance between theÂ production and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), specifically type I collagen. This work characterizes ECM production and remodeling by male and female valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to better understand the fibrocalcific divergence between sexes evident in CAVD. Male and female VICs were assessed for gene and protein expression of myofibroblastic markers, ECM components, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) via qRT-PCR and western blot. Overall metabolic activity was also measured. Activity assays for collagenase and gelatinase were performed to examine degradation behavior. Male VICs produced greater levels of myofibroblastic markers while female VICs showed greater metabolic activity and collagen production. In general, females displayed a greater level of MMP expression and production than males, but no sex differences were observed in TIMP production. Male VICs also displayed a greater level of collagenase and gelatinase activity than female VICs. This work displays sex differences in ECM remodeling by VICs that could be related to the sexual dimorphism in ECM structure seen in clinical CAVD.
