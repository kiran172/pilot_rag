Title: Long-term results of tricuspid reconstruction with pericardium in an infant.

Abstract: We report the long-term clinical outcome of an 8-month-old infant who underwent tricuspid reconstruction using fresh autologous pericardium for severe tricuspid regurgitation due to defects in the leaflets of the tricuspid valve after ventricular septal defect closure and ablation. Ten years after surgery, the tricuspid function is good with mild regurgitation and mild stenosis. From the age of 8 months to 11 years, the patient's body weight and height increased fourfold and twofold, respectively. Thus, a fresh autologous pericardial patch could be the material of choice for tricuspid leaflet repair in pediatric patients.
