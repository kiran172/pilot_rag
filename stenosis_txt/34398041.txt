Title: Impact of chronic kidney disease on the prognosis of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis, in conjunction with chronic kidney disease (CKD), after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unclear. This study assessed the impact of CKD, and different stages of CKD, on prognosis of patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: The protocol was written following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement guidelines. As of June 2021, we performed a comprehensive literature search on studies related to CKD and TAVR, using databases such as PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies. Then, Stata 15.0 software was used for meta-analysis.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of CKD and different stages of CKD on the prognosis of patients with TAVR. It is hoped to provide a comprehensive reference for clinical practice and related clinical trials in the future.
