Title: Unconventional deployment of atrial septal occluder in a patient with atrial septal defect, dextrocardia, and interrupted inferior vena cava.

Abstract: An atrial septal defect is a rare anomaly in patients with interrupted inferior vena cava, which renders the percutaneous intervention more complex; and hence, innovative approaches should be sought. Dextrocardia further complicates the procedure, and traditional atrial septal device deployment methods cannot be employed. We report a successful percutaneous secundum atrial septal defect closure by a novel deployment strategy along with balloon dilation of associated severe valvular pulmonary stenosis in a patient with dextrocardia and interrupted inferior vena cava.
