Title: Recent Technical Advancements of Endoscopic Spine Surgery with Disparate or Disruptive Technologies and Patents.

Abstract: There have been numerous technical advancements in the field of endoscopic spine surgery since it began in the 1980s and its use further expanded in the 1990s. At present, there are many newer technical advancements in this field, each trying to expand the indications and afford more accurate execution of this procedure. We predict some technologies which can be classified as being disruptive and have the potential of being game changers in this exciting field in the near future.
