Title: VitaFlow™ transcatheter valve system in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis: One-year results of a multicenter study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study reports the 1-year clinical outcomes of the VitaFlow™ transcatheter aortic valve system in the treatment of severe aortic stenosis.
BACKGROUND: The VitaFlow™ system (MicroPort®, Shanghai, China) was developed as a novel transcatheter aortic valve replacement system to mitigate or circumvent some of the challenges associated with heavily calcified valves and bicuspid valves.
METHODS: From September 2014 to November 2017, a prospective, multicenter, single arm study was conducted in 11 centers in China. The primary end point was all cause mortality at 12 months.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten symptomatic aortic stenosis patients (60 men, 50 women; mean age 77.73 ± 4.78 years) at prohibitive or high risk for surgery were enrolled. Mean society of thoracic surgeons score was 8.84 ± 5.58%. All-cause mortality was 2.7% at 1-year. Major stroke, major vascular complication, coronary artery obstruction, new pacemaker implantation occurred in 2.7, 2.7, 1.8, and 19.1% at 1-year follow-up, respectively. No patients had moderate or severe paravalvular leak at 1-year. At 1 year follow-up, 97% of patients had New York heart association ≤II. Patients with bicuspid valves had similar outcomes as those patients with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The 12-month clinical results support the safety and efficacy of VitaFlow™ in the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis, including patients with bicuspid aortic valve.
