Title: Preoperative antithrombotic treatment in acutely symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Early recurrence of cerebral ischemia in acutely symptomatic carotid artery stenosis can precede revascularization. The optimal antithrombotic regimen for this high-risk population is not well established. Although antiplatelet agents are commonly used, there is limited evidence for the use of anticoagulants. We sought to understand the safety and efficacy of short-term preoperative anticoagulants in secondary prevention of recurrent cerebral ischemic events from acutely symptomatic carotid stenosis in patients awaiting carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective query of a prospective single institution registry of carotid revascularization was performed. Patients who presented with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) attributable to an ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (ICA) were included. Antiplatelet (AP) only and anticoagulation (AC) treatment arms were compared. The primary outcome was a composite of preoperative recurrent ischemic stroke or TIA. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.
RESULTS: Out of 443 CEA patients, 342 were in the AC group and 101 in the AP group. Baseline characteristics between groups (AC vs AP) were similar apart from age (71±10.5 vs 73±9.5, p=0.04), premorbid modified Rankin scale (mRS) score (1.0±1.2 vs 1.4±1.3, p=0.03) and stroke as presenting symptom (65.8 vs 53.5%, p=0.02). Patients in the AC group had a lower incidence of recurrent stroke/TIA (3.8 vs 10.9%, p=0.006). One patient had symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the AC group, and none in the AP group. In multivariate analysis controlling for age, premorbid mRS, stroke severity, degree of stenosis, presence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT) and time to surgery, AC was protective (OR 0.30, p=0.007). This effect persisted in the cohort exclusively without ILT (OR 0.23, p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Short term preoperative anticoagulation in patients with acutely symptomatic carotid stenosis appears safe and effective compared to antiplatelet agents alone in the prevention of recurrent cerebral ischemic events while awaiting CEA.
