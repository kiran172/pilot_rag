Title: External Ring Annuloplasty: A Safe Landing Zone for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis in patients with previous valve-sparing root replacement represents a challenge, given the substantial morbidity and mortality rates in case of reoperation. Here, we present the case of a patient with late severe aortic stenosis 12 years after valve-sparing aortic root replacement. He was successfully treated by transapical aortic valve implantation. External ring annuloplasty, by reducing the native annuloaortic ectasia, allows transcatheter aortic valve replacement in case of stenotic deterioration of the native valve after valve-sparing aortic root replacement.
