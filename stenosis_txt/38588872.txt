Title: Quantitative assessment of retinochoroidal microvasculature in patients with carotid artery stenosis using OCT angiography.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the alterations in retinochoroidal parameters measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) in patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) and assess their associations with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) data.
METHOD: This study enrolled patients diagnosed with CAS and age-matched healthy controls. Both groups underwent OCT and OCTA examinations. DSA and assessment of carotid artery stenosis were performed only in the CAS group. The study evaluated various retinochoroidal parameters from OCT and OCTA, including linear vessel density (LVD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ), choroidal thickness (ChT), and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. DSA-derived measures included cervical segment (C1) diameter, cavernous segment (C4) diameter, stenosis percentage, ophthalmic artery (OA) filling time, C1-OA filling time, and residual stenosis.
RESULTS: A total of 42 eyes from 30 CAS patients and 60 eyes from 30 healthy controls were included. Patients with CAS displayed significantly decreased LVD compared to controls (p < 0.001). Additionally, the CAS group had thinner choroid and RNFL (p = 0.047 and p < 0.001, respectively). Macular LVD negatively correlated with both stenosis percentage and C1-OA filling time (p = 0.010 and p = 0.014, respectively). In patients who underwent carotid artery stenting, preoperative ChT significantly correlated with residual stenosis (Pearson r = -0.480, p = 0.020).
CONCLUSION: OCT and OCTA provide a quantitative assessment of retinochoroidal microstructural changes associated with CAS, suggesting potential for noninvasive evaluation of the disease. This might contribute to the prevention of irreversible ocular complications and early detection of CAS. Furthermore, ChT may not only aid in diagnosing CAS more reliably but also offer prognostic information.
