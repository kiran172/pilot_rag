Title: Restenosis after Coronary Stent Implantation: Cellular Mechanisms and Potential of Endothelial Progenitor Cells (A Short Guide for the Interventional Cardiologist).

Abstract: Coronary stents are among the most common therapies worldwide. Despite significant improvements in the biocompatibility of these devices throughout the last decades, they are prone, in as many as 10-20% of cases, to short- or long-term failure. In-stent restenosis is a multifactorial process with a complex and incompletely understood pathophysiology in which inflammatory reactions are of central importance. This review provides a short overview for the clinician on the cellular types responsible for restenosis with a focus on the role of endothelial progenitor cells. The mechanisms of restenosis are described, along with the cell-based attempts made to prevent it. While the focus of this review is principally clinical, experimental evidence provides some insight into the potential implications for prevention and therapy of coronary stent restenosis.
