Title: A Rare Anomalous Origin of the Right Vertebral Artery from the Internal Carotid Artery with an Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: An anomalous origin of the right vertebral artery (VA) from the right internal carotid artery (ICA) occurs only rarely.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old man underwent carotid artery stenting for right internal carotid artery stenosis. In this patient, the right VA arose from the right ICA associated with an aberrant right subclavian artery.
CONCLUSION: Embryologically, failure of involution of 1 of the first 6 intersegmental arteries causes various abnormal origins of the VA. The embryonic development of this anomaly is also reviewed.
