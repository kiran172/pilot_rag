Title: Interpretation of the central aortic pressure waveform in elderly patients with aortic stenosis.

Abstract: The central aortic pressure waveform, while simple in form, is complex in its physiological interpretation. Although general agreement has been reached on the contour and mechanisms responsible for pressure waveforms in the ascending aorta of healthy humans, in recent years there has been increasing interest in the contour of the pressure wave in elderly patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS). As aortic valve leaflets succumb to fibrosis and calcification, they increase opposition to forward flow. This results in a protracted pressure rise and manifests as the classical finding of pulsus parvus et tardus. Equally, changes to arterial properties (including elasticity and geometry) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) with age, heart failure, or hypertension can cause profound changes to the contour. Increased accessibility of methods to measure the central aortic pressure waveform, as well as the rapid uptake of transcatheter aortic valve implantation technologies, has created a renewed focus on better understanding of characteristic perturbations to the waveform in elderly patients with AS. In this review, we investigate the evolution of our understanding of the central aortic pressure waveform in varying AS disease states to highlight the importance of the physiological and biological basis for alterations in this waveform.
