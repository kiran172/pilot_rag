Title: Delineating Which Patient-reported Symptoms Are Associated with Satisfaction After Urethroplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine which patient-reported symptoms are associated with satisfaction after urethroplasty.
METHODS: From 2011 to 2018, patients were offered enrollment in a prospective study assessing patient-reported outcomes after urethroplasty. Outcomes were assessed preoperatively and 6-months postoperatively including patient satisfaction, voiding function (International Prostate Symptom Score), erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function 5) and ejaculatory function (ejaculatory component of brief sexual function inventory). Additionally, penile curvature/appearance, genitourinary pain, postvoid dribbling, and standing voiding function were also evaluated using either 3 or 5 point Likert scales. Stricture recurrence was defined as the inability to easily pass a 16Fr flexible videocystoscope. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to examine the associations between outcomes and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: A total of 387 patients completed the study with a mean age of 49.5 years and a mean stricture length of 4.5 cm. Location was bulbar (59.4%), penile (19.6%), posterior (13.7%) and pan-urethral (7.2%). At 6-months, 96.1% of patients were stricture-free, 81.6% reported being satisfied with surgery and 8% were unsatisfied. On multivariable binary logistic regression, improvement in International Prostate Symptom Score (odds ratio [OR]: 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.2, P = .04), new erectile dysfunction (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9, P = .04), new penile curvature (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9, P = .03) and improved standing voiding function (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.5, P = .004) were associated with patient satisfaction. Cystoscopic success (P = .60), change in pain score (P = .14), postvoid dribbling (P = .69), change in penile length (P = .44), and ejaculatory dysfunction (P = .51) were not.
CONCLUSION: Improved voiding function, patient-reported penile curvature, new erectile dysfunction and improved standing voiding are independently associated with patient satisfaction after urethroplasty and should be incorporated into any patient-centered approach to urethral stricture management.
