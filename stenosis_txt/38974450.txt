Title: A Case of Cerebral Infarction due to Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion Accompanied by Persistent Primitive Trigeminal Artery.

Abstract: An 85-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus became aware of motor weakness of the left lower extremity. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple small cerebral infarctions in the right corona radiata. Angiography revealed persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) originating from the right internal carotid artery (ICA) and connecting to basilar artery, and the right ICA occluded distal to PPTA. Collateral blood circulation had developed, and sufficient collateral blood flow was expected. From these findings, the right ICA was considered to show stenosis due to atherosclerotic changes before occlusion. Conservative treatment was conducted with the transoral administration of rivaroxaban. It is important to correctly diagnose the anatomy and existence of an anomalous vessel in a stroke patient, not only when endovascular treatment is planned, but also for conservative medical treatment. Rapid and accurate radiological examinations facilitate safe and effective treatment.
