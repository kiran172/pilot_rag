Title: The guardian of intracranial vessels: Why the pericyte?

Abstract: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is a pathological condition characterized by progressive narrowing or complete blockage of intracranial blood vessels caused by plaque formation. This condition leads to reduced blood flow to the brain, resulting in cerebral ischemia and hypoxia. Ischemic stroke (IS) resulting from ICAS poses a significant global public health challenge, especially among East Asian populations. However, the underlying causes of the notable variations in prevalence among diverse populations, as well as the most effective strategies for preventing and treating the rupture and blockage of intracranial plaques, remain incompletely comprehended. Rupture of plaques, bleeding, and thrombosis serve as precipitating factors in the pathogenesis of luminal obstruction in intracranial arteries. Pericytes play a crucial role in the structure and function of blood vessels and face significant challenges in regulating the Vasa Vasorum (VV)and preventing intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). This review aims to explore innovative therapeutic strategies that target the pathophysiological mechanisms of vulnerable plaques by modulating pericyte biological function. It also discusses the potential applications of pericytes in central nervous system (CNS) diseases and their prospects as a therapeutic intervention in the field of biological tissue engineering regeneration.
