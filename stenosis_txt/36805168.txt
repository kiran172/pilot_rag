Title: SARS-CoV-2 infection-related deregulation of blood lipids in a patient with -/-LDLR familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in blood lipids of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) has not been explored.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 43-year-old male patient with -/-LDLR HoFH with previous history of premature coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and surgical repair of aortic valve stenosis. He presented with an abrupt decrease of his blood lipid levels during acute infection with SARS-CoV2 and subsequently a rebound increase above pre-infection levels, refractory to treatment including LDL-apheresis, statin, ezetimibe and lomitapide up-titration to maximum tolerated doses. Markers of liver stiffness were closely monitored, increased at 9 months and decreased at 18 months after the infection. Potential interactions of hypolipidemic treatment with the viral replication process during the acute phase, as well as therapeutic dilemmas occurring in the post infection period are discussed.
