Title: Clinical outcomes on weekly endoscopic dilations as the initial approach to manage patients with complex benign esophageal strictures: report on 488 dilations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Success rate of endoscopic dilation (ED) of complex benign esophageal strictures (CBES) can be as low as 65%. Since EDs are usually performed at 2-4-week intervals, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of EDs done initially at weekly intervals.
METHODS: A cohort of patients with CBES (luminal diameter < 10 mm) underwent ED at weekly intervals and subsequent dilation intervals adjusted based on response. Weekly EDs were also re-initiated in those requiring additional interventions (electro-cautery/stents). Group A patients: Failed prior EDs done at ≥ 2-week intervals. Group B: CBES with no prior dilations. Success was defined as achieving and maintaining a luminal diameter of ≥ 14 mm and patient remaining dysphagia-free with minimal re-interventions.
RESULTS: 488 EDs were performed on a cohort of 57 consecutive patients with CBES. Median follow-up was 4 years. Group A: 21 patients (mean age 65 ± 13 years; mean interval between prior failed dilations 17 ± 9 days). 57% of these patients achieved long-term success with weekly dilations (mean 8 ± 4.7 dilations/patient). Group B: 36 patients (mean age 61 ± 13 years, mean 6.5 ± 5.5 dilations/patient). Long-term success was 83.3% (P = 0.033). Despite weekly dilations, unable to achieve a diameter of 14 mm in 5 patients. AE: perforation 1 (0.2%), bleeding 1 (0.2%).
CONCLUSION: Significant proportion of patients with CBES who failed prior dilations done at ≥ 2-week intervals achieved dysphagia-free status by initiating weekly dilations. Hence, before considering other options (electro-cautery/stents), one can consider using this approach. This approach can also be used upfront in patients with newly diagnosed CBES.
