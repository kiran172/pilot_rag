Title: Clinical outcomes in nonagenarians undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: To compare the risk of procedural complications and mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in nonagenarians (age ≥ 90 years) compared to younger patients (< 90 years). Although TAVI could be considered as a treatment option in nonagenarians, several previous studies have shown conflicting outcomes between nonagenarians and younger patients who underwent TAVI. We conducted a comprehensive literature search through PubMed and EMBASE to investigate the clinical outcomes of nonagenarians after TAVI. The outcomes of interest were short- and long-term mortality and procedural complications. Our study identified 16 observational studies including a total of 179,565 patients (21,674 nonagenarian patients and 157,891 younger patients. Nonagenarians had a significantly higher rate of short- (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48, 1.38-1.59; P < 0.001) and long-term mortality (HR, 95% CI: 1.34, 1.24-1.44; P < 0.001) than younger patients after TAVI. Furthermore, there were significant differences in major and/or life-threatening bleeding (risk ratio [RR], 95% CI: 1.21, 1.05-1.39; P = 0.008), stroke (HR, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.11-1.40; P < 0.001), and major vascular complication (RR, 95% CI: 2.15, 1.35-3.42; P = 0.001) between nonagenarians and younger patients after TAVI. Minor vascular complication, myocardial infarction and permanent pacemaker implantation rate were similar between the two groups. Nonagenarians had significantly higher rate of short- and long-term mortality, major and/or life-threatening bleeding, stroke, and major vascular complication after TAVI. Although TAVI is a treatment option in nonagenarians, careful and appropriate selection of patients is essential to improve clinical outcomes.
