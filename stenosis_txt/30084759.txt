Title: Self-Expandable Covered Metallic Stent (UVENTA) to Treat a Ureteral Stricture After Renal Transplant: A Case Report.

Abstract: We present the use of a self-expandable covered metallic stent (UVENTA; TaeWoong Medical, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) to treat a ureteral stricture after kidney transplant. In this report, we describe the procedure and short-term outcomes of a patient with a recurrent distal stricture who did not respond to percutaneous balloon dilation. We decided to place this temporary stent as an alternative to complex surgery. The aim of the procedure was to get a chronic dilation of the stricture up to 7 mm to stabilize the fibrotic tissue. The procedure was easily and quickly performed by an antegrade and retrograde combined approach. The postoperative course was uneventful. The stent was left in situ for 7 months. No complications were noted, and the renal function remained stable. The stent was easily removed, and 5 months later there were no signs of recurrence. The UVENTA device was shown to be an easy, safe, and effective minimally invasive treatment for ureteral stricture in renal transplant. Proper permanence time and long-term results need to be explored.
