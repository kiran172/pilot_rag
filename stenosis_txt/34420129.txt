Title: How I do it? Uniportal full endoscopic pseudoarthrosis release of left L5/S1 Bertolotti's syndrome under intraoperative computer tomographic guidance in an ambulatory setting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is limited literature on technique full endoscopic pseudoarthrosis release of Bertolotti syndrome.
METHODS: Uniportal full endoscopic pseudoarthrosis release technique applies for patients presenting with symptomatic Bertolotti's syndrome. Full-thickness endoscopic drilling is carried out from most ventrolateral margin of pseudoarthrosis articulating with the highest part of sacral ala (PH) point to dorsal medioinferior margin of pseudoarthrosis adjacent to superior articular process (MS) point. Complete pseudoarthrosis release was confirmed with an intraoperative 3D imaging system.
CONCLUSION: The uniportal full endoscopic pseudoarthrosis release is a good alternative to open surgery to release pseudoarthrosis in L5/S1 Bertolotti's syndrome in an ambulatory setting.
