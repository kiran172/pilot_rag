Title: Endovascular treatment of an immediate postoperative transplant renal artery stenosis with a polymer free drug eluting stent.

Abstract: The transplant renal artery stenosis occurred up to 23% after kidney transplantation. Endovascular treatment has become the treatment of choice of this complication, but could be challenging in immediate postoperative anastomotic narrowing. We report the case of a adolescent with early renal graft artery stenosis located in the anastomosis and diagnosed 3 days after renal transplantation, with necessity of haemodialysis. This complication was treated by angioplasty on the 25th day, using a polymer free drug eluting stent with a good result. We discussed the precautions and technical features of this procedure.
