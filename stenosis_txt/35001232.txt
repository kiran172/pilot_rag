Title: Long-term clinical and angiographic outcome from angioplasty and stenting for intracranial stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is a major cause of stroke. Although percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) treatment methods have increased over the last decade as alternative therapies, there is debate regarding the best method of treatment, with medical and surgical therapies often suggested.
METHODS: We analyzed the long-term follow-up results from 5 years of intracranial stenting for intracranial stenosis from three stroke centers. The primary endpoints were early stroke complications or death within 30 days after stent insertion, and the secondary endpoint was a recurrent stroke between 30 days and 60 months. Correlating factors and Kaplan-Meier survival curves for recurrent stroke and in-stent restenosis (ISR) were also obtained.
RESULTS: Seventy-three PTAS in 71 patients were examined in this study. The primary and secondary endpoints were all 8.2% (n = 6), and restenosis was 13.7% (n = 10) during the 5-year follow-up. The primary endpoints were significantly frequent in the high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and early stent (≤ 7 days after dual antiplatelet medication) groups. Secondary endpoint and ISR were identically frequent in the younger age group and in the presence of tandem stenosis in other major intracranial arteries. The cumulative probability of recurrent stroke and ISR at 60 months was 16.4% and 14.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PTAS is safe and effective for major ICAS. Reducing the early complication rate is still an important factor, despite the fact that long-term stroke recurrence was low.
