Title: The Efficacy of Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy Combined With Chemotherapy, Brachytherapy, and Local Hyperthermia on Patients with Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) followed by brachytherapy (BT), combined with chemotherapy, and local hyperthermia (HT) on locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC).
METHODS: In total, 40 patients with FIGO stage IB1-IVB cervical cancer from January 2016 to December 2018 were selectively enrolled in this study. All patients were treated with VMAT (50.4 Gy/1.8 Gy/28 f) concurrent with cisplatin-based chemotherapy (40 mg/m2, q1w, 6 cycles) and local HT (40.5-41°C for 60 min, BIW). BT (30-36 y/5-6 f, 2 f/w) was conducted after VMAT. Objective response rate (ORR), local control (LC) time, LC rate, progression-free survival (PFS) rate, cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate, overall survival (OS), median time to tumor progression and treatment-related toxicity were evaluated.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 31 months (8-48). The ORR was 100% at 3 months after treatment and 92.1% at 6 months, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year LC rates were 87.4%, 81.9%, and 70.9%, respectively. The average LC time was 31.50 ± 1.89 months (95% CI 27.79-35.21). The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year PFS rates were 75.85%, 61.2%, and 51.3%, respectively, while the median PFS was 27.07 months. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS rates were 95%, 84%, and 79.6%, respectively. In total, 12(30%) patients had grade 3/4 bone marrow suppression. One patient had grade 4 leukopenia. In total, 17 patients had grade 1/2 bone marrow suppression. Two patients had grade 3 nausea and grade 3 vomiting reaction, respectively. No grade 3/4 proctitis and bladder reaction were observed. In the late period of treatment, 1 patient had a rectal hemorrhage. In total, 13 patients had vaginal stenosis.
CONCLUSION: VMAT concurrent with chemotherapy, BT, and local HT had a favorable short-term efficacy and acceptable toxicity on cervical cancer, which was an alternative option for LACC.
