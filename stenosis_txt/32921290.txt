Title: Two-year follow-up of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds in severe infra-popliteal arterial disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety, efficacy, and durability of the Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold in predominantly complex, infra-popliteal lesions for the management of chronic limb ischemia at two-year clinical follow-up. Bioresorbable vascular scaffold are biodegradable scaffolds that provide short-term vascular support before undergoing intravascular degradation. A recent trial reported excellent 36-month vessel patency rates in simple infrapopliteal arterial lesions treated with Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold.
METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study evaluated the use of the Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (everolimus impregnated poly-L-lactic scaffold) in patients with infra-popliteal peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with respect to safety (thrombosis and TIMI bleeding), technical success, and freedom from clinically driven target vessel failure at 24 months.
RESULTS: 31 patients (51.6% male) with a median age of 67 years with predominantly advanced infra-popliteal disease were treated with 49 bioresorbable vascular scaffold in 41 vessels. The mean stenosis was 94% (80-100), with 49% of lesions being chronic thrombotic occlusions. No scaffold thrombosis or peri-procedural bleeding was observed. Procedural success was achieved in all patients; 93.5% of patients experienced freedom from clinically driven target vessel failure at 24 months, driven by one revascularization and one amputation. Primary patency was 96.7% at 12 months and 87.1% at 24 months. All patients were alive at 12 and 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: At 24 months, our study found that patients with predominantly advanced infra-popliteal PAD who were treated with Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold reported improved clinical status and a low and durable rate of clinically driven target vessel failure extending out to 24 months.
