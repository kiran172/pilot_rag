Title: Cystic lymphangioma presenting as an acute abdomen in an adult male with congenital aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Abdominal cystic lymphangioma rarely presents as an acute abdomen. In this article, we describe a young adult male with congenital aortic stenosis who initially presented with abdominal pain and raised inflammatory markers. The imaging in the form of a computed tomography scan was unfortunately inconclusive. In the evolution of this diagnostic dilemma, we describe the importance of early operative management as well as explore the link between cardiac and lymphatic malformations.
