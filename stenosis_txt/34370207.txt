Title: Congenital spine deformities: timing of insult during development of the spine in utero.

Abstract: The development of the spine andÂ spinal cord occurs at the earliest weeks of gestation. Their development not only affects each other but also are most likely associated with anomalies in other systems. It is essential to recognize the stages of spine development to understand the cause of congenital spinal deformities and their influences on the postnatal growing spine. A vast majority of congenital spinal problems are not evident clinically. For instance, the presence of neural axis abnormalities, such as spinal dysraphism or syringomyelia, may be so subtle that patients never seek medical care. Certain vertebral formation disorders such as hemivertebrae may remain asymptomatic throughout life if they are balanced while those with congenital bars may develop severe deformity. Major defects in the spine are often associated with abnormalities of the other organs such as cardiovascular and genital urinary system that warrants close attention by multidisciplinary specialists. A thorough understanding of the basics of embryology, which serves as a window into the development of the spine, is necessary to enable the practitioner to appreciate why, when, and where the numerous spine deformities develop in utero. Besides, certain developmental defects manifest in adulthood including spondylolysis, degenerative disc disease, congenital spinal stenosis, and even tumors like cordoma. Thus, understanding embryology can assist to establish the proper diagnosis and ensure optimal treatment.
