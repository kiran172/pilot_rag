Title: A Case of Coexistence of Severe Coronary and Carotid Artery Stenosis Treated with Carotid Artery Stenting Using Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumping and a Temporary Pacemaker.

Abstract: The risk factors of carotid stenosis and coronary stenosis are similar, and therefore, certain patients with carotid stenosis may have coronary heart disease. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is the major therapy for ischemic heart disease with three-vessel and left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease. However, CABG can induce cerebral infarctions in cases with carotid stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was used to be the standard therapy for carotid stenosis; however, CEA requires general anesthesia and has a high risk of cardiovascular events in patients with ischemic heart disease. In recent times, carotid artery stenting (CAS), which does not need general anesthesia, is the new strategy for carotid stenosis. However, CAS induces hypotension and bradycardia because of a carotid node reflex, which is dangerous in patients with ischemic heart disease. We reported a case of the coexistence of severe coronary stenosis including the LMCA and three vessels and carotid stenosis. CAS before CABG under local anesthesia was successful with the use of intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) and a temporary pacemaker.
