Title: Impact of vascular morphology and plaque characteristics on computed tomography derived fractional flow reserve in early stage coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computed-tomography (CT) derived fractional-flow-reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) gradually may decrease from proximal to distal vessels even without apparent coronary artery disease (CAD). It may be unclear whether the decrease in FFR<sub>CT</sub> at the distal coronal artery is physiological or due to stenosis. We decided to study predictive factors of an FFR<sub>CT</sub> decline below the pathological value of 0.80 in no-apparent CAD.
METHODS: A total of 150 consecutive patients who had both CT angiography coupled to FFR<sub>CT</sub> analysis and invasive angiogram showing &lt; 20% coronary stenosis were included. Vessels were divided into two groups according to FFR<sub>CT</sub> at the distal vessel: FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80 (n = 317) and FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 (n = 114). ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> was defined as the change in FFR<sub>CT</sub> from proximal to distal vessel. Vessel morphology (vessel length and lumen volume) and plaque characteristics [low-attenuation plaque volume, intermediate-attenuation (IAP) plaque volume, and calcified plaque volume] were evaluated.
RESULTS: FFR<sub>CT</sub> decreased from proximal to distal for the three major vessels in both FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80 and FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80. Compared to FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80, IAP volume was significantly higher in all three major vessels in FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80. ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> was correlated with vessel length and lumen volume in FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80, whereas ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> was correlated with IAP volume in FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80. IAP volume above 44.8 mm3 was the strongest predictor of distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> of ≤ 0.80.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of IAP is a major predictor of gradual decrease of FFR<sub>CT</sub> below 0.80 in no-apparent CAD vessels. Vessel morphology and plaque characteristics should be considered when interpreting FFR<sub>CT</sub>.
