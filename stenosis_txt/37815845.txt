Title: Redo transcatheter aortic valve replacement in degenerated transcatheter bioprosthesis (TAV-in-TAV).

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: With the expanding indications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to younger and low-risk patients, the life expectancy of patients currently undergoing TAVR will likely outlive the durability of transcatheter bioprosthesis. Consequently, the number of failed transcatheter bioprosthesis requiring surgical valve explant or redo TAVR is expected to increase.
AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of redo TAVR for treating degenerated transcatheter bioprosthesis, focusing on pre-procedural planning, potential challenges of coronary reaccess during TAVR-in-TAVR and main outcomes of TAVR explant and redo TAVR.
EXPERT OPINION: Patient-tailored device selection and individualized implantation height should be carefully assessed during the index TAVR procedure (weighting between pacemaker avoidance and the potential risk of coronary occlusion in future TAVR-in-TAVR). Future prospective studies comparing safety and clinical outcomes between redo TAVR vs TAVR explant are eagerly awaited.
