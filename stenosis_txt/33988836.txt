Title: The Association between Multi-Vessel Coronary Artery Disease and High On-Aspirin Platelet Reactivity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multi-vessel coronary artery disease (MV-CAD) is correlated with worse clinical outcomes compared with single-vessel CAD (SV-CAD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between MV-CAD and high on-aspirin platelet reactivity (HAPR) in patients with stable CAD treated with aspirin.
METHODS: The current study is an analysis of prospectively enrolled randomly selected patients with known stable CAD, who were taking aspirin (75-100 mg qd) regularly for at least one month, and had undergone coronary angiography at least 3 months prior to the enrollment to the study.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: acute coronary syndrome at the time of platelet function testing, active malignancy, acute infection, active inflammatory/rheumatic disease, major surgery in the past 6 months, chronic liver failure, treatment with oral anticoagulation, non-adherence with Aspirin and thrombocytopenia (<100 K/micl). Blood was drawn from the participants and sent for platelet function testing (VerifyNow, Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Bedford, Massachusetts, United States). MV-CAD was defined as >50% stenosis in ≥2 separate major coronary territories per coronary angiography. HAPR was defined as aspirin reaction units (ARU) >550.
RESULTS: Overall, 507 patients were analyzed; age 66.7 ± 11.2, 17.9% women, 223 (44%) had MV-CAD. The rate of HAPR was significantly higher among patients with MV-CAD vs. SV-CAD (14.8% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, a "dose response"-like association was found between the number of stenotic coronary arteries and the rate of HAPR (3.5%, 13.5 and 17.3% for SV-CAD, 2-vessel and 3-vessel disease, respectively). In a multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders, MV-CAD was found to be a strong independent predictor of HAPR [OR = 1.8 (95%CI: 1.05-4.7), p = 0.014].
CONCLUSIONS: A significant association between MV-CAD and HAPR was found. Additional studies designed to investigate the mechanisms of HAPR and different therapeutic options for this subset of patients are warranted.
