Title: Prognostic implications of pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement computed tomography-derived coronary plaque characteristics and stenosis severity.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) computed tomography angiography (CTA) in assessing physiological stenosis severity (CTA-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR)) and high-risk plaque characteristics (HRPC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among TAVR patients who underwent pre-procedure CTA, the presence and number of HRPCs (minimum lumen area of &lt; 4 mm2, plaque burden ≥ 70%, low-attenuating plaques, positive remodeling, napkin-ring sign, or spotty calcification) as well as CT-FFR were assessed. The risk of vessel-oriented composite outcome (VOCO, a composite of vessel-related ischemia-driven revascularization, vessel-related myocardial infarction, or cardiac death) was compared according to the number of HRPC and CT-FFR categories.
RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-seven patients (68.4% were male) with 1072 vessels were included. Their mean age was 70.6 ± 10.6 years. Vessels with low CT-FFR (≤ 0.80) (41.7% vs. 15.8%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR<sub>adj</sub>) 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-2.96; p = 0.001) or lesions with ≥ 3 HRPC (38.7% vs. 16.0%, HR<sub>adj</sub> 1.81; 95%CI 1.20-2.71; p = 0.005) demonstrated higher VOCO risk. In the CT-FFR (&gt; 0.80) group, lesions with ≥ 3 HRPC showed a significantly higher risk of VOCO than those with &lt; 3 HRPC (34.7% vs. 13.0%; HR<sub>adj</sub> 2.04; 95%CI 1.18-3.52; p = 0.011). However, this relative increase in risk was not observed in vessels with positive CT-FFR (≤ 0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: In TAVR candidates, both CT-FFR and the presence of ≥ 3 HRPC were associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events. However, the value of HRPC differed with the CT-FFR category, with more incremental predictability among vessels with negative CT-FFR but not among vessels with positive CT-FFR.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: In transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) candidates, pre-TAVR CTA provided the opportunity to assess coronary physiological stenosis severity and high-risk plaque characteristics, both of which are associated with worse clinical outcomes.
KEY POINTS: • The current study investigated the prognostic value of coronary physiology significance and plaque characteristics in transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients. • The combination of coronary plaque vulnerability and physiological significance showed improved accuracy in predicting clinical outcomes in transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients. • Pre-transcatheter aortic valve replacement CT can be a one-stop-shop tool for coronary assessments in clinical practice.
