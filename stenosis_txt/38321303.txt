Title: Evaluation of the Concentration of Selected Elements in the Serum of Patients with Degenerative Stenosis of the Lumbosacral Spine.

Abstract: In humans, 23 elements have been shown to have biological activity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), sodium (Na), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), and calcium (Ca) in the serum of patients diagnosed with lumbar degenerative stenosis when compared to the concentrations of those elements in the serum of healthy volunteers. The study group consisted of 60 patients who were diagnosed with degenerative stenosis of the lumbosacral spine and who qualified for hemilaminectomy. The control group included 60 healthy volunteers without degenerative spinal stenosis. The clinical specimens studied had sera collected from both groups. The quantitative analysis of the selected elements revealed statistically significant (p < 0.05) lower concentrations of Zn (740 ± 110 µg/L vs. 880 ± 160 µg/L) and Mg (22,091 ± 4256 µg/L vs. 24,100 ± 4210 µg/L) in the serum of the patients from the study group when compared to the controls. By contrast, K (16,230 µg/L ± 1210 µg/L vs. 13,210 µg/L ± 1060 µg/L) and Fe (141.87 µg/L ± 11.22 µg/L vs. 109.1 µg/L ± 26.43 µg/L) levels were significantly higher in the study group compared to the controls (p < 0.05). No statistically significant changes were detected in the concentrations of the assessed micronutrients and macronutrients in both sexes in either the study group, the control group, or those based on body mass index (p > 0.05). In the serum samples from the study group, the strongest correlations were noted between the concentrations. In the study group, we showed a significant relationship between the levels of Fe/Zn (r = 0.41), Fe/Na (r = 0.41), Fe/P (r = 0.55), Zn/P (r = 0.68), Zn/K (r = 0.48), Zn/Ca (r = 0.94), Mg/Ca (r = 0.79), and Na/K (r = 0.67). We showed that only Mg concentration varied statistically significantly with the severity of pain (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that the assessment of Fe, Zn, Mg, and K concentrations can be helpful in predicting the onset of degenerative changes in the spine.
