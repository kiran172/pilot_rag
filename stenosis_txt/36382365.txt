Title: Sequential percutaneous tricuspid and pulmonary valve implantation in a young child operated previously for Ebstein Anomaly.

Abstract: We report a successful percutaneous tricuspid valve implantation followed by a percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation in a young child with Ebstein's anomaly of tricuspid valve and pulmonary stenosis who was previously treated surgically at 1 year of age with tricuspid ring annuloplasty and a transannular outflow patch. This article shows the feasibility of sequential implantation of two valves in young patients with severe tricuspid and pulmonary valve insufficiency.
