Title: Soluble ST2 levels are related to replacement myocardial fibrosis in severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with aortic stenosis (AS) exhibit left ventricular (LV) remodeling and replacement myocardial fibrosis (RMF). Whether sST2 is associated with RMF measured by cardiac magnetic resonance and with sex remains unknown.
METHODS: We recruited 79 consecutive patients (73.0 [68.0-78.0] years; 61% men) with severe isolated AS underdoing valve replacement. RMF was identified and quantified by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Serum sST2 levels were determined.
RESULTS: RMF was associated with higher circulating sST2 levels, LV hypertrophy and dilation, and lower LV ejection fraction. All patients with LV dysfunction had RMF. Circulating levels of sST2 ≥ 28.8 ng/mL were associated with RMF and greater LV hypertrophy. LGE mass was correlated with LV remodeling and sST2. Of note, sST2 levels were also associated with the RMF pattern, being higher in midwall than in subendocardial fibrosis. Multivariate analyses showed that only LV ejection fraction and sST2 levels were associated with RMF. Moreover, men had higher levels of sST2 and RMF. RMF was associated with higher LV dilation and hypertrophy only in men and was correlated with LGE mass.
CONCLUSIONS: SST2 was an independent factor for RMF in patients with severe isolated AS. The presence of RMF was predicted by sST2 ≥ 28.2 ng/mL, and was associated with greater LV hypertrophy. sST2 expression and clinical associations may be sex-specific.
