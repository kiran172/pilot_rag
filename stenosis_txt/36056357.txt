Title: Effect of modified esophagectomy perioperative technique resection for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (tumor length > 8 cm): initial experience in 45 cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer with a lesion length greater than 8 cm (LCWEC) are prone to high mortality in a short time due to esophagotracheal fistula (ETF) and esophagoaortic fistula (EAF). We tried to explore a safe salvage surgical method during the perioperative period to maximize the resection of the tumor on the premise of safety and reconstruction of the alimentary tract to avoid early death due to ETF and EAF.
METHODS: From December 2007 to November 2018, forty-five LCWEC patients were treated using the modified Wu's esophagectomy. Patient features, surgical techniques, postoperative complications, and pathology outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average length of the tumors was 12.5 cm (range 8.1-22.5 cm), and the average transverse tumor diameter was 5.8 cm (range 4.5-7.8 cm). No complications like anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stenosis, chylothorax, delayed gastric emptying, vocal cord paralysis, dumping syndrome, and reflux were detected. The 30-day and in-hospital mortality rates were 0%. Complete (R0) resection was achieved in 38 (84.4%) cases. The resection margin rate of positive anastomosis was 0%. Until the death of the patients, no feeding failure due to gastrointestinal obstruction and early death due to ETF or EAF occurrence. During follow-up, the median time to death was 17.2 months for patients treated with surgery alone and 32 months for patients treated with postoperative multimodal treatment.
CONCLUSION: The modified Wu's esophagectomy is a safe and feasible salvage surgical method for LCWEC resection.
