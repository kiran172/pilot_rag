Title: Balloon rupture during transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: A distinctive complication with balloon-expandable (BE) THV platforms such as the Edwards Sapien (Edwards Lifescience) is the possibility of balloon rupture during THV deployment. Balloon rupture is a rare occurrence that can result in stroke due to fragment embolism, incomplete THV expansion, and/or vascular injury upon retrieval of the balloon. Careful evaluation of preoperative computed tomography is essential to identify high-risk cases. While annular and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) calcification are widely acknowledged as common risks for balloon injury, it's essential to note that balloon injury can manifest at various anatomical sites. In this review, we discuss the mechanism behind balloon rupture, methods to identify cases at a heightened risk of balloon injury, approaches to mitigate the risk of rupture, and percutaneous retrieval strategies.
