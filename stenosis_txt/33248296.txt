Title: Three-dimensional computed tomography venography reconstruction facilitates identification of atypical radiologic features of May-Thurner syndrome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is typically characterized by compression of the left common iliac vein by the overlying right common iliac artery. The present study evaluated the occurrence of atypical imaging features of MTS using three-dimensional computed tomography venography reconstruction (3D-CTV) and analyzed their correlation with clinical features.
METHODS: We analyzed the data from 268 patients with left lower extremity chronic venous disease (CVD) using 3D-CTV at a single institution from January to June 2019. An area stenosis percentage >50% was defined as significant venous compression. Of the 268 patients, 92 had at least one significant iliac and/or vena cava compression confirmed by 3D-CTV. Of the 92 patients, 89 underwent digital subtraction venography via the left common femoral vein, and the outcomes were compared with their 3D-CTV findings. Different types of venous compression were evaluated using 3D-CTV. The relationship among compression type, sex, age, and CVD symptoms was evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 106 venous compression sites were found in 92 patients. Atypical compression included inferior vena cava (IVC) compression and partial IVC compression (8.5% and 55.7%, respectively). Multiple compression sites were present in 13 patients (14.1%). The compression sites correlated significantly with clinical symptoms (P = .017) and were related to sex (P = .001). The number of patients with IVC and partial IVC compression but false-negative venography findings was four (33.3%) and six (50%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: 3D-CTV facilitates the detection of atypical venous compression in patients with MTS with notable chronic symptoms. Patients with multiple compression sites had more severe clinical symptoms and greater false-negative rates with venography. IVC compression was more likely to occur in female patients with MTS.
