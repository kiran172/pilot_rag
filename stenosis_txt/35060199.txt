Title: Rapid progression of mitral stenosis after atrial septal defect closure in a Lutembacher's syndrome patient.

Abstract: The combination of the atrial septal defect (ASD) and mitral stenosis (MS) is an unusual clinical entity called Lutembacher's syndrome. The hemodynamic interaction between the two cardiac malformations modifies the disease progression of each other. The symptom and progression of MS were thought to be slowed because of the existence of a left-to-right shunt that relived the blood flow through the mitral orifice. There is no consensus about caring this patient population for now. Here, we present a 58-year-old female with mild MS and coexistent ASD experiencing rapid progression of mitral valve lesions after percutaneous ASD closure. This case might identify the effect of ASD on delaying MS progression. From this point of view, MS and coexisting ASD should be evaluated and treated as a whole.
