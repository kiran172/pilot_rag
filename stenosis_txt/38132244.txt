Title: Congenital High Airway Obstructive Syndrome (CHAOS) Survival of a Newborn with Laryngeal Atresia.

Abstract: Congenital high airway obstructive syndrome (CHAOS) is a rare congenital anomaly, frequently caused by laryngeal or tracheal atresia, tracheal stenosis, and obstructing laryngeal cysts. This is a congenital malformation, often fatal, with an unknown prevalence. Laryngeal atresia is the most frequent cause. We report a case of an intrauterine diagnosis of CHAOS and ascites in a 17-week fetus delivered at 38 weeks of gestation without other associated malformations. A fetoscopic procedure was performed at 22 weeks of gestation. An attempt was made to perforate the affected area to ensure pulmonary fluid circulation and the ascites' resolution. After birth, a tracheostomy was performed. The patient was mechanically ventilated until 11 months of age, when she was discharged with no cerebral or other complications of immediate postnatal anoxia or episodes of respiratory arrest. A laryngotracheoplasty was performed at 2 years old, but decannulation was not possible due to certain complications. At 5 years old, a new surgical intervention was performed, which allowed decannulation 6 months later.
