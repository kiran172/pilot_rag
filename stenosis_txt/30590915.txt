Title: Sudden hemodynamic collapse after prone positioning on a Jackson spinal table for spinal surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prone position is used for a variety of procedures and surgeries, and hypotension is a commonly encountered complication.
CASE: A 75-year-old obese woman with lumbar spinal stenosis underwent posterior lumbar spinal fusion and posterolateral interbody fusion under general anesthesia. Before the surgery, when she was positioned on a Jackson spinal table in the prone position, sudden severe hypotension and hemodynamic collapse developed. The circulatory collapse was refractory to intravascular volume expansion and administration of inotropes and vasopressors. However, the application of external abdominal support immediately restored hemodynamic stability. The patient successfully underwent the surgery using an external abdominal support, and no post-operative complication was noted, including abdominal compartment syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: The Jackson spinal table allowed the abdomen to hang freely, providing abdominal decompression while resulting in a severely sagged abdomen. We suspected that the sagging abdomen had pulled the abdominal contents downwards, kinking the inferior vena cava or causing a venous pool in the abdomen, resulting in the obstruction of venous return to the heart.
