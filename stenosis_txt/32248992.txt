Title: Innovative transapical-transfemoral loop approach: First case of CoreValve implantation in a 19-mm Mitroflow during double valve-in-valve procedure.

Abstract: An 80-year-old woman with rheumatic valve disease and two previous cardiac surgeries was admitted for heart failure exacerbation. The patient presented stenotic aortic 19-mm Mitroflow and mitral 31-mm Carpentier-Edwards bioprostheses, and was deemed inoperable due to frailty and prohibitive surgical risk. The heart team decided on a compassionate double valve-in-valve procedure, with transfemoral implantation of a 23-mm aortic CoreValve Evolut R and transapical implantation of a 29-mm mitral Edwards SAPIEN 3. During the procedure, after extreme difficulty in retrograde crossing of the aortic valve, a transapical-transfemoral loop was successfully performed. The procedure was without complications and the patient was discharged in NYHA class II with normally functioning valves.
