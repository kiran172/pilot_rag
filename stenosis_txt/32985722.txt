Title: Hybrid reconstruction of bronchial dehiscence following lung transplant.

Abstract: Surgical repair of right-sided bronchial dehiscence post lung transplant is challenging. We report a hybrid reconstruction of the bronchus using an aortic homograft patch with stenting as a novel technique of management of ischemic airway injury following lung transplantation.
