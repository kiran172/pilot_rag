Title: Radiologic Findings of Cricoid Chondronecrosis after Intubation in the Setting of COVID-19.

Abstract: This case series examines seven patients diagnosed with cricoid chondronecrosis after intubation in the setting of COVID-19 and presents a novel "cricoid chondronecrosis computed tomography (CT) grading rubric" to standardize reporting of radiological findings. Application of this radiological grading rubric can improve communication among clinicians and radiologists and aid in prognosis determination of patients with cricoid chondronecrosis. Laryngoscope, 2024.
