Title: Diagnosis of Dextrocardia with a Pictorial Rendition of Terminology and Diagnosis.

Abstract: A significant number of patients with dextrocardia and other cardiac malpositions have other congenital heart defects (CHDs). The incidence of CHDs in subjects with cardiac malpositions is significantly greater than that in normal children, and the prevalence varies with the associated visceroatrial situs. The most useful approach to diagnosis is segmental analysis. Firstly, dextroposition should be excluded. In segmental analysis, the visceroatrial situs, ventricular location, status of atrioventricular connections, the great artery relationship, and conotruncal relationship are determined with the use of electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and echocardiographic studies, and, when necessary, other imaging studies, including angiography. Following identification of the afore-mentioned segments, the associated defects in the atrial and ventricular septae, valvar and vascular stenosis or atresia may be determined by a review of the historical information, physical examination, and analysis of chest roentgenogram, ECG, and echocardiographic studies. Along the way, a pictorial rendition of the terminology and diagnosis of cardiac malpositions is undertaken.
