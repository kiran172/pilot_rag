Title: Association between endothelin-1, nitric oxide, and Gensini score in chronic coronary syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) is a major public health burden; its pathogenesis involves atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and nitric oxide (NO) are vasoactive substances synthesized by endothelial cells that play a crucial role in CCS development. The Gensini score (GS) is used for evaluating CCS severity based on lumen segment changes, stenosis degree, and coronary stenosis site.
METHODS: This prospective study included 71 patients with CCS; we evaluated the relationships between GS and ET-1 and NO serum levels were evaluated in these patients. The GS was calculated for all patients. Serum ET-1 & NO levels among other laboratory parameters were measured.
RESULTS: The high GS group had higher ET-1 and relatively NO expressions in the than the low GS group. GS was positively correlated with ET-1 and negatively correlated with NO, T4, and TSH levels. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that ET-1 had the most significant effect on GS.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a strong association between ET-1, NO, and CCS severity. A combination of ET-1, NO, and GS is an essential predictor of CCS disease severity.
