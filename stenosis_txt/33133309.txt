Title: Bifurcation pulmonary venoplasty and stenting for recalcitrant pulmonary vein stenosis after surgical pulmonary vein reconstruction.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is a rare, severe, and potentially fatal complication most often arising from pulmonary vein ablation for medication refractory, symptomatic, and permanent atrial fibrillation. At present, the optimal approach for the management of PVS remains to be defined. Here, we describe a unique case of bifurcation pulmonary venoplasty and stenting in a patient with recalcitrant PVS after surgical reconstruction of her pulmonary veins. To our knowledge, this is the first such report of its kind. &lt;Learning objective: The optimal approach to managing complex pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is unclear. Our aim is to illustrate our successful approach for treating recalcitrant and complex PVS using dual transseptal access and kissing balloon bifurcation pulmonary venoplasty.&gt;.
