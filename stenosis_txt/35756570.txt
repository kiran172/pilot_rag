Title: Management of severe aortic stenosis in asymptomatic patients in the new AVATAR.

Abstract: Management of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis remains debatable. Until now, evidence on the subject was limited to observational studies, registry data, and meta-analyses. Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Conservative Treatment in Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis trial thus is the first randomized controlled trial assessing the role of surgery in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. A critical evaluation of the study along with discussion on existing evidence has been provided in this appraisal.
