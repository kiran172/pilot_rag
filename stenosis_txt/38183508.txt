Title: Impact of left ventricular inflow-outflow angle on heart failure readmission post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) readmission post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is common; however, its anatomical predictors remain unclear. This study identified a small systolic left ventricular inflow-outflow (LVIO) angle, evaluated using computed tomography, as a potential anatomical predictor associated with HF readmission post-TAVI. Patients with a small systolic LVIO angle may require close follow-up post-TAVI.
