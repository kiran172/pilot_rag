Title: One not to miss: Tuberculous tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: We describe a patient who developed severe tracheal stenosis while on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis. Bronchoscopic-guided balloon dilatation succeeded in managing this disorder. Diagnosis of tracheobronchial tuberculosis requires a high index of suspicion because symptoms are usually attributed to co-existing pulmonary disease and airway lesions are not detectable on chest x-ray. Interventional bronchoscopy is employed to restore airway patency once significant stenosis develops. Should bronchoscopic measures fail, surgical options can be considered.
