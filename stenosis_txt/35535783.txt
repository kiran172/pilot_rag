Title: Intraoperative Right Colic Graft Ischemia, Followed by Delayed Oesophagoplasty Including an Ileo-Transverse Anastomosis and the Cervical Revascularisation of the Ileum: Case Report.

Abstract: The ischemic complications during the isolation of the substituting oesophageal graft placement and after its placement may lead to graft necrosis and to the need to find a different reconstructive procedure. The most frequent reports of graft necroses occur in the days following the reconstruction. We are presenting the case of a 27-y.o. with full dysphagia as a result of caustic stenosis, in whose case the oesophageal reconstruction was abandoned following the irreversible ischemia of the right colic graft during the vascular isolation, followed by right-side hemicolectomy and ileo-transverse anastomosis. 4 years post the ingestion of a caustic substance and 2 years post the right colic graft ischemic necrosis, we performed an oesophageal reconstruction using a pediculated, cervically revascularized, ileo-colic graft on the left colic vessels. The graft's particularity is that is formed from left and transverse colon and ileum portions, including the ileo-transverse anastomosis performed 2 years prior to the oesophageal reconstruction.
