Title: Dialysis-associated steal syndromes.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to review contemporary concepts in the genesis of dialysis access steal syndrome (DASS) and its current management. An electronic search of literature from 1960 to 2020 in PubMed and the Cochrane library was conducted and practice guidelines were examined. Search terms included dialysis, steal, ischemia, access and ESRD. Clinical presentation, pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnostic techniques and management outcomes of extremity ischemia following dialysis access creation were reviewed. Symptomatic steal occurs in 4-10% of patietns after creation of hemodialysis access creation. Risk factos include brachial based fistula, diabetes, female sex, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, tobacco use, age more than 60 and hypertension. Diagnosis is mainly clinical and can be aided by non invasive testing. Correction o finflow stenosis, Distal revasulatisation with interval ligation, revision using distal inflow or other techniques are useful for fistula preservation. Dialysis-associated steal syndromes have a complex haemodynamic causation. Clinical presentation is diagnostic; however when the diagnosis is uncertain adjunctive non-invasive perfusion tests, duplex and other imaging amy be required. Management is guided by anatomic, patient and disease-related considerations.
