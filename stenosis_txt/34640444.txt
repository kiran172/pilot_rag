Title: Endoscopic Resection for Gastric Subepithelial Tumor with Backup Laparoscopic Surgery: Description of a Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to analyze patients who underwent endoscopic resection (ER) for gastric subepithelial tumors (SETs) with a high probability of surgical intervention. Between January 2013 and January 2021, 83 patients underwent ER at the operation theater and 27 patients (32.5%) required backup surgery mainly due to incidental perforation or uncontrolled bleeding despite endoscopic repairing. The tumor was predominantly located in the upper-third stomach (81%) with a size â‰¤ 2 cm (69.9%) and deep to the muscularis propria (MP) layer (92.8%) but there were no significant differences between two groups except tumor exophytic growth as a risk factor in the surgery group (37% vs. 0%, p &lt; 0.0001). Patients in the ER-only group had shorter durations of procedure times (60 min vs. 185 min, p &lt; 0.0001) and lengths of stay (5 days vs. 7 days, p &lt; 0.0001) but with a higher percentage of overall morbidity graded III (0% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.1571). After ER, five patients (6%) had delayed perforation and two (2.4%) required emergent laparoscopic surgery. Neither recurrence nor gastric stenosis was reported during long-term surveillance. Here, we provide a minimally invasive strategy of endoscopic resection with backup laparoscopic surgery for gastric SETs.
