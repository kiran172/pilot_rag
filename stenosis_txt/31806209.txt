Title: Relation of Frailty to Cost for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Frailty is associated with significant morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In addition to clinical outcomes, cost is an important factor to inform clinical decision-making around TAVI. However, the association of frailty with cost is unknown. This study tested whether frailty was associated with cost for adult patients who underwent TAVI at a moderate-volume single center between December 2012 and April 2018 (n = 431). Frailty was determined from pre-TAVI clinical visits as a composite of 2 markers: 5-meter walk time (abnormal: >6 seconds or unable to perform) and serum albumin (abnormal: <3.5 g/dl). Patients were excluded if missing frailty assessment or covariate data (24). Cost data were derived from financial statements, and assigned at the department-level by charge code. Multivariable regression models were adjusted for age, gender, and procedural co-morbidities. Of 407 patients in the analytical sample (mean age 81 years, 49% female), 74 (18%) were determined to be frail. Adjusted mean total costs were $6,397 higher for frail patients ($78,823 vs $72,425, p = 0.042) compared with nonfrail. Higher total costs were driven by department-level charges associated with longer in-hospital length of stay (7.6 vs 3.3 days, p <0.001): room, physical therapy, pharmacy, laboratory, supply, and imaging services. Providers must address frailty proactively to salvage the benefit associated with TAVI.
