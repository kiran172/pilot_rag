Title: Stented cryopreserved aortic allograft for reconstruction of long-segment post-tuberculosis tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: Tracheobronchial tuberculosis is one of the conditions causing long segment tracheal stenosis and is a clinically challenging scenario. This report describes a successful tracheal reconstruction in a 44-year-old man with long-segment post-tuberculosis tracheobronchial stenosis, utilizing a stented cryopreserved aortic allograft. The procedure was necessitated by the failure of conventional treatments. The stenotic segment was resected and replaced with a cryopreserved aortic allograft, supported by a metallic stent to maintain airway patency. Post-surgery, the patient experienced resolution of dyspnea without major complications. Currently, at 33 months post-operation, the patient enjoys an enhanced quality of life with effective breathing, speaking, swallowing abilities, and has resumed normal daily activities, with regular bronchoscopic follow-ups. This report demonstrates a novel approach for managing challenging tuberculosis-induced long segment airway stenosis.
