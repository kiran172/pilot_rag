Title: Hybrid procedures in the dialysis fistula aneurysm treatment.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Dialysis fistula aneurysms are common complications which in selective cases require surgical revision. It is recommended to detect and treat outflow stenosis concurrent with a dialysis fistula aneurysm, but usually, the treatment is divided into two stages - the open and endovascular stages are performed separately. We describe the results of hybrid procedures composed of aneurysm resection and endovascular correction for outflow veins performed for a dialysis fistula aneurysm treatment.
METHODS: From March 2012, we performed hybrid procedures in 28 patients to correct dialysis fistula aneurysms. Patients, dialysis access, operative data, and the results obtained during a median follow-up of 28.5 months were analyzed.
RESULTS: For dialysis fistula aneurysm correction, we performed 27 bypasses and 1 aneurysmorraphy. For outflow vein stenosis correction, we performed standard balloon angioplasty, no stents or stentgraft were used. The average increase in minimal diameter after angioplasty was 135.5% (range 57-275%). The 12- and 24-month primary patency rates of corrected fistulas in the observed group were 92.3% and 80%, respectively. A significant difference in the one-year patency rates between the urgent and planned procedures was observed (81.2% vs. 100%, respectively). No early complications related to endovascular or open procedures were observed. Late complications were observed in seven patients (25%) - mainly thrombosis caused by the recurrence of outflow vein stenosis (six patients, 21.5%), infection, lymphocele, and hematoma (one case of each complication).
CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid procedure for the surgical correction of dialysis fistula aneurysms with the simultaneous correction of outflow pathologies enables effective long-term treatment. The obtained data showed the efficiency and good results of this procedure. Procedures performed for urgent indications significantly increase the risk for later complications, especially fistula thrombosis and loss of dialysis access.
