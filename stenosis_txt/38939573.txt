Title: Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Canada: An Observational Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic disease characterized by very high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Untreated patients present with extensive xanthomas and premature atherosclerosis. Lipid-lowering therapy is highly efficacious and has dramatically increased life expectancy of patients with HoFH.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to obtain a comprehensive registry of HoFH in Canada, known to have several founder effect regions, and describe the clinical characteristics and cardiovascular outcomes of this population over time.
METHODS: Clinical and genetic data on patients with HoFH were collected via a standardized questionnaire sent to academic sites participating in the Familial Hypercholesterolemia Canada network.
RESULTS: A total of 48 patients with HoFH were enrolled. The median age at diagnosis was 12 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 5-24) and untreated LDL-C levels were 15.0 mmol/L (IQR: 10.5-18.6 mmol/L; 580 mg/dL IQR: 404-717 mg/dL). At last follow-up visit, median age was 40 years (IQR: 26-54 years). Treated LDL-C levels were 6.75 mmol/L (IQR: 4.73-9.51 mmol/L; 261 mg/dL IQR: 183-368 mg/dL) with 95.5% of patients on statins, 88.6% on ezetimibe, 34.1% on proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, 27.3% on lomitapide, 13.6% on evinacumab, and 56.8% were treated with low-density lipoprotein apheresis or plasmapheresis. Deaths were reported in 7 (14.5%) and major adverse cardiovascular events were observed in 14.6% of patients with the average onset at 30 years (IQR: 20-36 years). Aortic stenosis was reported in one-half the patients (47.9%) and 10 (20.8%) underwent aortic valve replacement.
CONCLUSIONS: This HoFH patient registry in Canada will provide important new health-related knowledge about the phenotypic manifestations and determinants of cardiovascular risk in this population, allowing for closer examination of quality of life and burden to the health care system.
