Title: Five-Year Outcomes of the Bioresorbable Peripheral Remedy Stent in the Treatment of Iliac Artery Disease.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the 5-year performance of a bioresorbable vascular scaffold, the Remedy stent, for the treatment of iliac artery atherosclerotic disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical study evaluated 97 patients (97 lesions) with symptomatic TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II A/B iliac artery lesions for 5 years after stent placement. The primary efficacy end point was 12-month primary patency compared with the prespecified standard derived from historical data with metallic stents, and the primary safety end point was the occurrence of major adverse clinical events within 5 years. All angiographic and computed tomography angiographic findings were evaluated by an independent core laboratory for quantitative vessel analysis.
RESULTS: The 12-month primary patency rate was 88.6% (95% CI, 80.1%-94.4%), which was lower than the prespecified standard. No significant difference was noted between the diameter stenosis at 9 and 12 months. There were no device- or procedure-related deaths, major amputation, or distal embolization during the follow-up period. The ankle-brachial index maintained significant improvement through the 5-year period compared with that at baseline. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), major adverse cardiovascular events, and major adverse cardiovascular and limb events were 95.8%, 91.7%, and 87.5% at 12 months and 85.4%, 72.1%, and 62.5% at 5 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year follow-up outcomes, including freedom from TLR, of the Remedy stent in iliac artery lesions were satisfactory, with a good safety profile. Nevertheless, the 12-month primary patency did not meet the expected standard compared with that of contemporary metallic stents.
