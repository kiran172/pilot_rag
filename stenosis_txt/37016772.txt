Title: Frontal sinus stenting in endoscopic sinus surgery: the 10-year Oxford experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Frontal sinus stents have been introduced to reduce frontal sinus re-stenosis after surgery and to improve outcomes.
METHOD: This study was a retrospective analysis of 19 patients who had endoscopic sinus surgery with approach to the frontal sinus and insertion of a soft sinus stent.
RESULTS: The frontal recess was patent in 78.9 per cent and stenosed in 21.1 per cent of patients; no completely closed recesses were observed. Mean follow up was 20.7 months, and time period of stenting was 9.8 months on average; complications were observed in 47.4 per cent of the patients, with post-operative sinonasal infection being the most common.
CONCLUSION: In the authors' experience, indications for frontal sinus stenting include recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis after multiple functional endoscopic sinus surgeries (especially in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps), patients with history of important craniofacial surgery or trauma, and recurrent mucoceles. The stent was overall well tolerated as only minor complications were observed. Close clinical follow up is mandatory.
