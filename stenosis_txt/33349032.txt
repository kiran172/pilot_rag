Title: Correction of Post-Cleft Lip Nostril Floor Stenosis: Para-Alar Flap Combined With Lip Revision.

Abstract: Post-cheiloplasty nostril floor stenosis is a scarcely reported secondary deformity. The aim of the current study was to assess the outcome of para-alar flap for management of nostril floor stenosis post-unilateral cleft lip repair. This is a retrospective case series study reviewing consecutive patients presenting with nostril floor stenosis following repair of unilateral cleft lip who were managed by the inferiorly based para-alar flap and lip revision. Differential nostril width was measured preoperative, immediate, and late postoperative. We reported 8 patients (3 boys and 5 girls) with an average age of 9.8 years (range: 4.5-19). Satisfactory results with good nostril symmetry measures were achieved, and no restenosis has been observed during the follow-up periods. The donor site scars were negligible. There was no reported partial or total flap loss. Para-alar flap was found to be an effective reconstructive option for patients with nostril floor stenosis post-unilateral cleft lip repair and can be combined safely with cleft lip revision.
