Title: Mid- and long-term outcomes after surgical correction of subaortic stenosis: a 27-year experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the mid- and long-term surgical outcomes of patients with subaortic stenosis (SAS).
METHODS: Patients operated for SAS from April 1990 to August 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with major associations such as aortic arch obstruction were excluded. Time to reintervention and predictors of recurrence were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank test and uni/multivariable Cox regression.
RESULTS: 120 patients at a median age of 4.7 years (interquartile range 2.9, 8.1) underwent primary operation (median peak preoperative left ventricular outflow tract gradient 52.5 mmHg, interquartile range 40, 70) involving fibrous tissue excision (n = 120) with septal myectomy (93%; n = 112) as the procedure of choice.At median follow-up of 13 years (interquartile range 7, 18), freedom from reintervention at 1, 3, 5 and 10 years was 99% (95% confidence interval 94%, 99%), 94% (87%, 97%), 93% (86%, 96%) and 90% (82%, 94%), respectively. Recurrence occurred in 18% (n = 20) with 15 patients undergoing reinterventions, 13 of whom required radical reoperation. Multivariable analysis revealed higher preoperative peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient (hazard risk 1.06, confidence interval 1.03, 1.09, P < 0.001), and presence of bicuspid aortic valve (hazard risk 14.13, confidence interval 3.32, 60.1, P < 0.001) as predictors for reintervention. Mild/moderate aortic regurgitation occurred in 49% (n = 55) of patients at the most recent follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Reintervention for recurrent SAS is common, predicted by higher preoperative peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient, and presence of bicuspid aortic valve, and frequently involves a radical procedure. Aortic regurgitation is a major consequence of SAS, but its severity usually remains low.
