Title: Pregnancy Complications Are Associated with Premature Coronary Artery Disease: Linking Three Cohorts.

Abstract: Background: There is increasing evidence that women who experience placenta-mediated pregnancy complications and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at higher risk for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) later in life. We hypothesized that there is an association between placenta-mediated pregnancy complications, GDM, and risk of premature CAD (PCAD). Methods: This research project involved a data linkage approach merging three databases of South Australian cohorts by using a retrospective, age-matched case-control study design. Cases (n = 721) were ascertained from the Coronary Angiogram Database of South Australia (CADOSA). Women &lt;60 years from CADOSA were linked to South Australian Perinatal Statistics Collection (SAPSC) to ascertain their prior pregnancy outcomes. Controls (n = 194) were selected from North West Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS) and comprised women who were healthy or had other health conditions unrelated to CAD, age-matched to CADOSA (±5 years), and linked to SAPSC to determine their pregnancy outcomes. PCAD was defined as &gt;50% stenosis in one or more coronary arteries at coronary angiography. Results: Compared with women without a history of PCAD, women who were diagnosed with PCAD were more likely to have experienced the placenta-mediated pregnancy complications of preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-5.00) or low-birth weight (adjusted OR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.22-4.88), or have been diagnosed with active asthma during pregnancy (adjusted OR = 3.52, 95% CI: 1.05-11.76). Conclusion: Placenta-mediated pregnancy complications should be recognized as clear risk markers for future PCAD.
