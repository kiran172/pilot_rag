Title: Short- and long-term outcomes associated with anal sacculectomy in dogs with massive apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate short- and long-term outcomes for dogs undergoing anal sacculectomy for massive (> 5 cm) apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma (AGASACA).
ANIMALS: 28 client-owned dogs with massive AGASACA.
PROCEDURES: A retrospective multi-institutional study was performed. Pre-, intra-, and post-operative data was collected, and variables were statistically analyzed for associations with progression-free interval (PFI) and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: At the time of anal sacculectomy, 19 (68%) dogs underwent concurrent iliosacral lymph node extirpation, including 17 of 18 (94%) dogs with suspected nodal metastasis preoperatively. Five (18%) dogs experienced grade 2 intraoperative complications. Ten (36%) dogs experienced postoperative complications, including 1 grade 3 and 1 grade 4 complication. No dogs had permanent fecal incontinence, tenesmus, or anal stenosis. Nineteen dogs received adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, or both. Local recurrence occurred in 37% of dogs. Dogs with lymph node metastasis at surgery were more likely than dogs without metastasis to develop new/progressive lymph node metastasis (10/17 [59%] vs 0/10 [0%]; P = .003) and distant metastasis (7/17 [41%] vs 0/10 [0%]; P = .026). Median PFI was 204 days (95% CI, 145 to 392). Median OS was 671 days (95% CI, 225 to upper limit not reached). Nodal metastasis at the time of surgery was associated with shorter PFI (P = .017) but not OS (P = .26). Adjuvant therapy was not associated with outcome.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dogs with massive AGASACA experienced prolonged survival following anal sacculectomy despite a high incidence of local recurrence and metastasis. Lymph node metastasis at the time of surgery was a negative prognostic indicator for PFI but not OS.
