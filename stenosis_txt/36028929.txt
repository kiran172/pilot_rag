Title: Necrotizing Tracheitis Complicated by Tracheal Wall Perforation.

Abstract: Necrotizing tracheitis is a rare condition, mainly seen in immunocompromised patients, that may lead to pseudomembrane formation, airway obstruction and in severe cases, tracheal perforation. We present a case of a 32-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes who presented with productive cough, dysphagia, and respiratory distress. Bronchoscopy revealed extensive tracheal necrosis along a 4-5Â cm segment of cartilaginous trachea and was complicated by tracheal perforation with false passage into the anterior mediastinum. Once the airway was re-established, a multidisciplinary team discussed options for definitive airway management, including tracheal reconstruction, pulmonary stent, or tracheostomy. Ultimately, a distal XLT tracheostomy was placed. Microbiology specimens of the tracheal tissue were positive for Actinomyces. The patient was started on long-term antibiotics and diabetes management. At three-month follow-up, the trachea was patent with near complete mucosalization of the previously necrotic segment. An area of proximal tracheal stenosis was successfully managed with a customized tracheal T-tube. In conclusion, this is a case of necrotizing tracheitis complicated by tracheal perforation. Successful treatment required a multidisciplinary team for airway management as well as medical treatment of immunocompromising risk factors and antimicrobial therapy. This enabled timely healing of the trachea and a durable airway.
