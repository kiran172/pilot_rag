Title: [Stent loss and successful retrieval with the loop snare technique].

Abstract: A 79-year-old woman was admitted to our coronary care unit for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Urgent left transradial coronary angiography showed mid-distal high-grade stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. During percutaneous coronary intervention, stent dislodgement from the balloon catheter occurred. Fortunately, the guidewire was left in place through the detached stent, but a loop snare failed to cross the proximal circumflex artery. A second wire was placed in parallel to the first one and the first wire was caught in the loop snare, which was pulled back and closed at the level of the stent. Then, we cautiously pulled the guiding catheter together with the stent as a whole unit out of the introducer.
