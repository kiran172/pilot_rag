Title: The cervical ligamentum flavum area: A new sensitive morphological parameter for identifying the cervical spinal stenosis.

Abstract: Thickening of the cervical ligamentum flavum (CLF) has been considered as a main cause of cervical spinal stenosis (CSS). A previous study reported that cervical ligamentum flavum thickness (CLFT) is correlated with CSS. However, the whole hypertrophy is different from focal thickness. Therefore, to analyze hypertrophy of the CLF, we created a new morphological parameter, called the cervical ligamentum flavum area (CLFA). We hypothesized that the CLFA is an important morphological parameter in the diagnosis of CSS. CLF samples were acquired from 83 patients with CSS, and from 84 controls who underwent cervical magnetic resonance imaging (C-MRI). T2-weighted axial C-MRI images were acquired. We measured the CLFA and CLFT at the C6-C7 intervertebral level on C-MRI using appropriate image analysis software. The CLFA was measured as the cross-sectional area of the entire CLF at the level of C6-C7 stenosis. The CLFT was measured by drawing a straight line along the ligament side towards the spinal canal at the C6-C7 level. Mean CLFA was 25.24 ± 6.43 mm2 in the control group and 45.34 ± 9.09 mm2 in the CSS group. The average CLFT was 1.48 ± 0.28 mm in the control group and 2.09 ± 0.35 mm in the CSS group. CSS patients had significantly higher CLFA (P < .01) and CLFT (P < .01). For the validity of both CLFA and CLFT as predictors of CSS, a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an optimal cutoff point for the CLFA was 31.66 mm2, a sensitivity of 92.8%, specificity of 88.4%, and an area under the curve of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99). The optimal cut off-point of the CLFT was 1.79 mm, with a sensitivity of 83.5%, specificity of 84.5%, and an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96). Both CLFT and CLFA were significantly related to CSS, but CLFA was the more sensitive measurement parameter. Therefore, to evaluate patients with CSS, treating physicians should test for CLFA.
