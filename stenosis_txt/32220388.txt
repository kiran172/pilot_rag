Title: Coronary Arteritis and Periaortitis in IgG4-Related Disease.

Abstract: We report an interesting case of coronary arteritis and periaortitis in a 62-year-old man with a history of biopsy-proven IgG4-related pulmonary disease. After 2 years of immune-suppressive therapy, the perivascular tissue surrounding all coronary arteries and the abdominal aorta was significantly attenuated, except that the luminal stenosis was aggravated to 70% in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Treatment with aspirin, atorvastatin, and ezetimibe was added. The patient was discharged under strict lesion surveillance at follow-up.
