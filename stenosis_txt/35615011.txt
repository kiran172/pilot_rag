Title: Full Endoscopic Surgery for Thoracic Pathology: Next Step after Mastering Lumbar and Cervical Endoscopic Spine Surgery?

Abstract: Thoracic disc herniation and stenosis are relatively rare, and various symptoms make them difficult to diagnose. Due to the complexity of neural and vascular structure, surgical treatment of thoracic pathology is challenging. Endoscopic spine surgery is an emerging minimally invasive surgical option. Based on wide experience on the cervical and lumbar spine, an endoscopic approach for the thoracic pathology can be performed beyond the learning curve. Transforaminal approach for thoracic disc herniation, endoscopic unilateral approach, and bilateral decompression for thoracic stenosis have been reported as favorable and safe surgical options. In the present study, the authors described the detailed surgical procedure as well as tips and tricks.
