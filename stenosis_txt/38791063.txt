Title: SMAD3 rs17228212 Polymorphism Is Associated with Advanced Carotid Atherosclerosis in a Slovenian Population.

Abstract: Smad proteins influence the TGFβ signaling pathway, which plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the rs17228212 polymorphism of the SMAD3 gene and advanced carotid atherosclerosis in Slovenian subjects and to investigate the effect of the rs17228212 SMAD3 polymorphism on the expression of SMAD3 in endarterectomy sequesters. In this cross-sectional case-control study, 881 unrelated Caucasians were divided into two groups. The first group included 308 patients with advanced carotid atherosclerosis of the common or internal carotid artery with stenosis greater than 75% that underwent a revascularization procedure (cases). The control group consisted of 573 subjects without hemodynamically significant carotid atherosclerosis. We analyzed the rs17228212 polymorphism of the SMAD3 gene using the StepOne real-time polymerase chain reaction system and TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The results in the two genetic models showed a statistically significant association, codominant (OR 4.05; CI 1.10-17.75; p = 0.037) and dominant (OR 3.60; CI 1.15-15.45; p = 0.045). An immunohistochemical analysis of SMAD3 expression was conducted for 26 endarterectomy specimens. The T allele of the rs17228212 SMAD3 gene was shown to be associated with an increased numerical area density of SMAD3-positive cells in carotid plaques.
