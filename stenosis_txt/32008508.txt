Title: Coronary Angiography for Follow-up of Heart Transplant Recipients: Usefulness of the Gensini Score.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Posttransplant cardiac allograft vasculo-pathy affects long-term survival after heart transplant. Because cardiac transplant recipients do not feel angina pectoris as a result of denervation of the transplanted heart graft, early diagnosis is difficult. The Gensini score, a widely used and simple scoring system, can determine the severity of coronary artery disease by angiography. Although this system has been widely used to evaluate natural coronary atherosclerosis, its use in heart transplant recipients has not been studied. Here, we evaluated cardiac allograft vasculo-pathy using the Gensini score.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 105 heart transplant patients seen between February 2004 and April 2018, including their immunosuppressive therapies. The Gensini score was calculated to determine severity score for each coronary stenosis according to degree of luminal narrowing and location.
RESULTS: Of 105 heart transplant patients, 21 were diagnosed with cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Most patients received tacrolimus, prednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil as standard therapy. Of 63 included patients, 21 (33.3%) showed cardiac allograft vasculopathy on coronary angiography. In accordance with the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation rating system, 42 of 63 patients (66.6%) were rated as 0 (no detectable angiographic lesions). Mean Gensini score was 34.8 ± 26. In the 21 patients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy, Gensini score showed mild cardiac allograft vas-culopathy (score ≤ 10) in 8 patients (38%), moderate (score > 10 and ≤ 40) in 6 patients (28.5%), and severe (score > 40) in 7 patients (33.3%). Angiographic coronary artery disease burden using Gensini was strongly correlated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy severity.
CONCLUSIONS: The Gensini score could provide valid assessment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy burden for use in clinical practice. However, more research is needed to identify and treat cardiac allograft vasculopathy for successful long-term survival of heart transplant patients.
