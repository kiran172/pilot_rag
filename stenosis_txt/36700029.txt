Title: Successful cervicothoracic esophageal stricture treatment with partial sternectomy and a pedicled TAAP flap: A case report.

Abstract: Postoperative benign esophageal anastomotic leakage and stenosis are common complications after esophagectomy. Treatment options for anastomosis stenosis include endoscopic mechanical dilation, dilation-combined steroid injection, incisional therapy, stent placement, and self-bougienage. However, long-segmental cervicothoracic esophageal stenosis and cutaneous fistula are always refractory to conservative treatments and are clinically challenging. When lesions extend well below the thoracic inlet, transthoracic esophagectomy and alimentary canal reconstruction seem to be the common choice but are susceptible to perioperative mortality and donor-site sequelae, especially for patients with poor health conditions. In this report, we present a novel surgical approach for cervicothoracic esophageal stenosis and fistula via partial sternectomy and reconstruction with a pedicled thoracoacromial artery perforator flap. No recurrence or complications occurred throughout 3 months of follow-up. This case study adds new perspectives to the treatment of anastomotic stenosis.
