Title: [Idiopathic Subglottic Tracheal Stenosis].

Abstract: Idiopathic subglottic stenosis is a circular scarred narrowing of the airway at the transition from the cricoid cartilage to the trachea. The stenosis is found radiologically and endoscopically at the level of the cricoid cartilage without involvement of the cricoid or tracheal cartilage itself. The disease practically only affects women between the ages of 20 and 60. The same clinical picture occurs in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and less frequently in other autoimmune diseases, where it requires systemic treatment. The clinical picture usually begins insidiously with coughing and sputum production and leads to dyspnoea and a restricted cough. As the course is insidious and the patients are otherwise healthy, the symptoms are often misinterpreted and the diagnosis is delayed. Treatment consists of local measures, ranging from dilatation and laser surgical resection, sometimes with local application of medication to inhibit the proliferation of new scar tissue, to laryngotracheal resection of varying degrees. The disease is located in the border area between the trachea and larynx and the patients are therefore treated by ENT medicine, pneumology and thoracic surgery.
