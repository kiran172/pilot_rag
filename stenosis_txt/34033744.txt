Title: Is It Feasible to Implant Sutureless Valves in Presence of Diseased Aortic Root and Aortic Aneurysm?

Abstract: Sutureless bioprosthetic valves are typically used in patients with a normal-sized aortic root and annulus because of concerns that the stent portion of the valve will not be properly anchored. This report describes an initial case series of sutureless valve implantation in the setting of a diseased aortic root and ascending aortic aneurysm, and it shows that the use of the Perceval valve (LivaNova PLC, London, UK) is feasible in these complex situations.
