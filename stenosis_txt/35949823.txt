Title: Nontraumatic convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nontraumatic convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) is a rare type of atypical subarachnoid hemorrhage. It mainly presents as a focal and transient neurological deficit with similar manifestations as transient ischemic attack.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 64-year-old man who visited the hospital with paroxysmal left-sided numbness and weakness is presented in this study. Computed tomography examination indicated a high-density image of the right frontal-parietal sulcus. Digital subtraction angiography showed severe stenosis at the right anterior cerebral artery A2-A3 junction (stenosis rate approximately 70%).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this case indicate that anterior cerebral artery stenosis may lead to the occurrence of cSAH.
