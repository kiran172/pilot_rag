Title: Correlation Between the Severity of Coronary Artery Disease and Retinal Artery Disease and the Therapeutic Effect of Captopril.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Investigate the Correlation Between the Severity of Coronary Artery Disease and Retinal Artery Disease, and assess the Efficacy of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) Application.
METHODS: One hundred patients diagnosed with primary hypertension at our hospital were chosen for the study. All patients underwent dual-source 64-layer spiral CT coronary angiography and fundus photography examination. Based on the extent of coronary artery stenosis, the patients were divided into Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D.
RESULTS: In comparison with patients in Group A, individuals in Groups B, C, and D exhibited a notable increase in the severity of retinal artery stenosis and arteriovenous crossing signs (P < .05). Furthermore, the severity of retinal artery stenosis and arteriovenous crossing signs demonstrated an incremental trend with the severity of coronary artery stenosis (P < .05). The arteriovenous crossing sign exhibited a sensitivity of 47.87%, the specificity of 89.21%, positive predictive value of 89.76%, and the negative predictive value of 46.53% for predicting coronary artery stenosis. After treatment, the blood pressure levels of the patients, both systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels significantly decreased compared to before treatment.
CONCLUSION: A significant positive correlation was observed between the severity of coronary artery lesions and retinal artery lesions. Assessing alterations in retinal blood vessels in hypertensive patients can effectively indicate the extent of coronary artery stenosis indirectly. Concerning medication, the antihypertensive drug captopril demonstrated the potential to alleviate the severity of coronary artery and retinal artery lesions in hypertensive patients. However, specific treatment methods should be tailored to individual patient circumstances.
