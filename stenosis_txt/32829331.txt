Title: Advances in Cardiac Computed Tomography Functional Imaging Technology.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among patients in China, and cardiac computed tomography (CT) is one of the most commonly used examination methods for CVD. Coronary artery CT angiography can be used for the morphologic evaluation of the coronary artery. At present, cardiac CT functional imaging has become an important direction of development of CT. At present, common CT functional imaging technologies include transluminal attenuation gradient, stress dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging, and CT-fractional flow reserve. These three imaging modes are introduced and analyzed in this review.
