Title: Pancreatic Torsion Resulting in Acute Pancreatic Necrosis in a Young Dog.

Abstract: We report a case of 7 mo old French bulldog who was referred to North Carolina State University Small Animal Emergency and Triage Services because of acute abdomen, regurgitation, lethargy, and fever. The patient had a history of pulmonic stenosis, which was corrected by balloon valvuloplasty 3 wk before presenting for the current complaint. The patient had nonspecific changes noted on blood work at his referring veterinarian. An abdominal ultrasound examination showed pathological changes that were supportive of a left-limb pancreatic torsion that was confirmed postmortem.
