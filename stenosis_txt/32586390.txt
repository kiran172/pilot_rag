Title: Association between ceramides and coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery stenosis induces heart diseases including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Some studies reported the ceramide species are associated with the ACS and major adverse cardia and cerebrovascular events (MACE). However, few studies investigated the association between plasma ceramide levels and the severity of stenosis, together with the onset of diseases. This aim of the present study was to investigate the association betweencertain ceramide species, coronary artery stenosis and acute coronary syndrome.
METHODS: Five hundred fifty-three patients with definite or suspected CAD were recruited and received angiography. Subjects were assigned into 4 groups according to the severity of coronary artery stenosis. The measurements of 4 plasma ceramide species, namely, Cer (d18:1/16:0), Cer (d18:1/18:0), Cer (d18:1/24:1), Cer (d18:1/24:0) were carried out by Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and the ratio of Cer (d18:1/16:0), Cer (d18:1/18:0) and Cer (d18:1/24:1) to Cer (18:1/24:0), respectively, were calculated as index to evaluate the association between plasma ceramides levels and coronary artery stenosis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to establish the prognostic model for the prediction of ACS risk.
RESULTS: After the adjustment by multiple clinical risk factors including age, gender, pre-existing myocardial/cerebral infarction, hemoglobin A1c% (HbA1c%), smoking and the diagnosis during index hospitalization, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the high ratio of Cer (d18:1/24:1) to Cer (d18:1/24:0), female gender, HbA1c%, unstable angina (UAP) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) diagnosis (compared with atherosclerosis) during index hospitalization were associated with more severe coronary artery stenosis. Furthermore, the prognostic model was established after adjustment of risk factors and the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for the prognostic model was 0.732 and 95% CI was 0.642-0.822.
CONCLUSION: The severity of coronary artery stenosis is associated with high ratio of Cer (d18:1/24:1) to Cer (d18:1/24:0), female gender, HbA1c% and AMI. Although the reported prognostic model showed a good discrimination, further investigation on long term MACE is needed to evaluate the role of ceramide for the prediction of MACE risk.
