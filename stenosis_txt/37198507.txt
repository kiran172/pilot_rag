Title: Endovascular Treatment for Spontaneous bilateral carotid artery dissection with acute ischemic stroke: A Case Report with automated postprocessing CT perfusion findings and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Carotid artery dissection (CAD) is a common cause of stroke, accounting for up to 25% of all ischemic strokes in young and middle-aged patients. CAD should be considered in young patients with unexplained head and neck pain, with or without focal neurological symptoms and signs. While the clinical features may raise suspicion for CAD, the diagnosis is confirmed by its typical neuroimaging findings. Meanwhile, simultaneous spontaneous dissection of the bilateral carotid artery has rarely been reported. We herein describe a clinically challenging case of a simultaneous bilateral CAD that was successfully treated with bilateral carotid artery stenting (CAS). The patient recovered satisfactorily after completing the whole course of treatment. Keywords: Acute stroke, Bilateral Spontaneous carotid artery dissection, Endovascular treatment.
