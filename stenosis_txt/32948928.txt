Title: TAVI imaging: over the echocardiography.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a common valvular heart disease. Recently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has changed the treatment of severe AS in elderly patients with contraindications to traditional surgical replacement. Echocardiography is conventionally used as the first imaging modality to assess the presence and severity of AS and to provide anatomical and functional information. Nowadays, imaging techniques play a crucial role in the planning of TAVI to define suitable candidates. Computed tomography (CT) is essential to display the anatomy of the aortic valve complex (including aortic annulus, Valsalva sinuses, coronary arteries ostia, sinotubular junction), thoracoabdominal aorta, and vascular access. Cardiac CT may also provide the evaluation of coronary arteries in alternative to conventional coronary angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging may be alternative or supplementary in selected cases, providing detailed information of cardiac function and myocardial wall characteristics. More recently, advanced computer modeling image-based techniques can be used to support the evaluation of the feasibility and safety of TAVI procedures.
