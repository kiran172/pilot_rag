Title: Airway Stents from Now to the Future: A Narrative Review.

Abstract: Airway stent insertion is important for patients with airway stenosis. Currently, the most widely used airway stents in clinical procedures are silicone and metallic stents, which offer patients effective treatment. However, these stents composed of permanent materials need to be removed, subjecting patients to invasive manipulation once more. As a result, there is a growing demand for biodegradable airway stents. Biodegradable materials for airway stents are now available in two types: biodegradable polymers and biodegradable alloys. Polymers that include poly (<sc>l</sc>-lactic acid), poly (D, <sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-glycolide), polycaprolactone, and polydioxanone are the ultimate metabolites which are generally carbon dioxide and water. Magnesium alloys are the most often utilized metal biodegradable materials for airway stents. The stent's mechanical properties and rate of degradation vary as a result of the different materials, cutting techniques, and structural configurations. We summarized the information above from recent studies on biodegradable airway stents conducted in both animals and humans. There is great potential for clinical applications for biodegradable airway stents. They avoid damage to the trachea during removal and reduce complications to some extent. However, several significant technical difficulties slow down the development of biodegradable airway stents. The efficacy and safety of different biodegradable airway stents still need to be investigated and proved.
