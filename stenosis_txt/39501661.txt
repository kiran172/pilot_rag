Title: Impact of Age in Single-Level Versus Multilevel Airway Compromise: A Multi-Institutional Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between age and treatment outcomes in conditions causing single- versus multilevel airway restriction.
STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary laryngology centers.
METHODS: Participants included younger (18-64 years) and geriatric (≥65 years) adults with posterior glottic stenosis (PGS), multilevel airway stenosis (MLAS), and bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP). Subgroup demographics, comorbidities, type, and etiology of airway compromise were described. Associations between age and primary outcome variables (i.e., tracheostomy and decannulation rates, number of surgeries performed, time between surgeries, and change in quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measures [PROMs]) were evaluated. Statistical analyses included independent t tests, χ2, Fisher's exact, or Mann-Whitney tests.
RESULTS: In 158 patients [96 younger (30 PGS, 29 MLAS, 37 BVFP) and 62 geriatric (24 PGS, 9 MLAS, 29 BVFP)], age differences were not significant for gender (P = .990), tracheostomy placement (70% vs 66%, P = .629), or decannulation success (40% vs 24%, P = .091) in younger versus geriatric groups, respectively. In younger patients, MLAS was more common (30.2% vs 14.5%, P = .024), and BVFP patients were more likely to decannulate (50% vs 12%, P = .017). Geriatric patients were more likely to have a history of prior radiation (26% vs 10%, P = .016), stenosis due to malignancy (23% vs 9%, P = .022), and fewer overall surgeries (median 1 vs 3, P = .003). Median PROMs were comparable between age subgroups (P > .05).
CONCLUSION: Younger adults underwent more surgeries, but overall comorbidities, tracheostomy decannulation rates, and PROMs were comparable between groups. Age does not negatively impact treatment outcomes and should not be a deterrent in treatment decision-making.
