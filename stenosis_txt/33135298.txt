Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement as a bridge to surgical aortic valve replacement in a younger patient with extremely high surgical risk.

Abstract: A 50-year-old man with decompensated aortic stenosis displayed significantly reduced ejection fraction, an ascending aortic aneurysm (55â€‰mm in diameter), and bilateral giant bullae, and was evaluated as having extremely high surgical risk. Therefore, as a bridge to definitive treatment, he simultaneously underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and upper left lung lobectomy. His heart function recovered 6 months later and he underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and graft replacement of the ascending aorta. TAVR may serve as a bridge procedure before SAVR for aortic stenosis in younger patients with high surgical risk.
