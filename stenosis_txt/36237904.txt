Title: A predictive patient-specific computational model of coronary artery bypass grafts for potential use by cardiac surgeons to guide selection of graft configurations.

Abstract: Cardiac surgeons face a significant degree of uncertainty when deciding upon coronary artery bypass graft configurations for patients with coronary artery disease. This leads to significant variation in preferred configuration between different surgeons for a particular patient. Additionally, for the majority of cases, there is no consensus regarding the optimal grafting strategy. This situation results in the tendency for individual surgeons to opt for a "one size fits all" approach and use the same grafting configuration for the majority of their patients neglecting the patient-specific nature of the diseased coronary circulation. Quantitative metrics to assess the adequacy of coronary bypass graft flows have recently been advocated for routine intraoperative use by cardiac surgeons. In this work, a novel patient-specific 1D-0D computational model called "COMCAB" is developed to provide the predictive haemodynamic parameters of functional graft performance that can aid surgeons to avoid configurations with grafts that have poor flow and thus poor patency. This model has significant potential for future expanded applications.
