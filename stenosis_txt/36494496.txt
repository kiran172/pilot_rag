Title: The impact of weight loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy on postoperative infectious complications and prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer: exploratory analysis of OGSG1003.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery is the standard treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancers. During neoadjuvant therapy, tumor-induced esophageal stenosis or adverse events often cause weight loss. However, little is known about the effects of weight loss during neoadjuvant therapy on postoperative complications or prognosis. We investigated the association between weight loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, postoperative infectious complications, and prognosis.
METHODS: Data from OGSG1003, a randomized phase-II trial comparing two regimens of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, cisplatin and fluorouracil plus Adriamycin and cisplatin and fluorouracil plus docetaxel, for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were used. Body weight was measured before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and esophagectomy. Multivariate analysis for infectious complications and prognosis was performed.
RESULTS: The study included 134 patients. The median weight loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 2.83% (-2.07% to 6.29%). Postoperative infectious complications were observed in 37 patients who had a significantly higher weight loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5.18% vs. 1.90%, P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that > 5% of weight loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy was the only independent factor associated with postoperative infectious complications (odds ratio 2.69, 95% confidence interval 1.12-6.46, P = 0.027). Weight loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with worse recurrence-free survival in the univariate analysis (log-rank test, P = 0.002), but this association was marginal in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 0.98-3.08, P = 0.058).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe weight loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy was an independent risk factor for postoperative infectious complications. Weight maintenance during neoadjuvant chemotherapy may reduce the incidence of postoperative infectious complications.
