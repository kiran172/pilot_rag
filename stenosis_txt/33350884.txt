Title: Expression of Interleukin 6 signaling receptors in carotid atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Interleukin (IL) 6 contributes to atherosclerotic plaque development through IL6 membrane-bound (IL6R and gp130) and soluble (sIL6R and sgp130) receptors. We investigated IL6 receptor expression in carotid plaques and its correlation with circulating IL6 and soluble receptor levels. Plasma samples and carotid plaques were obtained from 78 patients in the Biobank of Karolinska Endarterectomies study. IL6, sIL6R, and sgp130 were measured in plasma and IL6, IL6R, sIL6R, GP130, and sGP130-RAPS (sGP130) gene expression assessed in carotid plaques. Correlations between plaque IL6 signaling gene expression and plasma levels were determined by Spearman's correlation. Differences in plasma and gene expression levels between patients with (n = 53) and without (n = 25) a history of a cerebral event and statin-treated (n = 65) and non-treated (n = 11), were estimated by Kruskal-Wallis. IL6 and its receptors were all expressed in carotid plaques. There was a positive, borderline significant, moderate correlation between plasma IL6 and sIL6R and the respective gene expression levels (rho 0.23 and 0.22, both p = 0.05). IL6R expression was higher in patients with a history of a cerebrovascular event compared to those without (p = 0.007). Statin-treated had higher IL6R, sIL6R, and sGP130 expression levels and plasma sIL6R compared to non-treated patients (all p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, all components of the IL6 signaling pathways are expressed in carotid artery plaques and IL6 and sIL6R plasma levels correlate moderately with IL6 and sIL6R. Our data suggest that IL6 signaling in the circulation might mirror the system activity in the plaque, thus adding novel perspectives to the role of IL6 signaling in atherosclerosis.
