Title: The impact of water exchange on estimates of myocardial extracellular volume calculated using contrast enhanced T<sub>1</sub> measurements: A preliminary analysis in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend measuring myocardial extracellular volume (ECV) using T<sub>1</sub> -mapping before and 10-30 min after contrast agent administration. Data are then analyzed using a linear model (LM), which assumes fast water exchange (WX) between the ECV and cardiomyocytes. We investigated whether limited WX influences ECV measurements in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: Twenty-five patients with severe AS and 5 healthy controls were recruited. T<sub>1</sub> measurements were made on a 3 T Siemens system using a multiparametric saturation-recovery single-shot acquisition (a) before contrast; (b) 4 min post 0.05 mmol/kg gadobutrol; and (c) 4 min, (d) 10 min, and (e) 30 min after an additional gadobutrol dose (0.1 mmol/kg). Three LM-based ECV estimates, made using paired T<sub>1</sub> measurements (a and b), (a and d), and (a and e), were compared to ECV estimates made using all 5 T<sub>1</sub> measurements and a two-site exchange model (2SXM) accounting for WX.
RESULTS: Median (range) ECV estimated using the 2SXM model was 25% (21%-39%) for patients and 26% (22%-29%) for controls. ECV estimated in patients using the LM at 10 min following a cumulative contrast dose of 0.15 mmol/kg was 21% (17%-32%) and increased significantly to 22% (19%-35%) at 30 min (p = 0.0001). ECV estimated using the LM was highest following low dose gadobutrol, 25% (19%-38%).
CONCLUSION: Current guidelines on contrast agent dose for ECV measurements may lead to underestimated ECV in patients with severe AS because of limited WX. Use of a lower contrast agent dose may mitigate this effect.
