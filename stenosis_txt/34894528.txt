Title: The safety and efficacy of the Neuroform EZ stent for the treatment of symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis in the middle cerebral artery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Neuroform EZ stent placement for patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 70 patients (36 males and 34 females; mean age: 62.5 ± 1.25 years) with symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the MCA who underwent Neuroform EZ stent insertion between January 2018 and June 2020. We reviewed the clinical data of each patient so that we could evaluate outcomes and angiographic findings at follow-up.
RESULTS: The technical success rate for the 70 patients was 100%. The mean rate of stenosis improved from 82.6 ± 6.5% (pre-stenting) to 21.11 ± 2.6% (post-stenting). During the post-stenting follow-up period, the 1-year frequencies of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and death, were all 0%. 42 patients were reviewed in hospital by DSA or CTA. Of the patients undergoing DSA or CTA review, four patients were found to have in-stent restenosis.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates that the Neuroform EZ stent represents a valuable endovascular treatment option for patients with severe stenosis of the MCA. Additional studies are now needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes arising from the use of this technique.
