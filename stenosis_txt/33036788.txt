Title: Association of Inflammatory Markers with Multisite Artery Disease in Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Chronic inflammation plays a considerable role in atherosclerosis and may occur simultaneously in different arteries. This condition is referred to as multisite arterial disease (MSAD). We aimed to investigate the association between inflammatory markers and MSAD.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we included 526 patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Patients with PAD were evaluated by conventional or computed tomography angiography for the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and those with at least 30% stenosis were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: either MSAD+(PAD and CAD), Group 1) or MSAD- (only PAD without CAD, Group 2). Inflammatory markers were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Among all patients, 293 had MSAD while 233 had only PAD. The MSAD+group had higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-neutrophil ratio (PLR) (5.08±0.19, 4.67±0.51, and 207.1±6.23, 169.3±10.8, respectively, p<0.001). In multivariate analysis, HT [odds ratio (OR): 2.40 (1.61-3.59)); p<0.002], male gender [OR: 2.03 (1.29-3.17); p=0.002], DM [OR:1.56 (1.03-2.36); P=0.035], NLR [OR: 1,08 (1.02-1.16); p=0.021, and PLR [OR:1.05 (1.03-1.08); p<0.001] were found to be associated with MSAD.
CONCLUSION: NLR and PLR are correlated with MSAD and may indicate the extent of atherosclerosis.
