Title: Endofibrosis as a Causative Agent of the Peripheral Artery Disease: A Report of Two Cases for Professional Cyclists.

Abstract: Endofibrosis is a rare disease that predominantly affects athletes and is caused by a gradual occlusion of the (usually iliac) artery due to a thickening of the intima. From our experience, we report in this article two cases with the entity of endofibrosis in females around 30 years old. The first case presented with acute limb ischemia, and the second one was with pain in the leg during exercise. In addition, both cases are professional cyclists. They were eventually diagnosed with endofibrosis and underwent surgical procedures. They are now pursuing their professional career successfully. Last but not least, endofibrosis might be classified as an occupational disease, particularly, in the case of professional athletes or cyclists.
