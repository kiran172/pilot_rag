Title: Imaging Findings of Esophageal Sarcomatoid Carcinoma: Case Report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the imaging findings and pathological features, differential diagnosis of esophageal sarcomatoid carcinoma.
METHODS: Three cases of esophageal sarcomatoid carcinoma (ESC) proved by histology was retrospectively analyzed, and related literature were reviewed.
RESULTS: Two cases of barium in the digestive tract showed an irregular filling defect in the thoracic esophagus. The edges are clear, the surface of the tumor is irregular, and the niche is visible. The long axis of the tumor is the same as the esophagus, esophageal expansion, and the mucosa of the lesion area is destroyed. CT scan of 1 case showed a ellipse-like pedicle solid mass in the lower esophagus, the pedicle, and back wall is linked together, the back wall is slight thick, and esophageal eccentric stenosis, homogeneous density, lesions showed moderate enhancement, and the peripheral enhancement was relatively obvious in the central region, and the pedicle was not clear with the right posterior wall of esophagus. Intraoperative observation showed that the tumor was solid, rubbery, and the pedicle was closely related to the right posterior wall of esophagus. All 3 cases were pathologically diagnosed as esophageal sarcomatoid carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: ESC is uncommon, the imaging features have some characteristics, accurate diagnosis depends on the pathological examination.
