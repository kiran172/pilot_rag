Title: The physical and psychological sexual well-being of women with pelvic malignancy: how can we understand and improve our practice?

Abstract: How can we better understand and improve our practice around the physical and psychological well-being of women treated with radiation therapy for pelvic malignancy? In this issue, Summerfield et al report the results of a nationwide survey capturing practices around the management of radiation therapy-induced vaginal adhesions and stenosis (RTVAS) across New Zealand. This study highlights the need for oncologists to improve care around a challenging but critically important aspect of women's health beyond a cancer diagnosis.
