Title: Retrospective evaluation of early thrombosis in transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic polytetrafluoroethylene-coated shunts under 2-day postinterventional heparinization.

Abstract: The development of acute thrombosis within the TIPS tract may be prevented by prophylactic anticoagulation; however, there is no evidence of the correct anticoagulation regimen after TIPS placement. The purpose of this single-center retrospective study was to evaluate the short-term occlusion rate of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPSs) with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE)-coated stents under consequent periprocedural full heparinization (target partial thromboplastin time [PTT]: 60-80 s). We analyzed TIPS placements that were followed up over a six-month period by Doppler ultrasound in 94 patients and compared the study group of 54 patients who received intravenous periprocedural full heparinization (target PTT: 60-80 s) without any other anticoagulation to patients with prolonged anticoagulation medication. The primary endpoint was TIPS patency after six months. The primary patency rate was 88.3% overall, and in the study group, 90.7%, with an early thrombosis rate of 3.2% (study group: 1.9%) and a primary assisted patency rate of 95.7% (study group: 96.3%). In the study group, one case of TIPS thrombosis occurred on the 23rd day after TIPS placement. Two patients underwent reintervention because of stenosis or buckling. Moreover, the target PTT was not attained in 8 of the 54 patent TIPSs. Four patients had an increased portosystemic pressure gradient, without stenosis, and the flow rate was corrected by increasing the TIPS diameter by dilation. Two-day heparinization seems sufficient to avoid early TIPS thrombosis over a six-month period.
