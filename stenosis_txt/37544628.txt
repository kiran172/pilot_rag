Title: Acute Coronary Syndrome Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Extending the indication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to younger and lower-risk patients naturally results in longer life expectancy and survival rates after the intervention. The longer life expectancy of these patients leads to an increased possibility of future acute coronary events, necessitating the development of effective and appropriate treatment strategies. Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients with previous TAVR procedures present with modified clinical characteristics when compared to the non-TAVR population. In populations with prior TAVR procedures, plaque rupture remains the main cause of ACS. However, unlike the non-TAVR population, there is an increased frequency of nonatherotrombotic mechanisms, like emboli and mechanical obstruction of coronary ostia by valve components. The main observation related to the treatment of ACS TAVR patients is the significantly lower percentage of patients undergoing invasive management. Furthermore, ACS in TAVR patients is associated with poor prognosis, higher long-term mortality rates, and higher incidence of MACE. It is surprising that considering this significant and increasingly recognized issue, there are only a few studies that have investigated ACS after TAVR. The scope of the present review is to address available data about ACS following TAVR, focusing on incidence, timing, mechanism, and causes. We also examined current knowledge regarding optimal invasive treatment and analyzed short and long-term clinical outcomes.
