Title: Application of high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall image in the treatment of M1 segment stenosis of middle cerebral artery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application of high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall image (HRMR-VWI) in treating middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 segment stenosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed preoperative clinical data, imaging data, preoperative evaluation, stent procedure, and postoperative complications in 35 patients with atherosclerotic stenosis of the MCA M1 segment. And the 30-day postoperative mortality and disability and the 12-month restenosis were followed up.
RESULTS: There were 21 males and 14 females, with a median age of 55 and a median duration of 1 month from onset to stenting. DSA confirmed that the stenosis locates in the M1 segment, with a stenosis degree of (75.00 ± 17.15) %, a stenosis length of (4.34 ± 1.51) mm, and a blood vessel diameter of (2.25 ± 0.42) mm. After the operation, there was 1 case of death after a craniotomy to remove hematoma + decompression due to reperfusion hemorrhage. There were two technical complications during the procedure (1 case of asymptomatic occlusion of the A1 segment due to the covering of stent at the initial part of A1, 1 case of intraparenchymal hematoma in the temporal lobe due to penetrating distal small blood vessel with guide wire).
CONCLUSION: HRMR-VWI is of great value in observing plaques' location, morphology, and stability. It can improve the safety and effectiveness of stenting treatment of MCA M1 segment stenosis.
