Title: Treatment results of carotid artery stenting in a developing country.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the details of minor complications of carotid artery stenting in a developing country.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study conducted on the target group consisting of 65 symptomatic patients who underwent carotid artery stenting. We assessed technical success rate, periprocedural complication within 30 days (hypotension, bradycardia, acute kidney injury, vasospasm, a transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death), and the differences between groups with and without complications.
RESULTS: Minor periprocedural complications occurred in 15 patients. In all, 8 (12.3%) had transient hypotension, 6 (9.2%) had bradycardia, 7 (10.7%) had acute kidney injury, 2 (3.1%) had vasospasm, and 1 (1.5%) had transient ischemic attack. A greater rate of minor complications was observed in women (p=0.051).
CONCLUSION: The results of the carotid artery stenting procedures performed in a developing country were acceptable.
