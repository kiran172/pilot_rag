Title: Idiopathic fibrous mediastinitis with refractory pleural effusion: a case report and literature review.

Abstract: Fibrous mediastinitis is a rare progressive disease characterized by invasive proliferation of fibrous tissue in the mediastinum. This tissue proliferation leads to compression of the mediastinal structures in the thoracic cavity, including the pulmonary vessels, esophagus, and trachea, causing corresponding symptoms and complications such as pulmonary hypertension. In clinical practice, the diagnosis of fibrous mediastinitis is often delayed or missed because of the rarity and variable clinical manifestations of this condition. This article presents a case of idiopathic fibrous mediastinitis that manifested as pleural effusion of unknown etiology along with a review of the relevant literature.
