Title: Impact of the De Ritis Ratio on the Prognosis of Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to emphasize the impact of the aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio (De Ritis ratio) on the prognosis of patients with stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with SCAD who underwent elective PCI at Shinonoi General Hospital were included. SCAD was defined as epicardial coronary artery diameter stenosis ≥90% or epicardial coronary artery diameter stenosis ≥75% accompanied by symptoms or stress-induced myocardial ischemia. Clinical data were collected, and cardiovascular events were followed after discharge. One-way Cox proportional risk analysis was performed to assess the risk stratification value of the De Ritis ratio, using major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and all-cause mortality as the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. The independent risk stratification value was evaluated by multivariate Cox proportional risk analysis. RESULTS Among 204 patients with SCAD undergoing PCI, during a median follow-up period of 706 days (24 months), 13.7% (28/204) patients experienced MACCE, and 8.8% (18/204) experienced all-cause mortality. Multifactorial Cox regression analysis revealed that a high De Ritis ratio was an independent risk factor for MACCE (HR=2.96, 95% CI: 1.29-6.78, P=0.01) and all-cause mortality (HR=3.61, 95% Cl: 1.31-9.86, P=0.012). The sensitivity analysis further confirmed the incremental value of the De Ritis ratio for adverse cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS A high De Ritis ratio was an independent and valuable risk stratification factor for MACCE and all-cause mortality in patients with SCAD after PCI.
