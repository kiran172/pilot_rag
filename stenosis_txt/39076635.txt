Title: Biological Surgical Options in Young Patients for the Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis: Is the Jury Still Out? A Review.

Abstract: Aortic interventions remain the most effective treatment for severe aortic stenosis. In the recent years, advances in bioprosthetics and newer data have reduced the cut-off age for the use of bioprosthetic valves in younger patients, but the debate on whether to favor mechanical valves in younger patients remains a constant, especially with the undesired effects and considerations of anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists in this age group. Other options like the Ross procedure are gaining traction, despite still being undervalued and necessitating expertise centers. Hemodynamic considerations and durability of these options are important to consider, especially in this age group. Regardless of the choice of the prosthesis, patient informed consent is paramount since the decision affects the lifetime management of their initial condition, and expectations given must remain realistic.
