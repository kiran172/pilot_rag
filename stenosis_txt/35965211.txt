Title: A Comparison of Thirty-Day Clinical and Echocardiographic Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter vs. Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement for Native Aortic Insufficiency.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aim to compare in-hospital and 30-day outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) versus surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for native aortic insufficiency (AI).
BACKGROUND: TAVR is increasingly used off-label in patients with AI deemed high risk for SAVR. There is a paucity of data comparing TAVR and SAVR with current commercially available TAVR devices.
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing TAVR or SAVR for native AI between 2014 and 2020 was performed. Data were obtained from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database, Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) registry, and chart review. In-hospital and 30-day outcomes are reported.
RESULTS: Of 125 total patients, 91 underwent SAVR and 34 underwent TAVR. The TAVR group had a higher STS predictive risk of mortality (PROM) (TAVR = 3.96 %, SAVR = 1.25 %, p < 0.0001). In the postoperative period, the SAVR group had higher rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation (20.9 % vs. 0 %, p < 0.001), while the TAVR group had higher rates of complete heart block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation (20.6 % vs. 2.2 %, p < 0.001). There was no difference in in-hospital or 30-day mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, residual AI, or repeat valve intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher STS PROM and more comorbidities, patients who underwent TAVR for AI had similar in-hospital and 30-day outcomes as patients who underwent SAVR for AI. These results support TAVR in selected high-risk patients with AI, with the knowledge that pacemaker needs may be higher than patients undergoing SAVR.
