Title: Is Asia truly a hotspot of contemporary minimally invasive and endoscopic spinal surgery?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the training in relation to practice patterns of surgeons in Asia who perform lumbar endoscopic spinal surgery in comparison to surgeons the world over. The authors solicited responses to an online survey sent to spine surgeons.
METHODS: Pearson Chi-Square measures, Kappa statistics, and linear regression analysis of agreement or disagreement were performed by analyzing the distribution of variances of responses in relation to surgeons' training using statistical package SPSS Version 25.0.
RESULTS: A total of 430 surgeons accessed the survey. The completion rate was 67.4%. Analyzing the responses of 292 surveys submitted by 97 neurosurgeons (33.2%), 161 orthopaedic surgeons (55.1%), and 34 surgeons of other postgraduate training (11.6%) showed that only 14.0% (41/292) of surgeons had completed a fellowship. Ninety-one of the 292 respondents were from Asian countries/regions. A statistically significantly higher percentage of Asian surgeons (96.7%) compared to non-Asian surgeons (81.6%) indicated that they perform modern minimally invasive (MIS) and endoscopic spinal (ES) surgery (P=0.001). Spinal endoscopy was employed by 70.3% of Asian versus 55.2% of non-Asian surgeons (P=0.015). Endoscopic decompression techniques requiring advanced training was employed nearly twice as high by the Asian surgeons than by non-Asian.
CONCLUSIONS: Training requirements for MIS and ES surgery and implementation of privileges vary in different parts of the world. While industry-sponsored weekend cadaver workshops have remained the mainstay of training aspiring endoscopic spinal surgeons in North America and Europe leaving many of them to become autodidacts.
