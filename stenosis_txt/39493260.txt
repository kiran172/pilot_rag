Title: Effectiveness comparison between ustekinumab and infliximab for Crohn's disease complicated with intestinal stenosis: a multicenter real-world study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The efficacy of ustekinumab (UST) and infliximab (IFX) in Crohn's disease (CD) patients with intestinal stenosis remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the efficacy of UST and IFX in the treatment of CD patients with intestinal stenosis.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective and multicenter cohort study.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included CD patients treated with IFX or UST at five centers. We assessed the clinical response rate at weeks 12 and 24, steroid-free clinical remission rate at weeks 24 and 52 for overall patients and those with stenosis, and objective examination (intestinal ultrasound and/or endoscopy) response rate at week 52 for stenosis patients.
RESULTS: A total of 211 CD patients (106 IFX and 105 UST) were included, with 119 (56 IFX and 63 UST) having intestinal stenosis. In the overall patient population, there were no significant differences in clinical response rate and steroid-free clinical remission rate at weeks 12, 24, and 52 between the IFX and UST groups. In patients with stenosis, the steroid-free clinical remission rate at week 52 was significantly lower in the IFX group compared to the UST group (51.79% IFX vs 69.84% UST, p = 0.044). The objective examination response rate did not significantly differ between the IFX and UST groups at week 52 (66.67% IFX vs 76.19% UST, p = 0.690). In the UST group, steroid-free clinical remission rate was higher in bio-naïve patients than bio-experienced patients at week 24 (75.00% bio-naïve vs 55.38% bio-experienced, p = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: UST may be considered a more advantageous treatment option for those CD patients with intestinal stenosis, as it has better steroid-free clinical remission rates compared to IFX.
