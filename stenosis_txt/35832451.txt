Title: Intraoperative methods for wrapping anastomoses after airway reconstruction: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anastomosis management is the main challenge of airway resection and reconstruction, and postoperative anastomotic complications, including ischemia, stenosis, dehiscence, and separation may lead to severe outcomes and a poor prognosis. The anastomotic buttress is vital in airway reconstruction, but the selection of surgical buttress and reinforcement remains controversial. We aimed to demonstrate and evaluate the buttress options of anastomosis, including their preoperative characteristics, the intraoperative process, and the incidence of postoperative complications to help address the controversy regarding anastomosis management.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at a single institution. Patients who underwent airway reconstruction with anastomotic wrapping from Jan. 2019 to Sep. 2021 were enrolled in this study and preoperative characteristics and operational features were collected. All patients were carefully followed up by telephone and outpatient. Their postoperative complications and postoperative status after 6 months were recorded. The surgical procedures and clinical characteristics of the buttress options of anastomosis were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients undergoing either cervical tracheal, thoracic tracheal, carinal, or secondary carinal and main bronchus resection and reconstruction were evaluated. The anastomotic buttress used included mediastinal pleural flap (24/62, 38.7%), anterior cervical muscle (14/62, 22.6%), sternocleidomastoid (2/62, 3.2%), thymus flap (12/62, 19.4%), intercostal muscle flap (2/62, 3.2%), biological patch (2/62, 3.2%), prepericardial fat (1/62, 1.6%), thyroid gland (1/62, 1.6%), pectoralis major flap (2/62, 3.2%), and omental flap (2/62, 3.2%). All procedures produced satisfactory results without short-term anastomotic complications. A follow-up for 6 months was conducted and all patients were alive postoperatively. Tracheomalacia stenosis postoperatively occurred in 3 patients and they were subsequently treated with an endotracheal stent. One patient had tumor recurrence 3 months after surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Various anastomotic wrapping materials are used in airway reconstruction. Different utilizations of buttress are selected according to the anatomic characteristics and the reconstruction method used. This study indicated that appropriate surgical buttresses for wrapping anastomoses are legitimate alternatives to reduce the risk of anastomotic complications.
