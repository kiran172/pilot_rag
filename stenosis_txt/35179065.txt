Title: Outcomes of Stented vs Nonstented Femoropopliteal Lesions Treated With Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty has been increasingly used for the treatment of lower limb peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, bail-out stenting may be necessary in cases of suboptimal angioplasty. This study investigated the outcomes of femoropopliteal disease treated with DCB with/without bail-out stenting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study enrolling 166 consecutive patients (DCB+stent: n=81 vs DCB: n=85) with 253 femoropopliteal lesions (DCB+stent: n=99 vs DCB: n=154) treated with DCB with/without stenting. Bail-out stenting was performed at the operator discretion for postangioplasty dissections or otherwise suboptimal angiographic result (>30% residual stenosis). Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the outcomes of DCB with/without stenting during 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The baseline clinical characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. About half of the patients presented with critical limb ischemia, with most of the lesions located at the superficial femoral artery. The overall mean lesion length was 147±67 mm. The most frequent bail-out stent types were bare metal stents (BMS) (53.5%) followed by drug-eluting stents (DES) (41.4%). Lesions requiring bail-out stenting were on average longer (177±67 mm vs 127±59 mm; p<0.01) and on average had higher prevalence of flow-limiting postangioplasty dissections. The overall procedural success rate was 94% without any differences between the 2 groups. Both the stented and nonstented treatment modalities were effective and safe, demonstrating similar rates of 2-year freedom from major adverse limb event (stented: 71.3% vs nonstented: 64.4%) and 2-year freedom from target lesion revascularization (stented: 77.1% vs nonstented: 72.3%) during following up. The use of DES as bail-out therapy was associated with a lower risk of 2-year death compared with the use of BMS (DES: 97.2% vs BMS: 75.8%; p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: Drug-coated balloon with bail-out stenting is a viable treatment option for cases of suboptimal DCB results, promising similar efficacy with DCB-alone procedures. However, as the patency of stents at the femoropopliteal segment may be a challenge due to the biomechanical stress of the artery, the efficacy of DCB+bail-out stenting should be further evaluated. In addition, future studies are needed to determine which grades of post-DCB dissections should be treated and optimize current bail-out strategies.
