Title: Ozaki Procedure Plus Aortic Annular Enlargement in an Extremely Narrow Aortic Annulus: A Surgical Challenge.

Abstract: We report a 19-year-old woman with a history of percutaneous aortic valve (AV) balloon valvuloplasty 3 years ago. She was admitted with severe symptomatic AV stenosis with narrow aortic annulus. We decided to perform AV reconstruction with autologous pericardium. However, surgical findings revealed a very narrow AV annulus with a unicuspid valve; therefore, an AV enlargement was added.
