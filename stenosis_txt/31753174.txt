Title: Assessment of Cardiac Damage in Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) causes chronic pressure overload of the left ventricle (LV), resulting in the progressive cardiac damage, which extends beyond the LV. Several previous studies have shown a relationship of the cardiac damage to AS, rather than the stenosis severity, with adverse events after aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with severe AS. A new staging system for AS patients has important prognostic implications for clinical outcomes after AVR. This review summarizes the importance of assessment of cardiac damage in patients with AS.
