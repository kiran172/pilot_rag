Title: Median Sternotomy for Innominate Artery Compression Syndrome and Distal Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: We present a case of a premature infant who had an initial diagnosis of an innominate artery compression syndrome. This was approached by a median sternotomy for an aortopexy. However, the patient was found to have a distal tracheal stenosis due to a tracheal cartilage deficiency and was treated by a tracheal resection and primary anastamosis.
