Title: Symptomatic thoracic ossified ligamentum flavum in achondroplasia: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In a patient with achondroplasia, it is rare to encounter thoracic cord compression due to both spinal stenosis and ossification of the yellow ligament (OYL).
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old achondroplastic female presented with a progressive spastic paraparesis attributed to thoracic stenosis combined with T10-T11 OYL. Following a laminectomy, the patient demonstrated a marked recovery of neurological function.
CONCLUSION: This case and 12 others from the literature demonstrated that achondroplastic patients who present with myelopathy secondary to thoracic stenosis and OYL can be readily diagnosed with MR/CT and successfully treated utilizing decompressive laminectomies with/without fusions (i.e., for those crossing the thoracolumbar junction).
