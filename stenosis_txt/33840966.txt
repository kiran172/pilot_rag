Title: Percutaneous Transhepatic Vein Permcath: A Case Report.

Abstract: In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), functional vascular access is like a lifeline. Among the patients undergoing hemodialysis, arteriovenous fistulas are done in most of them. However, in approximately 15% of these patients with multiple access failures, the use of tunneled dialysis catheters (TDC) for hemodialysis has become an integral component of treatment plans. Unfortunately, in many cases of multiple access failure, it is difficult to get proper access especially if problems with peritoneal dialysis also exist. The problems related to tunneled dialysis catheters are infections, thrombosis, hemorrhage, migration, dislodgement, leakage, kinking, and chronic venous stenosis. The progressive loss of venous access sites requires a systematic approach to alternative sites as it is important for patient survival. Herein, we present a case of ESRD with multiple access failures who was effectively managed with the placement of a percutaneous transhepatic vein permcath. Till date, there is very little data onsuch interventions from India.
