Title: Contemporary results of transcatheter mitral valve procedures: bi-centric retrospective analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve (TMVIV) or valve-in-ring (TMVIR) replacement offer an alternative therapy for high risk patients. We aimed to highlight the operative and postoperative results of TMVIV and TMVIR procedures.
RESULTS: We included all patients underwent TMVIV and TMVIR procedures between 2017 and 2020 at two heart centers in Germany. We included a total of 36 high risk patients in our study where 12 received TMVIV and 24 received TMVIR. All patients underwent TMVIV or TMVIR with Edwards Sapien XT or S3 transcatheter valves (Edwards Lifesciences). The mean age was 79 (75-83 years old). The median (IQR) preoperative STS score was 9 (7-13)% and EuroSCORE II was 14.5% (12-16). The majority of our patients were operated via transapical approach (n = 26) and the minority via transseptal approach (n = 10). Out of our records, none of our patients required reopening for bleeding or any other surgical complications. None of our patients required reintervention during the 6 months follow-up period. One mortality was recorded on fifth postoperative day due to low cardiac output syndrome (obviously because of LVOT obstruction by the anterior mitral leaflet). The average blood loss was 200 ml in the first 24 h in patients underwent transapical approach. Average operative time was 93 min and all patients were immediately extubated after the procedure in the operating room (even the patient with echocardiographically documented LVOT obstruction who died on the fifth postoperative day). Length of Intensive Care Unit stay was 2 ± 1.2 days and length of hospital stay was 4.1 ± 1.2 days. In the follow up period, echocardiograms showed normal prosthetic valve function with low transvalvular gradients, no LVOT obstruction in TMVIR cases and no evidence of valve migration or thrombosis (except in one patient). Concerning 6 months readmission, it was recorded in 2 patients due to right sided heart failure symptoms due to preexisting high degree of tricuspid valve regurge which did not disappear or even decrease after the operation and the other patient due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: TMVIV and TMVIR offer an efficient, safe and less invasive alternative in high surgical risk patients.
