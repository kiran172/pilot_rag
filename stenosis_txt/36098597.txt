Title: [Transvesical correction of recalcitrant vesicourethral anastamotic stenosis with buccal graft fixed by automated V-LOC suture].

Abstract: We present a clinical case of a patient with a post radical robot-assisted prostatectomy recurrent vesicourethral anastamotic stenosis. Successful simplified transvesical correction with buccal mucosa graft fixed by self-anchoring automated V-Loc suture through the needle for epidural anestesia without knot formation was the unique feature of case presented.
