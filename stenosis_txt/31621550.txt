Title: Acute symptomatic extracranial internal carotid occlusion - natural course and clinical impact.

Abstract: Background: To assess the vascular and clinical course of acute symptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion. Patients and methods: Patients with an acute ischemic event in the anterior circulation and corresponding extracranial ICA occlusion at CT angiography and/or color-coded duplex sonography underwent recurrent duplex follow-up for detection of spontaneous recanalization. Stroke recurrence and functional outcome 4.5 months after the ischemic index event assessed by modified Rankin scale served as secondary outcome parameters. Results: 133 patients (91 men, mean age 62.3 years, SD 10.8) demonstrated symptomatic occlusion of the extracranial ICA with open intracranial ICA and open middle cerebral artery and were followed-up for spontaneous recanalization. Twenty-eight recanalized spontaneously, 25 to high-grade focal stenosis within 12 days, revealing an early cumulative recanalization rate of 23 %. Detection of recanalization was independently associated with de novo dual anti-platelet therapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.34 to 7.80). Ischemic recurrence occurred in 16 patients, of which 10 deemed to be embolic and 5 hemodynamic. Spontaneous ICA recanalization and an exhausted cerebrovascular reserve in the hemisphere distal to the occluded ICA were both independently associated with the occurrence of a recurrent ischemic event at Cox regression. An increasing NIHSS score at admission, a decreasing middle cerebral artery flow velocity and an ischemic recurrence independently predicted poor outcome (modified Rankin scale 3 to 6) in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Acute symptomatic extracranial ICA occlusion is an unstable condition with frequent spontaneous recanalization to severe stenosis and early embolic stroke recurrence, demanding appropriate prevention especially in those patients with only mild deficit.
