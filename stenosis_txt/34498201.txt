Title: Long term effects of surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement on FFR<sub>CT</sub> in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: The long-term variations of fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) after surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) have not been investigated. A total of 25 patients with isolated, severe AS underwent coronary computed tomography with 3-vessel FFR<sub>CT</sub> analysis (Heartflow Inc.-Redwood City, California, USA) and measurement of total coronary volume (V), left ventricular mass (M) and their ratio (V/M) before and 6 months after SAVR or TAVR. A significant increase in V/M due to a decrease in left ventricular mass 6 months after intervention was observed, whereas total coronary volume did not change (coronary volume pre: 2924.5 ± 867.9 mm3, coronary volume post: 2844.2 ± 792.8 mm3, P = 0.158; LV mass pre: 151.7 ± 40.7 g, LV mass post: 127.3 ± 34.7 g, P &lt; 0.001; V/M pre: 19.5 ± 4.1 mm3/g, V/M post: 22.7 ± 4.28 mm3/g, P = 0.002). FFR<sub>CT</sub> (expressed as area under the virtual pullback curve) remained constant. This proof-of-concept study showed that FFR<sub>CT</sub> was not subject to the confounding effect of left ventricular mass regression after SAVR or TAVR. Despite significant left ventricular remodeling at 6 months after AS treatment, FFR<sub>CT</sub> values remained constant. Further studies are needed comparing the performance of the different invasive and non-invasive coronary physiological indices in this patient cohort.
