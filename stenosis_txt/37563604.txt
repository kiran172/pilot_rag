Title: Restenosis after excimer laser coronary atherectomy and drug-coated balloon dilation in Takayasu's arteritis: a case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) is a rare chronic granulomatous arteritis that mainly affects the aorta and its major branches. Coronary artery (CA) involvement can be observed in 10-25% of TAK patients. We report a 21-year-old young female who was previously diagnosed with TAK and severe left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis and underwent numerous percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in our hospital due to in-stent restenosis (ISR). This time, an excimer laser coronary atherectomy (ELCA) and drug-coated balloon (DCB) dilation was taken at the LMCA for the ISR. The blood flow was smooth after the operation, and she was symptom-free after discharge. Unfortunately, 5 months later, severe intimal hyperplasia was still seen in the stent of LMCA and left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. A coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) was performed, and she has been symptom-free ever since. ELCA plus DCB is one of the novel ways we first reported. However, ensuring long-term inflammation control is equally important to restore blood flow. The combination of revascularization and anti-inflammation/immunosuppression is recommended to improve the outcomes of TAK patients with CA involvements.
