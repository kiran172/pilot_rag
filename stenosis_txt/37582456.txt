Title: Letter regarding the article: Trends, and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Aortic Insufficiency; A Nationwide Readmission Database Analysis.

Abstract: With great interest, we have read the article "Trends, and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation In Aortic Insufficiency; A Nationwide Readmission Database Analysis" by Ullah et al. For its clarity and conciseness, we applaud the author for his extensive research on this delicate topic. The authors have concisely written several scenarios including the current understanding of trends, and potential outcome of aortic insufficiency following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Nonetheless, we thought it would be helpful to add a few more things to the article's conclusion to strengthen it. The inclusion of the pathophysiology of coronary microcirculation disorder, and endothelial dysfunction in patients with aortic stenosis and then examine the impact of TAVI on these conditions can improve the results. Second, echocardiographic data regarding right and left ventricular dimensions and function or tricuspid regurgitation presence and its severity could lead to a better understanding of the mechanism.
