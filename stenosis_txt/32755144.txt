Title: Co-occurrence of compression syndromes: celiac axis stenosis, superior mesenteric artery and nutcracker syndrome.

Abstract: Moreno MÃ¡rquez et al. report an association between arcuate ligament syndrome (ALS) and the "nutcracker" phenomenon (compression of the left renal vein). The case illustrates the association between several syndromes, which all involve compression of vascular or gastrointestinal structures: arcuate ligament syndrome, superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) or Wilkie's syndrome, the "nutcracker" syndrome and May-Thurner syndrome (compression of the left iliac vein).
