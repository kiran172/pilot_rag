Title: Risk Factor Analysis of Gastroparesis Syndrome in 2652 Patients with Radical Distal Gastrectomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors of postoperative gastroparesis syndrome (PGS) in patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical distal gastrectomy.
METHODS: The clinical data of 2652 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical distal gastrectomy in the past 10 years were retrospectively analyzed. Furthermore, the incidence of PGS was set as the dependent variable, and the risk factors for PGS were screened using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Risk factor analysis for the different digestive tract reconstruction methods was also performed.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that preoperative pyloric obstruction (p = 0.001), digestive tract reconstruction (p = 0.001), jejunum nutrition tube application (p = 0.001), intraperitoneal chemotherapy drug application (p = 0.002), age (≥ 66 years or < 66 years) (p = 0.042), operative time (≥ 184.5 min or < 184.5 min) (p = 0.049), and postoperative indwelling catheter time (≥ 4.5 days or < 4.5 days) (p = 0.045) were related to PGS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative pyloric obstruction (odds ratio (OR) = 2.830, p = 0.004), application of a jejunum nutrition tube (OR = 3.309, p = 0.011), intraperitoneal chemotherapy (OR = 0.482, p = 0.010), and digestive tract reconstruction were independent risk factors for PGS.
CONCLUSION: This study identified risk factors associated with PGS, which could be further applied in clinical practice.
