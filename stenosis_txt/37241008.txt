Title: Open-Heart Cardio-Thoracic Biological Valve Replacement Following Complicated Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is currently becoming the method of choice in high-risk patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Post-TAVI complications are more common owing to the increasing use of the method. The majority of TAVI complications derive from concomitant aortic stenosis with moderate/severe aortic insufficiency, paravalvular leak, and atrioventricular block. The contemporary TAVI qualification process includes a thorough echocardiography and angio-CT of the aorta, which is crucial in assessing valve measurements, determining the position of the coronary arteries branching from the aorta, and choosing the optimal valve size. We present the case report of an 81-year-old patient admitted to our hospital because of exacerbation of the clinical condition and development of pulmonary edema a few days after TAVI. Despite the reduction of the initial leak, an echocardiographic examination revealed the remaining severe paravalvular aortic leakage. We performed open-heart cardio-thoracic surgery, explanted the TAVI valve, and implanted the biological prosthesis (Edwards Perimount Magna size 25). Introduction of new interventional treatment approaches and the availability of imaging tools have substantially reduced the incidence of significant paravalvular leak and offered a better prognosis for patients undergoing TAVI.
