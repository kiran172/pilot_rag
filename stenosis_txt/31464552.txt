Title: Snuff box radial artery access for arteriovenous fistula intervention.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this article is to retrospectively compare snuff box radial artery access with direct fistula access for radiocephalic fistula intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of 68 consecutive radiocephalic interventions between April 2013 and April 2017 was performed. The snuff box radial access was performed under ultrasound guidance with the hand in a neutral position (thumb up). The snuff box radial artery was entered distal to the extensor pollicis longus, over the trapezium bone. Hand held pressure was applied for hemostasis. The procedure times, success, and complications of snuff box radial artery access procedures were reviewed.
RESULTS: Snuff box radial artery access was used in 25% (17/68) of radiocephalic fistula interventions. All access procedures were successful. Snuff box radial artery access was only used in cases involving the proximal fistula. Lesions treated from snuff box radial artery access approach included 19% (10/54) of fistula stenosis, 50% (1/2) thrombosis, 63% (5/8) immature fistulae, 100% (1/1) steal syndrome, and none of the (0/5) symptomatic outflow occlusions. The mean procedure times for snuff box radial artery access and direct fistula access were not significant at 29.1 ± 16.3 min (range = 10-81) and 26.8 ± 14.0 min (range = 5-70), respectively (p < 0.57). Minor hematoma occurred in 12% (2/17) snuff box radial artery access and 2% (1/51) direct fistula access. There were no major complications.
CONCLUSION: Snuff box radial access was used successfully for radiocephalic fistula intervention with procedure times similar to direct fistula access without major complications.
