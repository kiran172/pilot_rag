Title: Novel Use of Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty to Treat Pulmonary Vein Stenosis.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis is challenging to treat due to high rate of recurrence. Multiple interventions exist but are limited by high rates of restenosis. One theory for the high rate of recurrence is vascular inflammation. Drug-coated balloon angioplasty has been used to limit restenosis caused by inhibiting inflammation in pulmonary vein stenosis.
