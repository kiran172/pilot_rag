Title: Association between Pericarotid Fat Density and Positive Remodeling in Patients with Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: The underlying mechanism of the potential involvement of inflammatory crosstalk between pericarotid fat and vascular layers in atherosclerosis pathogenesis is unclear. We investigated the association between pericarotid fat density and positive remodeling and inflammatory markers in carotid stenosis. We hypothesized that pericarotid fat density might serve as a marker of plaque inflammation in a clinical setting. Methods: We evaluated the stenosis degree and pericarotid fat density in 258 patients with carotid plaques. Plaque composition was examined, and the correlation between pericarotid fat density and expansive remodeling was investigated. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationship between pericarotid fat density and the expansive remodeling ratio. We also evaluated the relationship of pericarotid fat density with plaque composition, degree of stenosis, and macrophage and microvessel counts by. The subgroup analysis compared these factors between symptomatic mild carotid stenosis. Results: The pericarotid fat density was -63.0 ± 11.1 HU. The carotid fat densities were -56.8 ± 10.4 HU in symptomatic and -69.2 ± 11.4 HU in asymptomatic lesions. The pericarotid fat density values in intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid-rich necrotic core, and fibrous plaque were -51.6 ± 10.4, -59.4 ± 12.8, and -74.2 ± 8.4 HU, respectively. Therefore, the expansive remodeling ratio was 1.64 ± 0.4. Carotid fat density and expansive remodeling ratio were correlated. Immunohistochemistry showed high macrophage and microvessel levels (143.5 ± 61.3/field and 121.2 ± 27.7/field, respectively). In symptomatic mild carotid stenosis, pericarotid fat density was correlated with other inflammatory factors. The pericarotid fat density and expansive remodeling ratio (2.08 ± 0.21) were high in mild stenosis (-50.1 ± 8.4 HU). Conclusions: Pericarotid fat and intraplaque components were well correlated. Carotid fat density may be a marker of plaque inflammation in carotid plaques.
