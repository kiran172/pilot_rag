Title: Post-operative biliary strictures.

Abstract: Post-operative biliary stricture is a cumbersome condition, secondary to biliary or vascular damage. Its risk factors include biliary or vascular anatomical variants, local inflammation, and poor surgical expertise. Intra-operative diagnosis is difficult, and in most cases, patients present with obstructive symptoms within a few weeks. Magnetic resonance cholangiography is a pivotal test to confirm the clinical picture, to study the level of the damage, and to guide treatment. Nowadays, endoscopic stenting is the first-line treatment in most centers. Multi-stenting treatment achieves long-term clinical success for more than 90% of patients, however multiple procedures are needed. In order to optimize healthcare provider costs, shorter duration endotherapies with covered metal stents are under evaluation. Radiological and surgical approaches are considered in the event of endoscopy failure.
