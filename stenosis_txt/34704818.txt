Title: Increased expression of IL-20 is associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute myocardial infarction.

Abstract: Background: The expression and clinical significance of IL-20 in coronary artery diseases needs to be analyzed. Methods: IL-20 and its receptors were analyzed in coronary artery tissues. In a separate study, plasma IL-20 was also evaluated. Results: IL-20 and its receptors were significantly higher in coronary artery stenosis tissues from ischemic cardiomyopathy patients than that from controls. T lymphocytes and macrophages were the main source of IL-20 and expressed its receptors abundantly. Plasma IL-20 was significantly higher in acute myocardial infarction patients than that in controls. Conclusion: IL-20 was closely associated with the presence of acute myocardial infarction. IL-20 may participate in the progression of coronary artery stenosis and plaque vulnerability via regulating T lymphocytes and macrophages.
