Title: Axillary Access TAVR: Entrapment of a Transcatheter Aortic Valve in the Innominate Artery With Aortic Dissection.

Abstract: Non-femoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is indicated when peripheral vascular disease is diagnosed. We describe the "double-stick" technique via the axillary artery. During the procedure, the pigtail coiled around the TAVR system. While retracting the TAVR sheath, the seam along system split dislodging the valve from the balloon. The valve was entrapped in the innominate artery, and an aortic dissection required surgery. With the double-stick technique, friction and resistance between the pigtail and delivery system must be avoided. Pre-procedural planning and early identification is paramount. Smaller and more seamless delivery systems may reduce risk for dissection and entrapment.
