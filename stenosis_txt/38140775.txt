Title: Clinical implication of the Naples prognostic score on transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: One of the hallmarks of frailty in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) is malnutrition, for which one of the most up-to-date scoring systems is the Naples prognostic score (NPS). This study sought to investigate the predictive role of the NPS in determining mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) under long-term follow-up.
METHODS: A total of 430 consecutive patients with symptomatic severe AS who underwent TAVR were included retrospectively. The primary endpoint of the study was the long-term all-cause mortality. The study population was divided into two groups according to the NPS value, including Group 1 (NPS 0-2) and Group 2 (NPS 3-4).
RESULTS: The all-cause mortality occurred in 250 patients (62.5%) patients during a follow-up time of 40.6 (22.0-69.4) months. During the follow-up period, all-cause mortality was higher in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (87.9% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.001). Older age (p < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.015), left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.021), and being in Group 2 (high NPS) (hazard ratio: 7.058, 95% confidence interval: 5.174-9.629, p < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of all-cause mortality at long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The NPS as a malnutrition and inflammation marker in patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR provides valuable information for all-cause mortality under long-term follow-up.
