Title: Albuminuria Predicts Short-Term Worsening Renal Function After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Albuminuria is a major risk factor of cardiovascular events, however, the impact of albuminuria on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not been fully investigated. This retrospective study included 206 patients who underwent TAVR for severe aortic stenosis. Patients were divided into two groups according to the preoperative urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR): high (ACR ≥ 30 mg/g) and low (ACR < 30 mg/g). The incidence of 1-month worsening renal function (WRF), defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥10% from baseline after TAVR, was investigated. Patients with high ACR had acute kidney injury (8.5% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.01) and 1-month WRF (29.2% vs. 12.0%, p = 0.002) more frequently than those with low ACR. High ACR was independently associated with 1-month WRF (odds ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.72-8.08; p < 0.001). Albuminuria can be a useful predictor of deterioration of renal function at various time points after TAVR.
