Title: Pelvic Floor Therapy and Initial Interventions for Pelvic Floor Dysfunction in Gynecologic Malignancies.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides evidence-based updates for the first-line management approaches for pelvic floor disorders in patients with gynecologic malignancies, as well as important provider considerations when referring for pelvic floor physical therapy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, there is strong evidence to recommend pelvic floor muscle training as initial treatment for urinary incontinence and for pelvic organ prolapse; some evidence to recommend a more targeted pelvic floor muscle training program for fecal incontinence; and mostly expertise-based evidence to recommend vaginal gels or estrogen to aid with dyspareunia causing sexual dysfunction. More research is greatly needed to understand the role of overactive pelvic floor muscles in survivors with chronic pelvic pain and the treatment of post-radiation pelvic complications such as vaginal stenosis and cystitis. While pelvic floor disorders are common concerns in gynecologic cancer survivors, there are evidence-based initial noninvasive treatment approaches that can provide relief for many individuals.
