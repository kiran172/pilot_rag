Title: [Optical coherence tomography imaging for the evaluation and treatment of calcified coronary artery disease].

Abstract: Coronary calcific disease represents one of the main challenges for the interventional cardiologist, for whom optimal lesion preparation and percutaneous coronary intervention optimization are paramount for correct management. In this perspective, intravascular imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is becoming an increasingly indispensable tool. This work aims to provide a detailed overview of the complexity of calcified lesions, first analyzing their various morphologies and their clinical impact: spotty calcium seems to be more present in plaques at higher risk of destabilization, while diffuse calcification is typical of stable coronary stenosis; the eruptive calcific nodule is one of the three culprit lesion phenotypes responsible for acute coronary syndromes.In the second part of this review, the available technologies for the treatment of calcified lesions are described, with the aid of illustrative OCT images. Intravascular lithotripsy causes fractures at various levels of the calcified plaque, both circumferentially and longitudinally, with an improvement in vessel compliance; atherectomy acts by modifying the composition of the plaque with selective action on the hard calcific component. OCT, providing a comprehensive overview of lesion characteristics, can guide in the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic strategy, while also offering important information on the effectiveness of the chosen treatment.
