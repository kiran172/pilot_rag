Title: Trends and controversies in carotid artery stenosis treatment.

Abstract: Despite the completion of several multi-center trials, the management of carotid stenosis remains in flux. Key questions include the role of intensive medical management in the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. In addition, identification of patients with symptomatic stenosis who will most benefit from carotid revascularization remains a priority. The role of newer imaging techniques such as carotid plaque analysis with magnetic resonance imaging is also challenging current treatment paradigms. These topics are explored in this topical update.
