Title: Anti-Restenotic Technologies in the SFA: Balloons and Stents.

Abstract: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition, which significantly impacts the quality and length of life. In recent years, drug-eluting devices have demonstrated improved clinical effectiveness for treating peripheral arterial disease in the femoropopliteal arteries compared to traditional stents and angioplasty balloons. However, recent controversial studies have called the safety of this technology into question, leading to confusion as to if, when, and how these devices should be used. This article focuses on the underlying pathophysiology and pharmacology, the clinical benefits and potential harms, as well as expected future developments affecting the use of these drug-eluting technologies in treating peripheral arterial disease of the superficial femoral arteries.
