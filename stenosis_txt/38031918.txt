Title: Endoscopic ultrasound combined with enteroscopy for bilioenterostomy stenosis after pancreatoduodenectomy. The first attempt of a two-person operation.

Abstract: Bilioenterostomy stenosis is very challenging, and effective endoscopic treatment can prevent patients from undergoing surgery. We present a case of a patient with extremely narrow bilioenterostomy treated with simultaneous endoscopic ultrasonography and enteroscopy. It provides a new and feasible idea of endoscopic therapy for the treatment of such patients.
