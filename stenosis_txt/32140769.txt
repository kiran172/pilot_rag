Title: Evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients with atrial fibrillation by cardiac computed tomography for catheter ablation: CADAF-CT trial.

Abstract: Almost all institutions routinely perform cardiac computed tomography (CT) before radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) to evaluate the cardiac anatomy. The ideal timing of the CT image acquisition is different between for RFCA of AF and for evaluation of coronary artery lesions (CALs). Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether 64- or 320-line routine cardiac CT scans before RFCA of AF could evaluate both coronary artery lesions and pulmonary veins (LA-PVs) anatomy at the timing of the image acquisition of the LA-PVs in patients with AF who underwent RFCA of AF. The CALs were evaluated in 606 consecutive patients who underwent RFCA of AF assessed by the ideal timing of the CT image acquisition for RFCA of AF, and myocardial ischemia (MI) was also evaluated in patients with severe coronary stenosis (≥ 50%) and unevaluable CALs due to their severe coronary calcification and banding artifact by additional examinations combined with exercise stress testing, 201Tl scintigraphy, and/or fractionated flow reserve measurements. This study revealed that, in patients with AF who underwent RFCA of AF, (1) both 64- and 320-line cardiac CT scans for RFCA of AF could evaluate CALs in 93% of those patients, (2) the prevalence of MI was 9%, (3) significant relationships between the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score and prevalence of MI were observed (p = 0.003), and (4) the positive predict values of MI in patients with severe coronary stenosis (≥ 50%) and unevaluable CALs also significantly increased in accordance with the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score (p = 0.003). The evaluation of CALs and MI by routine cardiac CT for RFCA of AF combined with the additional examinations may be one of the most feasible modalities for patients with AF.
