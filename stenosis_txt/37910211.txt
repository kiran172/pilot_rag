Title: [The Cannulation of the Arteriovenous Fistula in the Presence of a Stent: Precautions, Risks, and Possibilities].

Abstract: A proper management and tailored interventions represented two fundamental steps to ensure a long-term use of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). AVF failure can be attributed to various factors, with stenosis being the most common cause. Different techniques are employed for treating complications, but percutaneous endovascular procedures are the most widely used. In addition to angioplasty (PTA), the possibility of utilizing stents, particularly stent grafts (SG), has further improved outcomes. However, the insertion of these devices involves commitment to a segment of the vessel, which may vary in length, making the indication necessitate a careful evaluation. The positioning of a stent graft indeed limits the space for needle insertion, and on the other hand, the cannulation of the device is considered off-label according to technical specification. This work addresses the issue of puncturing these devices. Alongside a rapid overview, we describe a clinical case of continuous cannulation of a multiply stented AVF, for over 9 years, which opens up the discussion about the possibility of long-term cannulation through proper planning.
