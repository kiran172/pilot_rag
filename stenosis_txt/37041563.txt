Title: Reconstruction of the upper gastrointestinal tract using intra-thoracic Roux-en-Y technique after caustic agent ingestion: a case report from Aleppo, Syria.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Caustic substance ingestion is a high-risk medical emergency associated with high mortality and morbidity. To date, there are several treatment options with no standard method of care.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a corrosive agent ingestion complicated with third-degree burns and severe stenosis of the esophagus and gastric outlet. After failure of conservative treatment, the patient underwent jejunostomy placement for nutritional support followed by transhiatal esophagectomy with gastric pull-up and intra-thoracic Roux-en-Y gastroenterostomy with good outcomes. The patient recovered from the procedure and has been tolerating oral intake very well with significant weight gain.
CONCLUSION: We put a new technique for treating severe gastrointestinal injuries caused by corrosive agent ingestion that resulted in both esophageal and gastric outlet strictures. These rare complex cases requires difficult treatment decisions. We believe that this technique provides many benefits for such cases and might be a feasible alternative for colon interposition.
