Title: Optical Coherence Tomography in Cerebrovascular Disease: Open up New Horizons.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT), based on the backscattering or reflection of near-infrared light, enables an ultra-high resolution of up to 10 μm. The successful application of OCT in coronary artery diseases has sparked increasing interest in its implementation in cerebrovascular diseases. OCT has shown promising potential in the atherosclerotic plaque structure characterization, plaque rupture risk stratification, pre-stenting and post-stenting evaluation, and long-term follow-up in extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). In hemorrhagic cerebrovascular diseases, OCT plays an important role in the structure evaluation, rupture risk stratification, and healing and occlusion evaluation following initial treatment in intracranial aneurysms (IAs). In this study, we summarized the applications of OCT in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of cerebrovascular diseases, especially in ICAS and IAs. The current limitations and future directions of OCT in the endovascular treatment of cerebrovascular diseases were also discussed.
