Title: Subglottic Stenosis After Pediatric Tracheostomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of subglottic stenosis (SGS) in children after tracheostomy and identify risk factors for development.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
METHODS: All patients (<18 years) undergoing tracheostomy at a tertiary children's hospital between 2015 and 2020 were included. Patients with a direct laryngoscopy (DL) concurrent with tracheostomy and a subsequent DL were included. Medical records, including operative reports, were reviewed to identify subglottic stenosis and associated risk factors.
RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included with mean age at tracheostomy of 2.4 years (standard deviation [SD]: 4.3) (median: 0.5 years, interquartile range [IQR]: 0.3-1.5 years) and gestational age of 33.8 weeks (SD: 5.9) (median: 36 weeks, IQR: 28-39 weeks). At initial DL, 24% (N = 34) had subglottic injury and 26% (N = 37) developed SGS. The incidence of SGS after tracheostomy was 11.5 cases per 100 patients per year. At tracheostomy, lower birth weight (1.8 vs. 2.3 kg, p = 0.005), shorter gestational age (31.8 vs. 34.6 weeks, p = 0.01), younger age (0.8 vs. 2.9 years, p = 0.01), lower weight (5.8 vs. 14.7 kg, p = 0.01), and subglottic injury (44% vs. 21%, p = 0.01) were associated with the development of SGS. Multivariable logistic regression analysis associated birth weight (odds ratio [OR]: 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31-0.75, p = 0.001) and early subglottic injury (OR: 3.22, 95% CI: 1.31-7.88, p = 0.01) with SGS development.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SGS after pediatric tracheostomy is estimated at 11.5 cases per 100 patients per year. Low birth weight and subglottic injury at the time of tracheostomy were associated with SGS in this vulnerable population of children.
