Title: A novel technique of airway silicon stent deployment under vision-Dr. Vidyasagar's technique.

Abstract: The conventional methods of silicon stent insertion recommend usage of external loading devices, where the stent is folded into the loading device and pushed in to the tracheobronchial tree using an external pusher which is blind, and leads to placement of stent either distally or proximally needing repositioning or is done with fluoroscopy that involves radiation exposure. We demonstrate our experience in 16 cases of successful silicon stent placement using this technique, wherein an Ultrathin flexible bronchoscope or Hopkins Rigid telescope is pushed alongside the forceps that hold upper end of the folded silicon stent allowing stent placement under direct vision with control over the stent. The Proximal end of the stent can be pulled under vision before deployment for appropriate positioning while pulling the rigid barrel. The stent is always under the operator's control providing excellent control over placement, simplifies the procedure and is safe with no reported complications.
