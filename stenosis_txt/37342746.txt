Title: A Case of Aplastic Anemia Complicated With Cerebral Infarction.

Abstract: Aplastic anemia is usually associated with hemorrhagic stroke. Here, we report a case of ischemic stroke secondary to aplastic anemia in a 28-year-old male who presented with sudden-onset right hemiplegia and aphasia when he was not on any immunosuppression for five months. His laboratory findings showed pancytopenia, and his peripheral blood smear showed no atypical cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the neck and brain vessels revealed an infarct in the left cerebral hemisphere in the middle cerebral artery territory, and no significant stenosis or aneurysm was observed on MRA. The patient was managed conservatively and discharged in stable condition.
