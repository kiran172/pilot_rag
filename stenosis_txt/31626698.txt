Title: Bariatric Surgery and Its Complications in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.

Abstract: Recent data have suggested that bariatric procedures, especially laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), are safe and effective weight loss measures in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). But most of the studies have looked at short-term outcomes, and there is a general lack of awareness of underlying disease processes and baseline comorbidities in IBD patients undergoing bariatric procedures. Postbariatric issues in IBD patients including diarrhea from dumping syndrome, choleretic diarrhea, a high prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's esophagus, stomal ulcerations, stenosis, and renal and gallstones can complicate the natural history of IBD. This could lead to unnecessary hospitalizations, change of medical therapy, and poor surgical and quality of life outcomes. In this review, we will discuss major complications after common bariatric procedures (SG, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and gastric banding) and suggest possible management strategies.
