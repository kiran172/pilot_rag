Title: Aortic root morphometry revisited-Clinical implications for aortic valve interventions.

Abstract: The complex anatomy of the aortic root is of great importance for many surgical and transcatheter cardiac procedures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive morphological description of the nondiseased aortic root. We morphometrically examined 200 autopsied human adult hearts (22.0% females, 47.9 ± 17.7 years). A meticulous macroscopic analysis of aortic root anatomy was performed. The largest cross-section area of the aortic root was observed in coaptation center plane (653.9 ± 196.5 mm2), followed by tubular plane (427.7 ± 168.0 mm2) and basal ring (362.7 ± 159.1 mm2) (p &lt; 0.001). The right coronary sinus was the largest (area: 234.3 ± 85.0 mm2), followed by noncoronary sinus (218.7 ± 74.8 mm2) and left coronary sinus (201.2 ± 78.08 mm2). The noncoronary sinus was the deepest, followed by right and left coronary sinus (16.4 ± 3.2 vs. 15.9 ± 3.1 vs. 14.9 ± 2.9 mm, p &lt; 0.001). In 68.5% of hearts, the coaptation center was located near the aortic geometric center. The left coronary ostium was located 15.6 ± 3.8 mm above sinus bottom (within the sinus in 91.5% and above sinutubular junction in 8.5%), while for right coronary ostium, it was 16.2 ± 3.5 mm above (83.5% within sinus and 16.5% above). In general, males exhibited larger aortic valve dimensions than females. A multiple forward stepwise regression model showed that anthropometric variables might predict the size of coaptation center plane (age, sex, and heart weight; R2 = 31.8%), tubular plane (age and sex; R2 = 25.6%), and basal ring (age and sex; R2 = 16.9%). In conclusion, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of aortic-root morphometry and provides a platform for further research into the intricate interplay between structure and function of the aortic root.
