Title: Transposition of external jugular to proximal internal jugular vein for relief of venous thoracic outlet syndrome and maintenance of arteriovenous fistula access for chronic hemodialysis: A new approach.

Abstract: We are reporting a case of venous thoracic outlet syndrome with recurrent subclavian vein thrombosis in the setting of an ipsilateral brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis that was malfunctioning due to the central vein obstruction. The patient also had a concomitant external jugular vein origin stenosis. Given her body habitus and aversion to recovery after traditional first rib resection, we elected for an alternative treatment with an external jugular vein to internal jugular vein transposition with balloon angioplasty of the stenosed external jugular origin segment. The goal of this was to provide simultaneous relief of her outlet obstruction symptoms and salvage her dialysis access with a less invasive technique.
