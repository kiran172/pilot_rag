Title: Absolute coronary flow and microvascular resistance before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with left ventricular (LV) remodelling, likely causing alterations in coronary blood flow and microvascular resistance.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate changes in absolute coronary flow and microvascular resistance in patients with AS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: Consecutive patients with AS undergoing TAVI with non-obstructive coronary artery disease in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were included. Absolute coronary flow (Q) and microvascular resistance (R<sub>Î¼</sub>) were measured in the LAD using continuous intracoronary thermodilution at rest and during hyperaemia before and after TAVI, and at 6-month follow-up. Total myocardial mass and LAD-specific mass were quantified by echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography. Regional myocardial perfusion (Q<sub>N</sub>) was calculated by dividing absolute flow by the subtended myocardial mass.
RESULTS: In 51 patients, Q and R were measured at rest and during hyperaemia before and after TAVI; in 20 (39%) patients, measurements were also obtained 6 months after TAVI. No changes occurred in resting and hyperaemic flow and resistance before and after TAVI nor after 6 months. However, at 6-month follow-up, a notable reverse LV remodelling resulted in a significant increase in hyperaemic perfusion (Q<sub>N,hyper</sub>: 0.86 [interquartile range {IQR} 0.691.06] vs 1.20 [IQR 0.99-1.32] mL/min/g; p=0.008; pre-TAVI and follow-up, respectively) but not in resting perfusion (Q<sub>N,rest</sub>: 0.34 [IQR 0.30-0.48] vs 0.47 [IQR 0.36-0.67] mL/min/g; p=0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: Immediately after TAVI, no changes occurred in absolute coronary flow or coronary flow reserve. Over time, the remodelling of the left ventricle is associated with increased hyperaemic perfusion.
