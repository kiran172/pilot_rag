Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Large Annuli Valves With the Supra-Annular, Self-Expandable Evolut Platform in a Real-World Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is approved for treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis across the spectrum of risk. While considering broader indications for use, transcatheter aortic valve replacement in large native annuli has become increasingly important.
METHODS: Patients with tricuspid aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the Evolut R or Evolut PRO+ 34 mm valves (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry between October 2016 and September 2020 were stratified according to in range (>12%) device oversizing and below range (0%-12%) device oversizing. Patients undergoing valve-in-valve procedures, having a baseline annulus size <26 or ≥34 mm, or without computed tomography angiography measured annulus size were excluded. Percentage of oversizing was calculated as [(valve diameter-annulus diameter)×100/annulus diameter].
RESULTS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with large annuli was performed in 8017 patients with a mean (±SD) age 79.3±7.9 years and 94% were male. Below range (n=1096) was less common than in range oversizing (n=6921). At 1-year follow-up, mortality (19.6% versus 14.9%; P=0.001), aortic valve reintervention (2.1% versus 0.6%; P&lt;0.001) and valve-related readmission rates (3.2% versus 2.0%; P=0.014) were higher in the below range device oversizing group versus in range group respectively. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model, when controlling for clinically relevant covariates, below range device oversizing was associated with higher 1-year all-cause mortality (HR, 1.28 [CI, 1.07-1.51]; P=0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Results from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry in patients with large annuli valves using 34mm Evolut R/PRO+ valves suggest that in range (>12%) device oversizing delivered better clinical outcomes than implantation with below range (0%-12%) device oversizing.
