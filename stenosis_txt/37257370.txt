Title: Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Nonagenarians and Octogenarians (Analysis from the National Inpatient Sample Database).

Abstract: Risks among nonagenarian (age ≥90 years) and octogenarian (age 80 to 89 years) patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared with clinically similar septuagenarian (age 70 to 79 years) patients remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the outcomes of TAVI in nonagenarians and octogenarians compared with septuagenarians. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample database to identify patients aged ≥70 years hospitalized for TAVI from 2016 to 2020 and to compare outcomes in nonagenarians and octogenarians versus septuagenarians. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included procedural complications, length of stay (LOS), and total costs. The trends in in-hospital outcomes were evaluated. Results were adjusted for demographic/clinical factors. The total cohort included 263,325 patients hospitalized for TAVI, of whom 11.9% were nonagenarians, 51.1% octogenarians, and 37.0% septuagenarians. After adjustment, nonagenarians and octogenarians had higher odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 2.41 for nonagenarians; adjusted odds ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 2.01 for octogenarians), heart block, permanent pacemaker insertion, stroke, major bleeding, blood transfusion, and palliative care consultation than septuagenarians (all p &lt;0.01). LOS was longer and the total costs were higher for nonagenarians and octogenarians (both p &lt;0.01). Over the study period, in-hospital mortality decreased in nonagenarians (p<sub>trend</sub> = 0.04), and major bleeding, permanent pacemaker insertion, LOS, and costs decreased in all patients aged ≥70 years (p<sub>trend</sub> &lt;0.01). In conclusion, nonagenarians and octogenarians who underwent TAVI have higher rates of mortality and procedure-related complications than clinically similar septuagenarians. Further research is necessary to optimize outcomes in this frail population.
