Title: Relationship Between Coronary Fractional Flow Reserve and Computational Fluid Dynamics Analysis in Moderate Stenosis of the Coronary Artery.

Abstract: Background: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is used to evaluate the need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in cases of moderate stenosis of the coronary artery. Recently, diagnostic imaging support with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis has been garnering attention. This study defines the relationship between FFR conducted for cardiac catheterization and CFD analyses conducted using coronary computed tomography (CT) for moderate stenosis, in addition to considering whether wall pressure (WP) and wall shear stress (WSS) can be used to evaluate ischemia. Methods and Results: Cases in which FFR was measured via coronary CT and cardiac catheterization was performed within 3 months were collected retrospectively. In the CFD analysis, WP and WSS were calculated and compared with FFR. Three groups were created to compare results of CFD analysis and FFR values according to the location of the stenosis: the right coronary artery, the left anterior descending artery, and the left circumflex artery. There was a correlation between FFR and WSS according to CFD analysis for moderate stenosis of the coronary artery, with a cut-off value for treatment able to be calculated. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that ischemia can be evaluated by conducting CFD analysis (WSS) using coronary CT.
