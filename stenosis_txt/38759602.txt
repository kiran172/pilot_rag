Title: I saw the 'puff of smoke' sign before it vanished into thin air.

Abstract: Moyamoya is characterized as a non-atherosclerotic and non-inflammatory vasculopathy that leads to progressive stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries as well as the Circle of Willis. While it can be idiopathic (Moyamoya disease) or associated with another condition (Moyamoya syndrome), there is a characteristic 'puff of smoke' sign that can be appreciated on cerebral angiography.
