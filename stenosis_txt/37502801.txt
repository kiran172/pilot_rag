Title: Stenting for Common Carotid Artery Stenosis Using the Sheath Pull-Through Technique.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We report the "sheath pull-through technique" for stenting of common carotid artery stenosis (CCAS).
CASE PRESENTATIONS: In this technique, an 8-10 Fr super-long sheath (SLS) 55-65 cm is inserted into the femoral artery and the brachiofemoral pull-through technique is subsequently used, improving the support of the sheath itself. We pulled both ends of a pull-through wire to further improve the support of SLS, stabilizing guiding catheter (GC) during the procedure in two cases.
CONCLUSION: This technique stabilizes GC during CCAS stenting.
