Title: Esophageal Intramural Pseudodiverticulosis Diagnosed by Combining Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, Esophagography, and High-resolution Manometry.

Abstract: Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis (EIPD) is a rare disease. A 78-year-old man with dysphagia presented to our hospital. The presence of diffuse esophageal spasm was suspected by his primary-care doctor. High-resolution manometry (HRM) showed no abnormal findings. The patient was diagnosed with EIPD and Candida esophagitis, by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and esophagography. His symptoms improved after symptomatic treatment for Candida esophagitis with oral administration of an antifungal drug. EIPD should be considered in patients with dysphagia; EGD and esophagography should be performed when diagnosing EIPD.
