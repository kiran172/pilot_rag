Title: National Institutes of Health stroke scale score at admission can predict functional outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke undergoing carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of present study was to evaluate the prognostic effect of the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score for patients who had undergone acute carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and assess the clinical and morphologic factors that could predict for worse outcomes.
METHODS: The data from 183 consecutive patients who had undergone CEA after ischemic stroke were analyzed from January 2015 to January 2021. The patients were divided into two groups using the NIHSS score cutoff of 4. Functional dependence was assessed at hospital discharge and 90 days after discharge.
RESULTS: Of the 183 patients, 102 (55.7%) had had a minor stroke (group A; NIHSS score of ≤4) and 81 (44.3%) had had a moderate to major stroke (group B; NIHSS score &gt;4). Groups A and B showed significant differences in their intracranial anatomic features, including the presence of an incomplete circle of Willis (7.8% vs 17.3%; P = .05), cerebral ischemic lesion volume ≥4000 mm3 (5.9% vs 24.7%; P ≤ .001), and a high Alberta stroke program early computed tomography score of 8 to 10 (75.5% vs 44.4%; P ≤ .001). The overall rate of combined perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, and death was 1.1%, with no strokes recorded during the interval to CEA. Patients in group A had a lower rate of functional dependence at discharge (4.9% vs 35.8%; P ≤ .001) and at 90 days after the index stroke event (2.5% vs 19.6%; P ≤ .001) compared with those in group B. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, an admission NIHSS score &gt;4 was significantly associated with higher odds of functional dependence at discharge (odds ratio, 7.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-18.5; P ≤ .001) and at 90 days (odds ratio, 10.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-19.3; P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: An NIHSS score >4 at admission increased the risk of a higher modified Rankin scale score at both hospital discharge and 90 days after the index stroke event. Acute CEA was safe and feasible for patients with ischemic stroke, even if they had previously undergone intravenous thrombolysis.
