Title: Robot-assisted oesophagectomy (Ivor-Lewis) for a complex stenosis previously managed by open gastrostomy tube placement.

Abstract: A man in his late 50s presented with severe dysphagia caused by a complex refractory benign stenosis that was completely obstructing the middle oesophagus. The patient was unsatisfied with the gastrostomy tube placed via laparotomy as a long-term solution. Therefore, we performed robot-assisted minimally invasive oesophagectomy (video). Mobilisation of the stomach and gastric conduit preparation were more difficult due to the previously inserted gastrostomy tube; thus, the conduit blood supply was assessed using indocyanine green ï¬‚uorescence. After an uncomplicated course, the patient was referred directly to inpatient rehabilitation on the 16th postoperative day. At 9 months after surgery, the motivated patient returned to full-time work and achieved level 7 on the functional oral intake scale (total oral diet, with no restrictions). At the 1-year follow-up, he positively confirmed all nine key elements of a good quality of life after oesophagectomy.
