Title: Open ureteroplasty with buccal mucosa graft for long proximal strictures: A good option for a rare problem.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report a single surgeon experience with one year follow-up after open ureteroplasty with buccal mucosa graft (OUBMG) in the rare situation of long segment proximal ureteral strictures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients with long segment proximal ureteral stricture underwent OU-BMG between February and July 2017. Functional outcome was assessed by pre- and postoperative serum creatinine, ultrasound and renal scintigraphy as well as patient reported outcomes.
RESULTS: Four patients with an average stricture length of 4 cm underwent OU-BMG between February and July 2017. No major postoperative complications occurred. Retrograde uretero-pyelography 6 weeks postoperatively revealed a watertight anastomosis followed by immediate emptying of the renal pelvis and ureter in all four patients. Ureteroscopy at this time showed a wide lumen with well-vascularized pink mucosa. After a mean follow-up time of 12.5 (12-14) months, postoperative serum creatinine was unimpaired. Renal scintigraphy revealed no signs of renal obstruction. With regard to intraoral surgery, no difficulties with mouth opening or intraoral dryness or numbness were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with long segment ureteral strictures OU-BMG is a safe technique with excellent surgical and functional outcomes. Hence, the application of this technique should be encouraged and regarded as one of the standard options in case of this rare problem.
