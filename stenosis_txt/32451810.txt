Title: Lipoprotein(a) and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention across Diverse Populations.

Abstract: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a highly proatherogenic lipid fraction that is genetically determined and minimally responsive to lifestyle or behavior changes. Mendelian randomization studies have suggested a causal link between elevated Lp(a) and heart disease, stroke, and aortic stenosis. There is substantial inter-ethnic variation in Lp(a) levels, with persons of African descent having the highest median values. Monitoring of Lp(a) has historically been limited by lack of standardization of assays. With the advent of novel therapeutic modalities to lower Lp(a) levels including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and targeted antisense oligonucleotides, it is increasingly important to screen patients who have family or personal history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for elevations in Lp(a). Further study is needed to establish a causal relationship between elevated Lp(a) and cardiovascular disease across diverse ethnic populations.
