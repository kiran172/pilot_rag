Title: Do carotid artery calcifications seen on radiographs predict stenosis in asymptomatic adults?

Abstract: NOT VERY WELL. IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS, CAROTID ARTERY CALCIFICATION SEEN ON RADIOGRAPH HAS A POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF 70% AND A NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF 75% FOR CAROTID ARTERY STENOSIS (STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION [SOR]: B, SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES WITH HETEROGENEOUS RESULTS AND A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY). CAROTID CALCIFICATIONS ON RADIOGRAPHS MAY BE MORE PREDICTIVE OF CAROTID STENOSIS IN PEOPLE WITH ATHEROSCLEROTIC RISK FACTORS (SOR: C, CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY). HARMS OUTWEIGH BENEFITS IN SCREENING FOR CAROTID ARTERY STENOSIS IN ASYMPTOMATIC ADULTS (SOR: B, MULTIPLE COHORT STUDIES); THEREFORE, INCIDENTAL RADIOGRAPHIC CAROTID ARTERY CALCIFICATIONS IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS SHOULD NOT PROMPT FURTHER TESTING.
