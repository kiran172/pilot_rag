Title: Impact of Chronic Coronary Artery Disease and Revascularization Strategy in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: The prognostic impact of coronary artery disease (CAD) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of CAD and different revascularization strategies on clinical outcomes in patients who underwent TAVI with third generation devices. Patients enrolled in the national observational Observational Study of Effectiveness of SAVR-TAVI Procedures for Severe Aortic Stenosis Treatment II study were stratified according to the presence of CAD (CAD+, n = 1,130) versus no CAD (CAD-, n = 1,505), and compared using a propensity matched analysis. CAD+ group was further stratified according to the revascularization strategy: no revascularization (n = 331), revascularization performed >90 days before index-TAVI (n = 417) and coronary revascularization performed <90 days before index-TAVI or during TAVI (n = 382). In-hospital, 30-day and 1-year clinical outcomes were estimated. The mean age of the overall population was 81.8 years; 54.9% of patients were female. Propensity score matching yielded 813 pairs and their 30-day all-cause mortality was comparable (p = 0.480). Major periprocedural adverse events were also similar between the groups. At 1-year follow-up, the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) and all-cause mortality were similar between the groups (p = 0.732 and p = 0.633, respectively). Conversely, patients with CAD experienced more often myocardial infarction and need for percutaneous coronary intervention at 1 year (p = 0.007 and p = 0.001, respectively). Neither CAD nor revascularization strategy were independent predictors of 1-year MACCE. About 40% of patients presenting with severe AS and who underwent TAVI had concomitant CAD. The presence of CAD had no impact on all-cause mortality and MACCE 1-year after TAVR. However, CAD carries a higher risk for acute myocardial infarction and need of percutaneous coronary intervention during follow-up.
