Title: Using Ping-pong technique along with rapid inflate-deflate ballooning to solve total left main occlusion during transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure.

Abstract: Coronary obstruction during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) poses a significant threat, prompting a closer examination of prevention and bailout strategies. Following TAVR deployment with a coronary artery obstruction complication and recognizing the complexities involved in engaging the left main coronary artery through TAVR cells. This case introduces the "Ping-pong" technique using a second guide catheter. When faced with difficulty in engaging the catheter through TAVR cells, an innovative solution is proposed. Inserting a wire into the valsalva and utilizing a rapid inflate-deflate balloon maneuver successfully facilitates catheter access into the left main, offering a promising intervention for challenging scenarios. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the severe implications of coronary obstruction during TAVR. The innovative "Ping-pong" technique and rapid inflate-deflate balloons emerge as valuable interventions, showcasing their potential in challenging catheter engagement scenarios. These insights offer a promising avenue for enhancing patient outcomes in TAVR procedures.
