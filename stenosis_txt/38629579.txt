Title: Postnatal outcome following fetal aortic valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of fetal aortic valvuloplasty (FAV) for critical aortic stenosis (AS), with a focus on the postnatal evolution of the patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study including all fetuses with critical AS which underwent FAV in a single center between January 2011 and June 2022. FAV was performed under ultrasound guidance. Technical success was based upon balloon inflation across the aortic valve and improvement of the antegrade aortic flow across the aortic valve. At birth, a biventricular circulation (BVC) strategy was decided assuming the left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function would ensure the systemic circulation.
RESULTS: Sixty-three FAV procedures were performed in 58 fetuses, at a median (range) gestational age of 26.2 (20.3-32.2) weeks. The procedure was technically successful in 50/58 (86.2%) fetuses. There were 11/58 (19.0%) cases of in-utero demise and 9/58 (15.5%) terminations of pregnancy. No patient was liveborn after an unsuccessful procedure. Thirty-eight (65.5%) infants were liveborn, at a median (range) gestational age of 38.1 (29.0-40.6) weeks, of whom 21 (55.3%) required prostaglandin treatment. Twenty-eight of the 38 (73.7%) liveborn children (48.3% of the study population) entered the BVC pathway at birth. Among them, 20 (71.4%) required an aortic valvuloplasty procedure at birth (11 (55.0%) percutaneous balloon, nine (45.0%) surgical) and eight (28.6%) did not require any treatment at birth, but, of these, five (62.5%) underwent surgical valvuloplasty between day 26 and day 1200 of age. Eleven (39.3%) of the infants with BVC at birth required a second intervention and four (14.3%) of them required a third intervention. Two (7.1%) infants who entered the BVC pathway at birth underwent conversion to univentricular circulation (UVC). None of the surviving children with BVC developed pulmonary hypertension. The overall survival rate in those with BVC at birth was 22/28 (78.6%) at a median (range) follow-up of 23.3 (2.0-112.6) months. Ten of the 58 (17.2%) patients had UVC at birth. Among these, six (60.0%) received compassionate care from birth and four (40.0%) underwent surgery. Three of the 10 patients who had UVC at birth were still alive at the latest follow-up assessment, at a median (range) gestational age of 24.3 (8.3-48.7) months.
CONCLUSIONS: FAV for critical AS led to increase of antegrade aortic flow in 86.2% of fetuses, with BVC being achieved in 48.3% (73.7% of the liveborn cases). Among patients with BVC at birth, the rate of reintervention was high, but 78.6% of these children were alive at the latest evaluation. © 2024 The Authors.
