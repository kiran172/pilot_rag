Title: Clinical implications of Sokolow-Lyon voltage less than 3.5 mV in patients who have undergone transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Degenerative severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is increasingly prevalent in the aging population, leading to the adoption of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as a less invasive alternative. While TAVR indications have expanded, the procedure is associated with a substantial incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The study aims to establish a preoperative risk-stratification system for TAVR candidates based on Sokolow-Lyon voltage (SLV) and other relevant factors.
METHODS: A total of 181 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline characteristics, preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography findings, and TAVR procedures were assessed. Low SLV (<3.5 mV) was defined based on ECG measurements.
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics revealed a mean age of 84 years, with 71.8% females. The two-year incidence of MACE defined as a composite of cardiac death and hospitalization due to heart failure, was 11.6%, significantly higher in the low SLV group. Low SLV emerged as an independent prognostic factor. The Tokyo Bay Risk (TBR) Score, including low SLV, Body Mass Index &lt;18.5 kg/m2, and previous coronary artery disease, effectively stratified MACE risk. Higher TBR scores (2 or 3) correlated with increased MACE risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low SLV in pre-procedural ECG demonstrated a heightened risk of two-year MACE. The TBR score, incorporating low SLV, proved valuable for preoperative risk assessment. Careful consideration of TAVR indications, along with TBR score integration, is crucial for optimizing outcomes.
