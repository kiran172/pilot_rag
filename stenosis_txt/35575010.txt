Title: Relationship Between Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio and Drug-Coated Balloon Restenosis in Patients With Femoropopliteal Arterial Disease.

Abstract: We investigated the relationship between neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and restenosis in patients with femoropopliteal arterial disease following drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty. Patients (n = 120) were divided into 3 groups according to the development of restenosis and the time of restenosis occurrence. The postoperative NLR was higher in the late-restenosis group than that in the no-restenosis group (3.53 vs 2.70; p = .011). In multivariate logistic analysis, postoperative NLR was an independent predictor of late restenosis (odds ratio: 1.404, 95% confidence interval: 1.073-1.839; p = .014). The postoperative NLR cutoff value for predicting late restenosis was 2.78 with a sensitivity of 80.8% and a specificity of 53.2% (area under the ROC curve was .666 (95% CI: .541-.791, p = .010). The incidence of late restenosis in the NLR â‰¥2.78 group was higher than that in the NLR &lt;2.78 group (32.3 vs 9.1%; p = .002). Postoperative NLR is independently associated with late restenosis in patients treated with DCB for femoropopliteal arterial disease.
