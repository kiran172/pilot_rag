Title: Temporary Tracheal Stenting After Pulmonary Artery Sling Repair in a Newborn.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery sling (PAS) is a rare disease frequently associated with severe malacia and stenosis of the trachea. We present a two-day-old newborn that underwent urgent surgery for PAS and needed prolonged respiratory support afterward. Temporary airway stenting above the level of the tracheal bifurcation was performed five days after surgery to overcome severe airway obstruction caused by tracheomalacia and laceration of the tracheal mucosa after diagnostic bronchoscopy. Two days after the procedure, the child could be extubated and after two weeks the stent was removed without complications. Temporary tracheal stenting after PAS repair can be an effective therapeutic strategy in newborns with tracheal obstruction and allows timely weaning from ventilator support.
