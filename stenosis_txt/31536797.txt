Title: Experience with Eversion Endarterectomy of the Common Femoral Artery with Comparison to Standard Endarterectomy with Patch.

Abstract: In this retrospective study, we review the outcome of femoral eversion endarterectomy (EE) and standard endarterectomy with patch angioplasty (SEP) over a 10-year period. EE technique involves transection of common femoral artery (CFA), eversion endarterectomy of the distal CFA, and primary end-to-end reconstruction. One hundred forty-two patients underwent femoral endarterectomy, among which 38 (26.8%) endarterectomies were performed using the eversion technique. The cumulative 2-year primary patency of EE with or without a concurrent procedure was greater than 86% and did not statistically differ from SEP. EE is a feasible technique when the use of a patch needs to be avoided.
