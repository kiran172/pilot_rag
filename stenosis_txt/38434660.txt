Title: Case Report: Multiple atherosclerotic plaques at its extreme in synchrony.

Abstract: Peripheral artery (PAD) disease in association with renal artery stenosis is an important association which predicts the severity of the disease. An increase in the number of vessels affected by peripheral artery disease increases the chances of renal artery stenosis. In our case, the patient had primarily presented with anginal chest pain with complaints of claudication which on further investigation was diagnosed to be a triple vessel coronary artery disease along with bilateral subclavian and bilateral renal stenosis. On detailed history taking, risk factors like hypertension and chronic smoking was found to be present in our case which predisposed to peripheral artery disease secondary to atherosclerosis which was diagnosed on further investigations. Although the association of renal artery stenosis is not very rare in cases of severe peripheral vascular diseases, the presence of a triple vessel coronary artery disease in synchrony is what makes it unique. Take away lesson from this case report is importance of early diagnosis of dyslipidemia causing atherosclerosis and its complications. Multiple atherosclerotic lesions in synchrony i.e, bilateral renal artery stenosis with bilateral subclavian artery stenosis with coronary artery triple vessel atherosclerotic disease like in our case and its severity should create awareness among health care individuals and early treatment measures including lifestyle modifications should be considered to avoid such drastic events.
