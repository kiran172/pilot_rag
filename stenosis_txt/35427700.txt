Title: Percutaneous plug-based vascular closure device in 1000 consecutive transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arterial access-site related complications constitute a large proportion of adverse events related to cardiac interventions requiring large-bore devices and have significant implications on morbidity, mortality and hospital cost.
AIMS: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel percutaneous plug-based vascular closure device (VCD) in 1000 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: A single-center observational study evaluating a plug-based VCD (MANTA, Teleflex/Essential Medical Inc., Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA) in patients undergoing TAVI at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The primary outcome was VCD-related major vascular complication according to the criteria of the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2.
RESULTS: From May 2017 to September 2020 a total of 1000 consecutive patients underwent transfemoral TAVI with arterial access-site management using the MANTA VCD. VARC-2 major vascular complications occurred in 42 (4.2%) patients: 17 (1.7%) patients intraoperatively received a covered stent, 17 (1.7%) patients underwent surgical repair during hospital stay, 3 (0.3%) patients underwent vascular surgery after discharge, 3 (0.3%) patients had major bleeding and 2 (0.2%) patients had symptoms of claudication with conservative treatment. No significant differences in major complications were seen between individual interventionists irrespective of experience with the device. A larger sheath outer diameter to femoral artery inner diameter ratio was the only factor associated with a significant increase of VCD-related major vascular complications.
CONCLUSION: This largest ever real-world evaluation of MANTA for large-bore arteriotomy closure in transfemoral TAVI patients indicates effective and safe arterial access-site management with low complication rates and short learning curve.
