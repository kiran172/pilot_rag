Title: Imaging findings of en bloc simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation.

Abstract: Simultaneous liver-kidney transplantations (SLKTs) are increasing in incidence, and the en bloc surgical approach is associated with a unique spectrum of vascular complications. En bloc SLKTs have a common arterial supply from the celiac axis and post-operative assessment with Doppler ultrasound can help to localize vascular lesions as either proximal in the shared arterial supply or distal in the organ-specific arteries. Venous complications predominantly include thrombosis or stenosis of the portal vein, hepatic veins, renal vein, or IVC, but have a much lower incidence. Radiologists familiar with the post-operative anatomy and complications can provide meaningful and accurate assessment to help direct clinical care. The purpose of this article is to provide a targeted review of SLKT, review the post-surgical anatomy associated with en bloc SLKT, and review the imaging evaluation of vascular complications associated with SLKT.
