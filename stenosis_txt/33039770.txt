Title: Unusual Pattern of Arterial Macrothrombosis Causing Stroke in a Young Adult Recovered from COVID-19.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to grow all over the world. Neurological manifestations related to COVID-19, including acute ischemic Stroke (AIS), have been reported in recent studies. In most of these, the patients are older, have multiple co-morbidities as risk factors for AIS and have developed a severe respiratory illness. Herein, we report a 36-year-old man with no significant past medical history who recently recovered from a mild COVID-19 infection and presented with unusual pattern of arterial macrothrombosis causing AIS. When the AIS happened, he had no COVID-19 related symptoms, had two negative screening tests for the infection and his chest CT was unremarkable.
