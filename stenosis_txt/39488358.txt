Title: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Tracheobronchial Disease.

Abstract: A variety of thoracic imaging modalities and techniques have been used to evaluate diseases of the trachea and central bronchi. This document evaluates evidence for the use of thoracic imaging in the evaluation of tracheobronchial disease, including clinically suspected tracheal or bronchial stenosis, tracheomalacia or bronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis. Appropriateness guidelines for initial imaging evaluation of tracheobronchial disease and for pretreatment planning or posttreatment evaluation are included. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.
