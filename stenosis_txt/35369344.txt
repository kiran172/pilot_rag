Title: Trends and Outcomes of Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Diabetes in the US.

Abstract: AIMS: We aimed to assess the trend and outcome of aortic valve replacement in patients with diabetes.
BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with higher cardiovascular events.
METHODS: Data from the National Inpatient Sample was analyzed between 2012 and 2017. We compared hospitalizations and in-hospital cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes to those without diabetes, hospitalized for aortic valve replacement.
RESULTS: In diabetes patients undergoing TAVR, the mean age of participants decreased from 79.6 ± 8 to 67.8 ± 8, hospitalizations increased from 0.97 to 7.68/100,000 US adults (p &lt; 0.002 for both). There was a significant temporal decrease in mortality, acute renal failure (ARF), and stroke. Compared to non-diabetic patients, those with diabetes had a higher risk of stroke, ARF, and pacemaker requirement [adjusted OR = 1.174 (1.03-1.34), 1.294 (1.24-1.35), 1.153 (1.11-1.20), respectively], but a similar adjusted mortality risk. In diabetes patients undergoing sAVR, the mean age of participants decreased from 70.4 ± 10 to 68 ± 9 (p &lt; 0.001), hospitalizations dropped from 7.72 to 6.63/100,000 US adults (p = 0.025), so did mortality, bleeding, and ARF. When compared to non-diabetes patients, those with diabetes were older and had a higher adjusted risk of mortality, stroke, and ARF [adjusted OR= 1.115 (1.06-1.17), 1.140 (1.05-1.23), 1.217 (1.18-1.26); respectively].
CONCLUSION: The recent temporal trend of aortic valve replacement in patients with diabetes shows a significant increase in TAVR coupled with a decrease in sAVR. Mortality and other cardiovascular outcomes decreased in both techniques. sAVR, but not TAVR, was associated with higher in-hospital mortality risk.
