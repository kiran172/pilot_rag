Title: Outcomes of Right and Left Hepatic Arterial Anastomosis in Right Lobe Living Donor Liver Transplant.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Living donor liver transplant is a complex surgery with well-known complications. Here, we report the use of the right and left hepatic arteries of the recipient for anastomosis and the effects of each procedure on overall outcomes and any associated short-term or long-term biliary complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study with long-term follow-up of 200 patients (100 in the right hepatic artery group and 100 in the left hepatic artery group).
RESULTS: The average donor age was 28.9 years in the left hepatic artery group and 30.9 years in the right hepatic artery group. Most of the donors (60%) were female. Overall, there was 10.5% mortality in the early postoperative period. Among survivors, there were more late strictures in the right hepatic artery group (29.7% vs 22.7%). Bile leak (P = .42), mortality (P = .71), and incidence of late-onset biliary strictures (P = .83) were less common in the left hepatic artery group.
CONCLUSIONS: Left artery anastomosis was found to be technically safe and feasible and did not adversely affect patient outcome compared with right artery anastomosis. Left hepatic artery anastomosis may also reduce the incidence of the biliary complications compared with the right hepatic artery anastomosis.
