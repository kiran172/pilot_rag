Title: Association of Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 Promoter Variants, Their Serum Levels, and Activities with Aortic Valve Calcification (AVC) in a Population from Western Iran.

Abstract: Background: Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzyme gene polymorphisms MMP-2-1575G/A and MMP-9-1562C/T promoter polymorphism, their serum levels, and activity are associated with aortic valve calcification (AVC). Materials and Methods: The synergistic link between the risk of AVC and the alleles T and A of MMP-9 and MMP-2 was investigated, respectively. Ninety-two cases with AVC and 92 healthy individuals from the west of Iran were included, and MMP- 2-1575G/A and MMP-9-1562C/T promoter polymorphisms were detected using PCR-RFLP. The serum levels and activity of MMP-2 and -9 were assessed using ELISA and gelatin zymography methods, respectively. In addition, serum biochemical markers, including FBS, urea and creatinine, cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, calcium, phosphorus, and blood pressure: systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were measured. Results: Heart valve calcification disease was associated with a comparatively higher frequency of the A allele of the MMP2-1575 variation (p = 0.002). In addition, the frequency of T allele of the MMP9-1562 variant was higher than the control group (p = 0.007). Conclusion: MMP-2 and MMP-9 serum levels and activities were observed to be considerably higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Patients are more susceptible to cardiovascular disease than the control group due to elevated serum levels and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
