Title: Multiomics identification of ALDH9A1 as a crucial immunoregulatory molecule involved in calcific aortic valve disease.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction and immune cell infiltration play crucial yet incompletely understood roles in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). This study aimed to identify immune-related mitochondrial genes critical to the pathological process of CAVD using multiomics approaches. The CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to evaluate immune cell infiltration characteristics in CAVD patients. An integrative analysis combining weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), machine learning, and summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) was performed to identify key mitochondrial genes implicated in CAVD. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was also performed to assess the relationships between key mitochondrial genes and infiltrating immune cells. Compared with those in normal aortic valve tissue, an increased proportion of M0 macrophages and resting memory CD4 T cells, along with a decreased proportion of plasma cells and activated dendritic cells, were observed in CAVD patients. Additionally, eight key mitochondrial genes associated with CAVD, including PDK4, LDHB, SLC25A36, ALDH9A1, ECHDC2, AUH, ALDH2, and BNIP3, were identified through the integration of WGCNA and machine learning methods. Subsequent SMR analysis, incorporating multiomics data, such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), revealed a significant causal relationship between ALDH9A1 expression and a reduced risk of CAVD. Moreover, ALDH9A1 expression was inversely correlated with M0 macrophages and positively correlated with M2 macrophages. These findings suggest that increased ALDH9A1 expression is significantly associated with a reduced risk of CAVD and that it may exert its protective effects by modulating mitochondrial function and immune cell infiltration. Specifically, ALDH9A1 may contribute to the shift from M0 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, potentially mitigating the pathological progression of CAVD. In conclusion, ALDH9A1 represents a promising molecular target for the diagnosis and treatment of CAVD. However, further validation through in vivo and n vitro studies is necessary to confirm its role in CAVD pathogenesis and therapeutic potential.
