Title: Prevalence and Risk Factors of Renal Artery Stenosis in Patients Undergoing Simultaneous Coronary and Renal Artery Angiography: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 31,689 Patients from 31 Studies.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), exacerbation of arterial hypertension, and progression to heart failure, but remains frequently unrecognized in clinical practice. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies by pooling data of patients undergoing CAG due to suspected or stable CAD that received a bilateral renal artery angiography. Results: A total of 31 studies with 31,689 patients were included (mean age 63.2 Â± 8.7 years, 20.9% were female). Overall, 13.4% (95%CI 10.5-16.7%) of patients undergoing coronary angiography had significant RAS, with 6.5% (95% CI 4.5-8.9%) and 3.7% (95%CI 2.5-5.2%) having severe and bilateral RAS. The mean weighted proportion of patients with three-vessel coronary disease (3VD) was 25.1 (95%CI 19.6-30.9%) while 4.2% (95%CI 2.6-6.2%) had left main (LM) coronary disease. Patients with RAS compared to those without RAS were significantly older (mean difference, MD 4.2 years (95%CI 3.8-4.6)). The relative risk of RAS was greater for the female sex (risk ratio, 95%CI; RR 1.3, 1.03-1.57), presence of diabetes (RR 1.2, 1.10-1.36), arterial hypertension (RR 1.3, 1.21-1.46), dyslipidemia (RR 1.1, 1.06-1.14), peripheral artery disease (PAD) (RR 2.1, 1.40-3.16), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR 2.6, 2.04-3.37), 3VD (RR 1.6, 1.30-1.87), and LM disease (RR 1.8, 1.28-2.47). Smoking had a neutral effect on the risk of RAS occurrence (RR 1.0, 0.94-1.06). Conclusions: RAS is common in patients undergoing coronary angiography. CKD, PAD, older age, and severe CAD were among the strongest predictors for the presence of significant RAS.
