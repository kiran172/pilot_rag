Title: A Study of the Clinical Profile and Management of Children With Anorectal Malformations.

Abstract: Introduction The diagnosis of anorectal malformations (ARMs) antenatally is rare, and most of these cases are diagnosed in the neonatal period. The defects range from easily treated minor anomalies with good prognosis to those that are difficult and complex. The associated anomalies in these malformations are important determinants for the prognosis and outcome of these cases. Material and methods  The present study was carried out in the department of pediatric surgery in a tertiary care institute. Patients presenting with ARMs in the neonatal period, those reported for definitive surgery, and patients for colostomy closure surgery were included. Patients who died before surgical treatment were excluded from the study. Convenience sampling of 100 patients who met the inclusion criteria was performed until the sample size was reached. Results Out of 63 cases of high variety, 84.12% were males and 15.87% were females. Out of 37 patients of low variety, 43.24% were males and 56.75% were females. The anomalies of the urogenital system were present in 22 (34.92%) out of 63 cases of high ARMs and 10 (27.02%) out of 37 cases of low ARMs. In the male patients, anocutaneous fistula was in 16 (23.18%) of cases. Out of 31 females in the present study, anorectal agenesis with anovestibular fistula was seen in 19 (61.29%) cases. In the early complications, significant bleeding and urethral injury were seen in one (2.63%) patient each. However, among the late complications, anal stenosis, mucosal prolapse, and wound infection were seen in seven (18.42%), five (13.15%), and four (10.52%) patients, respectively. Conclusion  A holistic approach to the management of ARMs is needed with a long-term goal of achieving urinary and fecal continence with good quality of life. The outcome of surgery is dependent on the specific type of malformation, but the results are better when intervention is done early.
