Title: Indications and Outcome of Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA): A Single Centre Experience.

Abstract: Background Stroke is a prevalent ailment that impacts a substantial number of individuals globally, resulting in both physical impairment and mortality. One of its major causes is carotid artery stenosis. The symptoms and degree of stenosis are key indications for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). In this study, we highlight the indications and outcomes of carotid endarterectomy in our center. Methods This is a descriptive, retrospective, observational study. Data of patients who underwent CEA at Glan Clwyd Hospital from January 2018 to January 2023 was retrieved. The study sample consisted of patients diagnosed with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis who had CEA at Glan Clwyd Hospital. The data was analyzed using statistical software SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Results A total of 150 patients were enrolled in the study. A majority of the patients were male, accounting for 69.3% (n = 104), and had a mean age of 71.1 ± 9.9 standard deviation. A majority of the patients were smokers (48.7%) and had additional medical conditions, including hypertension (34%), ischemic heart disease (17.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (73.3%), and diabetes (46.7%). Nevertheless, the remaining comorbidities were less common. The outcome of the CEA among the patients was cardiac event 3.3% (n = 5); transient ischemic attack (TIA) 3.3% (n = 5); stroke 0.6% (n = 1); hemorrhage 2.6% (n = 4); surgical site infection 2% (n = 3); perioperative mortality 1.3% (n = 2); and cranial nerve injury 1.3% (n = 2). However, no complications were reported in most of the patients, 85.6% (n = 128). Conclusion An endarterectomy is quite advantageous for treating symptomatic stenosis. The findings can be applied to patients who are physically suitable for surgery. The efficacy of endarterectomy is contingent upon not only the severity of carotid stenosis but also various other parameters, such as the time elapsed between the presenting event and the surgical intervention, as well as the patient's overall medical condition. However, the CEA is the gold standard in surgical management for symptomatic carotid disease.
