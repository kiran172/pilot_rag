Title: Effects of catheter-based renal denervation in hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several sham-controlled trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) with mixed outcomes.
AIM: To perform a comprehensive meta-analysis of all randomized, sham-controlled trials investigating RDN with first- and second-generation devices in hypertension.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane Library for eligible trials. Outcomes included both efficacy (24-hour and office systolic [SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) and safety (all-cause death, vascular complication, renal artery stenosis >70%, hypertensive crisis) of RDN. We performed a study-level, pairwise, random-effects meta-analysis of the summary data.
RESULTS: Ten trials comprising 2,478 patients with hypertension while being either off- or on-treatment were included. Compared with sham, RDN reduced 24-hour and office systolic BP by 4.4 mmHg (95%CI -6.1, -2.7, p<0.00001) and 6.6 mmHg (95%CI -9.7, -3.6, p<0.0001), respectively. The 24-hour and office diastolic BP paralleled these findings (-2.6 mmHg, 95%CI - 3.6, -1.5, p<0.00001; -3.5 mmHg, 95%CI -5.4, -1.6, p=0.0003). There was no difference in 24-hour and office SBP reduction between trials with and without concomitant antihypertensive medication (p for interaction 0.62 and 0.73, respectively). There was no relevant difference concerning vascular complications (OR 1.69, 95%CI 0.57-5.0, p=0.34), renal artery stenosis (OR 1.50, 95%CI 0.06-36.97, p=0.80), hypertensive crisis (OR 0.65, 95%CI 0.30-1.38, p=0.26) and all-cause death (OR 1.76, 95%CI 0.34-9.20, p=0.50) between RDN and sham groups. Change of renal function based on eGFR was comparable between groups (p for interaction 0.84). There was significant heterogeneity between trials.
CONCLUSIONS: RDN safely reduces ambulatory and office SBP/DBP vs. a sham procedure in the presence and absence of antihypertensive medication.
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE: What is new?Several sham-controlled trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) with mixed outcomes.This comprehensive meta-analysis comprising 2,478 patients shows that irrespective of the utilized method (radiofrequency-, ultrasound-or alcohol-mediated), renal denervation effectively reduced ambulatory and office systolic blood pressure.Renal denervation exhibited no additional risk concerning vascular injury or renal function impairment.What are the clinical implications?This meta-analysis supports current guidelines/consensus statements that renal denervation represents an additive treatment option in carefully selected patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
