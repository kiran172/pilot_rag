Title: Fatal mitral stenosis secondary to massive mitral annular calcium.

Abstract: Described herein are two patients who developed fatal acute heart failure due to mitral stenosis (MS) secondary to massive mitral annular calcium (MAC). This mechanism causing MS is rather unusual, but, nevertheless, it is probably the most common cause of MS today in Native Americans. Operative intervention for MS secondary to MAC is, as shown previously, hazardous and too frequently fatal.
