Title: Associations of Circulating microRNA-221 and 222 With the Severity of Coronary Artery Lesions in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients.

Abstract: Circulating levels of microRNA-221 and 222 (miR-221/222) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are elevated, yet the relationship between circulating miR-221/222 and the severity of coronary lesions in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains unknown. In this study, the relative expression levels of circulating miR-221/222 in patients with ACS (n = 267) and controls (n = 71) were compared by real-time fluorescence quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The ACS group was further divided into unstable angina pectoris (UA) group (n = 191) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) group (n = 76). Significant upregulation of circulating miR-221/222 was observed in ACS. A positive linear correlation between circulating miR-221/222 and Gensini scores was demonstrated. The area under the curve (AUC) of circulating miR-221/222 in the diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis ≥50% was 0.605 and 0.643, respectively. The circulating miRNA-221/222 expression levels in ACS patients were elevated and positively associated with the severity of the coronary artery lesions. Circulating miR-221/222 may be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis ≥50% and the occurrence of ACS.
