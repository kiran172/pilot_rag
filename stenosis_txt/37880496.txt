Title: Restoration of flow in the aorta: a novel therapeutic target in aortic valve intervention.

Abstract: Aortic blood flow patterns are closely linked to the morphology and function of the left ventricle, aortic valve and aorta. These flow patterns demonstrate the exceptional adaptability of the cardiovascular system to maintain blood circulation under a broad range of haemodynamic workloads and can be altered in various pathophysiological states. For instance, normal ascending aortic systolic flow is predominantly laminar, whereas abnormal aortic systolic flow is associated with increased eccentricity, vorticity and flow reversal. These flow abnormalities result in reduced aortic conduit function and increased energy loss in the cardiovascular system. Emerging evidence details the association of these flow patterns with loss of aortic compliance, which leads to adverse left ventricular remodelling, poor tissue perfusion, and an increased risk of morbidity and death. In this Perspective article, we review the evidence for the link between aortic flow-related abnormalities and cardiovascular disease and how these changes in aortic flow patterns are emerging as a therapeutic target for aortic valve intervention in first-in-human studies.
