Title: A new modified Duckett urethroplasty for repair of proximal hypospadias with severe chordee: outcomes of 133 patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite the continuous development and evolution of surgical methods and techniques, proximal hypospadias remains one of the most challenging issues for pediatric urologists. This study aims to evaluate the indications and postoperative complications of our new modified Duckett urethroplasty.
METHODS: A total of 133 patients with proximal hypospadias who underwent repair of the modified Duckett urethroplasty from February 2016 to February 2021 were reviewed. The median age of patients was 3 years (range 1-16). All patients had severe chordee. One senior experienced pediatric urologist performed all the surgeries. Catheter was removed 14 days after the surgery.
RESULTS: The location of the urethral meatus was proximal penile in 26 patients (19.5%), penoscrotal in 60 (45.1%), scrotal in 31 (23.3%), and perineal in 16 (12.0%). The mean length of the urethral defect was 4.5 cm (range 2.5-10). The median duration of follow-up was 46 months (range 8-67). Complications occurred in 31 patients (23.3%), including urethra-cutaneous fistula in 22 (16.5%), urethral stenosis in 7 (5.3%), and urethral diverticulum in 2 (1.5%). No recurrent chordee were found in all cases. All patients who developed complications were treated successfully at our hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: Our modified Duckett urethroplasty showed functionally and cosmetically favorable outcomes, with a lower incidence of postoperative complications. To the best of our knowledge, the novel Duckett technique is a feasible and suitable option for patients who suffer from proximal hypospadias with severe chordee and dysplasia of the urethral plate.
