Title: Anomalous Origin of the Right Pulmonary Artery From the Aorta and Congenital Tracheal Stenosis: Staged Repair in a Neonate.

Abstract: Anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta (AORPA), sometimes referred to as hemitruncus, is a rare malformation. We report a unique case of AORPA associated with Ebstein's anomaly and with congenital tracheal stenosis due to complete tracheal rings. The AORPA and tracheal stenosis were both successfully corrected in the neonatal period.
