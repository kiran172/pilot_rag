Title: Drug-coated balloon combined with drug-eluting stent for the treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions: insights from the HYPER study.

Abstract: True coronary bifurcation lesions (CBL) represent a challenging scenario for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), and are associated with a higher risk of target lesion failure (TLF), particularly when two stents are implanted. A hybrid strategy combining a drug-eluting stent (DES) in the main branch, and a drug-coated balloon in the side branch may improve outcomes by reducing the total stent length while maintaining an effective anti-prolipherative action. In this sub-study of the HYPER trial, 50 patients with true CBL were treated with a hybrid strategy: procedural success was 96%, one case of peri-procedural myocardial infarction and one case of TLF (in a DES-treated segment) at 1 year were reported. This study suggests that such a hybrid strategy may be a safe and effective option for true CBL PCI, and warrants additional investigations to compare outcomes with standard of care strategies.
