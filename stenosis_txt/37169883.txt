Title: Full-endoscopic technique mitigates obesity-related perioperative morbidity of minimally invasive lumbar decompression.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Obesity is associated with increased surgical complexity and postoperative complications in spine surgery. Minimally invasive procedures have been shown to lessen some of the increased risk in obese patients. This study investigated whether utilization of a working channel endoscope can further mitigate obesity-associated challenges in spinal surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a single-surgeon database was conducted for all adult patients undergoing full-endoscopic unilateral laminotomies for bilateral decompression between November 2015 and March 2021. Data collected included body mass index, in operating room preparation time, procedure time, length of hospital stay, use of analgesics, complications, and quality of life measured by Oswestry Disability Index.
RESULTS: Our cohort included 174 patients. Of these, 74 (42.5%) were obese. The average age was 63.6 years. In-operating room preparation time was 70.0 ± 1.7 min for obese patients and 64.4 ± 1.5 min for non-obese patients (p = 0.02). There was no difference in operative time, durotomy rates or other perioperative complications between obese and non-obese patients. Hospital length of stay trended toward longer in the obese group, but did not reach significance. A greater percentage of obese patients were still using both narcotic and non-narcotic pain medications 2 weeks after surgery. There was no significant difference in functional outcomes between groups.
CONCLUSION: Full-endoscopic unilateral laminotomies for bilateral decompression are safe and effective in both non-obese and obese patients. The use of an endoscope can partially mitigate obesity-related morbidity in lumbar decompression. However, obesity is significantly related to increased postoperative analgesic use.
