Title: WIfI classification: the Society for Vascular Surgery lower extremity threatened limb classification system, a literature review.

Abstract: The Society for Vascular Surgery has proposed a new classification system for the threatened lower limb, based on the three main factors that have an impact on limb amputation risk: Wound (W), Ischemia (I) and foot Infection ("fI") - the WIfI classification. The system also covers diabetic patients, previously excluded from the concept of critical limb ischemia because of their complex clinical condition. The classification's purpose is to provide accurate and early risk stratification for patients with threatened lower limbs; assisting with clinical management, enabling comparison of alternative therapies; and predicting risk of amputation at 1 year and the need for limb revascularization. The objective of this study is to collect together the main points about the WIfI classification that have been discussed in the scientific literature. Most of the studies conducted for validation of this classification system prove its association with factors related to limb salvage, such as amputation rates, amputation-free survival, prediction of reintervention, amputation, and stenosis (RAS) events, and wound healing.
