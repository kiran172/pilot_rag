Title: The Warden procedure for partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection in children: 10 years experience in 65 cases.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: In this study, we share our experience in the Warden procedure for the repair of partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections (PAPVCs) draining high in the superior caval vein in 65 cases of the paediatric age group over a period of 10 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 65 patients receiving the Warden procedure for the repair of high PAPVCs (draining above the cavoatrial junction) over a period of 10 years starting from January, 2010 to January, 2020 were included in this study.
RESULTS: In total, 34 were males (52.3%) and 31 were females (47.7%). The mean age was 3.47 ± 1.4 years, while the mean weight was 17.3 ± 5.3 kilograms. The mean bypass time was 84.2 ± 13.9 minutes and the mean cross clamp time was 54.8 ± 12.9 minutes. The mean intensive care unit stay was 2.14 ± 0.89 days, while the mean hospital stay was 5.9 ± 1.4 days. There was no in-hospital mortality or persistent sinus node dysfunction necessitating permanent pacemaker. In total, 62 patients (95%) could be followed up for a mean period of 7.8 ± 1.2 years after discharge. During the follow-up period, no stenosis was detected in the Warden anastomosis or the rerouted pulmonary veins and only one case of late mortality (1.6%) occurred due to a non-cardiac cause.
CONCLUSION: The Warden procedure is a safe approach for the repair of high PAPVCs (above the cavoatrial junction) in the paediatric age group with good long-term results and low incidence of complications like sinus node dysfunction as well as pulmonary vein and superior caval vein obstruction.
