Title: Correlation of plasma galectin-3 and plasma lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 with the severity and prognosis of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation of galectin-3 (Gal-3) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) with the severity of coronary artery disease and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
METHODS: 130 patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease (CHD) by coronary angiography from October 2018 to August 2019 in the Department of Cardiology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Hebei North University, were matched into the CHD group, with 68 cases in the mild stenosis (MS) group (degree of stenosis 50%~75%), and 62 cases in the severe stenosis (SS) group (degree of stenosis â‰¥75%). For comparison, patients with negative results of angiography during the same period (stenosis degree <50%) were assigned to the normal group. Indicators for detection included plasma Gal-3, Lp-PLA2 concentrations, Gensini scores, and MACE events in a 30-day follow-up visit.
RESULTS: Remarkably higher plasma Gal-3 and Lp-PLA2 concentrations in the CHD group were observed in comparison with the normal group. The SS group obtained a more positive result regarding plasma Gal-3 and Lp-PLA2 concentrations and Gensini scores than the MS group (P<0.05). The highest concentration of plasma Gal-3 and Lp-PLA2 was detected in the multi-vessel disease (MVD) group, followed by the double-vessel disease (DVD) group, and finally the single-vessel disease (SVD) group. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation of plasma Gal-3 and Lp-PLA2 concentrations with Gensini scores (P<0.05). Results of the follow-up visit presented strong relevance between noticeably higher concentrations of the plasma Gal-3 and Lp-PLA2 and MACE events (P<0.05). Increased Gal-3 and Lp-PLA2 are risk factors for the prognosis of coronary artery disease.
CONCLUSION: Plasma Gal-3 and Lp-PLA2 concentrations in patients with CHD are strongly related to the severity of coronary artery disease and MACE events, which is valuable for assessing the risk of patients in clinical practice.
