Title: Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar Foraminotomy for Juxta-Fusional Foraminal Stenosis.

Abstract: Adjacent segment foraminal stenosis is a significant adverse event of lumbar fusion. Conventional revision surgery with an extended fusion segment may result in considerable surgical morbidity owing to extensive tissue injury. Transforaminal endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy (TELF) is a minimally invasive surgical approach for symptomatic foraminal stenosis. This study aimed to demonstrate the surgical technique and clinical outcomes of TELF for the treatment of juxta-fusional foraminal stenosis. Full-scale foraminal decompression was performed via a transforaminal endoscopic approach under local anesthesia. A total of 22 consecutive patients who had undergone TELF were evaluated. The included patients had unilateral foraminal stenosis at the juxta-fusional level of the previous fusion surgery, intractable lumbar radicular pain despite at least six months of non-operative treatment, and verified pain focus by imaging and selective nerve root block. The visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores significantly improved after the two-year follow-up period. The modified MacNab criteria were excellent in six patients (27.27%), good in 12 (55.55%), fair in two (9.09%), and poor in two (9.09%), with a 90.91% symptomatic improvement rate. No significant surgical complications were observed. The minimally invasive TELF is effective for juxta-fusional foraminal stenosis.
