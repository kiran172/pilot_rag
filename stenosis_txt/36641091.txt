Title: Late Radiation-Induced Carotid Artery Stenosis and Stroke in Pediatric Patient Treated With Proton Radiation Therapy for Skull-Base Chordoma.

Abstract: Radiation vasculopathy is a well-recognized late complication of radiation therapy. We present a case of a stroke 29 years after high-dose proton radiation therapy for skull-base chordoma due to occlusion of bilateral internal carotid arteries.
