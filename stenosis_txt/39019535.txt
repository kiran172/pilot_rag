Title: Septal Ablation to Treat Subaortic Dynamic Obstruction Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Dynamic obstruction of the left ventricle is an unusual complication that can occur after aortic valve replacement. It is important to be aware of this pathology as it requires different management than normal complications and can rapidly lead to death. We present a case of successful resolution following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
