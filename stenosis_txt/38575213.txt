Title: Pathophysiology and Clinical Impact of Esophageal Remodeling and Fibrosis in Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

Abstract: Most of the major clinical signs and consequences of eosinophilic esophagitis seem to be related to tissue remodeling. Important data on remodeling activity in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis are provided by a range of current and new biologic markers and diagnostics. To completely clarify the possible advantages and restrictions of therapeutic approaches, clinical studies should take into consideration the existence and reversibility of esophageal remodeling. The degree of mucosal or submucosal disease activity may not be reflected by epithelial eosinophilic inflammation, which is used to define one criterion of disease activity".
