Title: Axillary transvalvular microaxial pump as extended bridge to transcatheter aortic valve replacement in cardiogenic shock with severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Cardiogenic shock in the setting of severe aortic stenosis is associated with poor outcomes. We describe 5 patients with cardiogenic shock and severe aortic stenosis who received an axillary microaxial pump (Impella) as an extended bridge to transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The median (range) age was 65 (61-87) years old, 80% were male, and 80% presented with stage D or E cardiogenic shock. In most cases, balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed prior to pump insertion. Stabilization by Impella allowed for heart team evaluation and additional interventions, including percutaneous coronary intervention, MitraClip, and cardioversion. After a median (range) of 7 (5-14) days of Impella support, semi-elective transcatheter aortic valve replacement was successfully performed. All patients survived to discharge. Four patients (80%) were alive beyond 1 year. In these high-risk patients, prolonged support with a microaxial pump allowed for stabilization, ancillary interventions, and multi-disciplinary heart team evaluation prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
