Title: The Relationship Between the Serum NLRP3 and Adiponectin Levels and Coronary Lesions in Patients with Unstable Angina with Type 2 Diabetes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the Levels of Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and Adiponectin (APN) and their relationship with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with Unstable Angina (UA) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).
METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one patients with UA were diagnosed by CAG in the Department of Cardiology of the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from July 2022 to May 2023 were included, and 74 healthy subjects were included as the control group. The levels of NLRP3 and APN in each group were detected by ELISA and the Gensini score in each patient according to the results of CAG. The correlations between NLRP3, APN, and Gensini score were analyzed. According to whether complicated with T2D or not, we further analyze the effect of NLRP3 and APN levels of patients with UA and T2D on the severity of coronary artery stenosis.
RESULTS: The levels of NLRP3 in UA with T2D group were the highest, followed by simple UA group, and the lowest in the control group, and the level of APN was the opposite. Spearman Correlation analysis showed that the level of NLRP3 was positively correlated with Gensini score (ρ<sub>1</sub>=0.688, P&lt;0.05) and the level of APN was negatively associated with Gensini score (ρ<sub>2</sub>= -0.515, P&lt;0.05). There was a negative correlation between NLRP3 and the level of APN (ρ<sub>3</sub>= -0.366, P&lt;0.05). High NLRP3 and low APN levels are the risk factors for atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSION: The NLRP3 and APN were abnormally expressed in patients with UA complicated with T2D. With the aggravation of atherosclerosis, the level of NLRP3 increased and the level of APN decreased.
