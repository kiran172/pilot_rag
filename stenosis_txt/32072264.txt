Title: Prognostic impact of cancer history in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The benefit of TAVI in cancer patients is currently unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to investigate prognostic impact of cancer status (active cancer or previous cancer) in severe aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: Consecutive TAVI patients in the Heart Center Bonn were enrolled and we stratified the patients into three groups: current cancer (active cancer), non-current cancer (previous cancer), or no cancer. The primary outcome was all-cause death within a 5-year follow-up. We evaluated mean aortic pressure gradient (mPG) values following TAVI (baseline mPG) and at the final follow-up (follow-up mPG).
RESULTS: In total, 1568 TAVI patients were eligible and 298 patients (19.0%) had active or previous cancer. At the 5-year follow-up, cancer patients had a significantly worse prognosis than non-cancer patients (log rank, P < 0.001). In a multivariable analysis, previous cancer was a significant predictor for 5-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; P < 0.001). Estimated mortality rates at 5-year follow-up rates among active cancer, previous cancer, and non-cancer were 84.0%, 65.8%, and 50.2% (long-rank P < 0.001), respectively. The hazard ratios of active cancer and previous cancer for 5-year mortality were 2.79 (P < 0.001) and 1.38 (P = 0.019) compared to non-cancer patients. We found significantly higher mPG during follow-up than at baseline in cancer patients (follow-up 8.10 vs baseline 7.40 mmHg; Wilcoxon P = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Active, and also previous, cancer status are associated with less beneficial long-term prognosis in TAVI patients.
