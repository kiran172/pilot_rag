Title: Comparative analysis of early postoperative results of transcatheter aortic valve implantation and surgical aortic valve replacement with a biological prosthesis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: . Aim: The choice of aortic valve stenosis correction method is determined by a number of clinical and technical parameters. The task was to compare early postoperative outcomes in patients after correction of aortic valve stenosis using TAVI and surgical aortic valve replacement with a biological prosthesis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of adult patients (18 years of age and older) who had transcatheter aortic valve implantation or surgical aortic valve replacement with a biological prosthesis at the State Institution "Heart Institute of the Ministry of Health" in the period from 2018 to 2022.
RESULTS: Results: In 47 (47.5%) cases, TAVI was performed and in 52 (52.5%) cases, SAVR with a biological prosthesis was performed. Patients who underwent TAVI were significantly older (p=0.002) and had a higher EuroSCORE II operative risk score (p<0.001). In patients with TAVI, larger diameter aortic valve prostheses were significantly more often used compared with the SAVR group with biological prosthesis (27.5±2.74 vs. 22.5±1.84, p<0.001). The early postoperative period in patients with TAVI was characterized by an 11.4% (p=0.046) and 15.4% (p=0.006). The length of stay in the ICU (p=0.024), as well as the duration of hospitalization in general (p=0.005), was also significantly lower in patients with TAVI compared with patients with biological prosthesis SAVR.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Despite the higher surgical risk of surgery according to EuroSCORE II, TAVI was characterized by a lower incidence of postoperative complications, with shorter duration of stay in ICU and hospitalization in general in comparison with patients undergoing SAVR with a biological prosthesis.
