Title: Nutritional risk index predicts the prognosis of gastric cancer patients with pyloric stenosis who received preoperative parenteral nutrition.

Abstract: Patients with gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis frequently have poor nutritional status and preoperative parenteral nutrition has been a common treatment strategy. The present study aimed to explore the predictive ability of the nutritional risk index (NRI) regarding the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer and pyloric stenosis who received preoperative parenteral nutrition. A total of 194 patients with gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis who received preoperative parenteral nutrition at Tthe Second People's Hospital of Neijiang (Neijiang, China) between January 2016 and December 2021 were included. At the same time, 221 patients with gastric cancer without pyloric stenosis who received surgery during the same period were also collected and the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients were compared. The optimal cut-off value of the NRI was determined from the receiver operating characteristic curve and prognostic factors were identified by survival analysis. Finally, a nomogram was constructed to predict the survival probability of patients with gastric cancer. The results indicated that patients with pyloric stenosis exhibited a wide range of unfavorable pathological characteristics and blood parameters. In addition, their overall survival (OS) was significantly worse (P<0.001). Among the patients with pyloric stenosis, there were 120 patients (61.9%) with an NRI <93.42 and 74 patients (38.1%) with NRI â‰¥93.42. Furthermore, patients with an NRI <93.42 had poorer OS (34.37 months vs. not reached, P=0.004). Of note, age, tumor size, radical resection, NRI and TNM stage were determined to be independent prognostic factors for OS. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.760 (95%CI: 0.688-0.832). In conclusion, the NRI was indicated to be an accurate score reflecting the nutritional status of patients, which was able to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with gastric cancer with pyloric stricture who received preoperative parenteral nutrition. Patients with a low NRI had shorter survival times.
