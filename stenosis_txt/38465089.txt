Title: Type 2 Myocardial Infarction Caused by Orthostatic Hypotension With Post-transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Case Report.

Abstract: This case report delineates the occurrence and management of type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) in an 89-year-old woman following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The patient, with a history of severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and colorectal cancer, presented with nausea and significant hypotension. Initial assessments revealed elevated troponin levels, atrial fibrillation, and ST-segment depression, leading to a diagnosis of type 2 MI. This condition was attributed to the interplay between left ventricular hypertrophy, hypotension-induced dehydration, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. The patient with post-TAVI exhibited dynamic changes in cardiac hemodynamics, with improvements in left ventricular function but persistent hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. This state, combined with hypotension due to diuretic-induced dehydration and atrial fibrillation, precipitated a mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand. The cessation of diuretics and initiation of rehydration therapy stabilized her condition, with subsequent normalization of troponin levels and blood pressure. This case highlights the complexity of managing type 2 MI in elderly patients post-TAVI. It underscores the importance of holistic consideration of both myocardial oxygen supply and demand factors, particularly in left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. The multifactorial nature of type 2 MI necessitates a tailored approach to diagnosis and management, emphasizing the need for comprehensive post-procedural care in patients undergoing TAVI.
