Title: Transition to Practice: Implementing Healthy Work Environment Standards through Nurse Resident-Led Evidence-based Practice Change in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Care on a Cardiac Telemetry Unit.

Abstract: Implementing healthy work environment standards helps to improve the care environment for nurses and patients. These standards were used as a framework during a nurse resident-led evidence-based practice project. The transcatheter aortic valve replacement team collaborated with the nurse residents throughout the evidence-based practice project to design a fast-track patient selection checklist and give input into a care protocol for their cardiac telemetry unit.
