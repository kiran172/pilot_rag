Title: Comparative study of myocardial perfusion and coronary flow velocity reserve derived from adenosine triphosphate stress myocardial contrast echocardiography in coronary lesions with no/mild stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Qualitative myocardial perfusion (QMP) derived from myocardial contrast echocardiography reflects the capillary flow, while coronary flow velocity reserve from Doppler spectrum (D-CFVR) of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is used to assess coronary microvascular function, particularly after excluding severe epicardial coronary stenosis. The present study aimed to assess the relationship of QMP and D-CFVR in detecting coronary microvascular disease (CMVD) by using adenosine triphosphate stress myocardial contrast echocardiography (ATP stress MCE).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-two patients (mean age: 54.22 ± 12.78 years) with chest pain and <50% coronary stenosis diagnosed by quantitative coronary angiography or dual-source CT underwent ATP stress MCE. The distribution of myocardial perfusion and CFVR value was estimated by experienced physicians. Of the 72 LAD with 0%-50% diameter stenosis, 15 (21%) exhibited abnormal CFVR and 31 (43%) displayed abnormal perfusion with ATP stress MCE. Eleven of the 15 LAD territories (73%) with abnormal CFVR values showed abnormal perfusion. However, CFVR was considered normal in 20 LAD territories (35%), despite the presence of perfusion defect in the territory.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal myocardial perfusion during ATP stress MCE was found in a sizable percentage of patients in whom CFVR of the supplying vessel was considered normal.
