Title: Penile skin lesions and urinary tract obstruction: A rare presentation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Abstract: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) can manifest in any organ or system, but the occurrence of cutaneous lesions on the penis, causing urethral stenosis, is particularly uncommon. The diagnosis primarily relies on typical clinical manifestations and pathological examination. Treatment involves the excision of local lesions combined with chemotherapy, with a generally favorable prognosis. A 3-year-old male patient experienced voiding difficulties after circumcision, revealing penile skin lesions upon examination. Postoperative pathological analysis and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of LCH. Langerhans cell histiocytosis can present as cutaneous lesions on the penis, leading to symptoms of urinary tract obstruction.
