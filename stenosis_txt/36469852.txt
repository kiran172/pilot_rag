Title: Optimal Measurement Sites of Coronary-Computed Tomography Angiography-derived Fractional Flow Reserve: The Insight From China CT-FFR Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the optimal measurement site of coronary-computed tomography angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR CT ) for the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the whole clinical routine practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included 396 CAD patients who underwent coronary-computed tomography angiography, FFR CT , and invasive FFR. FFR CT was measured at 1 cm (FFR CT -1 cm), 2 cm (FFR CT -2 cm), 3 cm (FFR CT -3 cm), and 4 cm (FFR CT -4 cm) distal to coronary stenosis, respectively. FFR CT and invasive FFR ≤0.80 were defined as lesion-specific ischemia. The diagnostic performance of FFR CT to detect ischemia was obtained using invasive FFR as the reference standard. Reduced invasive coronary angiography rate and revascularization efficiency were calculated. After a median follow-up of 35 months in 267 patients for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), Cox hazard proportional models were performed with FFR CT values at each measurement site.
RESULTS: For discriminating lesion-specific ischemia, the areas under the curve of FFR CT -1 cm (0.91) as well as FFR CT -2 cm (0.91) were higher than those of FFR CT -3 cm (0.89) and FFR CT -4 cm (0.88), respectively (all P <0.05). The higher reduced invasive coronary angiography rate (81.6%) was found at FFR CT -1 cm than FFR CT -2 cm (81.6% vs. 62.6%, P <0.05). Revascularization efficiency did not differ between FFR CT -1 cm and FFR CT -2 cm (80.8% vs. 65.5%, P =0.019). In 12.4% (33/267) MACE occurred and only values of FFR CT -2 cm were independently predictive of MACE (hazard ratio: 0.957 [95% CI: 0.925-0.989]; P =0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates FFR CT -2 cm is the optimal measurement site with superior diagnostic performance and independent prognostic role.
