Title: Characteristic computed tomographic myelography findings in 23 Thoroughbred horses.

Abstract: The purpose of this observational study was to determine the characteristic computed tomographic (CT) myelography findings of cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (CVSM) lesions in Thoroughbred horses. A total of 23 Thoroughbred horses (age range, 155-717 days on CT examination; mean, 410.9 days) were analyzed. All 23 Thoroughbred horses underwent unenhanced radiography, radiographic myelography, and CT myelography. Unenhanced radiographs were observed the presence of cervical vertebral malalignment and osseous lesions. Radiographic myelograms were observed for signs of cervical spinal cord compression; additionally, CT myelograms were used to detect cervical vertebral osseous lesions. Ventral compressions were frequently observed in the cranial cervical vertebrae (C2-C4), whereas dorsal compressions were frequently observed in the caudal cervical vertebrae (C5-C7). Furthermore, osseous lesions of the caudal articular process developed more frequently than those of the cranial articular process. CT myelography in Thoroughbred horses is a useful method for detecting CVSM changes.
