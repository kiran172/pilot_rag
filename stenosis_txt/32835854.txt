Title: Dose-Dependent Effect of Renin-Angiotensin System Blockade Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is growing body of evidence from retrospective studies that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade is associated with improved outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, it remains unknown whether the effect of RAS blockade is dose dependent. The current study sought to assess the dose-dependent effect of RAS blockade on survival and left-ventricular (LV) remodelling after TAVR.
METHODS: Patients who were enrolled into our observational TAVR study at our institution were retrospectively assessed according to different doses of RAS blockade: group 1 (no RAS blockade), group 2 (25% of maximum daily dose), group 3 (50% of maximum daily dose), and group 4 (full daily dose).
RESULTS: A total of 323 patients between January 2015 and September 2019 were included. Patients with higher doses of RAS blockade showed a trend toward higher overall survival at 3-year follow-up (56% with no RAS blockade vs 66% with the 25% dose vs 79% with the 50% dose vs 78% with the full dose; P = 0.063). After adjustment for baseline characteristics, the difference in survival was significant (P = 0.042). Besides New York Heart Association class and left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), RAS blockade dose was identified as independent predictor for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.97; P = 0.03). With respect to LV remodelling, a significantly larger reduction of LV mass index was observed during the follow-up with higher doses of RAS blockade.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that the impact of RAS blockade treatment on clinical outcome and LV remodelling after TAVR is dose dependent.
