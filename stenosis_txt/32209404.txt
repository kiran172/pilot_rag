Title: Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Endovascular Treatment: Long-term Results From a Single-Center Experience in an Unselected Patient Population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate early-, mid-, and long-term outcomes in an unselected population of patients treated for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with different commercially available off-the-shelf devices.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on a prospectively compiled computerized database on patients presenting an infrarenal AAA treated between January 2008 and December 2015 in a high-volume Italian tertiary referral Center. Demographic, clinical, and specific morphological features were considered as potentially influencing the outcomes and the type of the implanted device. Outcome measures were procedure-related reintervention, AAA-related, and all-cause mortality rates at 30-day, 12-month, and long-term follow-up. Reinterventions considered for the analysis were AAA rupture, graft infection, type I or III endoleaks, type II endoleaks with sac enlargement > 5 mm, graft stenosis or occlusions, procedures related to renal or visceral ischemia, and reintervention for access vessel injury.
RESULTS: Of 498 EVAR procedures performed for elective infrarenal AAA treatment during the entire study period, 479 patients were enrolled, the mean age was 73.5 ± 7.34 years (range 51-91), and 416 (86.84%) were men. The mean maximum AAA diameter was 52.02 ± 8.04 mm (range 39-90.2), a maximum AAA diameter ≥59 mm was recorded in 107 patients (22.33%), and an aortic neck length was <10 mm in 137 (28.60%). Technical success was achieved in all patients. At a mean follow-up of 52.97 ± 26.16 months (range 1-120), overall reintervention and death rates were 8.14% and 20.04%, respectively, without AAA-related deaths. At univariate analysis, hypertension was the only demographical variable found to be associated with higher risk of reintervention, P = 0.04 (OR: 2.34; CI 95%: 1.00-5.42). Furthermore, male sex (P = 0.02; OR: 2.62; CI 95%: 1.09-6.27) and chronic renal insufficiency (P = 0.003; OR: 2.08; CI 95%: 1.27-3.42) were associated with higher mortality rates. AAA diameter ≥59 mm was statistically associated with a higher rate of both reintervention and mortality: P < 0.001 (OR: 9.05; CI 95%: 4.52-18.11) and <0.001 (4.00; 2.46-6.49), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience seems to suggest that EVAR could be safely and effectively performed in an unselected patients' population, with encouraging results up to a ten-year follow-up.
