Title: Endarterectomy of carotid artery bifurcation in the setting of a persistent hypoglossal artery and anomalous collateral vascular supply.

Abstract: Presented is a patient with carotid artery stenosis resulting in crescendo anterior and posterior circulation transient ischemic attacks. Treatment was complicated by a rare persistent hypoglossal artery (HGA) arising from the left internal carotid artery in addition to severe contralateral carotid disease, hypoplastic vertebral arteries, and incomplete circle of Willis. A carotid endarterectomy with shunting was performed, maintaining perfusion of both the proper left internal carotid artery and HGA. This is a rare case of carotid stenosis in the setting of a persistent HGA with contralateral carotid disease and highlights the importance of planning intracranial perfusion before carotid surgery.
