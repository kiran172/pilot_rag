Title: Open Surgical Obliteration of Three Indirect Carotid-Cavernous Fistulas.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) are abnormal connections between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus (CS). CCFs are primarily treated by an endovascular route, but there are situations in which a lesion is not amenable to endovascular or transorbital treatment, necessitating a transcranial approach. In this select group of patients, the use of crushed temporalis muscle to pack the CS fistula site was found to be an effective method for treatment of CCFs.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION: In this case series, we present 3 patients with CCFs in which endovascular treatment was not possible because of occlusion of the petrosal sinuses or stenosis of the superior ophthalmic vein at the superior orbital fissure, rendering the lesion inaccessible by a transvenous or transorbital route. Each patient was treated with a variation of temporalis muscle packing through a skull base triangle; one was treated through the anteromedial triangle, one through the supratrochlear triangle, and the third through the Parkinson triangle. The fistulas were cured in each case.
CONCLUSION: Cavernous-carotid fistulas that are not amenable to endovascular or transorbital treatment can be successfully treated by packing the CS fistula site with crushed temporalis muscle. To cure these patients' symptoms and enhance their quality of life, it is crucial to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each therapy option.
