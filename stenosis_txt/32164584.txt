Title: Pulmonary endarteritis and endocarditis complicated with septic embolism: a case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary endarteritis is a rare clinical phenomenon with congenital heart that can potentially lead to major complications.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 47-year-old man with pulmonary endarteritis. This patient presented with hypertension, chest pain and a previous history of pulmonary valve disease during childhood. Also, eight-months prior, he was hospitalized with dyspnea (Functional Class III), cough, phlegm, and night sweats without fever. Echocardiographic diagnosis in the first transtransthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was intense pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) an, thus, the pulmonary valve vegetation and PVS, established by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). He was referred for surgery after 1â€‰weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy for removal of the vegetation.
CONCLUSIONS: Finally he was asymptomatic at 3-months of follow-up and was clinically in good condition. Therefore, the detection of infective endocarditis of the lung valve must not lengthy be prolonged.
