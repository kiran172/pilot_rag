Title: Impact of pre-existing right or left bundle branch block on patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Contemporary data on the prognostic impact of pre-existing left or right bundle branch block on clinical outcomes after aortic valve (AV) replacement are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre-existing bundle branch block on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing AV replacement.
METHODS: Data from patients who underwent AV replacement surgery between 2004 and 2020 were obtained from our departmental database.
RESULTS: Of the 2704 study patients, 203 (7.5%) had pre-existing bundle branch block and 2501 (92.5%) had normal atrioventricular conduction. The mean age was 68 (13) years, 1697 (63%) were male and 683 (25%) had a unicuspid or bicuspid AV. The in-hospital mortality rate was higher in patients with pre-existing bundle branch block compared to those without on admission (5.9% vs 2.9%, P = 0.032), and more frequent in patients with left compared with right bundle branch block (11.9% vs 4.3%, P = 0.003). New pacemaker implantation was most frequent in those patients with pre-existing left bundle branch block, followed by right and no bundle branch block on admission (28.6% vs 7.5% vs 2.8% respectively, P < 0.001; odds ratio 4.96 95% confidence interval 2.96-8.08, P < 0.001). The 10-year cumulative survival rate was lower in patients with bundle branch block compared with patients with no bundle branch block (76.8% vs 82.8%, log-rank P < 0.001; hazard ratio 0.73, confidence interval 0.54-0.99, P = 0.042).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that patients with pre-existing bundle branch block have a higher incidence of pacemaker implantation and all-cause mortality after AV replacement compared with patients without a conduction disturbance.
