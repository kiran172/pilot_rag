Title: Acute inferior occlusion myocardial infarction with a solitary ST-elevation in lead III: A case report.

Abstract: The ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) paradigm requires ST-segment elevation (STE) in contiguous leads on electrocardiography (ECG). STEMI criteria overlook numerous patients with acute coronary occlusion (ACO). The Aslanger pattern describes an ECG without contiguous STE, indicating acute inferior occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) with concomitant multi-vessel disease. We describe one case of inferior OMI with one STE in lead III on initial ECG; however acute inferior STEMI was later identified. Coronary angiography showed thrombosis in the proximal right coronary artery and severe stenosis in non-infarct-related arteries. Awareness of the limitations of current STEMI criteria is crucial for timely intervention.
