Title: Decreasing thickness and remodeling of ligamentum flavum after oblique lumbar interbody fusion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Ligamentum flavum is one of the structures that could compress the spinal canal. Few studies have reported atrophy of ligamentum flavum after spinal fusion. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the reduction of ligamentum flavum size after oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHOD: Seventeen patients who underwent OLIF without direct decompression were included. The MRI was obtained at the preoperative period, immediate postoperative period, and the follow-up period. Disc height (DH) was measured in plain radiograph. MRI measurements were spinal canal cross-sectional area (SCSA), ligamentum flavum thickness (LFT), ligamentum flavum area (LFA), and foraminal area (FA).
RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 68.5 ± 10.8. Mean times between postoperative MRI and follow-up MRI were 20.2 ± 11.9 months. Mean disc height increased from 7.6 ± 1.6 to 11.6 ± 1.7 mm at an immediate postoperative period but decreased to 10.1 ± 1.6 mm during follow-up (p &lt; 0.001). SCSA increased from 96.9 ± 54.9 to 136.0 ± 72.7 mm2 and 171.4 ± 76.10 mm2 during follow-up (p &lt; 0.001). LFT decreased from 3.9 ± 1.2 to 3.2 ± 0.8 mm (17.9%) and further decreased to 2.9 ± 0.7 mm during follow-up (9.4%) (p &lt; 0.001). LFA decreased from 97.4 ± 36.9 to 86.1 ± 36.9 mm2 (11.6%) and further decreased to 77.2 ± 32.5 mm2 during follow-up (10.3%) (p = 0.001). FA increased from 69.2 ± 26.6 to 96.1 ± 23.0 mm2 and increased to 112.9 ± 23.0 mm2 during follow-up (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: OLIF could decompress the spinal canal and foraminal canal indirectly. Despite the diminishing disc height during the follow-up period, the spinal canal was further increased in size from the remodeling of the ligamentum flavum.
