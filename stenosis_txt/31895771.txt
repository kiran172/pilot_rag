Title: Coronary sequelae of Kawasaki disease treated with rotational atherectomy and drug coated balloon: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis syndrome that mainly affects children and is the first cause of acquired heart disease. Coronary artery lesion is the most serious complication of KD. Only two previous studies have reported similar cases, but we reported patient was younger and had a longer follow-up.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a case of coronary sequelae of KD treated with rotational atherectomy and drug coated balloon (DCB). During the week after surgery, the patient complained of a slight chest pain intermittently, but no longer appeared after that.
DIAGNOSIS: We diagnosed by electrocardiogram and angiography. Angiography showed that the anterior descending branch (LAD) proximal stenosis was 95%, the right coronary artery (RCA) middle stenosis was 99%, and the calcification was severe.
INTERVENTIONS: We treat the patient with rotational atherectomy using a 1.25 mm burr, pre-dilatation of the stenosis lesion with a 3.5 mm × 15 mm non-compliant balloon was achieved. Then 3.5 mm × 15 mm drug eluting balloon was inflated at 10 atm for 60 seconds.
OUTCOMES: After the 6-month follow-up (from October 2018 to March 2019), the symptom of angina disappeared. Coronary angiography 6 months later showed no apparent progression of vessel narrowing.
CONCLUSION: The present case suggests that rotational atherectomy followed by DCB dilation could be an alternative revascularization therapy of choice in coronary KD sequelae complicated with atherosclerosis.
