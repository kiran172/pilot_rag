Title: [Sudden Chest Pain due to Early Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction:Report of a Case].

Abstract: We report a case of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction and acute aortic valve regurgitation. The case was a 75-year-old female who had sudden onset chest pain. ST-segment depression in several leads on electrocardiogram( ECG) suggested acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis in coronary arteries. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation, suggesting that angina was caused by myocardial ischemia associated with acute aortic regurgitation. She was diagnosed as having bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, and underwent redo aortic valve replacement. One leaflet of the bioprosthetic valve was torn along the stent post and caused bioprosthetic valve dysfunction. Failed bioprosthetic valve was removed and replaced by a mechanical valve.
