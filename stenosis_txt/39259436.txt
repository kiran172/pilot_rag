Title: Selective FFR<sub>CT</sub> testing in suspected stable angina in clinical practice - initial experiences.

Abstract: Coronary CT angiography (CTA) derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) is recommended for physiological assessment in intermediate coronary stenosis for guiding referral to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). In this study, we report real-world data on the feasibility of implementing a CTA/FFR<sub>CT</sub> test algorithm as a gatekeeper to ICA at referral hospitals. Retrospective all-comer study of patients with new onset stable symptoms and suspected coronary stenosis (30-89%) by CTA. Evaluation of CTA datasets, interpretation of FFR<sub>CT</sub> analysis, and decisions on downstream testing were performed by skilled CT-cardiologists. CTA was performed in 3974 patients, of whom 381 (10%) were referred directly to ICA, whereas 463 (12%) to non-invasive functional testing: FFR<sub>CT</sub> 375 (81%) and perfusion imaging 88 (19%). FFR<sub>CT</sub> analysis was rejected in 8 (2%) due to inadequate CTA image quality. Number of patients deferred from ICA after FFR<sub>CT</sub> was 267 (71%), while 100 (27%) were referred to ICA. Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) was confirmed in 62 (62%) patients and revascularization performed in 53 (53%). Revascularization rates, n (%), were higher in patients undergoing FFR<sub>CT</sub>-guided versus CTA-guided referral to ICA: 30-69% stenosis, 28 (44%) versus 8 (21%); 70-89% stenosis, 39 (69%) versus 25 (46%), respectively, both p &lt; 0.05. Implementation of FFR<sub>CT</sub> at referral hospitals was feasible, reduced the number of invasive procedures, and increased the revascularization rate.
