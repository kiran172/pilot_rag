Title: Atrioventricular Discordance with Double-Outlet Right Ventricle in Mirror Imagery and Levocardia: A Very Rare Case Report.

Abstract: A newborn without prenatal diagnosis, with bronchial and abdominal situs inversus in levocardia, was referred to our hospital for accurate evaluation; echocardiography showed venoatrial connections in mirror-image arrangement, atrioventricular (AV) discordance, and double-outlet right ventricle (DORV). Additional cardiac malformations were double upper caval district, atrial communication, subpulmonary interventricular communication, and moderate subvalvular and valvular pulmonary stenosis. Few days after birth, the patient presented low oxygen saturation and the heart team decided for a palliative surgery. We describe a very rare case in a newborn with bronchial-abdominal mirror imagery, AV discordance, and DORV in levocardia.
