Title: Hammock Mitral Valve Repair in Infancy: Operative Steps Toward a Customized Reconstruction After Preoperative Planning.

Abstract: Hammock mitral valve (MV) repair is historically technically difficult with a guarded prognosis. Surgical experience is extremely limited and variable outcomes are reported. The perioperative strategy and technical details of hammock MV repair in an infant who presented with severe mitral stenosis are described and review of the existing literature was undertaken.
