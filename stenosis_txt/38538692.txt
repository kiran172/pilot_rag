Title: Use of the Tubridge flow diverter in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms: a single center experience.

Abstract: To investigate the safety and effect of Tubridge flow diverter deployment for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, 85 patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with the Tubridge flow diverter were retrospectively enrolled. The clinical data including the baseline data, aneurysm parameters before and after treatment, and follow-up outcomes were assessed. Among 85 patients, there were 35 (41.2%) males and 50 females (58.8%) aged 17-77 (mean 56.7 ± 11.1) years with 110 aneurysms. Five (5.9%) patients initially presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage from aneurysm rupture. The aneurysm size was 2-30 (mean 8.6) mm, and the aneurysm neck was 2-10.6 (mean 5.7 ± 2.3) mm. Ninety-three Tubridge stents were deployed. Twenty-five (29.4%) patients experienced adjunctive loose coiling. Blood flow was significantly reduced from entering the aneurysm after stent deployment. Periprocedural complications occurred in three (3.5%) patients, including in-stent thrombosis during embolization in one patient (1.2%), conjunctiva edema on the right in one patient (1.2%), and acute multiple cerebral infarctions in one patient (1.2%). Angiographic follow-up was conducted in 67 (78.8%) patients 3-36 (mean 15.3 ± 5.6) months later. In 11 (16.4% or 11/67) patients, blood flow still entered the aneurysm with the O'Kelly-Marotta (OKM) grade B in two (3.0%) patients and grade C in nine (13.4%), whereas complete occlusion (OKM grade D) was achieved in the other 56 (83.6% or 56/67) aneurysms. In-stent stenosis was present in five (7.5%) patients with approximately 25% stenosis in three (4.5%) patients and 50% in two (3.0%). In conclusion, the Tubridge flow diverter can be safely and efficiently applied in the treatment of small and large intracranial aneurysms, with a low periprocedural complication rate, a high occlusion degree, and a low in-stent stenosis rate at follow-up even though large aneurysms may necessitate a longer surgical time and adjunctive coiling.
