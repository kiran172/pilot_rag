Title: Middle Ear Implant in a Patient With Fibrous Dysplasia: An Alternative for Hearing Restoration.

Abstract: We propose middle ear implants (MEI) as alternative hearing restoration option for patients with fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone (FDTB). A 60-year-old man presented with unilateral right-sided conductive hearing loss (CHL) and FDTB. The Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) MEI was implanted in the right ear. Preoperatively, the right side had a pure tone average (PTA) threshold of 67 dB, speech reception threshold (SRT) = 75 dB HL, and speech discrimination score (SDS) = 54% at 80 dB HL presentation level. Postoperative aided PTA threshold of the right ear was 28 db, aided SRT = 30 db, and SDS = 96% at 65dB HL. After excluding cholesteatoma, VSB provides an alternative hearing restoration technique for adults with FDTB and CHL due to stenosis of the external auditory canal and/or ossicular crowding.
