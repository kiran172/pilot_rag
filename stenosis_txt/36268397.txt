Title: Anterior wall STEMI in a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation due to coronary embolism: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Coronary embolism (CE) is a rare cause of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Atrial fibrillation (AF), left ventricular thrombus, septic emboli from infective endocarditis, myxoma, and paradoxical embolism can induce emboli in coronary arteries.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a case of anterior wall STEMI secondary to paroxysmal AF in a 60-years-old female with a previous history of right-sided ischemic stroke.
DISCUSSION: The major criteria for diagnosis of coronary embolism include (1) non-atherosclerotic wall of coronary vessels under angiography; (2) concomitant involvement of multiple sites; (3) histological proof of venous thrombus; (4) imaging by echocardiography/CT/MRI showing intra-cardiac thrombus. The minor criteria include (1) <25% stenosis of other vessels supplying to infarct-free myocardium; (2) atrial fibrillation history; (3) risk factors like (prosthetic valve, bacterial endocarditis, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect, dilated cardiomyopathy).
CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the importance of cardiac embolus as a diagnosis in a patient with a history of stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation as a cause of acute STEMI and its management.
