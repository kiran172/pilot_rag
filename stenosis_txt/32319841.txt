Title: Bench to bedside defining calcific aortic valve disease: osteocardiology.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: For years, calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) was thought to be due to a degenerative process, but recent scientific discoveries have proven it to be an active process. Understanding the cellular mechanisms for the development of disease and translating the cellular changes critical in the development of calcific phenotypes. The use of multimodality imaging has been the gold standard to define the development of calcification to determine the timing of therapy.
AREAS COVERED: This review will discuss the scientific literature in a new and evolving field known as osteocardiology, which specifically defines the cellular mechanisms involved in the development of the osteogenic phenotype in the heart and vasculature. The work in this field has been highlighted by the calcific aortic valve disease working group at the NIH. This review will discuss the appropriate use criteria for multimodality imaging techniques to identify early cellular and hemodynamic disease progression in the aortic valve to help determine the timing of therapy, the osteocardiology theory.
EXPERT OPINION: The authors will provide their background in basic science and clinical medicine to support the opinions in this paper.
