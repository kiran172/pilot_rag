Title: Replacement of pulmonary venous stent during Fontan operation.

Abstract: Post-operative pulmonary venous stenosis is a poor prognostic factor in single-ventricle haemodynamics. Implantation of a drug-eluting stent is a therapeutic option. However, due to their small size, they inevitably become inadequate as the patient grows. We present the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of the replacement of a small-diameter stent with a large-diameter stent during Fontan surgery.
