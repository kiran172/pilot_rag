Title: Airway injuries in pre and post-COVID-19 era: a preliminary epidemiologic investigation in our center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheal stenosis and tracheo-esophageal fistulas are serious but rare complications of prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation. Tracheal resection with end-to-end anastomosis and endoscopic procedure are the options of care in the treatment of tracheal injuries. Tracheal stenosis could be iatrogenic, associated with tracheal tumors, or idiopathic. Tracheo-esophageal fistula may be congenital or acquired; in adults about half of the cases are secondary to malignancies.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of all the patients referred to our center between 2013 and 2022, with diagnosis of benign or malign tracheal stenosis or tracheo-esophageal fistulas due to benign or malign airway injury, undergoing tracheal surgery. Patients are divided in two temporal cohorts: cohort X if treated before SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (from 2013 to 2019) and cohort Y if treated during and after SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (from 2020 to 2022).
RESULTS: From the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, we experienced an unprecedented increase in the incidence of TEF and TS. In addition, based on our data, results show less variability for TS etiology, mainly iatrogenic, an increase of 10 years in median age and an inversion of trend regarding the sex of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The standard of care for definitive treatment of TS is tracheal resection and end-to-end anastomosis. Literature shows a high success rate (83-97%) and low mortality (0-5%) following surgery in specialized centers with experience. Management of tracheal complication after prolonged MV is still challenging. An adequate clinical and radiological follow-up should be performed in patients treated with prolonged MV in order to diagnose any tracheal lesions in the subclinical phase and to choose the correct strategy, center and time to treat it.
