Title: Recent Advancements in Epidural Etanercept for Pain Management in Radiculopathy: A Literature Review.

Abstract: The most common etiology of low back and neck pain is associated with spinal cord pathologies. Regardless of origin, low back and neck pain are some of the most common causes of disability worldwide. Mechanical compression due to spinal cord diseases, such as degenerative disc disorders, can lead to radiculopathy, which manifests as numbness or tingling and can progress to loss of muscle function. Conservative management, such as physical therapy, has not been proven effective in treating radiculopathy, and surgical treatments have more risks than benefits for most patients. Epidural disease-modifying medications, such as Etanercept, have been recently explored due to their minimal invasiveness and direct effects on inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Therefore, this literature review aims to evaluate epidural Etanercept's effect on radiculopathy caused by degenerative disc diseases. Epidural Etanercept has been shown to improve radiculopathy in patients with lumbar disc degeneration, spinal stenosis, and sciatica. Further research is needed to compare the effectiveness of Etanercept with commonly used treatments such as steroids and analgesia.
