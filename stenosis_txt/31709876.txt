Title: Clinical characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation suffering from pulmonary vein stenosis after radiofrequency ablation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is a serious complication in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). We therefore examined these patients' clinical characteristics in relation to PVS occurrence.
METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and treatment strategies in patients with AF who developed PVS after RFCA.
RESULTS: Among 205 patients with AF who underwent RFCA, five (2.44%) developed PVS (all men; age 44-64 years; AF history 12-60 months; 2 paroxysmal AF, 3 persistent AF). One patient underwent two RFCA sessions and the others received one. The time to PVS diagnosed by pulmonary vein computed tomography angiography (CTA) was 3 to 21 months. PVS symptoms included dyspnea and hemoptysis. Nine pulmonary veins developed PVS. Single mild PVS occurred in two asymptomatic patients and multiple PVS or single severe PVS in three symptomatic patients who underwent pulmonary vein angiography and stent placement. Symptoms in the three patients significantly improved after stent implantation; however, stent restenosis occurred 1 year later in one case.
CONCLUSION: PVS is a rare complication of RFCA for AF that can be diagnosed by CTA. Pulmonary vein stent implantation can remarkably improve the symptoms, but stent restenosis may occur.
