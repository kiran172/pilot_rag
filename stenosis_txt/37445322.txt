Title: Lung Transplant Recipients and COVID-19: Report of Two Cases.

Abstract: Although the WHO has declared the end of the pandemic emergency, COVID-19 still poses a threat to immunocompromised patients. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread throughout the world over the last two years, causing a significant number of deaths. After three years, SARS-CoV-2 has lost its initial lethality but has shown a significantly worse prognosis for immunocompromised patients, especially those who have undergone lung transplantation, compared with the general population. This paper presents two compelling case studies that highlight the complex challenges of COVID-19 infection in lung transplant recipients. The first case involves a patient who received a bilateral lung transplant for pulmonary artery hypertension in 2009, followed by a kidney transplant in 2022. Surprisingly, despite an initially favorable clinical course after contracting COVID-19, the patient deteriorated rapidly and died within a few days due to extensive lung involvement. This case highlights the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and its potentially devastating impact on lung transplant recipients. The second case involves a patient who underwent bilateral lung transplantation five years earlier for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This individual also contracted COVID-19 and had pre-existing complications, including chronic lung allograft rejection (CLAD) and diffuse bronchial stenosis. Following viral infection, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated rapidly, with worsening bronchial stenosis. This case highlights the ability of COVID-19 to exacerbate pre-existing pulmonary complications in transplant recipients. These cases highlight the urgent need for increased vigilance and tailored management strategies when dealing with COVID-19 in lung transplant recipients. The unpredictable and detrimental course of the disease observed in these patients highlights the importance of implementing stringent preventive measures, such as vaccination and strict adherence to infection control protocols, in this vulnerable population. Further research is essential to gain a full understanding of the unique dynamics of COVID-19 in lung transplant recipients and to develop targeted interventions to improve their outcomes.
