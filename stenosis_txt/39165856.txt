Title: A cross- sectional study on the association between lifestyle factors and coronary artery stenosis severity among adults living in central Iran: A protocol for the Iranian- CARDIO study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although several studies have attempted to identify coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, few have explored the association between lifestyle-related factors and the severity of coronary artery stenosis. The present study was designed to assess the association between a combination of lifestyle, dietary, cardiometabolic, psychological, and mental factors, and CAD severity in adults undergoing angiography.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to recruit a total of 700 patients (aged 35 to 75 years) who met the inclusion criteria and were referred for angiography between July 2020 and November 2021 to Afshar Hospital, a central heart disease hospital in Yazd city, Iran. To assess the presence and intensity of CAD, we used the Gensini and SYNTAX scores. Biochemical factors were measured using standard kits from serum samples, and extra serum and whole blood samples were retained for further analyses. Data on general information, dietary food and supplement intake, eating habits, medicinal herbs consumption, psychological and mental state, sleep quality, and other variables were gathered by trained interviewers using specific questionnaires.
RESULTS: In total, 720 participants (444 males and 276 females) aged 56.57Â±9.78 years were included in the current study. Moderate to severe coronary artery stenosis was prevalent in 47.0% and 17.9% of participants based on Gensini and SYNTAX scores, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study will enhance our understanding of the association between different risk factors and the severity of coronary artery stenosis.
