Title: The correlation between lumbar interlaminar space size on plain radiograph and spinal stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Investigating the correlation between the interlaminar space size on plain radiograph and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: 100 Patients with LSS and 100 normal participants without LSS were included in this study. Lumbar interlaminar parameters were measured on plain radiographs. Spinal canal parameters were measure on CT and MRI. These image parameters were compared between LSS and control group. The linear correlation among interlaminar parameters, spinal canal parameters and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were analyzed. The cut-off values of interlaminar parameters for diagnosing L3/4 and L4/5 symptomatic LSS were analyzed.
RESULTS: Excepting for L1/2 interlaminar width, all interlaminar and spinal canal related parameters in LSS group were significantly smaller than those in control group. Excepting for L1/2 interlaminar width and L5/S1 interlaminar height, all interlaminar parameters had significantly positive linear correlation with spinal canal parameters accordingly in each lumbar level. For diagnosis of symptomatic LSS, The cut off values of L4/5 interlaminar width, height and area were 18.46 mm, 11.37 mm and 134.05 mm2 while 15.78 mm, 13.59 mm and 157.98 mm2 in L3/4. Both spinal canal size and interlaminar size had no linear correlation with ODI in cases of L4/5 LSS.
CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar interlaminar space size on plain radiograph has positive linear correlation with developmental and degenerative LSS, excepting for L1/2 interlaminar width and L5/S1 interlaminar height. Lumbar plain radiograph can be a feasible way for predicting and helping to diagnose LSS through evaluating the interlaminar space size.
