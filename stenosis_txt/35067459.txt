Title: Sleeve gastrectomy to aortic valve replacement: safe?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery has favorable results on cardiac structure and function, but there is minimal research on its utility in the cardiac comorbid population.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is safe in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS).
SETTING: Community hospital/bariatric center of excellence in Pennsylvania.
METHODS: Retrospective single center review of 18 patients with morbid obesity and clinically significant AS. All SGs were performed between June 2016 and June 2020. Outcomes including hospital length of stay, 30-day readmission, and 30-day mortality in the study population (n = 18) were compared with 100 patients without AS who underwent SG at the same institution during the same time.
RESULTS: There were no perioperative deaths. Mean hospital stay in the study group was 1.78 days compared with 1.3 days in the noncardiac group (P = .1154). Two of 18 patients (11.1%) required readmission within 30 days, both for clinically significant bleeding, compared with 2 of 100 noncardiac patients (2.0%) (P = .1097). Seventeen of 18 study patients went on to have definitive aortic valve replacement surgery.
CONCLUSION: SG appears safe in patients with clinically significant AS. Although the AS group did have a higher rate of complications, these were manageable and did not increase mortality or LOS. Further studies are required to determine if outcomes of definitive aortic valve replacement are improved after bariatric surgery.
