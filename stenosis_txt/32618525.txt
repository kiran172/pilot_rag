Title: Novel use of high-flow nasal cannula therapy in the management of pyriform aperture stenosis: case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pyriform aperture stenosis is a rare form of congenital nasal obstruction; it poses a management dilemma for otolaryngologists and physicians alike. It can result in poor weight gain and potentially life-threatening airflow obstruction. The challenge lies in the difficulty to predict which patients will require invasive operative management versus conservative therapy alone.
CASE REPORT: This case demonstrates the successful use of high-flow nasal cannula therapy in a young child with pyriform aperture stenosis.
