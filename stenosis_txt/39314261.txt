Title: Preliminary results on temporal evolution and clinical implications of atherosclerotic plaque in branch atheromatous disease after statin treatment.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Branch atheromatous disease (BAD) is a primary cause of early neurological deterioration (END) in penetrating artery occlusion, leading to poor functional outcomes. While it has been proposed to classify BAD under large artery atherosclerosis, uncertainty exists regarding the optimal treatment strategy, including cholesterol-lowering targets.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the clinical implications and temporal changes of atherosclerotic plaques before and after high-intensity statin treatment.
DESIGN: This is a high-resolution vessel-wall imaging sub-analysis of the trial of Statin and Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Preventing Early Neurological Deterioration in Branch Atheromatous Disease (SATBRAD).
METHODS: In this prospective, single-group cohort study, participants in the treatment arm of the SATBRAD trial received early dual antiplatelet therapy and high-intensity statin treatment. The majority of these participants subsequently underwent high-resolution vessel-wall magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Those with atheromatous plaques in the parent artery continued high-intensity statin treatment for 6 months, followed by a repeat MRI to monitor plaque changes.
RESULTS: There were 57 patients who underwent vessel-wall imaging and 24 exhibited contrast-enhanced plaques. Patients with contrast-enhanced plaques showed higher rates of END (29.2% vs 6.1%, p = 0.027), perfusion defects (62.5% vs 24.2%, p = 0.004), and lower rates of good outcomes at 3 months (50.0% vs 81.8%, p = 0.011). After adjusting for confounding factors, contrast-enhanced plaque had a negative impact on achieving a good outcome at 3 months (adjusted odds ratio = 0.04; 95% confidence interval = &lt;0.01-0.60). Following high-intensity statin treatment in 36 patients, there was a notable reduction in stenosis (33.7% vs 29.3%, p = 0.005) and contrast-enhanced plaque volume (16.3 vs 11.6 mm3, p = 0.015).
CONCLUSION: The study highlighted the association between contrast-enhanced atherosclerotic plaques, END, and poor functional outcomes, with high-intensity treatment leading to plaque volume reduction. These results underscore the shared pathology between BAD and intracranial atherosclerosis, emphasizing the necessity for further research and tailored treatment strategies for BAD.
