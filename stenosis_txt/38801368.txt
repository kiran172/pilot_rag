Title: [Alagille syndrome associated to JAG1 gene deletion. An unusual etiology].

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder that typically presents with cholestasis, cardiac, ocular, skeletal, vascular and renal abnormalities, and distinct facial features. Most cases are due to variants in the JAG1 gene, with only a small percentage involving a complete gene deletion.
OBJECTIVE: to contribute to the phenotype delineation and interpretation of a microdeletion not previously described in the literature on chromosome 20.
CLINICAL CASE: A 4-month-old female patient was diagnosed with a heart murmur. An echocardiogram revealed pulmonary artery stenosis, which, combined with a prominent forehead observed on physical examination, determined her referral to clinical genetics. Because ALGS was suspected, complementary studies were performed, revealing butterfly vertebras and a genetic panel identified a pathogenic heterozygous deletion, encompassing the entire coding sequence of the JAG1 gene. To rule out a more extensive deletion, a chromosome microarray was performed, confirming a pathogenic microdeletion on chromosome 20 of 378 kb (arr[GRCh37] 20p12.2(10414643_10792802)x1).
CONCLUSIONS: A targeted sequencing panel followed by confirmation with a chromosome microarray allowed the identification and delineation of a pathogenic microdeletion not previously reported in the literature, including the complete JAG1 gene in a Chilean patient whose phenotype is consistent with ALGS.
