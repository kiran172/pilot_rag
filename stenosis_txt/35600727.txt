Title: Omental Free-Shaped Flap Reinforcement on the Anastomosis and Dissected Area (OFFROAD) Following Reconstruction after Gastrectomy: A Retrospective Case-Control Study.

Abstract: The recent advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative care have improved postoperative morbidity and survival after gastric cancer surgeries. However, anastomotic leakage, the most serious complication post-gastrectomy, continues to occur. In esophageal and colorectal cancer surgeries, the omentum is used as a physical barrier and increases blood perfusion to prevent leakage to the anastomotic site. However, the use of the omentum as an anastomotic barrier after gastrectomy has not been reported yet. The authors aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omental free-shaped flap reinforcement on the anastomosis and dissected area following reconstruction after gastrectomy for preventing and treating anastomotic leakage. They reported that omental free-shaped flap reinforcement on the anastomosis might prevent anastomotic leakage post-gastrectomy. The omental flap also prevented further deterioration when leakage occurred. However, anastomosis-related complications, such as anastomotic stenosis and delayed gastric emptying, after an omental patch technique need to be evaluated further.
