Title: Recurrent middle cerebral artery stroke caused by arterial thoracic outlet syndrome and coagulopathy.

Abstract: Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is defined as compression of neurovascular components passing the thoracic outlet. While neurologic compression is the most common form, rare cases of arterial comprssion could result in concerning cerebral thromboembolic events. Here we present a 15-year-old female with repeated left hemiparesis and radiologic signs of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in right middle cerebral artery. Further investigations revealed stenosis of the right subclavian artery, saccular aneurysm, and occlusion of the right brachial artery which suggested the diagnosis of arterial TOS. Based on this report, we present this diagnosis as a rare but important cause of CVA, especially in young patients.
