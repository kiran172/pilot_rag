Title: Renal Endovascular Stenting of a Non-Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis Secondary to Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Non-atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) secondary to Takayasu arteritis (TA) is rarely cited in the literature. Although stenting has been well-described in atherosclerotic RAS, it's role in non-atherosclerotic, Takayasu arteritis-induced renal artery stenosis (TARAS) has not been fully established. We report a 38-year old, Filipino, woman who presented with an incidental finding of small left kidney and hypertension. On CT aortogram, complete total occlusion of the left kidney, and significant stenosis of the right renal artery, and several aortic branches were demonstrated, consistent with Takayasu arteritis. After initiating immunosuppressive agents and undergoing renal endovascular stenting, the patient's blood pressure dramatically improved. Restenosis of the right renal artery was not observed after 6 months. Kidney function was also preserved 2 years after the procedure.
