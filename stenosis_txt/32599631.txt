Title: Calcific Plug Obstructing the Thoracic Aorta.

Abstract: We describe a case of a 57-year-old woman with occlusion of the thoracic aorta due to a calcific plug as an unusual cause of refractory hypertension. Middle aortic syndrome, also known as "coral reef aorta," defined as a clinical condition caused by thoracic and/or abdominal aortic stenosis, requires peculiar treatment strategies representing a complex surgical challenge.
