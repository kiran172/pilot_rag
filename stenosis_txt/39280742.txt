Title: Endovascular recanalization for filter-bearing inferior vena cava occlusion in a dialysis patient.

Abstract: Central venous occlusion (CVO) or stenosis (CVS) is a common complication of long-term hemodialysis catheters. Endovascular intervention, primarily balloon angioplasty and occasionally stent placement, is the primary approach for managing CVS/CVO lesions. The presence of a filter within the inferior vena cava (IVC) lumen makes recanalization of the IVC more challenging. Here we present a complex case of a 47-year-old female with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), systemic lupus erythematosus, and recurrent deep venous thrombosis, necessitating an IVC filter, who became catheter-dependent via the right femoral vein and presented with total IVC occlusion below the filter. The occlusion was managed successfully with sequential angioplasty and stenting of the stenotic lesions. This intervention restored venous flow through the IVC into the right atrium and maintained dialysis access through the catheter. This case underscores the complexity of managing CVS/CVO in dialysis patients, especially with the presence of filters within the vascular dialysis conduit.
