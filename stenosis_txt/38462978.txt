Title: Use of the Disposcope endoscope for awake orotracheal intubation in an elderly patient with a large vocal cord polyp -a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vocal cord polyps are commonly encountered in the otorhinolaryngology department. The risk of anesthesia is high in patients with large vocal cord polyps. Awake intubation with appropriate airway tools provides a favorable safety profile.
CASE: We present the case of a 60-year-old male patient who had been suffering from a large vocal cord polyp for 16 years. Electronic laryngoscopy revealed that the vocal cord polyp was approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. The polyp had a pedicle and demonstrated synchronous motion with respiratory excursion. It covered almost the entire glottic area during inspiration and moved away from the glottis during expiration. A Disposcope endoscope was used for awake tracheal intubation, and the surgery was completed successfully.
CONCLUSIONS: The Disposcope endoscope can be a useful option for awake orotracheal intubation in cases of anticipated difficult intubation and difficult facemask ventilation.
