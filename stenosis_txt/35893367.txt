Title: Prognostic Implications of the Novel Pulmonary Hypertension Definition in Patients with Aortic Stenosis after Transcatheter Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Introduction: Pulmonary hypertension (PH), traditionally defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) ≥ 25 mmHg, is associated with poor outcomes in patients undergoing a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis (AS). Recently, a novel definition for PH has been proposed, placing the cut-off value of mean PAP at 20 mmHg, and introducing pulmonary vascular resistance as an exclusive indicator for the pre-capillary involvement. In light of the novel criteria, whether PH still preserves its prognostic significance remains unknown. Methods: The study population consisted of 380 patients with AS, who underwent a right heart catheterization before TAVR. The cohort was divided according to the presence of PH (n = 174, 45.7%) or not. Patients with PH were further divided into the following groups: (1) Pre-capillary PH ((Pre-capPH), n = 46, 12.1%); (2) Isolated post-capillary PH ((IpcPH), n = 78, 20.5%); (3) Combined pre and post-capillary PH ((CpcPH), n = 82, 21.6%). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 1 year. Results: A total of 246 patients (64.7%) exhibited mean PAP > 20 mmHg. Overall, the presence of PH was associated with higher 1-year mortality rates (hazard ratio (HR) 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4−5.8, p = 0.004). Compared to patients with no PH, Pre-capPH and CpcPH (but not IpcPH) were related to higher 1-year mortality (HR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.0−7.2, p = 0.041 and HR 3.9, 95% CI: 1.8−8.5, p = 0.001, respectively). This remained significant even after the adjustment for baseline comorbidities. Conclusions: Pre-interventional PH according to the novel hemodynamic criteria, is linked with poor outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR for severe AS. However, this is mainly driven by patients with mean PAP ≥ 25 mmHg. Patients with a pre-capillary PH component as defined by increased PVR present an even worse prognosis as compared to patients with isolated post-capillary or no PH who present comparable 1-year mortality rates.
