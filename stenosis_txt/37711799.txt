Title: Prognosis value of EAS index in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: EAS index is reported to be an adjunctive tool for risk stratification in addition to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This study aimed to verify the predictive value of EAS index among coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with different cardiac systolic function levels.
METHODS: A total of 477 patients with obstructive CAD were included in the exploratory analysis of a prospective cohort between October 2017 and January 2018 at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. EAS index, e'/(a' × s'), is a novel parameter assessed by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) indicating combined diastolic and systolic performance. Any occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was recorded, including first onset of myocardial infarction, stroke, readmission for heart failure, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death that occurred within 6 months of the first admission. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were applied to testify the predictive value of EAS index for cardiovascular outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 415 patients (87.2%) completed the follow-up (median, 25.9 months) and experienced 101 (24.3%) MACEs, 17 (4.0%) deaths, and 139 (33.4%) composite events. Elevated EAS index was significantly associated with a higher incidence of MACE, even after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity troponin T, high-density lipoprotein, stenosis degree, and other TDI parameters [Model 3, hazard ratio: 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-2.85]. For different levels of cardiac function, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that elevated EAS index was associated with higher MACE incidence only in patients with LVEF ≥50% (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: EAS index is an independent predictor of MACE in patients with obstructive CAD, which could be utilized as a tool for risk stratification in CAD patients or incorporated into a prediction model to improve efficacy.
