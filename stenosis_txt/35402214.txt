Title: Laryngotracheal Stenoses Post-Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome due to COVID-19: Clinical Presentation, Histopathological Findings and Management. A Series of 12 Cases.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased the risk of developing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent moderate to severe laryngotracheal stenoses (LSTs) with an early presentation that occurs between two and three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We present a series of 12 cases of LST following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dense lymphocyte infiltration with multinuclear giant cell granulomas was found on biopsy with intranuclear inclusions, suggestive of viral cytopathic effects in one case and intravascular fibrin thrombi with perivascular mononuclear infiltrate of CD3 + T lymphocytes. We present the largest and only series that describes clinical and histopathological characteristics of LTS and the management and outcomes after early laryngotracheal reconstruction in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
