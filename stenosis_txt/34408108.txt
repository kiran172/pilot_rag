Title: Long-term Outcomes after Microsurgical Decompression of Lumbar Foraminal Stenosis and Adverse Effects of Preoperative Scoliosis: A Prospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: Lumbar foraminal stenosis is a common disorder, with surgical treatment varying from simple decompression to interbody fusion. It is often associated with degenerative lumbar scoliosis, but the effects of scoliosis on outcomes are unclear. The objectives of this study were to clarify long-term outcomes after microsurgical decompression of lumbar foraminal stenosis through Wiltse's approach and to determine the effects of scoliosis on these outcomes. A total of 86 consecutive patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis were prospectively followed after microsurgical decompression. They were categorized in multiple subcohorts with follow-up durations ranging from 6 months to 5 years. Outcomes were assessed using the Short Form 36 questionnaire (average physical scores and bodily pain scores). Local Cobb angle of the operative segment was measured preoperatively, and its effects on outcomes were analyzed. Average physical scores improved significantly from 33.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.1-38.5) preoperatively to 59.5 (95% CI: 54.6-64.3) at 6 months postoperatively and remained improved for 5 years. Bodily pain scores improved significantly from 23.7 (95% CI: 18.7-28.6) preoperatively to 56.3 (95% CI: 51.2-61.6) at 6 months postoperatively and remained improved for 5 years. Patients with preoperative scoliosis (local Cobb angle >10 degrees) had poorer outcomes: average physical scores were worse by 9.6 points (p = 0.07) and bodily pain scores were worse by 12.1 points (p = 0.02), compared with patients without scoliosis (local Cobb angle â‰¤10 degrees). Microsurgical foraminal decompression produced overall excellent outcomes in patients with lumbar foraminal stenosis. Preoperative scoliosis attenuated these beneficial effects.
