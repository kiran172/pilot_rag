Title: Skene's gland duct cyst: three cases in female newborns.

Abstract: Skene's gland duct cysts are benign, asymptomatic bulging interlabial masses that are rarely identified in female newborns. The aetiology is unknown, but it is commonly associated with in utero maternal oestrogen exposure or obstruction or stenosis of the gland duct. We report three unrelated cases of neonatal Skene's gland duct cysts that resolved spontaneously without the need for surgical intervention.
