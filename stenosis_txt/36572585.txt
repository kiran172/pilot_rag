Title: Prevention and management of esophageal stricture after esophageal ESD: 10 years of experience in a single medical center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure to deal with local early esophageal neoplasm, although post-ESD esophageal stricture is a major delayed complication of esophageal ESD greatly influencing the patient's quality of life. This retrospective study was conducted to analyze the esophageal stricture after esophageal ESD while determining further treatment and outcome of stricture management.
METHODS: From 2009 to 2021, we reviewed all patients who underwent ESD for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital.
RESULTS: Totally, 133 patients with esophageal squamous cell neoplasm were enrolled. Among these 133 patients, 108 patients had lesions less than three-fourths in circumferential and 25 patients had lesions in excess of three-fourths circumferentially. Totally, 18 patients (13.5%) had symptomatic esophageal stricture and 17 patients (94.4%) had stricture existing over the upper or middle esophagus. The most important risk factor of esophageal stricture was the extent of resection of esophageal circumference, especially whole circumferential resection. Although oral steroid prevention medication was prescribed for high-risk patients with lesions more than three-fourth circumferential ESD, the stricture rate was still up to 40% (10/25). Endoscopic/luminal management with balloon dilation, radial incision and self-bougination achieved 83% (15/18) symptom remission. Three patients received surgical intervention with esophagectomy or jejunostomy.
CONCLUSION: Esophageal stricture is frequently encountered in esophageal ESD. Aggressive preventative strategy is warranted for the high-risk group. Endoscopy/luminal management has high efficacy for post-ESD esophageal stricture.
