Title: Bacterial Colonization in Double J Stent and Bacteriuria in Post-Renal Transplant Patients.

Abstract: Background and objective Urinary tract infections (UTI) in kidney transplant recipients can cause significant morbidity and negatively impact both, graft and patient survival. Ureteric stenting in renal transplantation is aimed at reducing the risks of complications like ureteric leak and stenosis. Ureteric stents are not without their potential complications which may include UTI. We aimed to compare urine bacteriology and bacterial colonization of DJ stent following kidney transplantation, and to establish antimicrobial susceptibility to guide the choice of empirical antibiotics in the event of UTI in post-transplant patients with DJ stent. Materials and methods This was a prospective study carried out over a year period (February 2020 to January 2021). Eighty post-renal transplant patients with indwelling ureteral stents were recruited for the study. An early morning midstream urine sample was taken for analysis from consenting patients that met the inclusion criteria. All stents were removed via rigid cystoscopy and the distal end of the stent (4cm) was cut off and put in a sterile bottle for microbiological analysis. Sensitivity and resistance were tested against a panel of 19 antibiotics on all microbial isolates. Results were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results The mean age of the patients was 47.9+ 12.1 years. Male patients were 60 (75%) while 20 (25%) were females. Fifty-one (52%) patients had hypertension while 25 (26%) had diabetes mellitus. Hypertension and diabetes were noted in 20 (21%) patients while only one patient (1%) had HCV. Prior to renal transplantation, patients had negative urine cultures. The majority of the patients (76, 95%) had their stent retrieved after 4 weeks, 2 (2.5%) of them had stents retrieved after 2 weeks, and 2 (2.5%) had stents retrieved after 8 weeks. There was a significant association between the duration of stent and stent colonization (p=0.031). No organism was cultured in both the urine and stent in 13 (14.4%) patients. Nine (10%) had positive stent culture with a negative urine culture while 5 (5.6%) had positive urine culture with a negative stent culture. The same organism was noted in both urine and stent in 58 (64.4%) of patients while different organisms were cultured in 5 (5.6%) of the patients. Escherichia coli was the most common organism cultured in the urine of 38 (65.5%) patients and 36 (58.1%) stents, respectively. The sensitivity pattern shows that the organisms were more susceptible to nitrofurantoin and gentamicin, and resistant to tetracycline and ceftriaxone. Tigecycline showed good susceptibility and poor resistance. Conclusion This study shows that stent colonization was slightly higher than urine bacteriology, with both demonstrating similar microbiological patterns. Selection of the initial empiric treatment should be based on local epidemiological data. Initial therapy should be de-escalated to the most narrow-spectrum antibiotics to complete the course of therapy once culture and sensitivity data is available. Antibiotics stewardship will help in reducing the trend of MDR pathogens.
