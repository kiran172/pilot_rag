Title: Ultrasound diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis and occlusion.

Abstract: Carotid artery ultrasonography is capable of diagnosing or inferring the presence or absence of stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and vertebral artery (VA), as well as the not directly observable distal ICA, middle cerebral artery (MCA), and basilar artery (BA). Stenosis at the origin of the ICA is mainly evaluated using the parameter peak systolic velocity (PSV), with values of ≥ 200-230 cm/s indicating severe stenosis. Recently, the acceleration time ratio has been reported for diagnosis of ICA origin stenosis. An indicator called the end-diastolic (ED) ratio can be used for diagnosing occlusion of the distal ICA or the M1 segment of the MCA. The PSV of stenosis can be used to diagnose stenosis at the beginning of the VA or V1, and mean flow velocity, mean ratio, and diameter ratio can be used to diagnose distal VA occlusion. Furthermore, the usefulness of the VA pulsatility index and resistance index has been suggested for diagnosing stenosis or occlusion of the BA. This review outlines diagnostic sonography criteria for stenosis and occlusion of extracranial and intracranial arteries.
