Title: Thoracoabdominal aneurysm causing functional mitral valve stenosis after total arch replacement.

Abstract: Large thoracic and thoraco-abdominal aneurysms may compress adjacent mediastinal structures. We present a case of a large thoraco-abdominal aneurysm compressing the left atrium and leading to functional mitral valve stenosis after total aortic arch repair, requiring urgent open thoraco-abdominal aneurysm repair.
