Title: The Effects of Carotid Revascularization on 1-Year Cognitive Performance in Patients With Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The impact of carotid revascularization on cognitive function for patients with severe carotid artery stenosis remains uncertain. This study is aimed to investigate the 1-year neurocognitive outcomes of patients who accept carotid revascularization and identify the risk factors associated with postoperative cognitive decline.
METHODS: From April 2019 to April 2021, patients with â‰¥70% carotid artery stenosis who were treated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) were recruited for this study. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) instrument was used to evaluate cognitive function preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis was built to identify potential risk factors for postoperative long-term cognitive decline.
RESULTS: A total of 89 patients who met the criteria were enrolled and completed 1-year follow-up. At 3, 6, and 12 months after carotid revascularization, the total MoCA score, attention, language fluency, and delayed recall score were significantly improved compared with the baseline scores (p<0.05). At 12 months, there was also a significant improvement in cube copying compared with baseline (p=0.034). Logistic regression analysis showed that the advancing age, left side, and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were independent risk factors for cognitive deterioration at 12 months after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, carotid revascularization has a beneficial effect on cognition function in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis, while advancing age, left side, and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were significantly related to a decreased cognitive score after carotid revascularization.
CLINICAL IMPACT: This study focused on the changes in cognitive function within 1 year after carotid revascularization in patients with severe carotid stenosis. Of course, carotid revascularization can improve the cognition function in these patients. On the other hand, we found the advancing age, left side and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were significantly associated with decreased cognitive scores at 1 year after carotid revascularization, which suggests that clinicians may need to be aware of patients with these characteristics.
