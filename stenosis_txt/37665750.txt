Title: Long-term outcomes of the classic Konno-Rastan procedure in paediatric and adult patients: impact of aortic annulus size on patient outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The classic Konno-Rastan procedure may yield different outcomes regarding aortic annulus diameters ≤15 mm and larger. Focusing on the effect of the diameter of the aortic annulus, we described the long-term outcomes of our patients.
METHODS: The outcomes of paediatric and adult patients who underwent surgery from 2000 to 2021 were studied retrospectively. The patient population was divided into 2 groups with aortic annulus diameters ≤15 mm and >15, and the outcomes were compared between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: A total of 48 patients, with a mean age of 12.24 ± 9.42 years (2-53 years) and a median follow-up duration of 8 years (7 months to 20 years) with an IQR of 5.5, were enrolled. The mean peak instantaneous pressure gradient was 78.97 ± 25.29 mmHg, which decreased to 21.43 mmHg (P-value = 0.012). The maximum left ventricular outflow tract gradient at the last follow-up was 28.21 mmHg, with the exception of 1 case with a gradient of 68.45 mmHg. The mean diameter of the aortic annulus was 15.34 ± 3.87 mm (8-23 mm), and the mean prosthetic valve size was 20.31 mm, which was 5 mm (33%) larger than the native annulus diameter. The overall mortality rate was 6.3%, with 1 death in the hospital and 2 in the first year after the surgery. The major complication rate, including mortality, heart block and reintervention, was higher in patients with ≤15 mm annulus (P-value = 0.028.) However, there was no difference between the 2 groups in follow-up. Four (8%) late cardiac reoperations were performed, none of which were related to our surgeries.
CONCLUSIONS: Kono-Rastan surgery for patients with aortic valve diameter of ≤15 mm can be performed with acceptable long-term outcomes.
