Title: Agreement between single plane and biplane derived angiographic fractional flow reserve in patients with intermediate coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is often used to evaluate the physiological severity of intermediate coronary stenoses, but less-invasive assessment methods are desirable. We evaluated the feasibility of angiographic FFR (angioFFR) calculated from two projections acquired simultaneously by a biplane C-arm system and angioFFR calculated from two projections acquired independently by one plane of the same biplane C-arm system. AngioFFR was validated against FFR in terms of detection of hemodynamically relevant coronary artery stenoses. Twenty-two Patients who underwent angiography and FFR for coronary artery disease were included. We used a non-commercial prototype to calculate biplane angioFFR for 22 vessels (19 LAD, 1 LCx, 2 RCA) and single plane angioFFR for 17 of the same 22 vessels. FFR < 0.8 was measured in 8 vessels. The Pearson correlation coefficients with FFR were 0.55 for single plane angioFFR and 0.61 for biplane angioFFR and the diagnostic accuracies were 88% (95% CI 73-100%) for single plane angioFFR and 86% (95% CI 72-100%) for biplane angioFFR. Bland-Altman plots revealed that compared with FFR, the limits of agreement for single plane angioFFR were  - 0.07 to 0.19 (mean difference 0.06, p = 0.002) and the limits of agreement for biplane FFR were  - 0.09 to 0.15 (mean difference 0.03, p = 0.03). In conclusion, angioFFR calculated from single or biplane acquisitions by a biplane C-arm is feasible and may evolve to a tool for less invasive imaging-based assessment of myocardial ischemia.
