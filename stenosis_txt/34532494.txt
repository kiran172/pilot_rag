Title: Chest wall reconstruction with digitally designed materials for straight back syndrome with tracheal stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: Severe symptoms of straight back syndrome (SBS) occur through compression of the mediastinal structures. The treatment is to relieve compression, but surgical relief has not been reported. A 29-year-old woman was admitted to hospital because of dyspnea for 2 years. Physical examination showed the physiological curvature of the spine had disappeared and imaging examination confirmed that the spine was straight, the distance between the spine and the anterior chest wall was shortened, and the lower part of the trachea was obviously compressed with a severe stenosis. The chest wall was simulated by 3D technology, and a model was obtained by 3D printing. The surgical resection was simulated on the model, and the required replacement material was digitally designed and processed. The upper half of the sternum, the first and second costal cartilages, and the thymus were excised. After the chest wall defect was repaired with the digital material, the ascending aorta was suspended on the reconstruction to relieve the tracheal compression. The operation was completed in 135 min without any complications. All symptoms disappeared after operation. Postoperative imaging examination showed complete resolution of the tracheal stenosis. The patient was discharged 10 days after operation. Surgical reconstruction of the anterior chest wall is a good method for treating tracheal stenosis in SBS, and digitally produced material is ideal for the reconstruction.
