Title: Outcomes of surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for aortic insufficiency.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Results and durability of aortic valve replacement in aortic stenosis are well known, but no study has focused on the results of aortic valve replacement in aortic insufficiency.
AIM: The aim of this retrospective study was to describe our mid-term outcomes after aortic valve replacement for aortic insufficiency.
METHODS: All consecutive adult patients who underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for aortic insufficiency at two European centres (in France and Germany) between May 2005 and December 2020 were analysed.
RESULTS: During the study period, 289 patients were included. Mean age was 56.9Â±12.5 years. Overall operative mortality was 1.5%, and the 10-year survival estimate rate was 75.0%, which was significantly lower than in the age- and sex-matched general population, with a standardized mortality ratio of 2.88 (95% confidence interval 1.96-4.08; P<0001). Freedom from aortic valve-related death was 87.6%, and from aortic valve-related reoperation was 87.4%. No patient aged>60 years was reoperated on during follow-up. Freedom from severe structural valve deterioration at 10 years was 73.3%, and freedom from moderate structural valve deterioration at 10 years was 50.3%. Freedom from major adverse valve-related events at 10 years was 69.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for aortic insufficiency shows good early results, 10-year mortality and major adverse valve-related event rates in young patients may be a concern, with a reduction in life expectancy compared with the general population.
