Title: Modified Ozaki Procedure Including Annular Enlargement for Small Aortic Annuli in Young Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) (Ozaki procedure) has excellent midterm results in adults. Outcomes in patients with a small native aortic annulus are unknown. We report early outcomes in young patients with small native aortic valve annuli.
METHODS: Retrospective data of patients undergoing AVNeo between 2015 and 2019 were reviewed. Patients with native aortic annulus less than 21 mm undergoing 3-leaflet AVNeo were included.
RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were identified (median age 7.9 years; median weight 21 kg), and 80% patients were less than or equal to 12 years age. Preoperative indication was aortic regurgitation (AR) (n = 23), aortic stenosis (AS) (n = 22), or mixed AS and AR (n = 6). Baseline anatomy was quadricuspid (n = 1), tricuspid (n = 23), bicuspid (n = 15), or unicuspid (n = 12) valve. Preoperative peak gradient for AS and mixed AS and AR patients was 55.36 mm Hg. Median native annulus diameter was 17 mm; sinus and annular enlargements were required in 22 patients and 9 patients, respectively. Median intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were 2.0 days and 7.2 days, respectively. There were no reinterventions, and there was 1 hospital mortality unrelated to aortic valve. At discharge, 94% of patients had less than or equal to mild AR, and the median peak gradient was 18 mm Hg. At mean follow-up of 11.9 months, 80% and 82% of patients had less than moderate AR and AS, respectively. Three patients required surgical reintervention. In annular enlargement patients, mean annulus Z score remained greater than 0 at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ozaki procedure has acceptable short-term results in young patients with small aortic annuli. A larger aortic annulus can be achieved with surgical annular enlargement. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine late valve function and potential continued annular growth.
