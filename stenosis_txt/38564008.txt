Title: Factors affecting graft healing in laryngotracheal reconstruction: a retrospective single-center experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To examine the factors that affect graft healing after laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between January-2008 and October-2023. We included all patients who underwent LTR and required anterior and/or posterior graft placement, while those who underwent procedures without graft placement and those with incomplete information were excluded.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were analyzed. Most patients were pediatric (65.3%), male (65.3%), had no coexisting comorbidities (55.1%), and harbored grade 3-4 stenosis (59.2%). Thirty patients (61.2%) underwent open surgery. Various graft complications occurred including infection (n = 1, 2%), dehiscence (n = 3, 6.1%), scar (n = 6, 12.2%), and granulation (n = 29, 59.2%). Only 15 patients (30.65%) achieved the composite status of "healthy" graft. Among 43 patients who had postoperative cultures, positive results for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were observed in 10 and four patients, respectively. Open surgery and double-stage procedure were significantly associated with higher rates of granulation tissue formation. Pediatric-age group had significantly higher rate of complete epithelization compared to adult-age group. A significantly greater proportion of patients who had unhealthy grafts had open surgery. The rate of double-stage LTR was significantly higher in unhealthy grafts compared to healthy grafts. Prolonged stent duration was linked to various graft-related complications. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed no statistically significant correlations between various factors and postoperative graft-related complications.
CONCLUSION: Open surgery, double-stage procedure, pediatric age group, and stent duration were not significant risk factors associated with postoperative graft-related complications during LTR in multivariate analysis.
