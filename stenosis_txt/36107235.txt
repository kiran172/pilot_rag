Title: Stricture rate in patients after the repair of anorectal malformation following a standardized dilation protocol.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine and analyze the stricture rate in patients who underwent a PSARP or PSARVUP and followed a postoperative protocol of anal dilation (Fig. 1).
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with anorectal malformation (ARM) who underwent a primary PSARP or PSARVUP from February 2016 to October 2021 was performed. Data collected included patients' demographics, type of ARM, age at the time of operation, postoperative complications, with emphasis on whether there were any strictures or any difficulties during dilations, and on follow-up. During the surgical repair, emphasis was placed on preserving the blood supply of the bowel and performing a tension-free bowel-to-skin anastomosis.
RESULTS: Eighty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Forty-four patients were females: 21 recto-perineal fistula, 12 cloaca, 9 recto-vestibular fistula, one imperforate anus without fistula, and one patient had a complex anorectal and vaginal malformation with an anal stricture and a rectovaginal fistula. Forty patients were males: 14 recto-perineal fistula, 11 recto-urethral bulbar fistula, 6 recto-urethral prostatic fistula, 6 imperforate anus without fistula, and 2 bladder neck fistula. One patient had an anal stenosis with sacral agenesis, without a presacral mass. Patient ages ranged from 0 to 79 months (mean 7.5 months, median 5 months) at the time of surgery. Follow-up time ranged from 7 to 73 months (mean 38 months, median 35 months). No patient suffered of a postoperative anal stricture. Six patients suffered of a rectal prolapse that required a surgical repair.
CONCLUSION: Post-operative anal stricture after PSARP and PSARVUP can be avoided with proper surgical technique and postoperative care. Namely, by preserving adequate blood supply of the bowel and avoiding tension at the anoplasty, and by adhering to a structured protocol of anal dilations.
