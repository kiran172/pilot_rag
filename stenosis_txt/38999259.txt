Title: A Neuronal Network-Based Score Predicting Survival in Patients Undergoing Aortic Valve Intervention: The ABC-AS Score.

Abstract: Background: Despite being the most commonly performed valvular intervention, risk prediction for aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis by currently used risk scores remains challenging. The study aim was to develop a biomarker-based risk score by means of a neuronal network. Methods: In this multicenter study, 3595 patients were divided into test and validation cohorts (70% to 30%) by random allocation. Input variables to develop the ABC-AS score were age, the cardiac biomarker high-sensitivity troponin T, and a patient history of cardiac decompensation. The validation cohort was used to verify the scores' value and for comparison with the Society of Thoracic Surgery Predictive Risk of Operative Mortality score. Results: Receiver operating curves demonstrated an improvement in prediction by using the ABC-AS score compared to the Society of Thoracic Surgery Predictive Risk of Operative Mortality (STS prom) score. Although the difference in predicting cardiovascular mortality was most notable at 30-day follow-up (area under the curve of 0.922 versus 0.678), ABC-AS also performed better in overall follow-up (0.839 versus 0.699). Furthermore, univariate analysis of ABC-AS tertiles yielded highly significant differences for all-cause (p &lt; 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (p &lt; 0.0001). Head-to-head comparison between both risk scores in a multivariable cox regression model underlined the potential of the ABC-AS score (HR per z-unit 2.633 (95% CI 2.156-3.216), p &lt; 0.0001), while the STS prom score failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.226). Conclusions: The newly developed ABC-AS score is an improved risk stratification tool to predict cardiovascular outcomes for patients undergoing aortic valve intervention.
