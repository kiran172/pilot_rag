Title: Incidence and predictors of transcatheter aortic valve replacement device emboligenic matter detected by transesophageal echocardiography.

Abstract: During transfemoral (TF) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) sometimes reveals an unexpected mobile membranous mass on the catheter tip within the proximal part of the descending thoracic aorta. Such mobile masses may cause critical embolic events if the TAVR device advances into the ascending aorta in the absence of preventive measures. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and predictors of emboligenic matter (EM) during TAVR, impact of EM on the procedure, and incidence of symptomatic ischemic stroke post procedure. Among 436 consecutive patients who underwent TF-TAVR, 407 were evaluated in this study. The primary end point was incidence of symptomatic ischemic stroke within 24 h post procedure while taking appropriate preventive measures. Incidence of EM, factors associated with EM, and the impact of EM on the procedure were also investigated. Among the 407 cases, 15 cases (3.7%) of EM were identified but no ischemic stroke occurred in the EM (+) group (0% vs. 2.04%, p = 1.00). In the EM (+) group, a self-expandable valve was used in all 15 cases (100% vs. 42.6%, p < 0.0001) while 14 cases used a CoreValve's InLine sheath system initially (93.3% vs. 27.3%, p < 0.0001). CoreValve's InLine sheath system usage was the only independent predictor of EM. The CoreValve's InLine delivery system was identified as a predictor of EM during TF-TAVR, but symptomatic ischemic stroke was avoided while taking appropriate embolization preventive measures.
