Title: Combined trans-stomal endotracheal approach to peri-stomal tracheal pathologies in children.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Peristomal pathologies in tracheostomized children are common and often difficult to treat. They may preclude decannulation even after the initial pathology that required tracheostomy had been resolved.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of combined direct laryngoscopy and trans-stomal endotracheal surgery in the treatment of pediatric peristomal pathologies.
METHODS: The medical records of all children and adolescents with tracheostomies who were surgically treated for peristomal pathologies by a combined endotracheal and trans-stomal approach between January 2006 and August 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Pathologies included stenosis, tracheomalacia, granulation tissue, and a combination of pathologies. Patient demographics and clinical details were retrieved. The primary outcome measure was successful decannulation. Secondary outcome measures were intra- and postoperative complications and number of procedures performed.
RESULTS: In total, 105 subjects aged 6 months to 17 years who underwent combined direct laryngoscopy and trans-stomal surgery were included. Fifty-two (49.5%) of them were successfully decannulated. The specific decannulation rates were 30.3%, 56%, and 59.6% for tracheal stenosis (TS), suprastomal granulation tissue (SSGT), and both, respectively. Trans-stomal microdebrider resection resulted in decannulation rates of 66.7% for TS and 88.8% for SSGT. Intra- and postoperative complications occurred in 4 (12.1%), 1 (4%), and 9 (20.45%) patients with TS, SSGT, and both, respectively. Older age at the time of first operation (p = .03) and tracheal stenosis (p = .02) were significantly associated with decannulation failure.
CONCLUSION: Combined direct laryngoscopy and trans-stomal endotracheal surgery can enable decannulation in almost 50% of children with peristomal pathologies, thus obviating open surgery. Multiple procedures may be required, depending upon the type and severity of the pathology. Complications are more common with multiple pathologies.
