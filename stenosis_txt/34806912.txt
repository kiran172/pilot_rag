Title: Intraoperative Monitoring of CSF Pressure in Patients with Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy (COMP-CORD Study): A Prospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is hallmarked by spinal canal narrowing and related cord compression and myelopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure dynamics are likely disturbed due to spinal canal stenosis. The study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of continuous intraoperative CSF pressure monitoring during surgical decompression. This prospective single center study (NCT02170155) enrolled DCM patients who underwent surgical decompression between December 2019 and May 2021. Data from n = 17 patients were analyzed and symptom severity graded with the modified Japanese Orthopedic Score (mJOA). CSF pulsations were continuously monitored with a lumbar intrathecal catheter during surgical decompression. Mean patient age was 62 ± 9 years (range 38-73; 8 female), symptoms were mild-moderate in most patients (mean mJOA 14 ± 2, range 10-18). Measurements were well tolerated without safety concerns. In 15/16 patients (94%), CSF pulsations increased at the time of surgical decompression. In one case, responsiveness could not be evaluated for technical reasons. Unexpected CSF pulsation decrease was related to adverse events (i.e., CSF leakage). Median CSF pulsation amplitudes increased from pre-decompression (0.52 mm Hg, interquartile range [IQR] 0.71) to post-decompression (0.72 mm Hg, IQR 0.96; p = 0.001). Mean baseline CSF pressure increased with lower magnitude than pulsations, from 9.5 ± 3.5 to 10.3 ± 3.8 mm Hg (p = 0.003). Systematic relations of CSF pulsations were confined to surgical decompression, independent of arterial blood pressure (p = 0.927) or heart rate (p = 0.102). Intraoperative CSF pulsation monitoring was related to surgical decompression while in addition adverse events could be discerned. Further investigation of the clinical value of intraoperative guidance for decompression in complex DCM surgery is promising.
