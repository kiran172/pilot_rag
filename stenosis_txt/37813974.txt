Title: Recanalization of chronic long-segment occlusion of the internal carotid artery with endovascular and hybrid surgery.

Abstract: To investigate the effect of endovascular and/or hybrid surgical recanalization on chronic long-segment occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the effect of occlusion location on the recanalization rate and prognosis, 87 patients with chronic ICA occlusion treated with endovascular approach only or hybrid surgery were retrospectively enrolled. The duration of ICA occlusion ranged from 21 to 360 days (median 30). Type I occlusion (from the neck to below the cavernous segment) consisted of 46 (52.8%) patients while type II (from the neck to above the clinoid segment) of 41 (47.1%). Hybrid surgery was performed in 44 (50.6%) patients while endovascular recanalization only was conducted in the other 43 (49.4%). In all patients, the success rate of recanalization was 93.0% (40/43) for the endovascular approach and 95.5% for the hybrid surgical approach. In patients with type I occlusion, endovascular recanalization only was performed in 22 (47.8%) patients and hybrid surgery in 24 (52.2%), resulting in successful recanalization in all patients (100%). In patients with type II occlusion, the success rate of recanalization was 85.7% (18/21) for the endovascular approach only but 90% (18/20) for the hybrid surgery. The total success rate of recanalization was 94.3% (82/87) for all patients, 100% for type I occlusion, and 87.8% for type II occlusion. No significant (P = 0.12) differences existed in the recanalization rate between groups I and II. Clinical follow-up was performed in 82 (94.3%) patients 6-39 months (mean 16) after the surgery. Re-occlusion occurred in 0 in group I but in four (9.8%) in group II. The mRS was good with 0-2 in 38 (82.6%) patients in group I and in 27 (75%) patients in group II, with no significant (P = 0.78) difference. In conclusion, chronic long-segment ICA occlusion can be safely and efficiently recanalized with the endovascular and hybrid surgery. The location of ICA occlusion may have a critical role in determining the recanalization rate, and careful evaluation of the occlusion location may be helpful in increasing the prognosis of recanalization.
