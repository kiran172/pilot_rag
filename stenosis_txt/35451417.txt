Title: Assessing the incidence of complications and malignancies in the long-term management of benign biliary strictures with a percutaneous transhepatic drain.

Abstract: Percutaneous drainage catheters (PDCs) are required for the management of benign biliary strictures refractory to first-line endoscopic treatment. While biliary patency after PDC placement exceeds 75%, long-term catheterization is occasionally necessary. In this article, we assess the outcomes of patients at our institution who required long-term PDC placement.A single-institution retrospective analysis was performed on patients who required a PDC for 10窶楽ears or longer for the management of a benign biliary stricture. The primary outcome was uncomplicated drain management without infection or complication. Drain replacement was performed every 4 to 12窶学eeks as an outpatient procedure.Nine patients (three males and six females; age range of 48-96窶楽ears) required a long-term PDC; eight patients required the long-term PDC for an anastomotic stricture and one for iatrogenic bile duct stenosis. A long-term PDC was required for residual stenosis or patient refusal. Drain placement ranged from 157 to 408窶確onths. In seven patients, intrahepatic stones developed, while in one patient each, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma occurred.Long-term PDC has a high rate of complications; therefore, to avoid the need for using long-term placement, careful observation or early surgical interventions are required.
