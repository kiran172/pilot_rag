Title: Successful application of percutaneous endoscopic cholangioscopy + electrohydraulic lithotripsy for hepatolithiasis post-liver transplantation: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation in pediatric patients is a crucial intervention for treating end-stage hepatic diseases. Despite significant advances in surgical techniques and postoperative care, complications remain a substantial challenge in this population. Biliary stones, an infrequent complication, present challenges in this context. Given the impossibility of endoscopic treatments, different strategies have been explored to address post-liver transplantation gallstones in children by implementing percutaneous treatment with intraductal lithotripsy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 7-year-old Latin patient, who had a diagnosis of biliary atresia at the age of 2, underwent a liver transplant from a living donor. However, 4 months after the transplant, the patient experienced recurring episodes of cholangitis. Cholangioresonance revealed intrahepatic lithiasis and anastomotic stenosis. Attempted gallstone removal through percutaneous cholangiography proved unsuccessful, as multiple peripheral stones in all ducts remained immobile. Subsequently, a percutaneous endoscopic cholangioscopy using the SpyGlass Discover system for visual examination of the bile ducts + electrohydraulic lithotripsy was performed, effectively removing the stones without any complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous cholangioscopy with intraductal lithotripsy enables accurate identification and extraction of intrahepatic stones without the need for surgical intervention. This method proves to be a valuable alternative in addressing post-transplant biliary stone. In our case, it was performed on a pediatric patient who underwent liver transplantation, which makes it interesting and relevant as there is currently insufficient literature on this approach in such cases in this population.
