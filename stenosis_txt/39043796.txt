Title: Microcirculatory dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with chest pain assessed by angiography-derived microcirculatory resistance.

Abstract: Chest pain, a common initial symptom in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, is closely linked to myocardial ischemia, despite the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis. This study explored microvascular dysfunction in HCM patients by employing angiography-derived microcirculatory resistance (AMR) as a novel tool for comprehensive assessment. This retrospective analysis included HCM patients with chest pain as the primary symptom and control patients without cardiac hypertrophy during the same period. The AMR was computed through angiography, providing a wire-free and adenosine-free index for evaluating microcirculatory function. Propensity score matching ensured balanced demographics between groups. This study also investigated the correlation between the AMR and clinical outcomes by utilizing echocardiography and follow-up data. After matching, 76 HCM patients and 152 controls were analyzed. While there was no significant difference in the incidence of epicardial coronary stenosis, the AMR of three epicardial coronary arteries was markedly greater in HCM patients. The criterion of an AMR ≥ 250 mmHg*s/m was that 65.7% of HCM patients experienced coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). Independent risk factors for CMD included increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (OR = 1.209, 95% CI 1.013-1.443, p = 0.036). Furthermore, an AMR_LAD ≥ 250 mmHg*s/m had an increased cumulative risk of the endpoint (log-rank p = 0.023) and was an independent risk factor for the endpoint (HR = 11.64, 95% CI 1.13-120.03, p = 0.039), providing valuable prognostic insights.
