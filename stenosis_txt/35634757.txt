Title: Transhepatic balloon mitral valvotomy in mitral stenosis with interrupted inferior vena cava.

Abstract: A 38-year-old female was found to have severe mitral stenosis, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with moderate tricuspid regurgitation, dilated right atrium, persistent left superior vena cava, and hugely dilated coronary sinus. The scheduled balloon mitral valvotomy via trans-femoral approach was abandoned after the venogram revealed the presence of left-sided inferior vena cava with hemi-azygos continuation draining into coronary sinus via left-sided superior vena cava. Balloon mitral valvotomy was attempted from the right trans-jugular route, but we were unable to puncture the inter-atrial septum due to the hugely dilated coronary sinus and right atrium. A transhepatic approach was used and balloon mitral valvotomy was successfully done with a standard balloon of 24â€‰mm size without any complication. In patients with inferior vena cava anomalies or interruption, a percutaneous transhepatic approach is a feasible alternative for performing balloon mitral valvotomy.
