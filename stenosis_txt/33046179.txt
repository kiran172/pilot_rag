Title: Infantile dilated cardiomyopathy due to congenital left main coronary ostial stenosis.

Abstract: Although a rare form of congenital heart disease, anomalies of the coronary arteries can present as heart failure in infants. The most common lesion is an anomalous left coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery, but other abnormalities can present similarly. This case is an infant who is found to have left coronary ostial stenosis causing dilated cardiomyopathy.
