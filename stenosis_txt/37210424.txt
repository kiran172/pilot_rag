Title: Fully Robotic Side-to-Side Linear-Stapled Anastomosis During Robotic Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The adoption of robotic surgery for esophageal cancer has been expanding rapidly over the recent years. In the setting of two-field esophagectomy, different techniques exist for intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis, although the superiority of one over another has not been clearly demonstrated. Potential benefits in terms of anastomotic leakage and stenosis have been reported in association with a linear-stapled anastomosis as compared to the more widespread techniques of circular mechanical and hand-sewn reconstructions, however, there is still limited reported evidence on its application to robotic surgery. We here report our fully robotic technique of side-to-side, semi-mechanical anastomosis.
METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing fully robotic esophagectomy featuring intrathoracic side-to-side stapled anastomosis by a single surgical team were included in this analysis. Operative technique is detailed, and perioperative data are assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 49 patients were included. There were no intraoperative complications and no conversion occurred. The rate of overall postoperative morbidity was 25, 14% being the relative rate of major complications. With anastomotic-related morbidity in particular, one patient developed minor anastomotic leakage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that a linear, side-to-side fully robotic stapled anastomosis can be created with a high technical success and minimal incidence of anastomosis-related morbidity.
