Title: Minimally Invasive Hybrid Approach to High Risk Mitral Disease With Severe Mitral Annular Calcification.

Abstract: Severe circumferential mitral annular calcification (MAC) remains a significant challenge, complicating surgical treatment of mitral valve disease. Transcatheter treatment options are attractive; however, they remain fraught with risks of annular fixation, paravalvular leak, atrioventricular-groove disruption, and left-ventricular outflow tract obstruction. We describe a novel minimally invasive hybrid technique of transcatheter mitral valve replacement in a patient with severe circumferential MAC.
