Title: The feasibility of laparoscopic TSME preserving the left colic artery and superior rectal artery for upper rectal cancer.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic tumor-specific mesorectal excision (TSME) preserving the left colic artery and superior rectal artery is still a technically challenging procedure. We conducted this study to demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure for upper rectal cancer.
METHODS: A total of 184 patients with upper rectal cancer were retrospectively analyzed in our cancer center between April 2010 and April 2017. These patients were treated with either laparoscopic TSME (n = 46) or laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) (n = 138). In the TSME group, the left colonic artery and superior rectal artery were preserved while they were not in the TME group.
RESULTS: The operation time in the TSME group was longer than that in the TME group (218.56 ± 35.85 min vs. 201.13 ± 42.65 min, P = 0.004). Furthermore, the number of resected lymph nodes in the TSME group was greater than that in the TME group (19.43 ± 9.46 vs. 18.03 ± 7.43, P = 0.024). The blood loss between the TSME and TME groups was not significant. No mortality occurred in either the TSME or TME groups. One patient in the TME group underwent conversion to laparotomy. The total postoperative complication rates in the TSME and TME groups were 8.7% and 17.4%, respectively. There was no difference in severe complications between the two groups (anastomotic leakage and stenosis).
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic TSME preserving the left colic artery and superior rectal artery can be safely conducted for upper rectal cancer.
