Title: [How to select the best device using pre-TAVR CT scan].

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR has become the gold standard for the treatment of symptomatic and severe aortic valve stenosis in elderly patients. Although the role of computed tomography imaging was initially limited to the determination of the optimal vascular approach, it has progressively matured to become the pilar of TAVR work-up while being standardized by consensus conferences. The list of evaluated elements includes aortic annulus diameter, the optimal projection curve, the number of aortic leaflets, the severity and localization of calcifications, coronary ostial height, membranous septum length and aortic angulation. The proper and cautious evaluation of these elements may help evaluating the risk for the main periprocedural complications such as coronary obstruction, annular rupture, permanent pacemaker implantation or procedural failure and selecting the optimal transcatheter heart valve and its size, according to the patient's specific anatomy. In this review, we detail how the evaluation of these parameters may impact the selection of the transcatheter heart valve.
