Title: LncRNA UCA1, miR-26a, and miR-195 in coronary heart disease patients: Correlation with stenosis degree, cholesterol levels, inflammatory cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA urothelial cancer-associated 1 (lnc-UCA1) targets microRNA-26a (miR-26a) and microRNA-195 (miR-195) to participate in coronary heart disease (CHD) progression via regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell and microvascular endothelial cell viability and mobility. Therefore, this study set out to further explore the relationship between lnc-UCA1 and miR-26a and miR-195, along with their roles in the management of patients with CHD.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-six CHD patients and 70 age-/gender-matched controls were recruited in this case-control study. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were collected for lnc-UCA1, miR-26a, and miR-195 measurement. Furthermore, serum samples from CHD patients were obtained for inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules measurement. The Gensini score was used to evaluate the stenosis severity in CHD patients.
RESULTS: Lnc-UCA1 expression tend to be increased, while miR-26a and miR-195 expressions were reduced in patients with CHD compared to that of controls (all p < 0.001). In CHD patients, lnc-UCA1 was negatively correlated with miR-26a (p < 0.001) and miR-195 (p = 0.014). Besides, lnc-UCA1 was positively correlated with Gensini score (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (p = 0.019), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.002), and C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), while miR-26a (p < 0.001) and miR-195 (p = 0.002) were negatively correlated with Gensini score. What's more, lnc-UCA1 was positively correlated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (p = 0.004), interleukin (IL)-1β (p = 0.041), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (p = 0.010), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (p < 0.001). While miR-26a was negatively correlated with some of the individual inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules.
CONCLUSION: Lnc-UCA1, miR-26a, and miR-195 may serve as potential biomarkers for CHD management.
