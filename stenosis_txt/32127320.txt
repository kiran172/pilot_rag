Title: Use of the Covera Stent Graft for the Treatment of Dysfunctional or Thrombosed Arteriovenous Grafts: A Retrospective Analysis of 64 Patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Covera stent graft (SG) for the treatment of dysfunctional or thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Within 29 months (February 2016-August 2018), 79 patients underwent Covera SG placement in the authors' department for the treatment of dysfunctional AVGs. Data were available for 64 patients who underwent 64 procedures, using 64 devices. Minimum follow-up was 6 months, unless reintervention occurred. Mean follow-up was 277 days (6-923 days). Treatment characteristics were 51 cases with venous-graft anastomosis (VGA) stenosis (79.7%), 13 cases of puncture zone stenosis (20.3%), 14 cases of in SG stenosis (21.9%), 8 cases of pseudoaneurysm treatment (12.5%) (1 treatment area might have had more than 1 characteristic). Thirty-six patients presented with thrombosis (56.2%), and 31 of 64 case were de novo treatment areas (48.4%). Primary outcome measurements were technical success and post-intervention primary patency (PIPP) at 6 months, whereas secondary outcome measurements included factors influencing primary outcome.
RESULTS: Technical success was 100%. Median PIPP was 336 days, and 73.6% of treatment areas were patent at 6 months. There were no significant differences in terms of PIPP when de novo treatment areas were compared with restenotic areas (519 vs. 320 days, respectively; P = .1); patients who presented with versus those who presented without thrombosis (320 vs. 583 days, respectively; P = .07); puncture zone stenosis or elsewhere (329 vs. 686 days, respectively; P = .52); and VGA stenosis or elsewhere (336 vs. 335 days, respectively; P = .9).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Covera SG for AVG treatment was safe and effective in every type of treatment area presented in this retrospective analysis.
