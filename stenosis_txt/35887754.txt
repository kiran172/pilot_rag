Title: Postacute Laryngeal Injuries and Dysfunctions in COVID-19 Patients: A Scoping Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate post-acute laryngeal injuries and dysfunctions (PLID) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
METHODS: Three independent investigators performed a systematic review of the literature studying PLID in patients with a history of COVID-19. The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement. Epidemiological, clinical, hospitalization features, laryngeal diseases, and voice outcomes were extracted from the included papers.
RESULTS: Eight papers met our inclusion criteria (393 patients) corresponding to five uncontrolled prospective and three retrospective studies. The most prevalent PLID were vocal fold dysmotility (65%), vocal fold edema (35%), muscle tension dysphonia (21%), and laryngopharyngeal reflux (24%). Posterior glottic stenosis (12%), granuloma (14%), and posterior glottic diastasis (12%) were the most common injuries. Most patients with PLID were obese and had a history of intensive care unit hospitalization, and orotracheal intubation. The delay between the discharge and the laryngology office consultation ranged from 51 to 122 days. The mean duration of intubation ranged from 10 to 34 days. Seventy-eight (49%) intubated patients were in the prone position. The proportion of patients requiring surgical treatment ranged from 39% to 70% (mean = 48%). There was an important heterogeneity between studies about inclusion, exclusion criteria, and outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appeared to be associated with PLID, especially in patients with a history of intubation. However, future controlled studies are needed to evaluate if intubated COVID-19 patients reported more frequently PLID than patients who were intubated for other conditions.
