Title: Covered Cheatham-Platinum Stent for Treatment of Descending Thoracic Aortic Stenosis Caused by Takayasu Arteritis in Two Children.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic type of systemic large vessel vasculitis, mainly involving the aorta and its main branches. Both surgical and endovascular revascularization are effective methods for treating TA-related stenosis of the aorta and its branches. By December 2020, there have been very limited reports on the use of coated Cheatham-Platinum (CP) stents in the treatment of TA associated descending thoracic aortic stenosis. Two children with thoracic aortic stenosis caused by TA who received the covered CP stent in Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University were reported. The follow-up time was 1.5 years and 4 years, respectively. The covered cheatham-platinum (CP) stent may be an alternative treatment for TA associated children with descending aortic stenosis.
