Title: Use of Virtual Reality and Three-Dimensional Printing in the Surgical Planning of Slide Tracheoplasty.

Abstract: Purpose: To describe our experience using virtual reality (VR) and three-dimensional (3D) printing as complements for the surgical planning process of slide tracheoplasty (ST) in patients with congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS). Description: VR and 3D printing are used for the surgical planning of ST as a therapeutic option in three female patients under five years of age with CTS. Evaluation: We assessed the planned surgical procedure, procedural time, postoperative complications, and outcomes, as well as the main surgeon's experience with the use of the applied technologies. Conclusions: The interaction within the VR environment allowed for collaboration of the surgical plan between surgical staff and enhancement of the radiologist-surgeon communication, while procedural simulation with 3D printing prototypes allowed for refining technical abilities for the surgical interventions. Based on our experience, the application of these technologies have added value to the surgical planning of ST and its outcomes in the treatment of CTS.
