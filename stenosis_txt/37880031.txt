Title: Preoperative diagnostic value of coronary CT angiography in acute Stanford type A aortic dissection involving the coronary arteries.

Abstract: AIM: To assess the diagnostic value of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) with coronary artery involvement and to evaluate whether CCTA could provide potentially useful information for selecting the surgical method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with ATAAD treated from January 2019 to December 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. Involvement of the coronary arteries based on CCTA findings were grouped into three major types and five subtypes. Interobserver and intraobserver diagnostic agreement for five subtypes were determined. The patients were divided into the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and non-CABG groups, and the proportions of the five subtypes between the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were enrolled in this study. Interobserver and intraobserver diagnostic agreement were both substantial in the left and right coronary arteries. Overall, the proportions of the five subtypes of coronary artery involvement were significantly different between the two groups (p<0.001). The proportion of Type A was elevated in the non-CABG group compared with the CABG group (22.6% versus 71.9%); by contrast, the proportions of Type B1 (35.5% versus 14.1%), Type B2 (19.4% versus 10.9%), Type C1 (6.5% versus 0%), and Type C2 (16.1% versus 3.1%) were elevated in the CABG group.
CONCLUSION: CCTA is reliable in evaluating coronary artery involvement by ATAAD. The present retrospective study indicated that CABG may be considered if the intimal flap disrupts the coronary orifice and causes luminal stenosis >50%, particularly Type B, or if an intimal tear occurs in the coronary orifice (Type C), which deserve further validation through prospective studies.
