Title: Correlation between Carotid Stenosis Degree and Blood Pressure Variability in Patients with Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenosis is one of the most serious diseases that endanger human health in contemporary times. It is a frequently occurring and common disease of the middle-aged and elderly people. Its incidence is increasing year by year, bringing a heavy economic burden to society and families. Whether there is a relationship between the degree of carotid artery stenosis and blood pressure variability is less studied.
AIMS: To investigate the correlation between the degree of carotid stenosis and blood pressure variability in patients with carotid stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 200 patients with carotid artery stenosis who were treated in our hospital from January 2017 to January 2020 were selected as the subjects of prospective study and were divided into mild stenosis according to the degree of carotid stenosis (carotid artery stenosis rate was 0-50%), moderate stenosis (carotid artery stenosis rate was between 50% and 70%), severe stenosis (carotid artery stenosis rateâ‰§70%), and the control group with 50 cases each. The correlations between the hemodynamics, the degree of carotid artery stenosis, and blood pressure variability in patients with carotid artery stenosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: The levels of 24hSSD, 24hDSD, dSSD, dDSD, and nSSD in the mild stenosis group and moderate stenosis group were significantly higher than those in the control group. In the stenosis group, the levels of 24hSSD, 24hDSD, dSSD, dDSD, and nSSD in the severe stenosis group were significantly higher than those in the moderate stenosis group, with statistical significance (P &lt; 0.05). The levels of PSV, EDV, and MV in the mild stenosis group and moderate stenosis group were lower than those in the control group, while the PI and RI indexes were higher than those in the control group. PI and RI levels were significantly higher than those in the mild stenosis group and moderate stenosis group (P &lt; 0.05). Logistic analysis showed that EDV (P = 0.001, OR = 2.245, 95%CI = 1.638 ~ 3.078), SSD (P = 0.014, OR = 0.725, 95%CI = 0.528 ~ 0.996), and PSV (P = 0.001, OR = 1.970, 95%CI = 1.300 ~ 2.990) were closely related to the degree of carotid artery stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Hemodynamics and blood pressure variability are related to the severity of carotid stenosis, which provides a reference and basis for clinical treatment of carotid stenosis.
