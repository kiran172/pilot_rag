Title: Aortic valve intervention rates in patients of different ethnicity with severe aortic stenosis in Leicestershire, UK.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To explore the ethnic differences in patients undergoing aortic valve (AV) intervention for severe aortic stenosis (AS) in Leicestershire, UK.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of all surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) at a single tertiary centre between April 2017 and March 2022, using local registry data.
RESULTS: Of the 1231 SAVR and 815 TAVI performed, 6.5% and 3.7% were in ethnic minority patients, respectively. Based on the 2011 Census data for those with a Leicestershire postcode, crude cumulative rate of SAVR (n=489) was 0.64 per 1000 population overall and 0.69, 0.46 and 0.36 in White, Asian and Black populations, respectively; and 0.50 per 1000 population overall for TAVI (n=383), with 0.59, 0.16 and 0.06 for White, Asian and Black populations, respectively. Asians undergoing SAVR and TAVI were 5 and 3â€‰years younger, respectively, than white patients with more comorbidities and a worse functional status.The age-adjusted cumulative rates for SAVR were 0.62 vs 0.72 per 1000 population for White and Asian patients and 0.51 vs 0.39 for TAVI. Asians were less likely to undergo SAVR and TAVI than White patients, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.66 (0.50-0.87) and 0.27 (0.18-0.43), respectively, but the age-adjusted RR was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The crude rates of AV interventions are lower in Asian patients compared with the White population in Leicestershire, although age-adjusted rates were not statistically different. Further research to determine the sociodemographic differences in prevalence, incidence, mechanisms and treatment of AS across the UK is required.
