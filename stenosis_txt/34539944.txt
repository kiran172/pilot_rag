Title: Hydrocalyx presenting as lumbar pain. A case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: Hydrocalyx is an obstructed renal calyx from infundibulo-pelvic diminution or stenosis which leads to dilatation of the calyx. It becomes clinically important when associated with flank pains, haematuria, infection, renal impairment or stone formation. On intravenous urography the finding of a cystic dilatation of a calyx that communicates with the renal pelvis supports the diagnosis. This case is A 50-year-old man with recurrent flank pains who was diagnosed with left hydrocalyx on a Computed Tomography Urography (CT Urography). He opted for conservative management. Management of hydrocalyx can be conservative for patients without significant renal damage or symptoms and surgical with nephron sparing intent for those who have severe symptoms and complications.
