Title: [Stent angioplasty for internal carotid artery stenosis].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stent angioplasty of carotid stenosis has become established as aÂ safe and efficient treatment method alongside carotid endarterectomy due to developments in stent design and refinement of interventional techniques. Today, the protocol for stent angioplasty is largely standardized.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide sound insight into the development and current practice of stent angioplasty. Particular attention is paid to technical implementation and periprocedural management.
