Title: Investigation of Effectiveness of Pulsed Radiofrequency With Multifunctional Epidural Electrode for Low Back Pain.

Abstract: AIM: Low back pain affects many people at some point in their life. Whenever pharmacologic and other conservative treatments of chronic pain fail, ablative and interventional methods are attempted on the assumption that interrupting nerve conduction prevents central pain cognition. Pulsed radiofrequency using multifunctional epidural electrodes can be used for multiple etiologies of chronic low back and leg pain with a low complication rate and minimal side effects.
METHODS: The records of the 188 patients who underwent pulsed radiofrequency with multifunctional epidural electrode between October 2014 and March 2017 in Algology clinic were examined retrospectively. Visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, response to straight leg raising test (SLR), lumbar range of motion, analgesic use, patient satisfaction score, need for open operation or other interventional procedure were collected.
RESULTS: VAS and SLR tests were found to be significantly improved compared with the preoperative values. The VAS scores at the 10th day and first, third and sixth months were significantly decreased compared to baseline scores (p<0.001). Also, SLR tests were significantly improved compared to baseline scores at the same intervals (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Pulsed radiofrequency with multifunctional epidural electrode is a safe and effective method for low back pain which is caused by several pathologies.
