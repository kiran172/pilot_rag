Title: Comprehensive Interventional treatment for severe central airway collapse caused by Relapsing Polychondritis: A case report.

Abstract: Relapsing Polychondritis (RP) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease. One major cause of death for patients with RP is severe tracheobronchial tree collapse. Treatment guidelines for RP are mainly based on case reports. We report a rare and challenging case of RP in a patient who experienced asphyxia due to severe central airway collapse. The patient had previously been misdiagnosed with refractory asthma due to recurrent wheezing. Following interventions including bronchoscopic laser tracheobronchoplasty, stent placement, corticosteroid therapy, and both invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, the patient was successfully stabilized and subsequently discharged from the hospital. Notably, after discharge, the patient did not require rehospitalisation for worsening respiratory symptoms and was managed with only a gradually tapering glucocorticoid regimen. In our case report, stent placement rapidly relieved asphyxia due to severe tracheobronchial stenosis, and laser tracheobronchoplasty may be a potential cure for diffuse airway collapse due to RP.
