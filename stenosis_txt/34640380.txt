Title: The Common Combination of Aortic Stenosis with Mitral Regurgitation: Diagnostic Insight and Therapeutic Implications in the Modern Era of Advanced Echocardiography and Percutaneous Intervention.

Abstract: The combination of aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR) is common in patients with degenerative valvular disease. It is characterized by having complex pathophysiology, leading to potential diagnostic pitfalls. Evidence is scarce in the literature to direct the diagnostic framework and treatment of patients with this particular combination of multiple valvular diseases. In this complex scenario, the appropriate use of advanced echocardiography and multimodality imaging methods plays a central role. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement or repair and transcatheter aortic valve replacement widen the surgical options for valve diseases. Therefore, there is an increasing need to reconsider the function, timing, and mode intervention for patients with a combination of AS with MR towards more personalized treatment.
