Title: Pathological Intraplaque Hemorrhage as the Gold Standard to Assess the Efficacy of Ultrasound in Predicting Vulnerable Carotid Plaque Rupture.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical utility of ultrasound in predicting the risk of carotid vulnerable plaque rupture using pathological intraplaque hemorrhage as the gold standard.
METHODS: A total of 118 patients who underwent endarterectomy due to symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were enrolled. Conventional ultrasound assessed the plaque thickness, area stenosis rate, echo, and surface morphology. Neovascularization were assessed by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and tracing intraplaque nonenhanced areas. According to neovascularization grade (0-4), plaques were classified as low-, intermediate-, and high risk. Fresh intraplaque hemorrhage within the pathology was adopted as the gold standard for diagnosing plaque rupture risk. Thus, we divided patients into ruptured risk and nonruptured risk groups to assess the value of crucial factors for plaque rupture risk using ultrasound.
RESULTS: Of the 118 patients, hypertension accounted for 71.2%, hyperlipidemia 68.6%, diabetes 52.5%, and statin history 64.4%. In the rupture risk group, diabetes, smoking, and stenosis rate were significantly higher than the nonrupture risk group (P < .001); plaque thickness ≥4 mm (P > .05); and mainly hypoechoic with irregular surface morphology (P < .001), nonenhanced areas in the plaques (P < .001), and neovascularization >grade 2 (P < .001). Compared with the low-risk group, plaque rupture risk was 7.219 times higher in the medium-risk group and 18.333 times higher in the high-risk group. The kappa value of the interobserver consistency of crucial ultrasound parameters was >0.75, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.919 (P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Both conventional ultrasound and CEUS have significant clinical importance in the prediction of rupture risk in vulnerable carotid plaques, thereby enabling stroke risk stratification and the assessment of plaque rupture risk.
