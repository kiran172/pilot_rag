Title: Future of Endovascular and Surgical Treatments of Atherosclerotic Intracranial Stenosis.

Abstract: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease and resultant intracranial stenosis is a global leading cause of stroke, and poses an ongoing treatment challenge. Among patients with intracranial stenosis, those with hemodynamic compromise are at high risk for recurrent stroke despite medical therapy and risk factor modification. Revascularization of the hypoperfused territory is the most plausible treatment strategy for these high-risk patients, yet surgical and endovascular therapies have not yet shown to be sufficiently safe and effective in randomized controlled trials. Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies have led to a resurgence of interest in surgical and endovascular treatment strategies, with a growing body of evidence to support their further evaluation in the treatment of select patient populations. This review outlines the current and emerging endovascular and surgical treatments and highlights promising future management strategies.
