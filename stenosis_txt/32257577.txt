Title: Solitary osteochondroma of the cervical spine presenting with quadriparesis and hand contracture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spinal osteochondromas are rare, benign tumors arising from the cartilaginous elements of the spine that may appear as solitary lesions versus multiple lesions in patients with hereditary multiple exostoses. Here, we present a 15-year-old female with a solitary C3-C4 osteochondroma who presented with a progressive quadriparesis and hand contracture successfully managed with a laminectomy/posterior spinal fusion.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 15-year-old female presented with a 3-month history of progressive quadriparesis and hand contracture secondary to a magnetic resonance (MR) documented C3-C4 cervical spine osteochondroma. The MR imaging revealed a solitary osseous extramedullary outgrowth arising from the left laminar cortex of the C-3 vertebral body extending to C-4. Due to the marked resultant canal stenosis, the patient underwent a cervical laminectomy of C3- C4 with posterior spinal fusion. Gross total resection was achieved, and the pathology confirmed an osteochondroma. The patient's myelopathy resolved, and 2 years later, she demonstrated no residual deficits or tumor recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Here, we report the successful management of a 15-year-old female with a C3-C4 osteochondroma and progressive quadriparesis through cervical laminectomy/fusion.
