Title: Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Bilateral Ileal Ureter Replacement With Extracorporeal Ileal Segment Preparation for Bilateral Extensive Ureteral Strictures: The Initial Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present our initial experience and evaluate perioperative, and follow-up outcomes following the novel technique of robot-assisted laparoscopic bilateral ileal ureter replacement (IUR) with extracorporeal ileal segment preparation for bilateral extensive ureteral strictures (BEUS).
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 4 consecutive patients with BEUS undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic bilateral IUR with extracorporeal ileal segment preparation between June 2021 and October 2021. A 4-arm technique was used. The demographic characteristics, perioperative data, and follow-up outcomes as well as the description of surgical technique were reported.
RESULTS: All the patients had BEUS, and the length of strictures was over 10.ßcm in both sides. All procedures were performed effectively with a median operative time of 312.5.ßminutes (range 227-433) and a median estimated blood loss of 75.ßmL (range 50-200). In one patient, additional partial small bowel resection procedure was performed. No case was converted to open surgery. The median length of the ileal graft was 29.ßcm (range 15-32). The median postoperative hospitalization was 10 days (range 6-13). Two patients developed metabolic acidosis, and no major complications during the perioperative and follow-up period were reported. All patients presented symptom-free, with no signs of restenosis and improved/stabilized hydronephrosis, during the median follow-up of 12 months (range 12-15).
CONCLUSION: We present the details and initial experience of robot-assisted laparoscopic bilateral IUR with extracorporeal ileal segment preparation. According to the median follow-up of 12 months, this minimally invasive procedure is a safe, feasible, and effective approach in the management of BEUS.
