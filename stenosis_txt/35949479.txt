Title: Mid and long-term follow-up of 50 pediatric cardiac Chadians operated in France from 2003 to 2012.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: cardiac valvular diseases (CVDs) are the major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality globally, with predominance of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in developing countries. Congenital heart defects (CHD) diagnoses are delayed due to socioeconomic factors. This study aims to evaluate the post-operative surgical outcomes of CHD and valvular RHD.
METHODS: this study is conducted with 50 patients from Chad, operated on between 2003 and 2012. Post-operative outcomes are evaluated from 2010 to 2012.
RESULTS: with the follow-up of 19 RHD patients who underwent plasty, 8 (42.1%) had no complications, 4 (21%) presented with mild regurgitation, 7 (36.8%) required re-operation due to 6 mitral stenosis (MS) cases (mitral surface range from 0.7 to 1.2 cm2) and 1 severe mitral regurgitation (MR) case. While those patients with valve replacement, 2 (50%) had no complications, 1 (25%) had mild regurgitation and 1 (25%) patient died. Two patients with aortic regurgitation (AR) that underwent annuloplasty presented with severe regurgitation. Regarding AR with valve replacement, 3 (60%) had no complications, and 2 (40%) had mild regurgitation. Among the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) patients who had plasty, 6 (85.7%) had no complications, and 1 (14.3%) had severe regurgitation. The surgical repair was curative in all CHD patients. The loss to follow-up rate was 13/50 (26%).
CONCLUSION: the annuloplasty on rheumatic valve disease (MR and AR) has proven to be disappointing. Plasty is debated without justified indication for AR. The outcomes of CHD, mitral and aortic valve replacement are successful.
