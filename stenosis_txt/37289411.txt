Title: Longitudinal Comparative Analysis of Complications and Subsequent Interventions Following Stand-Alone Interspinous Spacers, Open Decompression, or Fusion for Lumbar Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: For individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), minimally invasive procedures such as an interspinous spacer device without decompression or fusion (ISD) or open surgery (i.e., open decompression or fusion) may relieve symptoms and improve functions when patients fail to respond to conservative therapies. This research compares longitudinal postoperative outcomes and rates of subsequent interventions between LSS patients treated with ISD and those with open decompression or fusion as their first surgical intervention.
METHODS: This retrospective, comparative claims analysis identified patients age ≥ 50 years with LSS diagnosis and with a qualifying procedure during 2017-2021 in the Medicare database which includes healthcare encounters in inpatient and outpatient settings. Patients were followed from the qualifying procedure until end of data availability. The outcomes assessed during the follow-up included subsequent surgical interventions, including subsequent fusion and lumbar spine surgeries, long-term complications, and short-term life-threatening events. Additionally, the costs to Medicare during a 3-year follow-up were calculated. Cox proportional hazards, logistic regression, and generalized linear models were used to compare outcomes and costs, adjusted for baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 400,685 patients who received a qualifying procedure were identified (mean age 71.5 years, 50.7% male). Compared to ISD patients, patients receiving open surgery (i.e., decompression and/or fusion) were more likely to have a subsequent fusion [hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.49 (1.17, 1.89)-2.54 (2.00, 3.23)] or other lumbar spine surgery [HR (CI): 3.05 (2.18, 4.27)-5.72 (4.08, 8.02)]. Short-term life-threatening events [odds ratio (CI): 2.42 (2.03, 2.88)-6.36 (5.33, 7.57)] and long-term complications [HR (CI): 1:31 (1.13, 1.52)-2.38 (2.05, 2.75)] were more likely among the open surgery cohorts. Adjusted mean index costs were lowest for decompression alone (US$7001) and highest for fusion alone ($33,868). ISD patients had significantly lower 1-year complication-related costs than all surgery cohorts and lower 3-year all-cause costs than fusion cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: ISD resulted in lower risks of short- and long-term complications and lower long-term costs than open decompression and fusion surgeries as a first surgical intervention for LSS.
