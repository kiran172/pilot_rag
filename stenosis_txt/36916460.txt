Title: Enlargement of opisthenar microcirculatory area predicts impaired heart function in severe acute coronary syndrome patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Impaired microcirculation in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients manifests inadequate recovery and adverse clinical outcome. Here, we analyzed correlations between peripheral microcirculation and heart function in ACS patients.
METHODS: Opisthenar microvessel area (OMA) were measured with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), cardiac functional indexes (echocardiograph) were assessed 48-72 h after therapeutic interventions.
RESULTS: Results showed that OMA normalized with heart rate (OMA-HR) were significantly greater in ACS patients with percutaneous intervention (ACS-PCI, n = 25, stenosis &gt;80%) compared to those with pharmacological intervention (ACS-PI, n = 23, stenosis &lt;50%, p = .02). Ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), which were not different between two groups, showed negative correlations with OMA-HR in ACS-PCI (EF: r = -0.512, p = .009; FS: r = -0.594, p = .002). Cardiac output (CO) inversely correlated with OMA-HR in both groups (r = -0.697, p &lt; .0001; r = -0.527, p = .01). Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on admission was greater in ACS-PCI group. NLR, which was negatively associated with EF or FS, was positively associated with OMA-HR in all patients. The area under the curve (AUC) for OMA-HR was 0.683 (specificity 0.696 and sensitivity 0.72, p = .02). OMA-HR at &gt;376.5 μm2 predicts reduced FS and CO (p = .002, p = .005, respectively). Summary OMA-HR predicts inadequate recovery of the heart in severe ACS patients post-PCI.
