Title: Comparison of early-stage stenosis and regurgitation results among patients who underwent aortic valve repair.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to analyse the results of paediatric aortic valve repairs in our institution.
METHOD: The data of 57 patients under 18 years of age who underwent aortic valve repair between 2014 and 2019 were retrospectively analysed. Early postoperative reoperation and hospital mortality rates were evaluated based on the ages of the patients, their preoperative diagnoses, and the surgical techniques used. Survival curves for groups of patients were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: The rate of reoperation was 14% (n = 8), and there were no significant differences regarding valve pathologies and preoperative diagnoses (p > 0.05). Among the repair techniques, tricuspidisation was considered to be a risk factor for reoperation (p < 0.05). Augmentation, the material used (0.1 PTFE or pericardium), and the number of cusps were not found to have significant effects on reoperation or mortality. The mean follow-up period was 29.86 Â± 21.30 months. The survival rates of the patients were 88%, 100%, and 88.2% for those with aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, and mixed disease, respectively, and no significant difference was found when these rates were evaluated with the log-rank test (p > 0.05). The mortality rate was 8.8% (n = 5), and undergoing surgery before the age of 1 year was found to be significant in terms of mortality (p = 0.032, p < 0.05). The bicuspid aortic valve group had the lowest mortality risk, while the Shone complex group had the highest.
CONCLUSION: With its acceptable reoperation and mortality rates, aortic valve repair should be the first choice of treatment in the paediatric age group. Early results were satisfactory in all groups.
