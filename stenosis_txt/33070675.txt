Title: Demographic, Regional, and State-Level Trends of Mortality in Patients With Aortic Stenosis in United States, 2008 to 2018.

Abstract: Background Aortic stenosis-related mortality might vary across demographic subsets, regions, and states in the United States. Methods and Results We reviewed the death certificate data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging OnLine Data for Epidemiologic Research database to examine aortic stenosis-related mortality trends from 2008 to 2018. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100 000 people and annual percentage change with 95% CIs were calculated. Between 2008 and 2018, AAMR reduced from 12.7 to 11.5 (average annual percentage change, -1.0 [95% CI, -1.5 to -0.5]), because of an accelerated decline between 2015 and 2018 (annual percentage change, -4.4 [95% CI, -6.0 to -2.7]). Older (aged >85 years), male, and White patients had higher death rates than younger, female, and non-White patients, respectively. Although mortality reduction was similar across sexes, significant mortality reduction was limited to White patients only. The AAMRs were higher in rural than urban areas. States with AAMRs >90th percentile were distributed in the West and the Northeast, and <10th percentile in the South. The AAMRs for sex and race were highest in the West and lowest in the South. None of the states located in the Midwest showed a significant reduction in mortality. Mortality remained stable for hospital setting and nursing home/long-term care facility, except that the number of deaths increased at home and hospice facility since 2014. Conclusions The reduction in mortality in patients with aortic stenosis was not consistent among demographic subsets and states. The substantial public health and economic implications call for determination of underlying clinical and socioeconomic factors to narrow the gap.
