Title: Risk Assessment of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Preexisting Right Bundle Branch Block.

Abstract: Preexisting right bundle branch block (RBBB) is the strongest predictor for permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, the risk assessment for new PPI and effective procedural strategy for preventing new PPI in patients with preexisting RBBB are still unclear. This study stratified the new PPI risk after TAVI and investigated the impact of implantation strategy in a preexisting RBBB cohort. We analyzed 237 patients with preexisting RBBB who underwent TAVI. The primary endpoint was the incidence of new PPI. Multivariate analyses investigating predictors for new PPI were performed. The overall PPI rate was 33.3%. Significant baseline predictors for new PPI were combination of RBBB, left anterior or posterior fascicular block, and first-degree atrioventricular block (odds ratio [OR] 2.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 5.04), high calcium volume of noncoronary cusp (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.10), and membranous septum (MS) length <2 mm (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.75) in the univariate analysis and MS length <2 mm (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.82) in the multivariate analysis. On the multivariate analysis including procedural variables, predilatation (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.01 to 5.83), self-expanding valves (Corevalve, Evolut R, and Evolut Pro/Pro+; Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota) or mechanical expanding valves (Lotus/Lotus Edge; Boston Scientifics, Marlborough, Massachusetts) (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.31 to 6.91), and implantation depth > MS length (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.81 to 10.08) were significantly associated with new PPI. The incidence of new PPI increased according to the number of baseline predictors (0: 20.9%, 1: 34.3%, and ≥2: 52.0%) and procedural predictors (0: 3.7%, 1: 20.9%, 2: 40.5%, and 3: 60.0%). New PPI risk in a preexisting RBBB subset could be stratified by baseline factors. Device selection and implantation strategy considering MS length could prevent new PPI even in these high-risk population.
