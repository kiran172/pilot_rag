Title: Clinical history and management of bicuspid aortic valve in children and adolescents.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is one of the most common congenital heart defects in children, adolescents and adults. BAV can occur as an isolated lesion or in association with other congenital heart defects, such as coarctation of the aorta or genetic syndromes like Turner syndrome. Although the majority of long term complications associated with BAV manifest later in life, children and adolescents may present with early onset valvular dysfunction or dilation of the aorta. BAV is a heterogeneous disease with a wide array of presentations at various ages, depending on the degree of aortic valve dysfunction, aortic dilation and presence of associated lesions. Aortic valve stenosis and/or regurgitation are the primary indications for intervention in children and adolescents with BAV. Although a majority of young patients with BAV also have some aortic dilation, interventions on the aorta are very rare during this time frame. Children and adolescents with BAV benefit from comprehensive assessment of their risk profile to determine follow-up surveillance intervals, sports recommendations, and timing of surgical intervention. The morphologic phenotype of BAV is important to identify, as it may predict future complications and prognosis.
