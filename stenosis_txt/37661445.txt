Title: Circumferential Stenosis of the Second Part of the Duodenum Caused by Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis.

Abstract: Isolated eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) of the second part of the duodenum is rare. We herein report a case of EGE limited to the second part of the duodenum that caused circumferential stenosis due to massive wall thickening. A boring biopsy was useful to verify the accumulation of eosinophils. Induction of remission by prednisolone was accompanied by a marked reduction in the mRNA expression of interleukin-6, C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), and CCL26 without any reduction in prototypical EGE-associated T helper type 2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13). Thus, the enhanced expression of IL-6, CCL17, and CCL26 might be involved in the development of EGE in this case.
