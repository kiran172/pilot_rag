Title: Laparoscopic treatment of symptomatic Dunbar syndrome: a case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Dunbar syndrome is a rare disorder due to the external compression of the celiac trunk by the median arcuate ligament. The symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting with a significative reduction in patients' quality of life. Laparoscopy has proven to be a safe procedure. The aim of this study is to present a case of Dunbar syndrome undergoing laparoscopic surgery.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old male patient presented at Emergency Room with upper abdominal pain and dyspepsia, related to food intake. A selective arteriography of the celiac trunk revealed stenosis due to compression of the celiac artery.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Laparoscopic decompression of the celiac trunk by the median arcuate ligament was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 5th postoperative day.
CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive surgical division of the arcuate ligament is feasible and safe and it can restore patients' quality of life.
