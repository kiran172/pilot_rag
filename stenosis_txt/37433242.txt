Title: Budd-Chiari-like syndrome in a dog secondary to a gunshot wound treated with balloon angioplasty and endovascular stent placement.

Abstract: A 6-year-old female spayed Chihuahua mix presented with chronic recurrent ascites. Computed tomographic angiography revealed an isolated stenosis of the caudal vena cava secondary to a metallic foreign body, resulting in Budd-Chiari-like syndrome. Balloon angioplasty and endovascular stent placement successfully resolved the obstruction with long-term resolution of ascites.
