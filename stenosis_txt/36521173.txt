Title: Cranial Dislocation of Infrarenal Aortic Endoprostheses During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: This report describes the complexity of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in which rare complications sometimes occur, even at experienced centers. This is a case of cranial migration of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm endograft while advancing the balloon-expandable prosthesis through the infrarenal aorta, which was subsequently successfully treated by deploying a thoracic endoprosthesis after deployment of the aortic valve bioprosthesis.
