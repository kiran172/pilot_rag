Title: Primary Conservative Therapy for Symptomatic Isolated Mesenteric Artery Dissection with Severely Compressed True Lumen or Large Dissecting Aneurysm.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the safety and effectiveness of primary conservative therapy for patients with symptomatic isolated mesenteric artery dissection (IMAD) with a severely compressed true lumen and/or a large dissecting aneurysm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 consecutive patients (all men; median age, 53 y) with symptomatic IMAD with a severely compressed true lumen and/or a large dissecting aneurysm but without intestinal necrosis or arterial rupture who were treated with primary conservative therapy between November 2018 and February 2020 were assessed. A severely compressed true lumen was defined as luminal stenosis > 70%. A large dissecting aneurysm was defined as dissecting aneurysm diameter ≥ 1.5 times larger than the normal mesenteric artery diameter.
RESULTS: There was a strong positive relationship among abdominal pain, degree of luminal stenosis, and length of dissection (R = 0.811; P < .001). Conservative treatment was successful in all patients. Abdominal pain was eliminated within 4.7 d ± 4.8 (range, 2-31 d) in all patients, within 3.6 d ± 1.2 (range, 2-6) in the 31 patients with minor or moderate abdominal pain, and within 13.3 d ± 11.9 (range, 6-31 d) in the 4 patients with severe abdominal pain. Complete or partial remodeling of the mesenteric artery was achieved in 6 (17.1%) and 29 (82.9%) patients, respectively, during 8.6 mo ± 4.3 of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary conservative therapy can be used safely and effectively in patients with symptomatic IMAD with a severely compressed true lumen and/or a large dissecting aneurysm but without intestinal necrosis or arterial rupture.
