Title: Laser-Assisted Sialolithotripsy: A Correlation of Objective and Subjective Outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the long-term symptomatic results of laser-assisted sialolithotripsy (LAS) in cases of obstructive sialolithiasis and correlate with objective criteria using diagnostic sialendoscopy (DS) as a method of examination.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study comprising 50 consecutive patients who underwent holmium-YAG LAS and completed follow-up of at least 6 months. Symptom scoring and endoscopic scoring were done at 6 weeks and 6 months intervals for further study purposes.
RESULTS: At the end of 6 weeks post-LAS, 70% patients were asymptomatic (A-sym) and only 30% had residual symptoms (Sym). However, obstructed duct (OB-duct) was observed on endoscopic scoring in 88% due to stenosis, residual stones, or both stenosis and residual stones. The obstructed ducts were treated in outpatient clinic and followed up over time, leading to 98% of patients being in A-sym group at the end of study period of 6 months. At the end of study, 82% of patients had clear duct (CL-duct).
CONCLUSION: Holmium LAS is a viable option for the management of intermediate-sized stones. LAS if used judiciously, and in properly selected cases, has high rate of stone fragmentation and symptom resolution. A vigilant postoperative protocol taking into account residual mealtime symptoms and altered salivary characteristics combined with early DS can help identify and treat patients with residual stone fragments and ductal stenosis.
