Title: MicroRNA-331 and microRNA-151-3p as biomarkers in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Abstract: We sought to analyse plasma levels of peripheral blood microRNAs (miRs) as biomarkers of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to type-1 myocardial infarction as a model situation of vulnerable plaque (VP) rupture. Samples of 20 patients with STEMI were compared both with a group of patients without angina pectoris in whom coronary angiogram did not reveal coronary atherosclerotic disease (no coronary atherosclerosis-NCA) and a group of patients with stable angina pectoris and at least one significant coronary artery stenosis (stable coronary artery disease-SCAD). This study design allowed us to identify miRs deregulated in the setting of acute coronary artery occlusion due to VP rupture. Based on an initial large scale miR assay screening, we selected a total of 12 miRs (three study miRs and nine controls) that were tested in the study. Two of the study miRs (miR-331 and miR-151-3p) significantly distinguished STEMI patients from the control groups, while ROC analysis confirmed their suitability as biomarkers. Importantly, this was observed in patients presenting early with STEMI, even before the markers of myocardial necrosis (cardiac troponin I, miR-208 and miR-499) were elevated, which suggests that the origin of miR-331 and miR-151-3p might be in the VP. In conclusion, the study provides two novel biomarkers observed in STEMI, which may be associated with plaque rupture.
