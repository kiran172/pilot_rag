Title: Pathogenesis, Evaluation, and Management of Pulmonary Vein Stenosis: JACC Review Topic of the Week.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) can arise from several etiologies, including congenital, acquired, and iatrogenic sources. PVS presents insidiously, leading to significant delays in diagnosis. A high index of suspicion and dedicated noninvasive evaluation are key to diagnosis. Once diagnosed, both noninvasive and invasive evaluation may afford further insights into the relative contribution of PVS to symptoms. Treatment of underlying reversible pathologies coupled with transcatheter balloon angioplasty and stenting for persistent severe stenoses are established approaches. Ongoing refinements in diagnostic modalities, interventional approaches, postintervention monitoring, and medical therapies hold promise to further improve patient outcomes.
