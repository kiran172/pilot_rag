Title: Hemi-double stapling technique performed with a transorally inserted anvil for esophagojejunostomy in the surgical treatment of gastric cancer.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: A transorally inserted anvil has been developed to facilitate the creation of a stapled anastomosis without the need for a purse string to secure the anvil into place during laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG). We describe a hemi-double stapling technique and application of a transorally inserted anvil for esophagojejunostomy during LTG, and we report the results of a retrospective study in which we examined the feasibility and safety of this method. We also describe the key technical details of the method.
METHODS: Our anastomotic method has four chief features: (a) the esophagus is cut at a slant, and its left cut end is cut and punched for the hemi-double stapling technique; (b) the anvil and circular stapler are connected, placing the distal jejunum in cranial traction; (c) a single layer of sutures is used to correct dog-earing and overlapping, and these points are completely closed with Lembert sutures; and (d) the jejunal limb is fixed to the duodenal stump to prevent kinking of the jejunal limb and to decrease tension on the anastomosis.
RESULTS: This method has been used in 53 patients thus far. LTG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction was successful in all patients, and there was no need for conversion to open surgery. The mean operative time was 313â€‰minutes, and the mean blood loss was 106 mL. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 18 days. There was no anastomotic leakage or stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Hemi-double stapling technique with a transorally inserted anvil for LTG can be performed safely and easily and safely. It can also product good outcomes.
