Title: A rare case of eosinophilic jejunitis: diagnosis and management strategies.

Abstract: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare disease with an unknown cause, which can manifest independently or as part of a hyper-eosinophilic syndrome. The severity of the condition depends on the extent of eosinophilic infiltration and damage to the digestive tract. Diagnosis relies on histological examination, which reveals a significant presence of eosinophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the digestive wall. The authors present a new case of eosinophilic gastroenteritis in a 28-year-old patient who exhibited obstructive symptoms but lacked peripheral eosinophilia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no abnormalities, but barium transit imaging revealed gastro-duodeno-jejunal dilation upstream of a tight jejunal stenosis. Surgical examination of the affected area confirmed a diffuse and transparietal eosinophilic infiltrate, with no evidence of parasitic or granulomatous lesions. Fortunately, the patient had a swift recovery following surgery. Biopsies conducted at other locations, including the gastric, hepatic, and medullary levels, produced negative results, indicating the localized nature of the condition.
