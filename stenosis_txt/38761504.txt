Title: Basilar artery stenting in hyperacute stroke: A systematic review of published cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Basilar artery stenting is a rescue therapy in the management of hyperacute stroke. Published data on efficacy and safety are limited.
METHODS: A systematic review of published studies was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria were adult patients with ischemic stroke with permanent basilar artery stent placement within 48 h of onset. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Additional cases from our institution were identified via a local stroke registry.
RESULTS: Of 212 screened articles, patient-level data was reported in 35 studies (87 individuals) and six additional patients were included from our registry. Patients (n = 93, 63 % male; median age 64) most often presented with mid-basilar occlusion (52 %) and 76 % received treatment within 12 hours of onset. Favorable angiographic results occurred in 67 %. The final modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) was 0-3 for 56 % of patients; mortality was 29 %. Those with complete flow post-procedure were more likely to have a final mRS of 0-3 (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In 93 cases of basilar stenting in hyperacute stroke, favourable angiographic and functional outcomes were reported in 67 % and 56 % of patients, respectively. International multicenter registries are required to establish benefit and identify patient and technical factors that predict favorable outcomes.
