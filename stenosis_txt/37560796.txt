Title: Aorta to Right Ventricular Fistula Status Post-TAVR.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive procedure that involves replacing a damaged aortic valve using a catheter, typically inserted through a small incision in the leg, leading to faster recovery and reduced risks compared with traditional open-heart surgery. It is a common procedure; however, it is not without adverse events. We report a case of an 83-year-old man who underwent TAVR for the indication of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Shortly thereafter, he complained of progressive shortness of breath and was hospitalized for acute on chronic heart failure. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was the first indication of a potential aorta to right ventricular fistula, and this was confirmed by a cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA). He underwent a period of medical observation but did not do well, requiring re-admission to the hospital for acute on chronic heart failure. He was ultimately treated by percutaneous low-profile shunt closure using a septal occluder device. Percutaneous shunt closure in symptomatic patients using percutaneous low-profile shunt closure devices seems to be the best treatment option in high surgical risk patients.
