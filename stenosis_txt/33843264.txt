Title: Difficulty in articulation following left progressive blurred vision.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report a case of Paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) caused by severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and discuss the correlation between PAMM and ICA stenosis.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old male patient presented with left acute blurred vision for 1â€‰week. The best-corrected visual acuity of the left eye was 0.01. Funduscopic examination showed multiple grayish patches around the left macula. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated train-track hyperreflective lesions over the inner nuclear layer of the left eye. Afterwards, he experienced sudden slurred speech with fair comprehension. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography of the brain demonstrated left lacunar infarction with severe left ICA stenosis. After anticoagulant therapy, his dysarthria and left visual acuity were improved significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, PAMM in coincidence with lacunar infarction induced by ICA stenosis is firstly described in the literature. PAMM could be a critical warning of ICA stenosis, and this case can alert ophthalmologists to survey ICA stenosis in patients with PAMM.
