Title: [Acute interventions-dialysis shunt recanalization].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: An arteriovenous fistula is vital for patients who need regular hemodialysis. Continuous patency and sufficient functionality determine quality of life and associated morbidity and mortality of patients.
PROBLEM: Following successful hemodialysis shunt creation, intimal hyperplasia and consecutive thrombosis or complete occlusion may cause different types of shunt dysfunctionality or even critical failure.
OBJECTIVE: Immediate shunt recanalization and revision by using an endovascular-first approach is crucial for long-term survival of hemodialysis fistula. There are several mechanisms available for catheter-based thrombus removal to unmask the typically underlying shunt stenosis.
METHODS: Primary technical recanalization success rates are very similar for clot cleaning. Treatment of intimal hyperplasia is preferably addressed by using drug-coated balloon angioplasty to allow for increased shunt patency compared to plain old balloon angioplasty. Stents and stent grafts are only used for resistant or repeated short-term recurrence of severe stenosis. Finally, surgical revision has a classical role in case of repeated failure of endovascular measures.
