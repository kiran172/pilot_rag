Title: The Incidence of Pediatric Tracheostomy and Its Association Among Black Children.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In 2012, Black or African American children constituted 21% of pediatric tracheostomies while representing approximately 15% of the US population. It is unclear if this discrepancy is due to differences in associated diagnoses. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of pediatric tracheostomy in the United States from 2003 to 2016 and to determine the odds of placement among Black children when compared with other children.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective.
SETTING: Academic hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We used the 2003 to 2016 Kid Inpatient Database to determine the incidence of pediatric tracheostomy in the United States and determine the odds of tracheostomy placement in Black children when compared with other children.
RESULTS: A total of 26,034 pediatric tracheostomies were performed between 2003 and 2016, among which, 21% were Black children. The median age was 7 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 0 to 17); 43% were â‰¤2 years old, and 62% were male. The most common principal diagnosis was respiratory failure (72%). When compared with other children, Black children were more likely to undergo tracheostomy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), which increased among children younger than 2 years old (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.5). Black children with tracheostomies were also more likely to be diagnosed with laryngeal stenosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia and to have an extended length of stay (P &lt; .001).
CONCLUSION: Black children are 1.2 times more likely to undergo tracheostomy in the United States compared with other children. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate if there are underlying anatomical, environmental, or psychosocial factors that contribute to this discrepancy.
