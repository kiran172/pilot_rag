Title: Diastolic dysfunction in severe aortic stenosis: Old but still gold.

Abstract: A simple, widely applicable and reproducible risk predictor may improve patient care, risk stratification, and clinical decision making for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (sAS) patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Baseline severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction identified by E/A ratio in sAS patients undergoing TAVI is associated with increased post-procedural all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization but is not an independent predictor of outcome. Large studies employing multimodality imaging of cardiac function/structure and accounting for sex and comorbidities will be necessary to validate DD parameters (or their combination) in sAS patients undergoing TAVI.
