Title: Resolved Cerebral Venous Hypertension after Angioplasty of Central Venous Stenosis in a Hemodialysis Patient: A Case Report.

Abstract: Stenosis of the central veins is a common complication in hemodialysis patients. However, cerebral venous hypertension and neurological symptoms caused by central vein stenosis are relatively rare. We present a rare case of cerebral venous hypertension in a 63-year-old male who showed venous reflux into the dural sinuses due to central venous stenosis on time-of-flight MR angiography. After management for central venous stenosis, the venous reflux disappeared.
