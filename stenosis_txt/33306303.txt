Title: [Decompensation of chronic internal hydrocephalus in an adult patient].

Abstract: We report a rare case of decompensated chronic internal hydrocephalus in an adult patient. A 35-year-old woman experienced acute intracranial hypertension in 3 weeks after relief of postoperative inflammation in the oral cavity (tooth extraction). MRI revealed severe internal hydrocephalus. Third ventriculostomy was followed by significant clinical improvement. However, postoperative survey and subsequent neuroimaging confirmed no reduction of ventricular system. Thus, decompensation of chronic hydrocephalus following dental intervention and subsequent oral inflammation was assumed. Impaired venous outflow from the brain and destabilization of CSF circulation can be considered as a pathogenetic mechanism.
