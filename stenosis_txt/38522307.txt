Title: Cystic adventitial disease of the popliteal artery: A case report with review of literature.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Cystic adventitial disease (CAD) is a rare vascular disorder marked by occlusion stemming from the development of a cystic mass within the outer (subadventitial) layer, with a predominant impact on the popliteal artery. The significance of the case presented herein lies in shedding light on a distinct clinical manifestation involving a 40-year-old man who exhibited sporadic calf claudication during ambulation. This instance contributes to the broader understanding of CAD and its diverse clinical presentations, emphasizing the need for further exploration and awareness within the medical community.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old man, with no significant past medical history, was referred to the cardiovascular department for the evaluation of a new onset of left calf pain persisting over the past three months. An arterial lower limb Doppler ultrasound was performed, revealing a focal hypoechoic image around the popliteal artery with a regular arterial wall, indicative of extrinsic compression. This resulted in significant stenosis of the popliteal artery during plantar flexion of the foot. The diagnosis of CAD of the left popliteal artery was established after limb computed tomography angiography, and a complete resection of the cyst was scheduled. The postoperative course was uneventful, with the patient experiencing relief from left calf claudication.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: CAD is an uncommon vascular anomaly, representing merely 0.1 % of all vascular conditions. This condition predominantly afflicts men aged between 40 and 50 years old. The etiology of CAD remains a subject of debate, with pathological findings typically involving intramural cysts containing gelatinous material between the media and the adventitia. Surgical intervention becomes necessary when symptoms arise.
CONCLUSION: CAD of the popliteal artery, though rare, is a significant contributor to peripheral vascular insufficiency in young patients without typical atherosclerotic risk factors.
