Title: Excess Provisional Extracellular Matrix: A Common Factor in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Formation.

Abstract: A bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common cardiac malformation, found in 0.5% to 2% of the population. BAVs are present in approximately 50% of patients with severe aortic stenosis and are an independent risk factor for aortic aneurysms. Currently, there are no therapeutics to treat BAV, and the human mutations identified to date represent a relatively small number of BAV patients. However, the discovery of BAV in an increasing number of genetically modified mice is advancing our understanding of molecular pathways that contribute to BAV formation. In this study, we utilized the comparison of BAV phenotypic characteristics between murine models as a tool to advance our understanding of BAV formation. The collation of murine BAV data indicated that excess versican within the provisional extracellular matrix (P-ECM) is a common factor in BAV development. While the percentage of BAVs is low in many of the murine BAV models, the remaining mutant mice exhibit larger and more amorphous tricuspid AoVs, also with excess P-ECM compared to littermates. The identification of common molecular characteristics&nbsp;among murine BAV models may lead to BAV therapeutic targets and biomarkers of disease progression for this highly prevalent and heterogeneous cardiovascular malformation.
