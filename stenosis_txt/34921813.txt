Title: Successful Repair of a Forme Fruste Bicuspid Aortic Valve by the Raphe Suspension Technique.

Abstract: A 52-year-old man underwent surgery due to shortness of breath caused by severe aortic regurgitation with right coronary cusp prolapse. Operative findings revealed 3 symmetric cusps with small raphe between the right and noncoronary cusps situated lower than the others, indicating a forme fruste bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The BAV was successfully repaired by tricuspidization, including raphe suspension, right coronary cusp plication, and double annuloplasty. The postoperative course was uneventful, and echocardiography at 3 months showed mild aortic regurgitation with adequate left ventricular reverse remodeling. Here we present the technical details of the raphe suspension procedure for forme fruste BAV.
