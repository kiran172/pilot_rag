Title: Computed tomography assessment of the aortic root morphology in predicting the development of paravalvular leak following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Introduction: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective treatment of significant aortic stenosis. Paravalvular leaks (PVLs) are one of the most common complications after the procedure. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether the aortic root morphology affects the occurrence of PVL after TAVI. Patients and methods: We enrolled 50 patients with bicuspid and 50 patients with tricuspid aortic valve who underwent multislice computed tomography (MSCT) and transthoracic echocardiography prior to TAVI. The dimensions of the aortic root were assessed by MSCT. PVL after TAVI was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Patients were divided in 2 groups according to the PVL severity: less than moderate PVL (n = 80) and moderate or worse PVL (n = 20), and comparisons between the groups were performed. Results: Patients with at least moderate PVL, compared with those with less than moderate PVL, had greater mean (SD) area (5.2 [1.1] cm2 vs 4.7 [0.8] cm2; P = 0.02), perimeter (8.4 [0.9] cm vs 7.9 [0.7] cm; P = 0.01), and long axis (29.5 [2.7] mm vs 28 [2.7] mm; P = 0.04) of the aortic annulus and greater mean (SD) area (5.3 [1.3] cm2 vs 4.7 [1.1] cm2; P = 0.04) and perimeter (8.6 [1.1] cm vs 8.1 [0.9] cm; P = 0.02) of the left ventricular outflow tract. In multivariable analysis, bicuspid aortic valve disease, interventricular septum hypertrophy, greater left ventricular outflow tract, and postdilatation were significant predictors of moderate PVL following TAVI. Conclusions: The assessment of the aortic root morphology with MSCT can be helpful in predicting PVL after TAVI.
