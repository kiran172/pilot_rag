Title: Iliac Vein Rupture During the Endovascular Treatment for May-Thurner Syndrome in a Previously Irradiated Pelvis.

Abstract: May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a vascular condition for which endovascular management is commonly chosen. We report an unusual presentation of this syndrome in a patient with previous Wertheim hysterectomy and pelvic radiotherapy, characterized by bilateral leg swelling due to radiation-induced right iliac vein stenosis. Endovascular left iliac vein stenting was performed. During the procedure, an iliac vein rupture occurred after stenting and was successfully treated using a stent graft. Two months follow-up showed a significant reduction of the leg swelling and the patency of the iliac stents. This rare case highlights a potential major risk of iliac vein rupture during the endovascular procedure in an irradiated pelvis.
