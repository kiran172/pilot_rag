Title: Trends, predictors, and outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with bicuspid aortic valve related disease: Insights from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and Nationwide Readmission Database.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has increasingly been utilized in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) related aortic stenosis (AS) with insufficient large-scale data on its safety.
METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample and Nationwide Readmission Database (2011-2018) were queried to identify patients undergoing TAVI for BAV versus trileaflet aortic valve (TAV) associated AS. The in-hospital, 30- and 180-day odds of outcomes were assessed using a propensity-matched analysis (PSM) to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 216,723 TAVI (TAV: 214,050 and BAV: 2,673) crude and 5,347 matched population (TAV: 2,674 and BAV: 2,673) was included in the final analysis. At index admission, the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality (aOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 0.67-3.66), stroke (aOR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.38-1.57), cardiac tamponade (aOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.17-3.36), vascular complications (aOR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.09-1.22), cardiogenic shock (aOR: 1.77, 95% CI: 0.93-3.38), paravalvular leak (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.26-1.14), need for mechanical circulatory support device, and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPM) (aOR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.69-1.52) were not significantly different between TAVI for BAV versus TAV. At 30- and 180-day follow-up duration, the risk of stroke and major postprocedural complications remained similar, except that TAVI in BAV had a higher incidence of PPM implantation compared with TAV. The yearly trend showed an increase in the utilization of TAVI for both TAV and BAV and a steady decline in the overall annual rate of in-hospital complications.
CONCLUSION: TAVI utilization in patients with BAV has increased over the recent years. The relative odds of in-hospital mortality, and all other major complications, were similar between patients undergoing TAVI for BAV- and TAV-related AS.
