Title: Invasive Hemodynamic Predictors of Survival in Patients With Mitral Stenosis Secondary to Mitral Annular Calcification.

Abstract: Background The aim of this study was to establish prognostic hemodynamic parameters in patients with mitral stenosis secondary to mitral annular calcification. Methods and Results A retrospective cohort of 105 patients undergoing transseptal catheterization for hemodynamic evaluation of mitral annular calcification-related mitral stenosis between 2004 and 2020 was studied. Mitral valve gradient (MVG) and mitral valve area (MVA; calculated by the Gorlin formula) were measured using direct left atrial and left ventricular pressures. The median age of the patients was 70.3 years (58.4-76.7 years), and 53.3% were women. The median MVA was 1.7 cm2 (1.3-2.3 cm2) and MVG was 7.3 mm Hg (5.3-10.3 mm Hg); left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 17.6±28.3 mm Hg. During a median of 2.1 years (0.7-4.5 years), there were 63 deaths; 1- and 5-year survival were 76% and 40%, respectively. There was no association between left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and survival. After adjusting for age and comorbidities, both MVA (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50 per cm2; 95% CI, 0.34-0.73) and MVG (HR, 1.1 per mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20) were independent predictors of death. Atrial fibrillation was also independently associated with mortality. When added to a combined model, MVA remained associated with death (HR, 0.51 per cm2; 95% CI, 0.33-0.79) while MVG was not. Conclusions In patients with mitral annular calcification-related mitral stenosis, survival was poor. MVA and MVG were independently associated with death, but MVA was a better predictor of outcomes.
