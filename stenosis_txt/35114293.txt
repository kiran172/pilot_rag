Title: The Conjunction Conundrum in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: A continuous discussion regarding the predictors for permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is ongoing, especially in the era of low and medium risk patients. The aim of this article is to review the data so far regarding the pathophysiology, risk factors, and the indications for permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI. The factors that contribute to rhythm abnormalities post TAVI can be divided into pre-existing conduction abnormalities, patient-related anatomical factors, and peri-procedural technical factors. The latter components are potentially modifiable, and this is where attention should be directed, particularly now that in an era of TAVI expansion towards lower-risk patients.
