Title: MRI after Lumbar Spine Decompression and Fusion Surgery: Technical Considerations, Expected Findings, and Complications.

Abstract: Postoperative MRI of the lumbar spine is a mainstay for detailed anatomic assessment and evaluation of complications related to decompression and fusion surgery. Key factors for reliable interpretation include clinical presentation of the patient, operative approach, and time elapsed since surgery. Yet, recent spinal surgery techniques with varying anatomic corridors to approach the intervertebral disc space and implanted materials have expanded the range of normal (expected) and abnormal (unexpected) postoperative changes. Modifications of lumbar spine MRI protocols in the presence of metallic implants, including strategies for metal artifact reduction, provide important diagnostic information. This focused review discusses essential principles for the acquisition and interpretation of MRI after lumbar spinal decompression and fusion surgery, highlights expected postoperative changes, and describes early and delayed postoperative complications with examples.
