Title: Ophthalmic artery flow direction change predicts recurrence of ischemic stroke after carotid stenting: a longitudinal observational study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The implantation of carotid artery stents prevents recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with carotid stenosis. This study aimed to investigate associations between change of ophthalmic artery flow (COAF) post carotid stenting and recurrent ischemic stroke, as well as the link toward the anterior and posterior circulations and patients' prognosis after carotid stenting.
METHODS: This retrospective, longitudinal cohort study recruited 87 left side carotid stenosed ischemic stroke patients undergoing left side carotid stenting between year of 2009 and 2013, and patients were followed up to 9 years after carotid procedures. Clinical data were derived from medical records. The primary outcome was stroke recurrence. Predictive factors were stenosis  > 50% in one intracranial artery and ROAF. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to identify risk factors associated with stroke recurrence.
RESULTS: Among 87 included patients undergone left side carotid stent treatment, 44 had stroke recurrence within 3 years after carotid stenting. The recurrence group had significantly greater proportions of COAF after stenting (p = 0.001), and middle cerebral artery (MCA) and basilar artery or vertebral artery (BA/VA) stenosis > 50% (all p < 0.001) than the no-recurrence group. Survival was significantly shorter in patients with COAF than in those without (p < 0.01). Regression analysis showed that COAF was associated with stroke recurrence (HR: 3.638, 95% CI 1.54-8.62, p = 0.003). The recurrence rate was highest in patients with bilateral MCA stenosis  > 50% (100%), followed by left MCA stenosis  > 50% plus BA/VA stenosis  > 50% (83.33%) or COAF (82.14%). Patients with bilateral MCA stenosis  < 50% had no recurrence within 3-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis after carotid stenting is poorer for patients with MCA stenosis  > 50%, BA/VA stenosis  > 50% and/or COAF. Carotid duplex and magnetic resonance angiography provide definitive information for prognosis prediction.
