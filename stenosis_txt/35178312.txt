Title: A Rare Encounter of Mitral Arcade With Anomalous Papillary Muscles.

Abstract: A congenital mitral arcade is a rare heart structural abnormality that affects the structure of the papillary muscles and chordaeÂ tendinae. This structural deviation impacts the mitral valve's functional capability, which is why most patients with this condition develop complications such as mitral stenosis or regurgitation. Some patients can obtain successful mitral valve repair. However, most will still need to get a mitral valve replacement. This case presents a young female who was found to have a mitral arcade and underwent mitral valve repair.
