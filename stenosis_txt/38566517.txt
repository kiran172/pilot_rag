Title: A multicenter prospective observational study appraising the effectiveness of the Supera stent after subintimal recanalization of femoro-popliteal artery occlusion: The SUPERSUB II study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complex femoropopliteal artery disease represents a challenge. The Supera stent holds the promise of improving the results of endovascular therapy for complex femoropopliteal disease.
AIMS: We aimed at appraising the early and long-term effectiveness of the Supera stent after successful subintimal angioplasty (SuperSUB strategy) for complex femoropopliteal lesions.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, single-arm observational study including consecutive patients at participating centers in whom Supera was implanted after successful subintimal angioplasty for complex femoropopliteal lesions.
RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were included Femoropopliteal arteries were the most common target, and lesion length was 261 ± 102 mm. Most procedures were technically demanding, with antegrade femoral access in 35 (38%) and retrograde distal access in 55 (60%). Supera stent length was 281 ± 111 mm, with 4, 5, and 6 mm devices being most commonly used: 32 (35%), 35 (38%), and 23 (25%), respectively. Technical success was achieved in 100% of subjects, as was clinical success (per subject), whereas procedural success (per subject) was obtained in 98%. At 24 months, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 93%, whereas primary patency was 87%. When compared with a similar historical cohort, Supera stent use appeared to be associated with a reduction in resources.
CONCLUSION: Use of Supera stent after successful subintimal recanalization of complex lower limb arterial lesions yields favorable procedural results, which are maintained over follow-up, and are associated also with a favorable resource use profile.
