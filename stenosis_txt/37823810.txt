Title: [Revascularisation of Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis - Reasonable or Obsolete?].

Abstract: Recommendations for surgical versus conservative treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) are based on prospective randomized trials, some of which were performed several decades ago. However, during this time, "best medical treatment" (BMT) for conservative therapy of arteriosclerotic patients has evolved significantly. Because of the associated risk reduction of ACS, surgical therapy is increasingly being questioned. By identifying clinical and morphological risk parameters, subgroups could be identified that might, however, benefit from invasive therapy. Consequently, multidisciplinary therapy decision-making requires an increasingly patient-individualized approach.
