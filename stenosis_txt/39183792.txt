Title: The reimplantation of anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery under lower mini-sternotomy.

Abstract: The patient was 28-year-old male. He was suffered from chest pain at rest. He was diagnosed with AAORCA (anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery) by emergency catheter. Myocardial scintigraphy indicated ischemic changes in the right coronary artery region, so surgery was the plan. Reimplantation was selected because the coronary artery computed tomography showed little intramural travel and mild coronary artery stenosis. The surgery was performed under lower mini-sternotomy to facilitate early return to work. The patient had a good postoperative course, and was discharged from the hospital postoperative Day 11 after rehabilitation. We report a case of the right coronary artery reimplantation with lower mini-sternotomy for AAORCA.
