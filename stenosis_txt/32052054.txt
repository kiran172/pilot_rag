Title: Outcome, complication and follow-up of patients with esophageal foreign body impaction: an academic institute's 15 years of experience.

Abstract: Esophageal foreign body impaction (EFBI) is a gastrointestinal emergency, mostly requiring endoscopic management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the epidemiology, adverse events, and outcomes of patients following the episode of EFBI. All esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) reports of admitted patients for EFBI at the University of Kansas Medical Center between 2003 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Of 204 patients, who met the inclusion criteria, 60% were male and the mean age was 54.7 ± 17.7 years. The encounter was the first episode of EFBI in 76% of cases. EGD in less than 24 hours of patients' admission was required in 79% of cases. The distal esophagus was the most common site of impaction (44%). Push and pull techniques were used in 38 and 35.2% of cases, respectively, while 11% were managed by a combination of both techniques. Structural causes were the most common etiologic findings including benign strictures and stenosis in 21.5% of patients, followed by Schatzki's ring (7.8%) and hiatal hernia (6.9%). Of all cases, 45% did follow-up in up to 1 year, and biopsy was done in 34% of cases. Out of 43 patients who had endoscopic findings suspicious for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), the diagnosis was confirmed by pathology in 37. The rate of recurrence EFBI was significantly higher in patients with EoE (P < 0.001). EFBI-related esophageal adverse events (AEs) occurred in 4.9% of cases. Cardiovascular and pulmonary AEs occurred in 1.5 and 2.9%, respectively. Logistic regression did not find any predictor for AEs occurrence. EFBI managed very well with endoscopic treatments. Despite the emerging data about the safety of the push technique, there are still concerns regarding its adverse events especially the risk of perforations. Our study shows no significant difference in adverse events between different types of techniques.
