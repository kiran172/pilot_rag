Title: Right Ventricle-Pulmonary Artery Conduit Replacement Resolves Anomalous Single Coronary Stenosis in Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot.

Abstract: A 41-year-old man with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and a single coronary artery (CA) arising anteriorly presented with dyspnea in the setting of moderate right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit (RV-PAC) stenosis and moderate-to-severe extrinsic left main CA compression between the aorta and RV-PAC. His CA stenosis resolved after successful RV-PAC replacement.
