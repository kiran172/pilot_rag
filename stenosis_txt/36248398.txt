Title: Severe symptomatic nickel allergy following stent graft implantation requiring excision and external iliac artery reconstruction.

Abstract: Although nickel allergy is a common cause of contact dermatitis, systemic reactions to nitinol stents are rare. A 61-year-old woman had presented with a nonhealing toe wound. Angiography revealed an external iliac artery stenosis, which was treated with a nitinol stent graft. However, she developed severe truncal pruritus, and within 3Â months, her external iliac stent graft had thrombosed. Allergy testing revealed nickel sensitivity. After medical therapy had failed, stent graft removal was performed, resulting in complete resolution of her symptoms. The present case demonstrates a rare allergic reaction to the nitinol in commercially available stent grafts. Pruritus and rash are rare reactions to stenting; however, a nitinol allergy should be considered for patients with no other identifiable primary source.
