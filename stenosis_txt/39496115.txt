Title: Factors Associated With Return to Work Following Laminoplasty for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predictive of returning to work within 90 days of laminoplasty for degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).
BACKGROUND: DCM is a debilitating condition resulting from spinal canal stenosis and spinal cord compression. One surgical option for cord decompression is cervical laminoplasty. Factors influencing return to work (RTW) postsurgery are unknown.
METHODS: This study included adult patients previously employed, undergoing primary elective laminoplasty for DCM, and with documented RTW status. Variables included demographic information, medical history, illness characteristics, and baseline patient-reported outcomes. The primary outcome of interest was RTW status at 90 days. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify predictors.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients (67.6%) returned to work within 90 days, whereas 22 (32.3%) either RTW between 90 and 365 days (n = 3) or did not RTW within 365 days (n = 19). Significantly more patients who RTW within 90 days worked full-time (90.9% vs 64.3%, P = 0.030). Patients who RTW within 90 days had significantly lower preoperative Neck Disability Index scores (23.7 ± 17.5 vs 35.6 ± 14.3, P = 0.008) and higher preoperative modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scores (13.7 ± 2.5 vs 12.2 ± 2.7, P = 0.018) compared with those who did not RTW. No differences were found in other baseline patient-reported outcomes. Patients who RTW within 90 days had significantly lower postoperative 3-month neck pain (2.0 ± 2.1 vs 3.8 ± 2.6, P = 0.007), 3-month arm pain (1.3 ± 1.9 vs 3.6 ± 2.8, P < 0.001), 12-month neck pain (1.4 ± 1.6 vs 3.1 ± 2.4, P = 0.019) and 12-month arm pain (1.1 ± 1.8 vs 2.4 ± 2.4, P = 0.048) compared with those who did not RTW within 90 days. Higher preoperative modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scores were significantly associated with truncated time to RTW (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.29, P = 0.034).
CONCLUSION: Patients with better preoperative neck and arm pain and functional scores were more likely to RTW within 90 days postlaminoplasty. Preoperative functional status plays an important role in assessing RTW postlaminoplasty. This information is valuable for preoperative patient counseling.
