Title: Genitourinary function and defecation after colorectal cancer surgery with low- and high-ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery: A meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effect of low ligation (LL) vs high ligation (HL) of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) on functional outcomes during sigmoid colon and rectal cancer surgery, including urinary, sexual, and bowel function, is still controversial.
AIM: To assess the effect of LL of the IMA on genitourinary function and defecation after colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery.
METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched to retrieve studies describing sigmoid colon and rectal cancer surgery in order to compare outcomes following LL and HL. A total of 14 articles, including 4750 patients, were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3 software. Dichotomous results are expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous outcomes are expressed as weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95%CIs.
RESULTS: LL resulted in a significantly lower incidence of nocturnal bowel movement (OR = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.55 to 0.97, P = 0.03) and anastomotic stenosis (OR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.16 to 0.62, P = 0.0009) compared with HL. The risk of postoperative urinary dysfunction, however, did not differ significantly between the two techniques. The meta-analysis also showed no significant differences between LL and HL in terms of anastomotic leakage, postoperative complications, total lymph nodes harvested, blood loss, operation time, tumor recurrence, mortality, 5-year overall survival rate, or 5-year disease-free survival rate.
CONCLUSION: Since LL may result in better bowel function and a reduced rate of anastomotic stenosis following CRC surgeries, we suggest that LL be preferred over HL.
