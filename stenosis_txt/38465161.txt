Title: Cryodebulking to Relieve Critical Airway Narrowing Due to a Central Airway Tumor at the Carina: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Central airway tumors presenting as critical airway stenosis is a medical emergency. Employing a cryoprobe, we successfully debulked a central airway tumor, providing rapid relief to a patient who came to the emergency room with severe breathlessness, hemoptysis, and respiratory failure. The current report underscores the efficacy of cryodebulking as an immediate and minimally invasive technique and a compelling alternative to conventional heat-based therapies.
