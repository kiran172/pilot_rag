Title: Preliminary results of a vaginal constraint for reducing G2 late vaginal complications after postoperative brachytherapy in endometrial cancer: a prospective analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the preliminary results of the use of 68 Gy EQD2<sub>(α/β=3 Gy)</sub> as a dose limit to the lowest dose in the most exposed 2 cm3 of the vagina in order to reduce G2 late vaginal problems in postoperative endometrial carcinoma (EC).
METHODS: From November 2016 to October 2019, 69 postoperative EC patients receiving vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) ± external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) were prospectively analyzed. The median EBRT dose was 45 Gy (range: 44-50.4 Gy), 1.8-2 Gy/day, 5 fractions(Fr)/week. VBT was administered with the following schedule: 1Fr of 7 Gy after EBRT and 2 daily Fr × 7.5 Gy in exclusive VBT. The dose was prescribed at 0.5 cm from the applicator surface with an active length of 2.5 cm; 56 patients were treated with vaginal cylinders (49-3.5 cm, 6-3 cm, and 1-2.5 cm) and 13 with the colpostat technique. The overall VBT dose was adjusted to meet the vaginal restriction of &lt; 68 Gy EQD2<sub>(α/β=3 Gy)</sub> at 2 cm3. Late toxicity was prospectively assessed using RTOG scores for bladder and rectum, and the objective LENT-SOMA criteria for vagina.
RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 31.0 months, no vaginal-cuff recurrences were found. Late toxicity: only 1G1(1.4%) rectal toxicity; 21G1(30.4%) and 3G2(4.3%) vaginal complications. Only one (1.4%) of 3 G2 manifested as vaginal shortening.
CONCLUSIONS: In postoperative EC patients treated with VBT, only one developed G2 vaginal stenosis with the use of 68 Gy EQD2<sub>(α/β=3 Gy)</sub> as a dose constraint. These preliminary results seem to indicate the value of this dose limit for reducing G2 vaginal stenosis. Nonetheless, these findings should be confirmed in a larger number of patients with longer follow-up.
