Title: Cardiac power output is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with preserved ejection fraction after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: AIMS: Cardiac power output (CPO) measures cardiac performance, and its prognostic significance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (EF) has been previously reported. However, the effectiveness of CPO in risk stratification of patients with valvular heart disease and post-operative valvular disease has not been reported. We aimed to determine the association between CPO and clinical outcomes in patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) EF after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective observational study included 1047 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis after TAVI. All patients were followed up for all-cause mortality and hospitalization for HF. CPO was calculated as 0.222 × cardiac output × mean blood pressure (BP)/LV mass, where 0.222 was the conversion constant to W/100 g of the LV myocardium. CPO was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography at discharge after TAVI. Of the 1047 patients, 253 were excluded following the exclusion criteria, including those with low LVEF, and 794 patients (84.0 [80.0-88.0] years; 35.8% male) were included in this study. During a median follow-up period of 684 (237-1114) days, the composite endpoint occurred in 196 patients. A dose-dependent association was observed between the CPO levels and all-cause mortality. Patients in the lowest CPO tertile had significantly lower event-free survival rates (log-rank test, P = 0.043). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that CPO was independently associated with adverse outcomes (hazard ratio = 0.561, P = 0.020). CPO provided an incremental prognostic effect in the model based on clinical and echocardiographic markers (P = 0.034).
CONCLUSION: CPO is independently and incrementally associated with adverse outcomes in patients with preserved LVEF following TAVI.
