Title: A Rare Double Heterozygous Mutation in Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor and Apolipoprotein B-100 Genes in a Severely Affected Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Patient.

Abstract: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is characterized by high plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and premature cardiovascular disease risk. Mutations in the genes that encode proteins involved in LDL uptake and catabolism, including LDL-receptor (LDLR) and apolipoprotein-B (APOB), are known to cause FH. We present the case of a severely affected FH proband with two mutations in two different causing genes and characterize her first-degree blood relatives. The proband was a 54-year-old woman with a severe FH phenotype with treated LDL-C of 8.3 mmol/L, total cholesterol (TC) level of 11.6 mmol/L, peripheral artery disease, early myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, and carotid artery disease. Exons of the LDLR and APOB genes were amplified by polymerase chain reactions (PCR). PCR products were examined by pyrosequencing and proven by bidirectional DNA sequencing. The proband was heterozygous for both the LDLR c.420G>C (p.Glu140Asp) mutation known to be pathogenic and a rare APOB c.10708C>T (p.His3570Tyr) mutation with unproven pathogenicity. Cascade testing has been performed in her 15 first-degree blood relatives. Her daughter carries only the LDLR c.420 G>C mutation with a TC of 8.4 mmol/L. Her two sisters carry only the APOB c.10708C>T with a TC of 5.7 and 6.2 mmol/L. This case provides evidence that the rare APOB c.10708C>T mutation alone is not pathogenic, but has a synergic effect on LDLR mutation. The finding is important for understanding the genotype-phenotype correlation and highlights the need to consider the presence of additional mutations in FH families where relatives have varying phenotypes.
