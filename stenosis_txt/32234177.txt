Title: [Value of absolute quantification of myocardial perfusion by PET in detecting coronary microvascular disease in patients with non-obstructive coronaries].

Abstract: Objective: To compare the incidence of coronary microvascular disease (CMVD) between patients with non-obstructive and obstructive coronary arteries. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 97 patients with angina pectoris, who underwent the absolute quantitative PET examination of myocardial perfusion and coronary anatomy examination within 90 days. All patients were divided into two groups: non-obstructive group (72 cases, no stenosis ≥50% in all three coronary arteries) and obstructive group (25 cases, at least one coronary stenosis ≥50%; and at least one coronary stenosis&lt;50%). Quantitative parameters derived from PET including rest myocardial blood flow (RMBF), stress myocardial blood flow (SMBF), coronary flow reserve (CFR) and cardiovascular risk factors were compared between the two groups. CMVD was defined as CFR&lt;2.90 and SMBF&lt;2.17 ml·min(-1)·g(-1). Results: Incidence of CMVD was significant higher in the non-obstructive coronary arteries of the obstructive group than in the non-obstructive coronary arteries of non-obstructive group (47.1% (16/34) vs. 25.5% (55/216), χ(2)=6.738, P=0.009) while incidence of CMVD was similar between non-obstructive and obstructive patients ((44% (11/25) vs. 33.3% (24/72), χ(2)=0.915, P=0.339). RMBF ((0.83±0.14) ml·min(-1)·g(-1) vs. (0.82±0.17) ml·min(-1)·g(-1)), SMBF ((2.13±0.60) ml·min(-1)·g(-1) vs. (1.91±0.50) ml·min(-1)·g(-1)) and CFR (2.59±0.66 vs. 2.36±0.47) were similar between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). Conclusions: CMVD can occur in non-obstructive coronary arteries in both patients with non-occlusive coronary arteries and patients with obstructive coronary arteries. Prevalence of CMVD is significantly higher in patients with obstructive coronary arteries than in patients with non-obstructive coronary arteries. The CMVD severity is similar between the two groups.
