Title: Transverse venous sinus stenosis in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a prospective pilot study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Whether transverse venous sinus stenosis (TVSS) causes idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or is an effect of the increased intracranial pressures is controversial. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of serial imaging in patients with IIH on medical management.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients found to have IIH and TVSS on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography (CEMRV) were recruited in a prospective cohort study. Patients were medically managed and followed with a CEMRV immediately after lumbar puncture, 3-6 months after diagnosis with resolution of IIH symptoms, and 1 year after diagnosis. Ophthalmological data were collected at the time of diagnosis, 3-6 months after diagnosis, and 1 year after diagnosis. Feasibility data, including patient recruitment rate, barriers, and logistical issues, were recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty patients with suspected IIH were screened, and 5 of 7 (71.4%; 95% confidence interval: 36.21-100) eligible patients were enrolled in 1 year, at completion. All recruited patients had clinical resolution of their IIH on medical therapy, and none of them had any obvious change in their TVSS.
CONCLUSIONS: Prospective examination of TVSS with serial magnetic resonance imaging in patients with IIH is feasible. TVSS in patients with IIH did not show any change, despite clinical improvement on medical management in all participants.
