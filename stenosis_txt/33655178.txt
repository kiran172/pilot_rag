Title: Congenital Pharyngeal Web in an Adult: Treatment of a Rare Clinical Anomaly by Coblation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION TO THE TOPIC: Previous reports of congenital pharyngeal webs, although rare, have been described in children. Clinical presentation varies, ranging from aspiration to intermittent airway obstruction, and most commonly, dysphagia. In this case report, the authors describe an unusual finding of a hypopharyngeal web in an adult patient. This patient had no prior history of chemoradiotherapy, malignancy, or total laryngectomy, all of which have been associated with acquired pharyngeal stenosis, supporting that this finding was of congenital origin. After a review of the possible embryological developmental abnormalities, the hypothesis is that of gut recanalization failure during development.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a woman in her mid-40's with a history of solid food dysphagia resulting in a 20 kg weight loss over three months. The patient denied dysphagia progressing to liquids, pain with swallowing, and a history of alcohol or tobacco use. Upon examination of the larynx via laryngoscope, a congenital hypopharyngeal web was identified. Successful excision of the web via coblation restored proper drainage of the pyriform sinus into the esophagus and resulted in markedly improved swallowing function and weight gain.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharyngeal webs are rare findings, particularly in adult patients. These congenital anomalies can be safely and effectively treated endoscopically via coblation.
