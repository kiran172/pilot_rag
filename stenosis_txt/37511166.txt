Title: Giant Arachnoid Granulations: Diagnostic Workup and Characterization in Three Symptomatic Adults.

Abstract: Giant arachnoid granulations (GAGs) are poorly investigated. Here, we document clinical findings associated with five new GAGs and illustrate the anatomical composition of these structures as well as diagnostic considerations in three symptomatic adults. The GAGs ranged from 1.1 to 3.6 cm (mean, 2.2 cm) in maximum dimension and manifested in middle-aged individuals who presented with long-standing brain mass and/or chronic headache. On imaging examinations, the tissues appeared as irregular parasagittal and/or perisinus structures that demonstrated heterogeneous internal elements. The GAGs abutted dura, extended through calvarial marrow spaces, and impinged on dural venous sinuses, causing their stenosis. The histologic workup of two GAG specimens resected from separate individuals revealed central collagen with pronounced internal vascular proliferation. One specimen additionally exhibited reactive changes within the lesion, including venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, and conspicuous inflammation. The salient immune component consisted of a foam cell-rich infiltrate that obstructed subcapsular and internal sinusoidal GAG spaces. Within this specimen, meningothelial hyperplasia was also appreciated. Notably, proliferated lymphatic vascular elements were additionally observed within the structure, extending into deep central collagen regions and engulfing many extravasated erythrocytes in the subcapsular space. In both surgically treated patients, symptoms resolved completely following resection. This report is the first to definitively depict reactive vascular and immunological changes within GAGs that were clinically associated with headache. The frequency of reactive changes within these meningeal structures is unclear in the literature, as GAGs are rarely sampled and investigated. Further systematic analyses are warranted to elucidate the causes and consequences of GAG genesis and their roles in physiology and disease states.
