Title: Oncologic safety of Carrel patch hepaticojejunostomy for treating cystic-type choledochal cyst in children based on 20-plus years follow-up.

Abstract: AIM: During choledochal cyst (CC) excision, the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis (HJA) can be performed conventionally (CHJA) or with a Carrel patch (CPA). CPA can increase CHD diameter to 10-13 mm, preventing anastomotic stenosis and intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) stones but may be at risk for malignant transformation.
METHODS: The medical records of 83 cystic-type CC with CHD ≤ 9 mm followed up for at least 20 years were reviewed retrospectively. Available excised CC specimens (70/83) were re-examined blindly for pre-malignant changes. A questionnaire about suturing narrow lumens was conducted.
RESULTS: All 83 had pancreaticobiliary maljunction. Group data were similar. Anastomoses were CPA (n = 43) and CHJA (n = 40). Mean diameter for CPA was 11.4 mm (range: 10-13 mm); for CHJA was 7.4 mm (range: 5-9 mm). Mean follow-up was 27.7 years (range: 20-42). Postoperative anastomotic stenoses were less after CPA: 1/43 (2.3%) versus 5/40 (12.5%) (p = 0.10), but CHJA had significantly more postoperative IHBD stones: 0% versus 4/40 (10.0%) (p < 0.05). All IHBD stone patients had anastomotic stenosis. Excised specimens showed no pre-malignant cytology. Lumen diameter ≤ 9 mm was considered challenging by 10/10 surgical trainees and ≤ 7 mm by 16/22 pediatric surgeons.
CONCLUSIONS: CPA appears to be oncologically safe because of the absence of malignant transformation for at least 20 years.
