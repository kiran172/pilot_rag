Title: Individualised surgical treatment strategy for subaortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The clinical data of patients with subaortic stenosis who underwent surgical treatment in our centre in the past 12 years were reviewed. The short-term and long-term clinical outcomes were analyzed, and the long-term outcomes of different surgical methods for subaortic stenosis were compared to determine the optimal surgical treatment strategy for subaortic stenosis.
METHODS: From December 2010 to December 2022, 90 patients undergoing surgical treatment for subaortic stenosis in our hospital were enrolled. There were 55 males and 35 females with a median age of 72 (46,132) months and an average surgical weight of (21.35 ± 15.84) kg. According to the operation method, 90 patients were divided into group A (50 patients with simple subaortic membrane resection) and group B (40 patients with subaortic membrane and muscle resection or modified Konno procedure).
RESULTS: There were three early deaths (3.33%). One late death occurred in group B. There was no significant difference in long-term survival rate between the two groups (p = 0.904). The preoperative left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient in group B was (91.56 ± 36.98) mm Hg, which was higher than that in group A(51.13 ± 36.04)mm Hg(p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in immediate postoperative left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient between group B [(5.44 ± 8.43) mm Hg] and group A [(7.82 ± 13.44) mm Hg] (p = 0.343). In the long-term follow-up, left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient in group B was (5.86 ± 9.53) mm Hg, which was not statistically significant compared with group A (8.83 ± 14.52) mm Hg (p = 0.294). Eleven patients with moderate or greater aortic regurgitation (group A/group B: 3/8) underwent simultaneous aortic valvuloplasty. In group B, moderate or greater aortic regurgitation was significantly improved immediately after operation (p = 0.013) and was not significantly aggravated in long-term follow-up (p = 0.083), and there was no significant improvement in group A after operation and long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the different anatomical lesions of left ventricular outflow tract, the individualised surgical treatment strategy for patients with subaortic stenosis can achieve good long-term outcomes. The long-term survival rate and freedom from reoperation due to late left ventricular outflow tract obstruction after simple subaortic membrane resection and extended left ventricular outflow tract resection are comparable. For patients with moderate or greater aortic regurgitation before extended left ventricular outflow tract resection, simultaneous aortic valvuloplasty is beneficial to improve postoperative aortic valve function.
