Title: Carotid artery stenosis in correlation with neck and carotid artery anatomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neck anatomy, especially its largest muscle - sternocleidomastoid and carotid space, with carotid artery anatomy and stenosis.
METHODS: We analysed 102 computed tomography carotid angiograms. The study included the measurement of the neck and sternocleidomastoid length, diameter and volume and the size of the carotid space. Analysis of carotid artery geometry, the length, angle and height of carotid artery bifurcation and the direction of the internal carotid artery origin was also included.
RESULTS: We found a positive correlation only between the neck and carotid length. There was no correlation between other neck characteristics and a carotid anatomy or internal carotid artery stenosis. Direction of internal carotid artery origin was significantly different (p < 0.01) between the left and right sides.
CONCLUSIONS: We have not found a correlation between the size of sternocleidomastoid and carotid space and carotid stenosis as a hypothetical factor for atherosclerosis. Also, the degree of carotid artery stenosis did not correlate with other neck and carotid measurements. Neck and carotid anatomy correlated only in their lengths. The left internal carotid artery showed mostly posterolateral origin, and right internal carotid artery had no predominate direction.
