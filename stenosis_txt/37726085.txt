Title: Management Strategies for Congenital Heart Disease Comorbid with Airway Anomalies in Children.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess management strategies for pediatric patients with the challenging combination of congenital heart diseases (CHDs) and airway anomalies.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with CHD and airway anomalies in the Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Centre of Fuwai Hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into three groups based on different management, including the conservative group, the slide group (slide tracheoplasty), and the suspension group (suspension with external stenting). Patients' data and computed tomography measurements from medical records were reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 139 patients were included in the cohort; 107 had conservative airway treatment (conservative group), 15 had slide tracheoplasty (slide group), and 17 had tracheal suspension operation (suspension group). The top three associated intracardiac anomalies were ventricular septal defect (n = 34, 24%), pulmonary artery sling (n = 22, 16%), and tetralogy of Fallot (n = 15, 11%). Compared with patients with conservative airway management (100 minutes [median], 62-152 [IQR]), the extra airway procedure prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass duration, with 202 minutes (IQR, 119-220) for the slide group and 150 minutes (IQR, 125-161) for the suspension group. Patients who underwent slide tracheoplasty required prolonged mechanical ventilation (129 minutes [median], 56-328 [IQR]). Of the total cohort, 6 in-hospital deaths, all in the conservative group, and 8 mid-to long-term deaths, with 6 in the conservative group, occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Both conservative and surgical management of CHD patients with airway anomalies have promising outcomes. Extra tracheobronchial procedures, especially the slide tracheoplasty, significantly prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass duration. Based on multidisciplinary team assessment, individualized management strategies should be developed for these patients.
