Title: [Autopneumonectomie. A Forgotten Disease].

Abstract: HISTORY:  An 80-year old female was referred to our hospital with left internal carotid artery stenosis and a childhood history of hemoptysis.
INVESTIGATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS:  The ECG showed 2nd degree Mobitz atrio-ventricular block. The chest x-ray and computerized tomography identified a shift of the mediastinum and the heart to the left. The left lung was completely destroyed whilst the right lung was enlarged and crossed the midline. Pulmonary function tests revealed a moderate restrictive ventilation disorder. The diagnosis of autopneumonectomy was based on patient history together with radiological findings.
TREATMENT AND COURSE:  A pacemaker was implanted with two stimulation electrodes via a left cephalic venous cutdown. A carotid endarterectomy was also performed without any complication.
CONCLUSION:  After autopneumonectomy, postpneumonectomy like syndrome may occur in very rare cases, whereupon operative treatment is mandatory. Any respiratory infections should be treated with antibiotics. Pacemaker electrode placement via the subclavian vein is contraindicated due to the risk of a catastrophic pneumothorax.
