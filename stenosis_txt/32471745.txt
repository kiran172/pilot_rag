Title: Venous Thoracic Outlet Syndrome in a Young Student.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) results from compression and thrombosis of the axillosubclavian vein. In primary effort thrombosis, a subtype of VTOS, chronic repetitive compression injury of the axillosubclavian vein leads to scarring, stenosis, and eventually, thrombosis. This is a rare manifestation of an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old male student without significant past medical history presented to our Emergency Department with a complaint of intermittent swelling and discoloration of his upper right arm. His symptoms had been present for the past year and had worsened over the past few weeks. Swelling was associated with overhead use of the arm. There is no family history of clotting disorders. A computed tomography angiogram of the chest with upper extremity runoff showed findings consistent with VTOS. The patient was discharged with an urgent referral to Vascular Surgery. Within 2Â weeks, he underwent multiple surgical procedures and was initiated on anticoagulation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: VTOS usually presents in patients who do not have commonly recognized prothrombotic risk factors. Emergency physicians should include this diagnosis in their differential because good functional outcomes rely on early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment. In addition, emergency physicians must refer these patients to vascular surgeons, as most will require surgical management.
