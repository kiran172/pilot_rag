Title: Transannular rupture during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: management in a patient with prior cardiac surgery.

Abstract: Annular rupture occurs in approximately 1% of transcatheter aortic valve replacementÂ cases. Annular rupture often requires surgical management and is associated with high mortality. Repair of annular rupture in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is undercharacterized and poses a unique challenge given the increased difficulty and complexity from both an emergent and reoperative case. An 80-year-old male with previous CABG experienced annular rupture post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement requiring urgent surgical management. This case illustrates the successful repair of a rare and high-risk complication describing the approach utilized in correcting annular rupture in a patient with previous CABG.
