Title: Management of Giant Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm with Quadricuspid Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: The pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is a rare disease with no well-defined guidelines about the diagnostic criteria and its management. In fact, the indications for surgical treatment and the type of surgical approach are not clear. However, in case of giant PAAs with hypertension and pulmonary valve abnormalities, surgery should be considered as an effective and safe approach to prevent dissections or ruptures. In this report, we describe a successful case of surgical repair, using a Bioconduit with a pericardial patch to recreate the pulmonary artery bifurcation in a 72-year-old male with aneurysm of the pulmonary artery (max diameter: 72â€‰mm), associated with quadricuspid pulmonary valve stenosis and pulmonary hypertension. The procedure was uncomplicated and the follow-up computed tomography scan at 4 months showed correct positioning of the graft with no sign of contrast leakage.
