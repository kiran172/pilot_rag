Title: Young thoracic vertebra diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis with Scheuermann disease: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a disorder characterised by the calcification and ossification of ligaments and entheses. It is a frequent occurrence in elderly males, but rarely encountered in younger individuals.
CASE SUMMARY: A 24-year-old male was admitted to the hospital due to low back pain accompanied with numbness in both lower limbs for 10 d. Upon clinical examination and imaging tests, the patient was diagnosed with DISH with Scheuermann disease and thoracic spinal stenosis. Before the operation and medical treatment, the patient had hypoesthesia of the skin below the xiphoid process. Afterward, a standard laminectomy was conducted using ultrasonic bone curette and internal fixation was applied. Subsequently, the patient was given corticosteroids, neurotrophic drugs, hyperbaric oxygen and electric stimulation. As a result of the treatment, the patient's sensory level decreased to the navel level and there was no major change in the muscle strength of the lower limbs. During follow-up, the patient's skin sensation has returned to normal.
CONCLUSION: This case is a rare instance of DISH co-existing with Scheuermann's disease in a young adult. This provides a valuable reference point for spine surgeons, as DISH is more commonly observed in middle-aged and elder adults.
