Title: Advances in the Understanding of the Complex Role of Venous Sinus Stenosis in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disorder characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) that predominantly affects young obese women. IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion. That is, if increased ICP is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography of the brain are recommended to exclude secondary causes. Imaging findings, such as empty sella, orbital findings, meningocele, and encephalocele, are not diagnostic of ICP, nor does their absence exclude ICP either. Therefore, venous manometry is recommended as the gold standard for evaluation, regardless of previous anatomic imaging results. Venous manometry is an invasive examination that is frequently applied to derive physiologic information concerning the nature of the pressure gradient. However, the pathogenesis of IIH has not been fully elucidated. The presence of venous sinus stenosis in a subset of patients has provided some support for the potential mechanisms underlying this condition. Hence, this review provides an up-to-date discussion on the potential pathogenic mechanisms of IIH with a special focus on venous sinus stenosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 2.
