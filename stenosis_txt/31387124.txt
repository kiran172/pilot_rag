Title: A Wide Comparison of Techniques for Repair of PAPVCs: One Institution's 20-Year Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Different methods for surgical correction of partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) exist. We evaluated the outcomes of four techniques regarding morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: A total of 116 patients underwent PAPVC repair in our institution over a period of 20 years. Single-patch technique (n = 82 [71%], mean age: 18.59 ± 20.49 years), double-patch technique (n = 13 [11%], mean age: 43.18 ± 25.14 years), Warden's technique (n = 7 [6%], mean age: 10.04 ± 10.47 years), and direct implantation of anomalous pulmonary veins (n = 14 [12%], mean age: 14.42 ± 18.58 years) were examined.
RESULTS: Out of the 116 patients, one patient (0.9%) developed pulmonary hypertension after discharge and three patients (2.6%) with normal right cardiac function showed right ventricular failure. In total, a pacemaker was inserted in seven cases (6%). Three patients (2.6%) presented with persistent nonsinus rhythm during follow-up. This complication was most frequently seen in the double-patch group being significantly increased compared with the other groups (p = 0.035). One patient presented with a mild stenosis of the superior vena cava. There were two early, nonsurgery-related deaths and no late mortality.
CONCLUSION: Operative therapy of PAPVC has low postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, surgical repair of this cardiac anomaly is a safe and reproducible treatment independent of the applied method. The surgical technique must be selected based on the anatomy and possible accompanying congenital heart defects. Special care should be taken when using the double-patch technique because of significant more frequent nonsinus rhythm events postoperatively.
