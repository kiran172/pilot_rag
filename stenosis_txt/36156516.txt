Title: [Successful Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair in a Patient with Mid-aortic Syndrome:Report of a Case].

Abstract: We report a case of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for mid-aortic syndrome, which is characterized by a segmental narrowing of the aorta, in a 71-year-old man who presented with intermittent claudication. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed segmental stenosis of the descending aorta, for which TEVAR was performed. The ankle-branchial index increased after surgery, and the dorsalis pedis arterial pulses became palpable bilaterally. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 14 without any complication. At present, four years after surgery, he is in good condition with improved renal function, requiring no hospitalization for the treatment of heart failure.
