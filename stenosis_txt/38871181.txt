Title: Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease is associated with the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and plaque burden.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerosis is closely related to cardiovascular disease risk. The present study aims to evaluate the association between metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and plaques burden, as detected by computed tomography angiography (CTA), and further test the screening value of MAFLD on the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and plaques burden.
METHODS: We used data from the PolyvasculaR Evaluation for Cognitive Impairment and vaScular Events study, a community-based cohort. Hepatic steatosis was assessed using the fatty liver index. Coronary atherosclerotic plaques and burden were detected by CTA. The association of MAFLD with the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and burden was assessed by binary and ordinal logistic regression models, respectively.
RESULTS: Among the 3029 participants (mean age 61.2 ± 6.7 years), 47.9% (1452) presented with MAFLD. MAFLD was associated with an increased odds of the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaques (OR, 1.27; 95% CI: 1.03-1.56), segment involvement score [cOR (common odds ratio), 1.25; 95% CI, 1.03-1.51], and segment stenosis score (cOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06-1.57). Participants with severe fibrosis or diagnosed as DM-MAFLD subtypes had with higher odds for the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and plaques burden. In addition, MAFLD demonstrated a higher sensitivity for detecting the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaques and plaque burden (54%-64%) than conventional CVD risk factors (such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia).
CONCLUSION: MAFLD is associated with higher odds of having coronary atherosclerotic plaques and plaque burden. Moreover, MAFLD may offer better screening potential for coronary atherosclerosis than established CVD risk factors.
