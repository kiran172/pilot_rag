Title: Prognostic Impact of the Get-with-the-Guidelines Heart-Failure Risk Score (GWTG-HF) after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients with Low-Flow-Low-Gradient Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study examined the prognostic value of the get-with-the-guidelines heart-failure risk score (GWTG-HF) on mortality in patients with low-flow-low-gradient aortic valve stenosis (LFLG-AS) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
BACKGROUND: Data on feasibility of TAVI and mortality prediction in the LFLG-AS population are scarce. Clinical risk assessment in this particular population is difficult, and a score has not yet been established for this purpose.
METHODS: A total of 212 heart failure (HF) patients with real LFLG-AS were enrolled. Patients were classified into low-risk (n = 108), intermediate-risk (n = 90) and high-risk (n = 14) groups calculated by the GWTG-HF score. Clinical outcomes of cardiovascular events according to Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC-2) recommendations and composite endpoint of death and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) were assessed at discharge and 1 year of follow-up.
RESULTS: Baseline parameters of the groups showed a median age of 81.0 years [77.0; 84.0] (79.0 vs. 82.0 vs. 86.0, respectively p &lt; 0.001), median EuroSCORE II of 6.6 [4.3; 10.7] (5.5 vs. 7.2 vs. 9.1, p = 0.004) and median indexed stroke volume of 26.7 mL/m2 [22.0; 31.0] (28.2 vs. 25.8 vs. 25.0, p = 0.004). The groups significantly differed at follow-up in terms of all-cause mortality (10.2 vs. 21.1 vs. 28.6%; p &lt; 0.035). There was no difference in intrahospital event rate (VARC). Postprocedural mean gradients were lower in high-risk group (7.0 vs. 7.0 vs. 5.0 mmHg, p = 0.011). No differences in postprocedural aortic valve area (1.9 vs. 1.7 vs. 1.9 cm2, p = 0.518) or rate of device failure (5.6 vs. 6.8 vs. 7.7%, p = 0.731) could be observed. After adjustment for known predictors, the GWTG score (HR 1.07 [1.01-1.14], p = 0.030) as well as pacemaker implantation (HR 3.97 [1.34-11.75], p = 0.013) turned out to be possible predictors for mortality. An increase in stroke volume index (SVI) was, in contrast, protective (HR 0.90 [0.83-0.97]; p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: The GWTG score may predict mortality after TAVI in LFLG-AS HF patients. Interestingly, all groups showed similar intrahospital event and mortality rates, independent of calculated mortality risk. Low SVI and new conduction disturbances associated with PPI after THV implantation had negative impact on mid-term outcome in post-TAVI HF-patients.
