Title: Long-Term Outcomes of Mechanical Aortic Valve Replacement in Children.

Abstract: When the options of aortic valve repair or the Ross procedure are not feasible or have been exhausted, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) may provide a reliable and structurally durable alternative, but with the limitations of long-term anticoagulation, thrombosis risk and lack of valve growth potential. In this article, we review the longitudinal outcomes of mechanical AVR in children in our institution and compare them to those recently reported by others. From 1978 to 2020, 62 patients underwent mechanical AVR at a median age of 12.4 years (interquartile range (IQR): 8.6-16.8 years). The most common underlying diagnoses were: conotruncal anomalies (40%, 25/62), congenital aortic stenosis (16%, 10/62), rheumatic valve disease (16%, 10/62), connective tissue disease (8.1%, 5/62) and infective endocarditis (6.5%, 4/62). Thirty-two patients (52%, 32/62) had at least 1 prior aortic valve surgery prior to mechanical AVR. Early death was 3.2% (2/62). Median follow-up was 14.4 years (IQR: 8.4-28.2 years). Kaplan-Meier survival was 96.8%, 91.9%, 86.3%, and 81.9% at 1, 5, 10, and 20 years. On competing risk analysis, the proportion of patients alive without aortic valve reoperation at 1, 5, 10, and 20 years was 95.2%, 87.0%, 75.5% and 55.4%, respectively, while the proportion of patients that had aortic valve reoperation (with death as a competing event) at 1, 5, 10, and 20 years was 1.6%, 4.9%, 12.8%, and 28.5%, respectively. In conclusion, when the options of aortic valve repair or the Ross procedure are not feasible in children, mechanical AVR is an alternative, yet the long-term rates of mortality and need for aortic valve reoperation are of concern.
