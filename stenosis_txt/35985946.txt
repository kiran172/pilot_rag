Title: Using Intravascular Lithotripsy to Facilitate Transfemoral Arterial Access for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Peripheral vascular assessment is important in pre-procedural planning for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). While alternative vascular access sites have been used in patients with hostile iliofemoral anatomy, femoral access has been established as the superior access method for procedural outcomes. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) can facilitate transfemoral access for TAVI in patients with calcific stenoses of the iliofemoral arteries. This How-To-Do-It article describes the procedural planning and methods for performing IVL in these patients.
