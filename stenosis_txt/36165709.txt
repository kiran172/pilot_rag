Title: A totally endoscopic approach for aortic valve surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to describe a new approach for totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: From October 2017 through December 2020, a total of 266 consecutive patients underwent totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement. Reoperations and combinations were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 266 patients with a median age of 72 (64, 79) years underwent totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement; of these, 250 (93.98%) patients were designated to undergo surgery because of aortic valve stenosis. The median follow-up index was 0.69 (0.30, 0.90). Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events occurred in 4 (1.50%) patients within 30â€‰days. Overall hospital mortality was 1.50%. Twenty additional deaths (7.52%) occurred during the 3-year follow-up period. An early thoracoscopic revision was needed in 7 patients due to signs of bleeding or cardiac tamponade. Fourteen patients required a permanent pacemaker implant.
CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective analysis of our early experience with totally endoscopic aortic valve replacement in 266 consecutive patients demonstrated satisfactory results, with low mortality and acceptable morbidity rates.
