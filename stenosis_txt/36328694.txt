Title: Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Without Saphenous Vein Grafting: JACC Review Topic of the Week.

Abstract: Approximately 95% of patients of any age undergoing contemporary, coronary bypass surgery will receive at least 1 saphenous vein graft (SVG). It is recognized that SVG will develop progressive and accelerated atherosclerosis, resulting in a stenosis, and in occlusion that occurs in 50% by 10 years postoperatively. For arterial conduits, there is little evidence of progressive failure as for SVG. Could avoidance of SVG (total arterial revascularization [TAR]) lead to a different late (>5 year) survival? A literature review of 23 studies (N = 100,314 matched patients) at a mean 8.8 years postoperative found reduced all-cause mortality for TAR (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.71-0.84; P < 0.001). An expanded analysis with a new unpublished data set (N = 63,288 matched patients) was combined with the literature review (N = 127,565). It found reduced all-cause mortality for TAR (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72-0.85; P < 0.001). Additional Bayesian analysis found a very high probability of a TAR-associated reduction all-cause mortality.
