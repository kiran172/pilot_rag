Title: Differences in Carotid Artery Geometry and Flow Caused by Body Postural Changes and Physical Exercise.

Abstract: Different body postures and physical exercises may lead to changes in arterial geometry and hemodynamics, which may be associated with the distribution of atherosclerosis lesions. This study was aimed at investigating potential geometric and hemodynamic changes of the carotid bifurcation in different body postures and after high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts. Three-dimensional vascular ultrasound (3DVUS) and Doppler ultrasound images were acquired for 21 healthy participants (aged 29 Â± 6 y, 14 men and 7 women) in different body postures (sitting and three sleeping postures [supine, left lateral and right lateral]) and after physical exercises. The common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) diameters of the left carotid artery were found to increase significantly from supine to left lateral (both p &lt;0.05). CCA diameters (p &lt; 0.05) and ICA/CCA diameter ratio (p &lt; 0.01) of the left carotid artery changed significantly from supine to sitting. Significant differences in CCA peak systolic velocity (CCA PSV, p &lt; 0.001), CCA end-diastolic velocity (CCA EDV, p &lt; 0.001), CCA pulsatility index (CCA PI, p &lt; 0.001) and maximum velocity-based wall shear stress at the CCA (WSS<sub>(max)</sub> at the CCA, p &lt; 0.001) were identified in different postures. After physical exercises, significant increases were observed in the CCA diameter (p &lt; 0.001), CCA PSV (p &lt; 0.001), ICA PSV (p &lt; 0.05), WSS<sub>(max)</sub> at the CCA (p &lt; 0.001) and WSS<sub>(max)</sub> at the ICA (p &lt; 0.05), as were significantly lower values of the CCA EDV (p &lt; 0.01) and ICA/CCA PSV ratio (p &lt; 0.05). Side-to-side differences were also detected in different postural change scenarios and after physical exercise; more significant differences were found to occur only in the left-sided carotid artery. Significant differences were identified under postural change and after physical exercise among healthy adults, suggesting that daily activity has an effect on the carotid bifurcation. These changes may be associated with formation and development of carotid atherosclerosis. Moreover, these side differences might be severe for patients and worth further attention in clinical practice.
