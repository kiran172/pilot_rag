Title: Vessel wall imaging features of Moyamoya disease in a North American population: patterns of negative remodelling, contrast enhancement, wall thickening, and stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study characterized vessel wall imaging (VWI) features of Moyamoya disease (MMD) in a predominantly adult population at a North American center.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with VWI were included. Twelve arterial segments were analyzed for wall thickening, degree and pattern of contrast enhancement, and remodeling.
RESULTS: Overall, 286 segments were evaluated in 24 patients (mean age = 36.0 years [range = 1-58]). Of 172 affected segments, 163 (95%) demonstrated negative remodeling. Complete vessel wall obliteration was most frequent in the proximal M1 (17/48, 35%). Affected segments enhanced in 72/172 (42%) (n = 15 for grade II; n = 54 for concentric and n = 18 for eccentric); 20 of 24 (83%) patients had at least one enhancing segment. Both enhancing and non-enhancing segments were present in 19/20 (95%) patients. Vessel wall enhancement was most common in the proximal segments and correlated to the degree of stenosis (p < 0.001), and outer wall diameter (p < 0.001), but not disease duration (p = 0.922) or Suzuki score (p = 0.477). Wall thickening was present in 82/172 (48%) affected segments and was associated with contrast enhancement (p < 0.001), degree of stenosis (p < 0.001), and smaller outer wall diameter (p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: This study presents VWI findings in North American patients with MMD. Negative remodeling was the most common finding. Most patients had both enhancing and non-enhancing abnormal segments. Vessel wall enhancement was most common in proximal segments, variable in pattern or degree and was correlated to the degree of stenosis and smaller outer wall diameter.
