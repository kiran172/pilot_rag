Title: Same-Day Discharge After Transcatheter Native Aortic and Mitral Valve-in-Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become the gold standard of care in the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis and transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement seems to be an attractive alternative to redo surgery. We report the first case of concomitant transcatheter aortic valve replacement/transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement that was performed under conscious sedation who was subsequently discharged the same day. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
