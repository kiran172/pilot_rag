Title: Ambulatory TAVR: Early Feasibility Experience During the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has modified practice for patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis and could result in higher mortality rates due to treatment delays. In this clinical case series, 3 patients underwent ambulatory transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) thanks to patient and entourage willingness, careful patient selection (including a history of permanent pacemaker placement), and a minimalist procedural approach. No complications occurred during the 30-day follow-up. Performing ambulatory TAVR could reduce the clinical consequences of wait times, minimize exposure to coronavirus contamination, and reduce the use of hospital resources that might be needed for COVID-19 patients. Thanks to a scrupulous minimalist TAVR protocol, ambulatory outpatient management of aortic stenosis was possible in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
