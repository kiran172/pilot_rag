Title: Congenital bilateral iliac vein anomalies in a Nigerian pediatric kidney transplant recipient: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: The finding of bilateral congenital common iliac vein anomalies is indeed uncommon. This article presents the case of an 11-year-old boy with end-stage renal disease who had kidney transplantation (KT). At presentation, he was found to have a large superficial vein running from the left groin over the suprapubic area. The arterial pulsation of both lower limbs was preserved, and there was no pedal edema. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed aplasia of the right common iliac vein, stenosis of the left common iliac vein, and marked dilatation of the left external and internal iliac veins. There were also varicosity of numerous pelvic veins and a collateral vein draining the right lower limb. This preoperative diagnosis was key to planning for surgery. On KT surgery, the renal allograft vein was anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion to the inferior vena cava and artery to the common iliac artery. The patient had a smooth postoperative recovery and continues to enjoy a normal renal function.
