Title: [Follow-up after urinary diversion].

Abstract: Radical cystectomy is currently the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Different parts of the small and large intestines can be utilized for continent and incontinent urinary diversion. The postoperative follow-up after urinary diversion should consider functional, metabolic and oncological aspects. The functional follow-up of (continent) urinary diversion includes stenosis, emptying disorders or incontinence. The oncological follow-up should focus on the detection of local, urethral and upper tract recurrences as well as distant metastases. As 90% of the tumor recurrences occur during the first 3 years, a close follow-up should be carried out during this period. Metabolic disturbances, such as vitamin B12 and bile acid deficits, acidosis and disorders of calcium metabolism can also occur during long-term follow-up. The metabolic follow-up should consider the metabolic consequences of the parts of the intestines utilized for the urinary diversion.
