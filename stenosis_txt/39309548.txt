Title: Mental state as a predictor of outcome in spinal stenosis surgery: Four quadrants model integrating patient satisfaction and functional outcome.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Mental status, characterised by anxiety and depression, significantly influences physical well-being, particularly in patients with spinal stenosis symptoms.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The prevalence of depression and anxiety in our cohort. The correlation between psychological distress and physical outcome after surgery, including postoperative recovery and satisfaction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaires evaluating anxiety and depression (HADS), functionality (ODI), quality of life (EQ-5D), and perceived recovery (Likert-scale) were sent to a randomly selected cohort of 450 lumbar spinal stenosis patients, with or without spondylolisthesis, who underwent surgery between 2007 and 2013. Results are presented, dichotomised by HADS score (score ≥8 indicating psychologically impaired) and in a Four Quadrants Model integrating functional outcomes and perceived recovery separately for psychologically impaired and non-impaired cases.
RESULTS: Among the 147 included patients, 32 (22%) exhibited anxiety and/or depression (impaired cases). Satisfactory outcome (perceived recovery) was reported in 29.0% of the impaired cases and 78.3% of the non-impaired cases (p < 0.001). The mean postoperative functionality score of the impaired cases was 42.46 ± 16.24, in contrast to 18.48 ± 18.25 for the non-impaired cases (p < 0.001). In the impaired group, only 12.5% achieved both a good functional outcome (ODI ≤24) and satisfactory perceived recovery, compared with 58.4% in the non-impaired group.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Patients reporting anxiety and/or depression demonstrate an inferior long-term outcome after spinal stenosis surgery compared to non-impaired patients. This clinically relevant difference underscores the importance of addressing depression and anxiety in preoperative counselling to optimize patient satisfaction and functional outcomes.
