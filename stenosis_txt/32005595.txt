Title: Percutaneous Aortic Valve Intervention in Patients Scheduled for Noncardiac Surgery: A Japanese Multicenter Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal management of preexisting severe aortic stenosis (AS) in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery (non-CS) remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous aortic valve intervention (PAVI) in patients with AS before non-CS.
METHODS: We analyzed pooled data within a multicenter Japanese registry from 118 patients with severe AS who underwent PAVI before non-CS. Sixty patients underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) and 58 patients underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The groups' baseline characteristics, perioperative complications, and 30-day mortality and midterm mortality after non-CS were compared.
RESULTS: The postprocedural mean pressure gradient was higher in the BAV group than in the TAVR group (35.0 ± 11.5 mmHg vs. 11.5 ± 4.8 mmHg, p < 0.001). The non-CS operation risk did not differ between the groups (p = 0.69). One patient in each group experienced a noncardiac death (p = 0.74), and the 30-day mortality rate after non-CS was 1.7%. Heart failure occurred in 2 patients in each group (p = 0.68). One patient in the TAVR group experienced a non-disabling stroke, and no myocardial infarctions occurred. Consequently, the combined adverse events were 5.0% and 6.9% in the 2 groups (p = 0.48). The bleeding rates during the non-CS were similar in both groups (33.3% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.25). There were no differences between the groups regarding midterm mortality (p = 0.60), whereas 53.3% of the patients in the BAV group required invasive treatment of their AS during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with severe AS, PAVI before non-CS reduces the AS severity and may contribute to procedural safety during non-CS.
