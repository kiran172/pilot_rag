Title: Full-Endoscopic Interlaminar Approach for Decompression of Lateral Recess Stenosis.

Abstract: For lateral recess stenosis, extensive decompression with laminectomy is still performed in most centers. However, tissue-sparing surgeries are becoming more common. Full-endoscopic spinal surgeries have the advantages of being less invasive and offering a shorter recovery time. Here, we describe the technique of the full-endoscopic interlaminar approach for the decompression of lateral recess stenosis. The full-endoscopic interlaminar approach for the lateral recess stenosis procedure took approximately 51 min (range of 39-66 min). Blood loss could not be measured due to continuous irrigation. However, no drainage was required. There were no dura mater injuries reported in our institution. Furthermore, there were no injuries to the nerves, no cauda equine syndrome, and no hematoma formation. The patients were mobilized on the same day as surgery and discharged the next day. Therefore, the full-endoscopic technique for lateral recess stenosis decompression is a feasible procedure that lowers the operational time, complications, traumatization, and rehabilitation duration.
