Title: Aortic valve calcification in the era of non-coding RNAs: The revolution to come in aortic stenosis management?

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis remains the most frequent structural heart disease, especially in the elderly. During the last decade, we noticed an important consideration and a huge number of publications related to the medical and surgical treatment of this disease. However, the molecular aspect of this degenerative issue has also been more widely studied recently. As evidenced in oncologic but also cardiac research fields, the emergence of microRNAs in the molecular screening and follow-up makes them potential biomarkers in the future, for the diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of aortic stenosis. Herein, we present a review on the implication of microRNAs in the aortic valve disease management. After listing and describing the main miRNAs of interest in the field, we provide an outline to develop miRNAs as innovative biomarkers and innovative therapeutic strategies, and describe a groundbreaking pre-clinical study using inhibitors of miR-34a in a pre-clinical model of aortic valve stenosis.
