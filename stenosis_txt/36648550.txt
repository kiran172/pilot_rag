Title: CT evaluation of unilateral pulsatile tinnitus with jugular bulb wall dehiscence.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the imaging features of unilateral pulsatile tinnitus (PT) with jugular bulb wall dehiscence (JBWD).
METHODS: Computerized tomography angiography images of unilateral PT patients were reviewed between 2019 and 2021. Thirty-one symptomatic JBWD patients without sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence (SSWD) were included. Thirty-eight patients with SSWD were used as the control group. The prevalence of JBWD was calculated. The area and height of the jugular bulb, the extent of dehiscence, the presence of jugular bulb diverticulum, posterior condylar emissary vein (PCEV), oblique occipital sinus (OOS), venous outflow laterality (VOL), the degree of transverse sinus stenosis (TSS), and the pituitary height to sella turcica ratio were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The prevalence of JBWD was 12.1%, and JBWD was established as a causative diagnosis in 5.0% of unilateral PT patients. There were no statistical differences in the gender, symptomatic side, or VOL between the two groups. The area of the jugular bulb was larger and the height was higher (p<sub>area</sub> &lt; 0.001, p<sub>height</sub> = 0.005). The prevalence of jugular bulb diverticulum was higher in the JBWD group (p = 0.002). The degree of symptomatic TSS was less severe (p &lt; 0.001), and the prevalence of bilateral TSS was lower in the JBWD group (p &lt; 0.001). The pituitary height to sella turcica ratio was greater (p = 0.004), the prevalence of PCEV (p = 0.014) was lower, and OOS (p = 0.015) was greater in the JBWD group.
CONCLUSIONS: The correlating factors of PT with JBWD and PT with SSWD are significantly different. These findings can further facilitate early and efficient PT treatment.
KEY POINTS: • The incidence of jugular bulb dehiscence (JBWD) accounted for approximately 12.1% in pulsatile tinnitus (PT) patients, and JBWD was established as a causative diagnosis in 5.0% of PT patients. • PT required large blood flows and abnormal flow patterns, whether in JBWD or sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence groups. • JBWD causing PT has some unique characteristic findings on CT.
