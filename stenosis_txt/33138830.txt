Title: Vaginal delivery in a patient with severe aortic stenosis under epidural analgesia, a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A history of previous cardiac disease increases the maternal mortality risk by as much as 100%. There is no consensus on the absolute contraindications to vaginal delivery in valvular heart disease, but central regional anesthesia is traditionally considered contraindicated in patients with severe aortic stenosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old primigravid woman with severe aortic stenosis was admitted to the obstetrics department for programmed labor induction. With epidural anesthesia and mini-invasive hemodynamic monitoring labor and operative vaginal delivery were well tolerated, and hemodynamic stability was always maintained.
CONCLUSIONS: Epidural analgesia and oxytocin induction are possible for the labor management of parturients with severe aortic stenosis given that continuous non-invasive followed by invasive hemodynamic monitoring can be provided and given the absence of any obstetric or cardiologic contraindications and the strong will of the patient.
