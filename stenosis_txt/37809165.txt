Title: A Case Report on the Diagnosis of Acute Abdominal Aortic Occlusion Using Point-of-Care Ultrasound in the Emergency Department.

Abstract: Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) can be used to detect and evaluate for an aneurysm and/or a dissection of the abdominal aorta in suspected patients in the Emergency Department (ED). Despite the routine use of PoCUS for the assessment of the abdominal aorta in suspected aortic aneurysms and dissections, there is limited literature regarding its use in the diagnosis of acute abdominal aortic occlusions in the emergency setting. This is a case demonstrating the use of PoCUS in identifying an acute aortic occlusion in a 71-year-old female patient with known hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with central abdominal pain and bilateral lower limb weakness to the ED. The patient had multiple differential diagnoses, including a possible acute aortic occlusion of the abdominal aorta. PoCUS of the aorta was utilized to diagnose an acute abdominal aortic occlusion in the ED. The rapid diagnosis expedited the referral to vascular surgeons for definitive management. Acute abdominal aortic occlusion is a time-sensitive and life-threatening emergency. PoCUS of the abdominal aorta to detect acute abdominal occlusions allows for a rapid diagnosis with the potential to improve outcomes. A protocol for detecting acute abdominal aortic occlusion should be included in the standard aorta PoCUS scan.
