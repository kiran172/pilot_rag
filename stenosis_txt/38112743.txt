Title: Sex differences of sequential changes in coronary blood flow and microvascular function in patients with suspected angina.

Abstract: AIMS: This study evaluated the sex differences of sequential changes in coronary blood flows and microvascular function in patients with suspected angina but with no obstructed coronary arteries.
METHODS: A total of 202 consecutive patients who experienced chest pain but had no significant coronary artery stenosis and who underwent adenosine stress echocardiography were included in the study. Coronary blood flow (CBF) velocities were measured at 1, 2, and 3 min after adenosine infusion.
RESULTS: The mean age was 61 years, and 138 (68%) were women. Approximately 40% of patients had coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD, coronary flow velocity reserve < 2.3), with women exhibiting higher CMD prevalence. The left ventricular (LV) mass index was similar between men and women, while women exhibited higher baseline rate pressure products (RPP). At baseline, coronary blood flow velocities were similar between the sexes. However, CBF velocities in women gradually increased during the examination; and in men, the increase was abrupt and steep during the early stages of examination (p = 0.015 for interaction between time and sex), even with similar RPP in stress. Coronary flow velocity reserve was steadily lower in women compared to men (1 min, 2.09 ± 0.86 vs 2.44 ± 0.87; 2 min, 2.39 ± 0.72 vs 2.63 ± 0.85; 3 min, 2.45 ± 0.70 vs 2.68 ± 0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with suspected angina but with no obstructed coronary arteries, CMD was especially prevalent among women. Women exhibited higher oxygen consumption, while exhibiting slower and gradual increases in CBF velocities. Conversely, men exhibited faster and steeper increases in CBF velocities even with similar RPP in stress.
