Title: Interventional treatment of giant tracheal lymphoma under rigid bronchoscopy: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Lymphoma can appear in all parts of the body and present with different symptoms. However, bronchial lymphoma is rare and can be misdiagnosed as airway malignancy or lung disease.Patient: An older adult woman with tracheal lymphoma experienced severe breathing difficulties, and chest computed tomography indicated severe narrowing of the airway. She did not respond to repeated antibiotic treatment, and she was eventually diagnosed with lymphoma based on pathology after surgical removal of the tumor.
DIAGNOSIS: The patient received a diagnosis of thoracic tracheal stenosis due to intratracheal inflammatory granulomatous lesions or a tumor.
INTERVENTIONS: Treatment involved the use of a high-frequency electrotome, freezing, and argon plasma coagulation.
OUTCOMES: The patient reported improvements in dyspnea, cough, and other symptoms after the operation. The pathological results confirmed follicular lymphoma. Reexamination by fiberbronchoscopy indicated that the degree of stenosis in the middle and upper tracheal segments was significantly reduced following interventional therapy.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic interventional therapy can be an effective treatment for tracheal lymphoma.
