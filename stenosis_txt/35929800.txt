Title: Bilateral pulmonary artery banding for transposition of the great arteries complex with coarctation.

Abstract: Surgical approaches for transposition of the great arteries with aortic arch obstruction include primary repair and two-stage repair. However, neither approach provides a satisfactory outcome. We report a case of patient who underwent two-stage repair, wherein arterial switch operation combined with aortic arch reconstruction was preceded by bilateral pulmonary artery banding; this yielded good outcomes. This approach safely avoids primary repair in the neonatal period and allows for the opportunity to evaluate right ventricle outlet tract stenosis before the definitive repair.
