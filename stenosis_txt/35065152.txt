Title: Evolution of right ventricular dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation after TAVI: A prospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) may impact prognosis of patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). We aimed to evaluate the evolution of previous RV dysfunction and/or significant TR after TAVI procedure.
METHODS: All patients undergoing TAVI between January 2018 and January 2019 were enrolled in this prospective cohort. Patients with at least one right heart (RH) abnormality at baseline including RV dysfunction (TAPSE < 17 mm, S-wave < 9.5 cm/s, Fractional area change < 35%, Strain > -20%, Tei > 0.54) and/or significant TR (Effective Regurgitant Orifice Area ≥ 40 mm2 and/or Regurgitant Volume ≥ 45 mL) underwent transthoracic echocardiography at day 1 and 6-month after TAVI. The primary endpoint was the regression of pre-TAVI RV dysfunction and/or significant TR at 6-month follow-up.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 144 patients including 76 women (52.8%) with a mean age of 81.1 ± 6.8 yo, a mean EuroSCORE 2 of 5.2 ± 3.9%. At least one RH abnormality was observed in 53 patients (36.8%). At 6-month, at least one RV dysfunction parameter significantly improved in 26 patients (63.4%), TAPSE increasing from 13.0 ± 2.6 to 16.0 ± 9.8 mm, p < 0.0001 and S-wave from 7.7 ± 1.2 to 10.0 ± 2.6 cm/s, p = 0.004. Among 31 patients with baseline significant TR, TR decreased in 14 (45.2%); p = 0.003. Among patients with baseline RH abnormalities, 13 (24.5%) fully recovered. Baseline significant TR was predictive of 6-month clinical outcomes (OR = 3.1, 95%CI = [1.01-9.0], p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: In our recent intermediate surgical risk TAVI population, RV dysfunction and/or significant TR are frequent at baseline and fully or partially recover in most patients at 6-month follow-up.
