Title: Placement of a newly designed partially covered T- or Y-configured self-expanding metallic stent for hilar biliary obstruction: technical note.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the technical success, efficacy, and safety of a newly designed partially covered bilateral self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) in patients with malignant biliary obstruction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From May 2016 to November 2017, ten patients with malignant hilar biliary stenosis (bismuth type II-IV) underwent stent placement with the newly designed partially covered T/Y-configured SEMS. Technical success, drainage catheter removal, jaundice remission, early and late complications, stent patency, and overall survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: The stent was successfully deployed in all patients. The total bilirubin level significantly decreased one month after stent placement (P < 0.05). Drainage catheter removal rate was 90%. Two cases (20%) experienced early complications (bile duct hemorrhage and cholangitis) and two cases (20%) experienced late complications (hepatic abscess and cholangitis). During the follow-up (mean 276 days; range 57-503 days) stent occlusion occurred in three patients (30%), and two patents died of hepatic failure. The median stent patency and overall survival were 275 days (95% CI 223.8-326.3 days) and 428.9 days (95% CI 347.9-509.8 days), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The newly designed partially covered T/Y-configured SEMS is technically feasible and clinically effective for biliary trifurcation obstruction.
