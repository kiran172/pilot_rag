Title: Left ventricular mass regression after aortic valve replacement with the TTK Chitra™ monoleaflet tilting disc valve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the extent of left ventricular (LV) mass regression in aortic stenosis after aortic valve replacement with the TTK Chitra™ tilting disc valve.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study included patients with severe isolated aortic stenosis (AS), admitted in our department. They had aortic valve replacement (AVR) with the TTK Chitra™ tilting disc valve, between January 2008 and December 2010. Data were collected from consecutive forty-eight patients. LV mass and diametric and functional parameters were recorded preoperatively and compared with echocardiography after 3 months, 6 months, then yearly, up to 3 years.
RESULTS: 70.8% of the patients were males and 29.2% were females. The mean duration of illness was 37.92 ± 25.87 months. The mean LV ejection fraction increased 3 months after surgery (61.56 ± 10.10% to 69.31 ± 9.34%) with a sustained increase for the next 3 years. The mean LV end-diastolic diameter decreased (50.16 ± 6.05 mm to 45.69 ± 5.93 mm) after 3 months of surgery, with a sustained decrease for the next 3 years. The mean LV end-systolic diameter decreased (32.84 ± 6.96 mm to 29.41 ± 5.86 mm) after 3 months of surgery and then showed a sustained decrease for the next 3 years. The LV mass assessed with echocardiography regressed from 324.65 ± 97.77 g before surgery to 252.64 ± 71.12 g after 3 months and then showed a sustained decrease over the next 3 years.
CONCLUSION: Significant LV mass regression occurred after AVR with the TTK Chitra™ valve. The maximum reversal was found to be within the first 3 months after surgery with sustained beneficial improvement for the next 3 years.
