Title: Hoarseness: its spectrum, associations and management in a tertiary care centre in India.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the demographic, aetiopathological and diagnostic profiles of patients presenting with hoarseness to a laryngology unit of a tertiary care centre in India.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted.
RESULTS: The 1033 patients who presented with dysphonia showed a male predominance (70 per cent), high rates of malignancy (18 per cent), late presentation (mean, 24 months) and poor follow-up trends (53 per cent with 3 months' follow up), which contrasts with data from developed countries. The patient population hailed from different states in India and neighbouring countries around India, serving as a good sample for the subcontinent. The majority (67 per cent) were managed conservatively; however, surgical management was the preferred choice for those who presented with airway stenosis (91 per cent) and laryngeal trauma (75 per cent). Significant associations between vocal professionalism level and co-morbidities and dysphonia aetiopathologies are discussed.
CONCLUSION: These findings give insight into the trends of hoarseness in the developing Indian subcontinent, which can aid understanding and management.
