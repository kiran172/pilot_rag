Title: Endoscopic selective biliary stenting and reintervention using metal stents with a slim delivery system in a patient with complexly altered digestive anatomy.

Abstract: Nishikawa and colleagues describe a case of endoscopic multiple stenting for malignant biliary stenosis in a patient with complexly altered digestive anatomy following hepaticojejunostomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis and gastrojejunostomy with Braun enterostomy. Furthermore, reintervention for malignant stenosis extending from the intrahepatic bile duct to the intestinal tract was successfully completed.
