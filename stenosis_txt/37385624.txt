Title: A nonobstructive condition: Medial arterial calcification.

Abstract: Vascular calcification, including intimal and medial calcification, is closely associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular diseases. Although increased understandings were achieved, people still know much more about intimal calcification than medial calcification because the latter doesn't obstruct the arterial lumen, commonly considered as a non-significant finding. We clarified the pathologic characteristic of medial calcification, its difference from intimal calcification, principally focused on its clinical relevance, such as diagnosis, nosogenesis, and hemodynamics. We underline the importance of identifying and distinguishing medial calcification, understanding its effect to local/systematic arterial compliance, and relationship to diabetic neuropathy. Recent studies emphasize do not ignore its predictive role in cardiovascular mortality. It is of great clinical significance to summarize the mechanisms of occurrence, lesion characteristics, diagnostic methods, pathogenic mechanisms, hemodynamic changes, and the distinction as well as association of intimal calcification with intimal calcification.
