Title: Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-assisted treatment of severe airway stenosis due to goiter: Two case reports.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a critical care intervention that acts as a temporary substitute for the heart and lungs, facilitating adequate tissue perfusion and gas exchange. The 2 primary configurations, veno-arterial and veno-venous ECMO, are tailored to support either the heart and lungs or the lungs alone, respectively.
PATIENT CONCERNS: The case report details patients with tumor-induced airway stenosis who encountered limitations with standard treatments, which were either insufficient or carried the risk of severe complications such as hypoxia and asphyxia.
DIAGNOSES: Patients were diagnosed with severe airway stenosis caused by goiter, a condition that required innovative treatment approaches to prevent complications during the management process.
INTERVENTIONS: Veno-venous ECMO was implemented as a bridging therapy to provide vital respiratory support during the tumor resection procedure. This intervention was crucial in reducing the risks associated with airway edema or tumor rupture.
OUTCOMES: With the use of veno-venous ECMO, the patients successfully underwent tumor resection. They were subsequently weaned off the ECMO support, and after a course of treatment, they were discharged in good condition.
LESSONS: The case demonstrates the efficacy of veno-venous ECMO as a bridging therapy for managing severe airway stenosis caused by goiter. Its use facilitated the successful resection of tumors and led to positive patient outcomes, highlighting its potential as a valuable treatment option in similar scenarios.
