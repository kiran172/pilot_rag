Title: Redo aortic valve replacement due to early structural valve deterioration in a trifecta valve: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: While the number of SAVR cases has been increasing for patients below their sixties due to the improvement of bioprosthetic valves, some early structural valve deterioration (SVD) in Trifecta valves has been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a female who presented with sudden shortness of breath. Ultrasonography diagnosed SVD. We performed redo aortic valve replacement due to SVD in Trifecta valve. With our surgical technique we could remove the bioprosthetic valve easily.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: We could easily remove the mounted prosthetic valve along with the titanium band. These cases may emerge with acute heart failure due to sudden massive aortic regurgitation, not like the gradual progression of stenosis due to calcification.
CONCLUSION: The postoperative course in Trifecta recipients must be followed carefully.
