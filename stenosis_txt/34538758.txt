Title: Surgical navigation in parotid sialolith extraction.

Abstract: Posterior parotid lithiasis may in some cases require a combined surgical approach associating sialendoscopy to an external intraoral or transfacial approach. This single-center retrospective study describes the surgical technique for parotid lithiasis extraction by a combined external and sialendoscopic approach with the help of CT-navigation. Five patients were included between November 2014 and July 2020. The sialolith was extracted in 100% of cases. Navigation and transillumination localizations matched consistently. No patients showed postoperative facial paresis. At 2 to 21 months' follow-up, there was no recurrence of sialolithiasis. Navigation can be a complement to transillumination, improving surgical comfort and safety, but does not replace first-line sialendoscopy. Visual control is required whenever possible after extraction. In combined procedures, it enables accurate identification of parotid sialoliths. In case of impassable stenosis, it could be a therapeutic alternative to parotidectomy.
