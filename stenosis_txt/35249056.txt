Title: [A Case in Which Inferior Vena Cava Stent Placement Was Effective for Inferior Vena Cava Stenosis Due to Metastatic Liver Tumor].

Abstract: A 60s woman was diagnosed with cecal cancer with multiple liver metastases(final pathology was T4aN1M1[H1])and underwent ileocecal resection and D3 dissection. She did not wish for postoperative chemotherapy and surgical treatment of liver metastases. One and a half years after surgery, she developed extremity edema of lower legs and hypoalbuminemia, and she gained 20 kg. Contrast-enhanced CT showed stenosis of the inferior vena cava due to liver metastases, which was markedly improved the symptoms by placement of an inferior vena cava stent. Inferior vena cava stent placement is a minimally invasive treatment and can be an option as it can be expected to improve quality of life in some cases.
