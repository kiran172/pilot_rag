Title: Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry methods for the selective and sensitive determination of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, its sulfate, and/or glucuronide conjugates in plasma.

Abstract: 24S-hydroxycholesterol (i.e., cerebrosterol, 24S-OH-Chol) is the main form of cholesterol elimination from the brain. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods were developed for the quantification of the total and unesterified/unbound fractions of 24S-OH-Chol, its monosulfate, monoglucuronide, and diconjugate derivatives (24S-OH-Chol-3sulfate [3S], 24S-OH-Chol-24glucuronide [24G] and 24S-OH-Chol-3S, 24G, respectively) in human plasma. Linearity, precision, accuracy, and extraction recovery were validated within the typical physiological and pathological ranges of concentrations for each compound. The lower limit of quantifications was 2.00, 0.33, 0.26, and 0.74 ng/ml for 24S-OH-Chol, 24S-OH-Chol-24G, 24S-OH-Chol-3S, and 24-OH-Chol-3S, 24G, respectively. Extraction recovery values in total and unbound plasma fractions were also analyzed in murine and monkey plasma and varied from 73% in mouse to 113% in cynomolgus monkey. The methods could rapidly (less than 7 min) quantify individual compounds with high sensitivity, accuracy (bias ≤15%), and reproducibility (coefficient of variation [CV] ≤ 17%). Their clinical applications were validated by measuring levels of the 4 compounds in samples from 20 noncholestatic donors, 5 cholestatic patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis, and 10 patients suffering from biliary stenosis. Results highlight the abundance of 24S-OH-Chol in the total fraction and the abundance of 24S-OH-Chol-3S and 24G in the unbound ones. While the latter strongly accumulate in plasma fractions of cholestatic patients, levels of 24S-OH-Chol remained similar to those of healthy donors. Our results indicate that this approach is suitable for monitoring cerebrosterol and its conjugates in large-scale clinical studies.
