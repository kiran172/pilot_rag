Title: Blended Phenotype of NOTCH3 and RNF213 Variants With Accelerated Large and Small Artery Crosstalk: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Recent advancements in genome research have revealed not only the importance of variants associated with cerebrovascular diseases but also a notably high frequency of carriers harboring multiple variants, presenting with an elusive blended phenotype. In this study, we report the case of a 66-year-old man who experienced 3 stroke episodes over a 4-year period, starting at the age of 62 years. The patient presented with isolated infarcts in the left temporal pole with progressive stenosis in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery based on large and small artery crosstalk.
METHODS: Exons 2-24 of the NOTCH3 gene were analyzed by direct genomic DNA sequencing. The presence of the p.Arg4810Lys variant of the ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) gene was evaluated using real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Diagnoses of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy and RNF213-related vasculopathy were made based on the early-onset recurrent stroke episode, progressive intracranial artery stenosis, and presence of the heterozygous NOTCH3 p.Cys1250Arg and RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys variants.
DISCUSSION: Temporal pole infarcts could represent a blended phenotype of both variants. This case highlights the importance of large and small artery crosstalk and the pivotal role of genetic analysis in determining the pathogenesis of stroke and dementia.
