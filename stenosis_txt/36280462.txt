Title: Nonsplenorenal Spontaneous Portosystemic Shunts in Liver Transplant Attitude and Outcomes: A Single-Center Series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Management of nonsplenorenal spontaneous portosystemic shunts (NSRSPSS) in liver transplant (LT) is controversial. Reports on the influence of its ligation suggest improvements in morbidity and survival.
METHODS: Retrospective study of a single-center series. The objective was to analyze the outcomes and post-LT survival after the closure of NSRSPSS.
RESULTS: Between January 2005 and April 2021 a total of 23 patients with NSRSPSS underwent LT. The shunt was superior mesenteric vein-vena cava in 12 (52.2%), inferior mesenteric vein-vena cava in 6 (26.1%), through the left gastric vein in 4 (17.4%), and portocava in 1 (4.3%). Seven patients presented portal vein thrombosis, with thrombectomy being performed in 5. Moreover, 21 patients had portoportal anastomosis, 1 patient required portal reconstruction at the splenomesenteric confluence, and 1 had a coronary-portal anastomosis. The NSRSPSS was closed in 22 cases (95.7%). The mean (SD) portal flow before and after the closure of NSRSPSS was 1395 (572) mL/min and 1773 (583) mL/min (104.4 [47.9] mL/min/100 g and 127.9 [4.9] mL/min/100 g, respectively). Six patients (26.1%) presented primary graft dysfunction, 13 (56.5%) acute kidney injury, and 9 (39%) ascites. Three arterial stenoses (13%), 2 biliary stenoses (8.6%), and 1 intrahepatic portal thrombosis (4.3%) occurred. Median intensive care unit and hospital stay was 5 days (range, 3-8 days) and 15 days (range, 13-21 days). After a mean follow-up of 5.18 (3.2) years, all patients except 1 are alive.
CONCLUSIONS: The closure of the NSRSPSS during LT can optimize portal flow, with potential influence in morbidity and survival rates.
