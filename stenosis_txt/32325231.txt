Title: Follow-up after carotid stenting with the CASPER stent system: A duplex ultrasound evaluation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report results of duplex ultrasound evaluation of consecutive patients after carotid stenting with the double layer Carotid Artery Stent designed to Prevent Embolic Release (CASPER) stent system.
METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2017, a single-center, retrospective study of 101 consecutive patients (21.8% female; median age, 72.1 years) was performed. Patients with internal carotid artery stenosis treated with the CASPER stent were included. Eligibility criteria for stenting included stenosis of ≥70% of the vessel diameter (or ≥50% diameter with ulceration) in symptomatic carotid artery stenosis or ≥80% stenosis in asymptomatic patients at the carotid artery bifurcation or the proximal cervical internal carotid artery. Duplex ultrasound examination was performed before and within 24 hours of implantation as well as at 14 days, and 3, 6, and 12 months.
RESULTS: At the 12-month follow-up visit, moderate in-stent restenosis (ISR) (≥50% and <70%) was detected in three stents (2.8%) and severe (≥70%) ISR in two (1.9%; including one case of stent occlusion). All but the two latter patients remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period. One patient required retreatment for ISR after a minor stroke and another patient with stent occlusion also re-presented with a minor stroke. Multivariable logistic regression was unable to detect any significant factors associated with ISR.
CONCLUSIONS: Duplex ultrasound examination after carotid stenting is a useful tool for patient follow-up and determination of ISR. We found a low incidence of ISR assessed by duplex ultrasound examination at 12 months after CASPER stenting, but further studies are warranted.
