Title: The Genetics of Canine Pulmonary Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: There have been recent advancements in understanding the genetic contribution to pulmonary valve stenosis (PS) in brachycephalic breeds such as the French Bulldog and Bulldog. The associated genes are transcriptions factors involved in cardiac development, which is comparable to the genes that cause PS in humans. However, validation studies and functional follow up is necessary before this information can be used for screening purposes.
