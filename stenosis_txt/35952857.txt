Title: Incidence of Persistent Left Bundle Branch Block After Rapid-Deployment Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We evaluated the incidence, prognosis, and predictive factors of new onset of persistent left bundle branch block (NOP-LBBB) after rapid-deployment aortic valve replacement (RD-AVR).
METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective, single-center study of 274 consecutive patients with no baseline ventricular conduction disorder and no previous permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) who underwent RD-AVR with an INTUITY valve (n = 55) or INTUITY Elite Valve (n = 219) (Edwards Lifesciences). Transthoracic echocardiography and 12-lead electrocardiography was performed preoperatively, at discharge, and at 1-month and 1-year intervals. The incidence, prognosis, and predictive factors of NOP-LBBB were evaluated.
RESULTS: NOP-LBBB occurred in 58 patients (21.2%) after discharge. In multivariate analysis, age (P < .01), INTUITY valve diameter ≥23 mm (P = .02), and INTUITY Elite implantation (P = .01) were independent predictors of NOP-LBBB. By 1:1 propensity matching analysis between the NOP-LBBB group and the control group, there were no significant differences in 1-year overall mortality (P = .23), hospitalization for congestive heart failure (P = .99), or PPI (P = .99). NOP-LBBB exposed patients to a high rate of dysrhythmic events (12.1% vs 1.4%, P < .01) and was associated with a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (0.62 ± 0.095 vs 0.652 ± 0.0783, P = .02) without an impact on New York Heart Association functional status (1.25 ± 0.32 and 1.52 ± 0.70, P = .32). PPI was performed in 17 patients (6.2%) before discharge, including 14 NOP-LBBB patients.
CONCLUSIONS: NOP-LBBB after RD-AVR is prevalent in patients with no prior conduction disorders. INTUITY Elite is associated with a significantly higher rate of NOP-LBBB. The persistence of NOP-LBBB predisposed patients to the occurrence of high-grade conduction disorders and might have led to PPI but did not increase death or hospitalization for congestive heart failure.
