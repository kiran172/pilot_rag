Title: A Stepwise Haemostasis Intraoperative Protocol Driven Reduction of Haematoma Rate Following Symptomatic Carotidendarterectomy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for symptomatic stenosis reduces further stroke risk. Post-CEA haematoma increases the risk of complications including stroke. There are few studies considering protocols aimed at reducing post-CEA haematoma rates. Presented are the outcomes of a protocol developed to reduce this surgical complication.
METHOD: The protocol was implemented in 112 consecutive CEA. It involves stepwise additional measures to ensure haemostasis before wound closure. Attention to bleeding points is followed by light compression for 10 min. Protamine is then given if haemostasis has not been achieved. If after 20 min the problem persists Tranexamic acid is given. Following a further 20 min if haemostasis is not yet achieved a platelet transfusion is undertaken. Haematoma rates, return to theatre for post-operative haematoma and other complications were compared with 100 consecutive pre-protocol introduction CEA cases.
RESULTS: Of 112 CEA patients, 19 received protamine, 8 protamine and tranexamic acid. One case required platelet transfusion. Neck haematoma rate fell from 10 to 3 cases (P = .02, OR: 0.25 [95% CI .07-.94]), of which returned to theatre for haematoma evacuation fell from 6 to 1 case (P = .03, OR: 0.14 [95% CI .02-1.19]). 30 day stroke and death rate reduced from 5% to 1.8% (P = .11, OR: 0.35 [95% CI .07-1.82]).
CONCLUSION: The stepwise haemostasis intraoperative protocol can reduce post-CEA haematoma rates.
