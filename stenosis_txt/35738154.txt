Title: Resolution of chylopericardium after balloon dilatation of tricuspid valve stenosis in a Labrador Retriever.

Abstract: A 2-year-old 33 kg female castrated Labrador Retriever was referred for exercise intolerance, hyporexia, and abdominal distention. Point-of-care ultrasound revealed ascites, hepatic congestion, severe pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was performed, and the chylous nature of the fluid was confirmed by cytology, triglyceride, and cholesterol measurements. Repeated pericardiocentesis was necessary within 24-h after admission, after which a pericardial stay-catheter was placed. Cardiac ultrasound revealed severe tricuspid valve stenosis. Balloon dilatation of the stenotic valve was performed, resulting in a significant drop in the mean diastolic trans-valvular Doppler gradient and long-term resolution of the chylopericardium. No other cause for the pericardial effusion could be identified, suggesting that this is the first described case of chylopericardium due to tricuspid valve stenosis.
