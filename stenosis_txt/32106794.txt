Title: Vascular deformation in human atherosclerotic carotid artery evaluated by 2D analysis of ultrasonography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Common carotid artery (CCA) remodelling in the atherosclerosis process is an inherent necessary element that decreases the progress of significant lumen compromise. The present study used a semi-automated method to assess relationships of intima-media thickness (IMT), lumen diameter (LD) and inter-adventitial diameter (IAD) using ultrasound B-mode images of atherosclerotic carotid artery.
METHODS: In the cross-sectional study, 120 male subjects (age range: 40-60 years) were classified into four research groups namely control, mild, moderate, and severe stenosis. The maximum near and far wall IMT, mean of both walls' IMT and IAD, and also LD of the left CCA were extracted for all participants. Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to investigate relationships of IMT, LD, and IAD.
RESULTS: Results revealed that the maximum far and near wall IMT, mean of both walls' IMT and IAD in the CCA were significantly different in stenosis patients and the control group (p&lt; 0.001). However, there were no significant differences among the four studied groups in terms of LD of CCA (p = 0.65). There was a stronger correlation between mean of both walls' IMT and IAD in comparison with mean far wall IMT and IAD (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that changes of IAD in the left CCA were associated with carotid deformation, and thus it can be considered as a predictor of atherosclerosis process.
