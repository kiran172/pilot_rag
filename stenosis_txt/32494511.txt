Title: Heyde Syndrome: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Heyde syndrome is characterized by an association between gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and calcific aortic stenosis (AS). Although the course of disease progression that links AS and GI bleeding has not been determined, overlaps among AS, intestinal dysplasia, and acquired von Willebrand's syndrome are thought to result in GI bleeding. Aortic valve repair in some patients has been reported to result in marked improvement or the complete resolution of signs and symptoms of Heyde syndrome. The prevalence of Heyde syndrome is higher among elderly persons than among other age groups, suggesting that a degenerative process may be a significant factor in the disease progression. This report describes a patient with Heyde syndrome, as well as a review of the current literature.
