Title: Risk factors for early neurological deterioration in acute isolated pontine infarction without any causative artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the risk predictors for early neurological deterioration (END) in isolated acute pontine infarction without any causative artery stenosis.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with isolated acute pontine infarction within 72 h of symptom onset were enrolled between October 2017 and December 2021. END was defined as an increase in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥ 2 points within the first week postadmission. Patients were divided into the END and the non-END groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate independent predictors of END in patients with isolated acute pontine infarction.
RESULTS: A total of 153 patients were included in the final study (62 females; mean age, 67.27 ± 11.35 years), of whom 28.7% (47 of 153) experienced END. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that infarct volume (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001-1.005; P = 0.002) and basilar artery branch disease  (aOR, 3.388; 95% CI, 1.102-10.417; P = 0.033) were associated with END. The combined ROC analysis of the infarct volume and basilar artery branch disease for predicting END showed that the sensitivity and specificity were 80.9% and 72.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Basilar artery branch disease and infarct volume were associated with END in acute isolated pontine infarction and may be useful prognostic factors for neurological progression.
