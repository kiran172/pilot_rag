Title: Association between internal carotid artery kinking and ischemic stroke: A population-based cross-sectional study.

Abstract: AIM: Evidence for an association between Internal carotid artery (ICA) kinking and ischemic stroke has been controversial. We aimed to examine the association between ICA tortuosity and risk of ischemic stroke and specific ischemic stroke subtypes (large artery atherosclerosis, LAA; small artery occlusion, SAO).
METHODS: A total of 419 outpatients were included in this cross-sectional study. ICA kinking was objectively assessed by head and neck computed tomography angiography (CTA). The risk of ischemic stroke for each patient was evaluated according to the Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS). Ischemic stroke subtypes (LAA and SAO) were measure with head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: The average age of patients was 59.1 years (SD = 13.25) and 264 (63.0 %) were males. The prevalence of ICA kinking in this sample was 31.5 % (132 out of 419). Individuals with ICA kinking was associated with 0.55-points increase in ESRS score than those without ICA kinking (95 % CI, 0.28-0.81, p < 0.001) among patients over 50 years. In addition, right ICA kinking or left ICA kinking were associated with 0.35-points (95 % CI, 0.08-0.63) and 0.49-points (95 % CI, 0.23-0.76) increase in ESRS score, respectively. For specific ischemic stroke subtypes, individuals with ICA kinking had a 10.34-fold increased risk of SAO compared to those without ICA kinking (95 % CI, 6.22-20.68). Individuals with right ICA kinking had a 4.51-fold risk of SAO than those without kinking (95 % CI, 2.64-7.71), and had an 8.86-fold risk of SAO than those without kinking in the left ICA kinking (95 % CI, 4.97-15.79).
CONCLUSION: Our findings support the role of ICA kinking on ischemic stroke. Early screening and proper treatment of carotid artery tortuosity could be a potential intervention strategy for the prevention of ischemic stroke later on.
