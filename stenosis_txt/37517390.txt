Title: Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain Is Elevated after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with a high incidence of new silent brain infarcts (SBIs) on postprocedural neuroimaging. A venous blood sample reflecting neuronal damage following TAVI could help identify patients with potential SBIs. We aimed to investigate if a biochemical marker of neuronal injury, neurofilament light chain (NFL), is elevated after TAVI.
METHODS: In this observational study, NFL was measured in plasma from 31 patients before and after TAVI. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to investigate any effect of clinical- and procedure-related factors on differences in NFL levels before and after TAVI.
RESULTS: Samples were collected 41 (14-81) days before and 44 (35-59) days after TAVI, median (interquartile range). Median age was 81 (77-84) years, and 35% were female. No patient had any overt procedure-related neurological complications. The geometric mean (95% confidence interval) of the NFL concentration was 30 (25-36) pg/mL before TAVI and 48 (39-61) pg/mL, after TAVI, p &lt;0.001. None of the included variables in the multiple linear regression model were statistically significantly associated with the difference in levels before and after TAVI.
CONCLUSIONS: NFL levels in plasma were higher after TAVI as compared with levels before, with a mean increase of 60% (18 pg/mL). Further studies including neuroimaging and cognitive outcomes are needed to understand the potential value of measuring NFL in relation to TAVI.
