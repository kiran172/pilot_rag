Title: Patient-specific hemodynamic feature of central venous disease intervened by stent: A numerical study.

Abstract: Central venous disease (CVD) with stenosis or occlusion is a severe and prevalent complication for chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients, resulting in dialysis access dysfunction. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent placement (PTS) has become one of the first-line treatments for CVD. In clinical practice, the extra stents would be used if the curative efficacy of a single stent were unsatisfactory. Aiming to evaluate the therapeutic effect of different PTS schemes, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations on four patients were performed to compare the hemodynamic characteristics of real-life HD patients after stent placement. The three-dimensional central vein's models of each patient were built using computational tomography angiography (CTA) images, and idealized models were constructed as contrast. Two inlet velocity modes were imposed to imitate the blood flow rate of healthy and HD patients. The hemodynamic parameters for different patients were investigated, including wall shear stress (WSS), velocity, and helicity. The results showed that the implantation of double stents is able to improve flexibility. When subjected to external force, the double stents have better radial stiffness. This paper evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of stent placement and provided a theoretical basis for CVD intervention in hemodialysis patients.
