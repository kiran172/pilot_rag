Title: Evaluating transurethral resection of the prostate over twenty years: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The goal of this systematic review is to assess the temporal changes in outcomes and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) from 2000 to 2022.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 103 randomized clinical trials from PubMed on TURP, involving 8521 patients. Studies were grouped by years: 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, and 2015-2022. We assessed International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Peak Flow (Qmax), Post-void residue of urine (PVR), and post-operative complications. Heterogeneity was ranked as low (I2 &lt; 25%), moderate (I2 = 25-75%), or high (I2 &gt; 75%).
RESULTS: TURP significantly improved IPSS, Qmax, and PVR, with the most recent studies showing superior results in IPSS and Qmax after 3 years compared to 2000-2004 studies. Heterogeneity in PVR was high (I2 = 100%). No negative impact on erectile function was observed. Complication rates included TURP syndrome (2%), bleeding (8%), and blood transfusion (6%), but elevated heterogeneity with difference between the groups was seen in clot evacuation (I2 = 83%) and urinary tract infections (I2 = 82%). Other complications were urinary retention (4%), incontinence (8%), urethral stricture (3%), bladder neck stenosis (2%).
CONCLUSION: In the last 20 years there has not been a clear trend in the results of TURP. The found heterogeneity may indicate a lack of standardization in TURP procedures. However, symptomatic improvement among patients is uniform, which supports this procedure as a historical benchmark surgical treatment for BPH.
