Title: Decade-long mitral valve surgery trends and rheumatic heart disease: a review of mitral valve surgery in a large Chinese cardiovascular center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite being one of the few chronic secondary heart diseases that can be prevented, current epidemiological data on rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in China are unavailable. This study examined mitral valve (MV) surgery trends in a large Chinese cardiovascular center over the last 10 years and provided insight into the distribution of RHDs and their changes.
METHODS: Medical records of patients who underwent cardiac surgery, MV surgery, and MV surgery for rheumatic MV (rMV) disease at Beijing Anzhen Hospital between January 2010 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were statistically analyzed among age groups.
RESULTS: Overall, 7,736 patients underwent rMV surgery and 87.5% were aged 40-70 years. The proportion of patients aged >60 years increased annually (P<0.05), and the proportion of patients in all other age groups decreased. The proportion of patients with rMV diseases among those with cardiac or mitral valve diseases decreased each year, but the absolute number of patients with rMV disease remained stable. Approximately 90% of patients who underwent rMV surgery were from northern China. The incidence of rMV disease among patients with mitral valve disease moderately correlated with the per capita gross regional product (Per-GRP), an indicator of living standards (r=-0.517, P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: RHD still exists in northern China and requires adequate resources for its management. The number of older patients with rMV disease presents a challenge for mitral valve surgery.
