Title: Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score for the prediction of mortality in valvular heart disease.

Abstract: AIMS: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is one of the leading causes of heart failure. Clinically significant VHD can induce different patterns of cardiac remodelling, and risk stratification is challenging in patients with various degrees of cardiac dysfunction. The study aimed to investigate the prognostic implications of Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) score in patients with VHD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study used data from the China Valvular Heart Disease (China-VHD) registry, which was a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study for patients with significant (at least moderate) VHD. In total, 10 446 patients with moderate or greater VHD from the China-VHD study were included in the present analysis. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality within 2 years. Among 10 446 patients with VHD, the mean age was 61.98 ± 13.47 years, and 5819 (55.7%) were male. During 2 years of follow-up, 895 (8.6%) patients died. The MAGGIC score was monotonically and independently associated with mortality in both total cohort [adjusted hazard ratio: 1.095, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.084-1.107, P &lt; 0.001] and most types of VHD (aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, mixed aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation, and multiple VHD). The score was also an independent prognostic factor in patients with or without symptoms or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and exhibited both satisfactory discrimination and calibration properties in predicting mortality. The prognostic value of MAGGIC score was robust in most quartiles of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level, with no significant interaction observed (P<sub>interaction</sub>  = 0.498). Compared with the EuroSCORE II, the MAGGIC score achieved significantly better predictive performance in overall population [C index: 0.769 vs. 0.727; net reclassification improvement index (95% CI): 0.354 (0.313-0.396), P &lt; 0.001; integrated discrimination improvement index (95% CI): 0.069 (0.052-0.085), P &lt; 0.001] and in subgroups of patients divided by therapeutic strategy, LVEF, symptomatic status, stage of VHD, and aetiology of VHD.
CONCLUSIONS: The MAGGIC score is a reliable prognostic factor across the range of cardiac dysfunction in VHD and may assist in risk stratification and guide clinical decision-making.
