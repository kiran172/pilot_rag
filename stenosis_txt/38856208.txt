Title: Rodent Inferior Vena Cava Venoplasty Balloon Model.

Abstract: Balloon venoplasty is a commonly used clinical technique to treat deep vein stenosis and occlusion as a consequence of trauma, congenital anatomic abnormalities, acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or stenting. Chronic deep venous obstruction is histopathologically characterized by thrombosis, fibrosis, or both. Currently, no direct treatment is available to target these pathological processes. Therefore, a reliable in vivo animal model to test novel interventions is necessary. The rodent survival inferior vena cava (IVC) venoplasty balloon model (VBM) allows the study of balloon venoplasty in non-thrombotic and post-thrombotic conditions across multiple time points. The local and systemic effect of coated and uncoated venoplasty balloons can be quantified via tissue, thrombus, and blood assays such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), zymography, vein wall and thrombus cellular analysis, whole blood and plasma assays, and histological analysis. The VBM is reproducible, replicates surgical human interventions, can identify local vein wall-thrombi protein changes, and allows multiple analyses from the same sample, decreasing the number of animals required per group.
