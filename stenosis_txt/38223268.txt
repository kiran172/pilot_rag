Title: Transaortic TAVR and Mitral Repair Under Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest in a Porcelain Aorta Patient.

Abstract: Vascular and valvular calcifications, commonly seen in renal patients, increase operative mortality and can preclude conventional valvular management. We show a novel approach to treat aortic stenosis and degenerative mitral regurgitation under hypothermic circulatory arrest in a hemodialysis patient with aortic, mitral disease and porcelain aorta with surgical and transcatheter contraindications.
