Title: Dysplasias in the Child's Spine.

Abstract: Many of the skeletal dysplasias impact the spinal column causing scoliosis, kyphosis, stenosis, and/or instability at various segments of the spine. Understanding how a particular dysplasia is likely to manifest is important to ensure proper screening and treatment decisions. Equally important is understanding the natural history of specific spine abnormalities, such as awareness of the resolution of the cervical kyphosis common to infants with diastrophic dysplasia. Many patients with rarer dysplasias are best cared for by teams of providers including neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, geneticists, pulmonologist, and anesthesiologists who are familiar with the various issues surrounding each particular dysplasia.
