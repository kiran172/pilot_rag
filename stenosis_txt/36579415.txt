Title: Diagnostic performance of angiography-derived fractional flow reserve in patients with NSTEMI.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Noninvasive methods of estimating invasively measured fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>invasive</sub>) are actively being explored, aiming to avoid the use of an invasive pressure wire and the administration of hyperemia-inducing drugs. Coronary angiography-derived FFR (FFR<sub>angio</sub>) has already demonstrated its diagnostic performance in the context of stable coronary artery disease. However, its applicability in the context of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) has yet to be established. We sought to determine the diagnostic performance of FFR<sub>angio</sub> exclusively in patients presenting with NSTEMI. We performed a prospective, single-center, single-arm, double-blinded study comparing FFR calculated by FFR<sub>angio</sub> to FFR<sub>invasive</sub> in NSTEMI patients. FFR<sub>invasive</sub> was measured in all angiographically intermediate lesions (30%-70% stenosis) and was then compared to FFR<sub>angio</sub> which was calculated at the same position, by a blinded operator. The primary endpoints were the sensitivity and specificity of FFR<sub>angio</sub> for predicting FFR<sub>invasive</sub> using a cut-off value of ≤0.80. Among 100 NSTEMI patients who were screened, 46 patients with 60 vessels in total underwent FFR<sub>invasive</sub> and were included in the study. The mean value of FFR<sub>invasive</sub> was 0.83 ± 0.3 with 22 (36%) being ≤0.80 while the mean FFR<sub>angio</sub> was 0.82 ± 0.1 with 22 (36%) being ≤0.80. FFR<sub>angio</sub> exhibited a sensitivity of 95.5%, a specificity of 97.4%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 96.7%. FFR<sub>angio</sub> can precisely and noninvasively estimate FFR<sub>invasive</sub> in acute coronary syndromes and may have a role in guiding treatment decisions related to angiographically intermediate coronary lesions in this context.
WHAT IS KNOWN: FFR<sub>angio</sub> has demonstrated its diagnostic performance in validation studies, as a noninvasive and cost-effective method in the context of stable coronary artery disease but its performance has never been exclusively evaluated in NSTEMI patients.
WHAT IS NEW: The present prospective single-center study demonstrates the excellent diagnostic performance of FFR<sub>angio</sub> in detecting functionally significant coronary artery stenosis in the setting of NSTEMI, providing more confidence in utilizing FFR<sub>angio</sub> in this population, avoiding the risk of an invasive pressure wire and the administration of hyperemia-inducing drugs.
WHAT IS NEXT: Future randomized trials evaluating FFR<sub>angio</sub>-guided treatment of coronary artery disease (stable or ACS) are now needed to definitively establish the role of FFR<sub>angio</sub> in the physiological assessment of coronary lesions.
