Title: Type I Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) Followed by Type II in a Young Patient With Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) Presented With Hypertensive Emergency: A Case Report.

Abstract: This article presents a case report highlighting the association between fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and acute myocardial infarction in a 25-year-old female patient with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities. Initially presenting with a hypertensive emergency, the patient subsequently developed acute coronary syndrome. MRI revealed irregular narrowing of the bilateral renal arteries, consistent with a diagnosis of FMD. Further evaluation through cardiac catheterization confirmed 95% stenosis of the mid-circumflex artery, necessitating percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Fibromuscular dysplasia has been frequently reported in conjunction with coronary artery dissection leading to acute coronary syndrome, especially in young females. Here, we describe the case of FMD without any coronary artery dissection. The presence of FMD highlights the need for comprehensive evaluation and management in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The recognition of FMD as an underlying pathology in acute myocardial infarction is crucial for appropriate intervention strategies. In this particular case, PCI was successfully performed to address the significant stenosis of the mid-circumflex artery. These findings emphasize the importance of considering FMD as a potential contributing factor in young patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome, particularly in the context of renal artery involvement. Increased awareness among healthcare providers regarding the association between FMD and acute myocardial infarction can aid in prompt diagnosis, appropriate management, and improved patient outcomes.
