Title: Suprasternal Approach to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a Complex Congenital Pediatric Patient Presenting With Cardiogenic Shock.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers well established benefit for adults with severe aortic stenosis, although applications in the pediatric population remain limited. We describe a case of a 15-year-old male with complex congenital heart disease presenting with cardiogenic shock in the setting of mixed severe aortic stenosis (AS) and severe aortic insufficiency (AI). Self-expanding TAVR was performed via suprasternal approach with robust clinical improvement. At one month follow up, he had resolution of clinical heart failure with improvement in ejection fraction and no symptoms of valvulopathy. To our knowledge, there have been no described cases of suprasternal TAVR in a pediatric patient.
