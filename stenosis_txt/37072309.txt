Title: [Prevention and treatment of postoperative complications of esophageal cancer].

Abstract: Surgery is the primary treatment for esophageal cancer, but the postoperative complication rate remains high. Therefore, it is important to prevent and manage postoperative complications to improve prognosis. Common perioperative complications of esophageal cancer include anastomotic leakage, gastrointestinal tracheal fistula, chylothorax, and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Respiratory and circulatory system complications, such as pulmonary infection, are also quite common. These surgery-related complications are independent risk factors for cardiopulmonary complications. Complications, such as long-term anastomotic stenosis, gastroesophageal reflux, and malnutrition are also common after esophageal cancer surgery. By effectively reducing postoperative complications, the morbidity and mortality of patients can be reduced, and their quality of life can be improved.
