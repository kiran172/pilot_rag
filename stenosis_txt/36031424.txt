Title: Early outcomes of the Y-incision technique to enlarge the aortic annulus 3 to 4 valve sizes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel aortic annular enlargement technique.
METHODS: From August 2020 to February 2022, 50 consecutive cases of aortic valve replacement with Y-incision aortic annular enlargement and other combined cardiac procedures were performed primarily for severe aortic stenosis. Data were obtained through medical record review, The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database, and National Death Index data.
RESULTS: The median age was 65 (59, 71) years, 70% of patients were female, and 26% had previous cardiac surgery. Sixty-six percent patients had isolated aortic valve replacement. The preoperative mean gradient was 40 (30, 47) mm Hg, and the native aortic annular size was 21 (19, 23) mm. After aortic annular enlargement, the median prosthesis size was 27 (27, 29) with 54% of patients having a size 29 or the largest sized valve. The median increment of annulus enlargement was 3 (3, 4) valve sizes. 88% of patients received no blood transfusion. There were no major postoperative complications, including operative mortality, renal failure requiring permanent dialysis, mediastinitis, or reoperation for bleeding, except for 1 stroke. Three-month postoperative computed tomography aortogram showed the aortic root was enlarged from 27 (24, 30) to 40 (36, 41) mm without aortic pseudoaneurysm. The postoperative mean gradient was 7 (5, 8) mm Hg and valve area was 1.9 (1.7, 2.3) cm2 at 3 to 12 months. Mitral and tricuspid valve functions were significantly improved. Survival was 100% at 18 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Y-incision aortic annular enlargement was safe and effective for upsizing the aortic annulus by 3 to 4 valve sizes.
