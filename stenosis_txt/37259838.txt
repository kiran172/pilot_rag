Title: Left atrial strain rate: marker of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis?

Abstract: Aim: To assess the diagnostic value of left atrial deformation parameters during dobutamine stress echocardiography to predict significant coronary artery stenosis in patients with moderate pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials &amp; methods: Rest and stress echocardiography were performed on 61 patients with a moderate and high probability of CAD. Based on presence of CAD patients were divided into pathological and nonpathological groups. Results: Early diastolic strain rate (LAe SR) was significantly lower among the pathological group at high dobutamine doses. LAe SR was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curve and threshold prognostic value was set of -2.05 (sensitivity 78%, specificity 50%, area under the curve 0.638; p = 0.026). Conclusion: Measuring LAe SR has predictive value and might be a helpful parameter in assessing ischemia.
