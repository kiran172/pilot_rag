Title: Cardiorenal dysfunction and hypertrophy induced by renal artery occlusion are normalized by galangin treatment in rats.

Abstract: Galangin is a polyphenolic compound found in Alpinia officinarum and propolis. This study investigated the effect of galangin on blood pressure, the renin angiotensin system (RAS), cardiac and kidney alterations and oxidative stress in two-kidney one-clipped (2K-1C) hypertensive rats. Hypertension was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats (180-220 g), and the rats were given galangin (30 and 60 mg/kg) and losartan (10 mg/kg) for 4 weeks (n = 8/group). Galangin decreased hypertension and cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy, which was related to the reducing circulation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity and angiotensin II concentration (p &lt; 0.05). These effects were consistent with the reduced overexpression of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>R), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and collagen type I (Col I) protein in cardiac tissue (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, renal artery occlusion, procedure-induced kidney dysfunction and fibrosis were attenuated in the galangin-treated group. Galangin treatment normalized the overexpression of AT<sub>1</sub>R and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox-4) protein and normalized the downregulation of nuclear factor-erythroid Factor 2-related Factor 2 (Nrf-2) and haem oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in 2K-1C rats (p &lt; 0.05). Galangin exhibited antioxidative effects, as it reduced systemic and tissue oxidative stress markers and increased catalase activity in 2K-1C rats (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, galangin attenuated hypertension, renin-angiotensin system activation, cardiorenal damage and oxidative stress induced by renal artery stenosis in rats. These effects might be associated with modulation of the expression of AT<sub>1</sub>R, TGF-β1 and Col I protein in the heart as well as AT<sub>1</sub>R/Nox-4 and Nrf-2/HO-1 protein in renal tissue in hypertensive rats.
