Title: Neuroimaging investigation of the intracranial vasculature is warranted in older adults with lacunes of presumed vascular origin.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lacunes of presumed vascular origin are perceived as biomarkers of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), although they may also be related to other pathogenetic mechanisms. We aimed to assess whether lacunes are more often associated with intracranial artery stenosis (IAS) than with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin (a biomarker of cSVD) in older adults.
METHODS: This study included 585 individuals aged â‰¥60 years living in rural Ecuador. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the strength of the association between IAS or moderate-to-severe WHM on one side, and lacunes on the other. Mediation analysis was used to estimate the percentage of the effect of IAS on lacunes that was mediated by WMH.
RESULTS: Lacunes were noticed in 62 (11%) individuals, IAS in 39 (7%), and moderate-to-severe WMH in 169 (29%). Fourteen of 39 individuals (36%) with IAS had lacunes, which corresponded to the territory of the stenotic artery in 50% of cases. Lacunes have a larger association with IAS than with moderate-to-severe WMH. The estimated prevalence rate of lacunes independently of any confounder was 10.6% (95% C.I.: 8.3-12.9%), which increased to 22.2% in subjects with IAS, but only to 16.4% among those with moderate-to-severe WMH. Only 24.5% of the effect of IAS on lacunes was mediated by WMH.
CONCLUSION: Lacunes are more often associated with IAS than with WMH at the population level. Neuroimaging investigation of the intracranial vasculature in individuals with lacunes will provide informed-based decisions for secondary stroke prevention.
