Title: Causal Relationship of the Transverse Left Ventricular Band and Bicuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital lesion found in adults. It can be seen in combination with a transverse left ventricular (LV) band. This study aimed to find an essential relationship between the presence of transverse ventricular band and BAV.
METHODS: A total of 13 patients from a tertiary care centre in India with transverse LV band were investigated during a six-month period from January 2019 to July 2019. LV band thickness and gradients at the site of the LV band were evaluated as part of its effect on LV haemodynamics. The morphology of the aortic valve and LV outflow tract gradients was assessed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 41 years. A majority had a BAV (n = 11). Average thickness of the LV band was 6.2 mm and the average mean aortic gradient was 4 mmHg. Sequestration of blood was noted at the level of the transverse band in all the patients with two separate jets at the left ventricular outflow tract. The anterolateral jet was deflected from the transverse band and showed higher velocity compared to the other jet, causing turbulence at the BAV. No correlation was found between the thickness of the transverse band and aortic valve gradient.
CONCLUSION: Presence of a robust transverse LV band can serve as a surrogate marker for BAV.
