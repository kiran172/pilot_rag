Title: Association of ACEI/ARB and statin prescribing patterns with mortality after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR): Findings from real-world claims data.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard of care for most patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), but the impact of medical therapy prescribing patterns on post-TAVR patients has not been thoroughly investigated.
METHODS: We analyzed Optum claims data from 9,012 adults who received TAVR for AS (January 2014-December 2018). Pharmacy claims data were used to identify patients who filled ACEI/ARB and/or statin prescriptions during the study's 90-day landmark period post-TAVR. Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards models were used to evaluate the association of prescribing patterns with mortality during the 3-year follow-up period. Subgroup analyses were performed to examine the impact of 11 potential confounders on the observed associations.
RESULTS: A significantly lower adjusted 3-year mortality was observed for patients with post-TAVR prescription for ACEI/ARBs (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.91, P = .0003) and statins (HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94, P = .0018) compared to patients who did not fill prescriptions for these medications post-TAVR. Subgroup analyses revealed that the survival benefit associated with ACEI/ARB prescription was not affected by any of the potential confounding variables, except preoperative ACEI/ARB prescription was associated with significantly lower risk of mortality vs postoperative prescription only. No other subgroup variables had significant interactions associated with survival benefits, including preoperative use of statins.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale, real-world analysis of patients undergoing TAVR, the prescription of ACEI/ARB and statins was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality at 3-years, especially in those where the medications were initiated preoperatively.
