Title: Case report: Neonatal pancreatitis, chromosomal abnormality and duodenal stenosis in a newborn. A new syndrome?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Pancreatitis is a dire clinical diagnosis with variable presentation in the paediatric population. Moreover, neonatal pancreatitis has been rarely reported in the English literature.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A newborn, product of a poorly supervised, pre-term gestation with pre-natally diagnosed intestinal obstruction, and post-natal clinical features of jaundice, vomiting, abdominal distension, aphonation and suspected chromosomal abnormalities. There was maternal hepatitis which was untreated. Diagnosed as duodenal atresia, the baby was investigated, resuscitated and had surgery. Intra-operative findings were of an omental bubble, duodenal stenosis with annular pancreas, coagulative necrosis of the pancreas and multiple intra peritoneal cheesy deposits. Following an unfortunate demise, autopsy confirmed pancreatitis and multiple congenital abnormalities.
DISCUSSION: Paediatric caregivers should be aware of the possibility of neonatal pancreatitis in jaundiced newborns with intestinal obstruction especially with a background of maternal viraemia.
CONCLUSION: A constellation of unusual presentations as highlighted could be a pointer to an emerging syndrome. All paediatric caregivers should entertain a high index of suspicion of pancreatitis in such a case, investigate and expedite appropriate interventions to prevent mortality.
