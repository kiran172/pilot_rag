Title: Management of recurrent acquired choanal atresia with radial forearm free flap transfer.

Abstract: Acquired choanal atresia is a rare complication of pharyngeal surgical interventions. Here, we report the case of a 72-year-old woman who was treated in our institution for acquired choanal atresia after failed previous treatments. We have excised the obstructing fibrotic scar tissue and then reconstructed the area using a mucosal local flap and free radial forearm flap transfer. Choanal stenosis caused by abnormal granulation was identified in the months after surgery; however, this was treated with endoscopic dilatation and steroid injections in the outpatient setting. No restenosis was identified 1Â year after the operation. Postoperative evaluation of speech was satisfactory. Free flap transfer could be an option for refractory choanal atresia, and endoscopic dilatation with local steroid injections may be an effective method to treat postoperative restenosis.
