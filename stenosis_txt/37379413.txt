Title: [The role of endosonography in the treatment of chemical ulcerative-necrotic burns of the esophagus].

Abstract: The authors present ultrasonography-assisted endoscopic diagnosis of chemical burn of the esophagus. This method early predicted decompensated cicatricial stenosis of the esophagus that was valuable to determine treatment strategy. Preventive mini-invasive endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy provided adequate enteral nutrition in a patient with decompensated esophageal stenosis before reconstructive surgery.
