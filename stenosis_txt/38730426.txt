Title: Prognostic value of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over coronary computed tomography angiography findings: comparison with no-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the proposed name change for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study aimed to investigate the association of cardiovascular disease risk with MASLD and NAFLD in patients who underwent clinically indicated coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 2289 patients (60% men; mean age: 68 years) with no history of coronary artery disease who underwent CCTA. The steatotic liver was defined as a hepatic-to-spleen attenuation ratio of < 1.0 on CT just before CCTA. MASLD is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis along with at least one of the five cardiometabolic risk factors. Adverse CCTA findings were defined as obstructive and/or high-risk plaques. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) encompassed composite coronary events, including cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, and late coronary revascularization.
RESULTS: MASLD and NAFLD were identified in 415 (18%) and 368 (16%) patients, respectively. Adverse CCTA findings were observed in 40% and 38% of the patients with MASLD and with NAFLD, respectively. Adverse CCTA findings were significantly associated with MASLD (p = 0.007) but not NAFLD (p = 0.253). During a median follow-up of 4.4 years, 102 (4.4%) MACE were observed. MASLD was significantly associated with MACE (hazard ratio 1.82, 95% CI 1.18-2.83, p = 0.007), while its association with NAFLD was not significant (p = 0.070). By incorporating MASLD into a prediction model of MACE, including the risk score and adverse CCTA findings, global chi-squared values significantly increased from 87.0 to 94.1 (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MASLD are likely to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than those with NAFLD. Concurrent assessment of MASLD during CCTA improves the identification of patients at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease among those with clinically indicated CCTA.
