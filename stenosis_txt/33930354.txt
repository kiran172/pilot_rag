Title: Matched Analysis of Surgical Versus Percutaneous Revascularization for Left Main Coronary Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is being performed more frequently for left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD). This study evaluated a real-world propensity-matched analysis of surgical vs percutaneous revascularization for LMCAD.
METHODS: Adults (≥18 years of age) at a single academic institution undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or PCI for left main stenosis greater than or equal to 50% between 2010 and 2018 were examined. Greedy propensity-matching techniques were used to generate well-matched cohorts, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to compare survival. Multivariable Cox models were created for 5-year mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE).
RESULTS: A total of 1091 patients with LMCAD were identified (898 CABG, 193 PCI). Patients undergoing PCI were significantly older (77 years of age vs 68 years of age; P < .001), more likely to have heart failure (26.94% vs 13.14%; P < .001), and less likely to have 3-vessel disease (42.49% vs 65.59%; P < .001). Propensity matching yielded 215 CABG and 134 PCI well-matched patients. In the matched analysis, 1-year (77.61% vs 88.37%) and 5-year (48.77% vs 75.62%) survival were lower with PCI. Rates of MACCE at 5 years were also higher with PCI (64.93% vs 32.56%; P < .001). Rates of both myocardial infarction (19.40% vs 7.44%; P = .001) and repeat revascularization (26.12% vs 7.91%; P < .001) were higher with PCI. After risk adjustment, CABG remained associated with reduced risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.54; P < .001) and MACCE (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.48; P < .001) at 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: This real-world, propensity-matched analysis demonstrates substantial advantages in survival and MACCE with CABG for LMCAD, supporting surgical revascularization in this clinical setting in appropriate operative candidates.
