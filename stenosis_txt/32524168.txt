Title: Differentiating epidural fibrosis from disc herniation on contrast-enhanced and unenhanced MRI in the postoperative lumbar spine.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine diagnostic confidence and inter-observer/intra-observer agreement in differentiating epidural fibrosis from disc herniation and lumbar spinal stenosis parameters on magnetic resonance images (MRI) in postoperative lumbar spines with (Gad-MRI) and without (unenhanced MRI) intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: N = 124 lumbar spine MRI examinations of four groups were included: 1-6 months, 7-18 months, 19-36 months, more than 37 months between lumbar spine surgery and imaging. Two radiologists evaluated Gad-MRI and unenhanced MRI: diagnostic confidence was determined as confident or unconfident. Inter-observer and intra-observer agreement were assessed in differentiating epidural fibrosis from disc herniation and for lumbar spinal stenosis parameters on MRI. Fisher's exact test and Cohen's kappa served for statistics.
RESULTS: Diagnostic confidence in differentiating epidural fibrosis from disc herniation was significantly higher on Gad-MR images compared with unenhanced MRI at 1-18 months for observer 1 and at 1-6 months postoperatively for observer 2 (p values: 0.01-0.025). Inter-observer agreement at 1-6 months postoperatively for identification of epidural fibrosis was higher on Gad-MRI (kappa values: 0.53 versus 0.24). Inter-observer and intra-observer agreement for identification of disc herniation and for assessment of lumbar spinal stenosis parameters revealed inconsistent data, without a trend for higher inter-observer or intra-observer agreement on Gad-MRI compared with unenhanced MRI (kappa values: 0.17-0.75).
CONCLUSION: Gad-MR images compared with unenhanced MRI improved diagnostic confidence and agreement in differentiating epidural fibrosis from disc herniation for both observers in the first 6 months and for one observer in the first 18 months after lumbar spine surgery. After 18 months, Gad-MR images compared with unenhanced MRI did neither improve confidence nor agreement.
