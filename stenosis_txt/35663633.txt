Title: 6-Month Evaluation of a Transcatheter Aortic Valve (Myval) in a Novel Ovine, Supra-Aortic Banding Model.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to evaluate a balloon expandable transcatheter heart valve (THV) system (Myval) at 6-month follow-up in ovine banding model. Eleven THV systems were implanted via carotid approach. There were 2 procedure-related deaths and 2 premature deaths. At 6 months all valves that completed follow-up (n = 7) were functional, with no significant regurgitation, calcification, thrombi, or vegetation. Mean pressure gradient was 21.9 ± 11 mm Hg, maximum velocity = 3.3 ± 1 m/s, and ejection fraction was 53.3 ± 6%. Myval THV showed optimal hemodynamic performance and biocompatibility.
