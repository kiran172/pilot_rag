Title: Head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic performances of Rubidium-PET and SPECT with CZT camera for the detection of myocardial ischemia in a population of women and overweight individuals.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances for the detection of myocardial ischemia of 82-Rb-PET-MPS and 99m-Tc-SPECT-MPS in overweight individuals and women.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Men with BMI ≥ 25 and women referred for MPS were considered for inclusion. All individuals underwent 99m-Tc-SPECT-MPS with CZT cameras and 82-Rb-PET-MPS in 3D-mode. Individuals with at least one positive MPS were referred for coronary angiography (CA) with FFR measurements. A criterion for positivity was a composite endpoint including significant stenosis on CA or, in the absence of CA, the occurrence of acute coronary event during the following year. 313 patients (46% women) with mean BMI of 31.8 ± 6.5 were included. Sensitivity for the detection of myocardial ischemia was higher with 82-Rb-PET-MPS compared with 99m-Tc-SPECT-MPS (85% vs. 57%, P < .05); specificity was equally high with both imaging techniques (93% vs. 94%, P > .05). 82-Rb-PET allowed for a more accurate detection of patients with a high-risk coronary artery disease (HR-CAD) than 99m-Tc-SPECT-MPS (AUC = 0.86 vs. 0.75, respectively; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: In women and overweight individuals, 82-Rb-PET-MPS provides higher sensitivity for the detection of myocardial ischemia than 99m-Tc-SPECT-MPS thanks to a better image quality and an improved detection of HR-CAD.
