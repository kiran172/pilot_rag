Title: Human urinary kininogenase reduces the endothelial injury by inhibiting Pyk2/MCU pathway.

Abstract: The injury of endothelial cells is one of the initiating factors in restenosis after endovascular treatment. Human urinary kallidinogenase (HUK) is a tissue kallikrein which is used for ischemia-reperfusion injury treatment. Studies have shown that HUK may be a potential therapeutic agent to prevent stenosis after vascular injury, however, the precise mechanisms have not been fully established. This study is to investigate whether HUK can protect endothelial cells after balloon injury or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced endothelial cell damage through the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2)/mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) pathway. Intimal hyperplasia, a decrease of pinocytotic vesicles and cell apoptosis were found in the common carotid artery balloon injury and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced endothelial cell damage, Pyk2/MCU was also up-regulated in such pathological process. HUK could prevent these injuries partially via the bradykinin B2 receptor by inhibiting Pyk2/MCU pathway, which prevented the mitochondrial damage, maintained calcium balance, and eventually inhibited cell apoptosis. Furthermore, MCU expression was not markedly increased if Pyk2 was suppressed by shRNA technique in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment group, and cell viability was significantly better than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated only. In short, our results indicate that the Pyk2/MCU pathway is involved in endothelial injury induced by balloon injury or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced endothelial cell damage. HUK plays an protective role by inhibiting the Pyk2/MCU pathway in the endothelial injury.
