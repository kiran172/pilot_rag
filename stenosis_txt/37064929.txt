Title: Rash, Facial Droop, and Multifocal Intracranial Stenosis Due to Varicella Zoster Virus Vasculitis.

Abstract: Background: This is a case of multifocal intracranial stenosis in a 74Â year old male ultimately discovered to be due to Varicella Zoster Virus infection. Purpose: We highlight the importance of a broad differential diagnosis, even when the most likely etiology of intracranial stenosis is atherosclerosis. Our paper reviews the differential diagnosis as well as "red flags" for intracranial vasculopathy. Even though intracranial atherosclerotic disease is the most common cause of vasculopathy, infectious or inflammatory vasculitis should be considered on the differential. Conclusions: Before considering bypass surgery or other invasive neurosurgical procedures, ensure reversible causes of vasculopathy have been ruled out. The presence of cranial neuropathies, rash, and/or elevated inflammatory markers should be red flags for vasculitis in patients presenting with stroke.
