Title: Monocyte to high-density lipoprotein ratio as an independent predictor of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis-related emergency large vessel occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation between the monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis-related emergent large vessel occlusion (ICAS-ELVO) in acute ischemic stroke patients with endovascular thrombectomy.
METHODS: Included in this study were 215 patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy. They were randomly assigned to training and testing datasets. The patients in training dataset (n=128) were divided into ICAS group (n=65) and embolism group (n=63). MHR was compared between the two groups. According to the cut-off value, patients in testing dataset (n=87) were divided into low-MHR group (n=54) and high-MHR group (n=33). MHR was compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: In training dataset, the proportion of male patients, diabetic patients and smokers in ICAS group was significantly higher than that in embolism group [(50 (76.9%) vs. 30 (47.6%), P=0.001; 29 (44.6%) vs. 14(22.2%), P=0.007; 37(56.9%) vs. 14 (22.2%), P=0.001; 37 (56.9%) vs. 14 (22.2%), P=0.001], while the mean age and the proportion of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and atrial fibrillation were significantly lower [(64.74±9.13 vs. 71.38±13.34, P=0.001; 6 (9.2%) vs. 14 (22.2%), P=0.043; 12 (18.5%) vs. 22 (34.9%), P=0.035; 5 (7.7%)vs. 56 (88.9%), P<0.001)]. The laboratory test results showed that monocyte count was significantly higher and high-density lipoprotein level was significantly lower in ICAS group than those in embolism group (0.61±0.26 vs. 0.45±0.13, P=0.001; 1.17±0.28 vs. 1.37±0.27, P=0.001). MHR in ICAS group was significantly higher than that in embolism group (0.55±0.26 vs. 0.34±0.11, P=0.001). In training set, MHR was found to be an independent predictor for the occurrence of ICAS-ELVO with an adjusted OR of 2.39 (95%CI 1.29-4.48, P=0.006). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of MHR was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.72-0.87, p < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 0.60 and a specificity of 0.873. The optimal cut-off value of the MHR level was 0.46. In testing dataset, the rate of ICAS-ELVO in higher quartile was significantly higher than that in the lower quartile (81.8% vs. 33.3%, P<0.001). Patients with a low MHR had a higher rate of cerebral hemorrhagic than those with a high MHR.
CONCLUSION: MHR was associated with ICAS-ELVO in acute ischemic stroke patients with endovascular thrombectomy, and the higher level of MHR does benefit to differentiate ICAS from intracranial embolism, suggesting that MHR may prove to be an independent predictor for ICAS-ELVO.
