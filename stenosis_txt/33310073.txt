Title: Antiplatelet Therapy During Emergent Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery Stenting: Comparison of Three Intravenous Antiplatelet Perioperative Strategies.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Guidelines for antiplatelet therapy administration, during emergent stenting for extra-cranial internal carotid artery (EC-ICA) occlusion in the setting of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are lacking. Different antiplatelet regimen are used in association to endovascular therapy (EVT) for the treatment of EC-ICA lesions. We aimed to compare the clinical and radiological effects of three intravenous antiplatelet agents used during emergent EC-ICA stenting.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical data were collected from January 2015 to December 2019 in a monocentric prospective registry of AIS patients treated by EVT. All patients who underwent emergent EC-ICA stenting were sorted regarding the intravenous antiplatelet agent used during the procedure.
RESULTS: Among 218 patients treated by EVT for an EC-ICA occlusion of the anterior circulation during the study period, 70 underwent an emergent stenting of the EC-ICA. 60 were included in the present study, 9 received intravenous (IV) Cangrelor, 8 IV abciximab and 43 Aspirin. The rate of favorable neurological outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) â‰¤ 2 at three months were better in the Cangrelor and Aspirin groups (66,7% and 58,1%, respectively) than in the Abciximab group (37,5%), as well as, the rate of any intracranial ICH (22,2% and 37,2% vs 62,5%). The rate of acute stent reocclusion was similar between groups.
CONCLUSION: When used as a rescue treatment during emergent stenting of EC-ICA, Cangrelor and Aspirin present a better safety profile than Abciximab, with less intracranial hemorrhages and a higher rate of good clinical outcome. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.
