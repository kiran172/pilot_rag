Title: Congenitally corrected transposition and mitral atresia complicated by restrictive atrial septum.

Abstract: Congenitally corrected transposition (ccTGA), also known as L-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA), is a rare cardiac malformation accounting for approximately 0.05% of congenital heart disease, characterized by ventricular inversion, discordant ventriculo-arterial connections with a normal visceroatrial relationship. It was first described by Baron Rokitansky in 1875, and prenatal sonographic diagnosis can be difficult. Symptomatology and clinical presentation of this malformation are related to the associated intracardiac defects. We report a rare case of severe, complex cardiac disease: prenatally diagnosed ccTGA with atrial restriction, mitral atresia, Ebsteinoid tricuspid valve, and severe pulmonary valve stenosis, who subsequently developed left pulmonary vein stenosis.
