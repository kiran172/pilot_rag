Title: Perioperative Outcomes of Adjunctive Hypnotherapy Compared with Conscious Sedation Alone for Patients Undergoing Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using a transfemoral approach under local anesthesia with conscious sedation (LACS) is becoming an increasingly common TAVI strategy. However, patients who are awake during the TAVI procedure can experience stress, anxiety, and pain, even when LACS is used. Clinical hypnotherapy is an anxiolytic intervention that can be beneficial for patients undergoing invasive surgery. This study aimed to assess the perioperative outcomes of adjunctive hypnotherapy undergoing transfemoral TAVI with LACS.Consecutive patients (n = 143) with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral TAVI with LACS only (n = 107) or with LACS and hypnotherapy (n = 36) between January 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively included in the study. The clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. The LACS with hypnotherapy group had a significantly shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU; LACS only versus LACS with hypnotherapy: 4.0 (4.0-5.5) days versus 3.0 (3.0-5.0) days, P < 0.01). Moreover, the use of anesthetics (propofol and remifentanil) and norepinephrine was significantly lower in the LACS with hypnotherapy group (e.g., for propofol, LACS only versus LACS with hypnotherapy: 96.4 ± 104.7 mg versus 15.0 ± 31.8 mg, P < 0.001). The multiple regression analysis showed that being male, hypnotherapy, and the composite complication score were independently associated with the length of stay in the ICU.The adjunctive hypnotherapy on LACS among transfemoral TAVI patients may facilitate perioperative management. However, a prospective randomized study is necessary to confirm the efficacy of hypnotherapy among TAVI patients.
