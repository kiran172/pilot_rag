Title: Dislodged Coronary Artery Stent Retrieved With an Endovascular Snare.

Abstract: Advances in stent design and technology have made stent loss during percutaneous coronary intervention rare. When stent loss occurs, the risk of life-threatening procedural complications is high. We describe the use of an endovascular snare system to retrieve a dislodged stent from the proximal right coronary artery of a 54-year-old man during percutaneous coronary intervention after other conventional retrieval techniques had failed.
