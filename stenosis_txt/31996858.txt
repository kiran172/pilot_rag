Title: Left main coronary artery compression by the right pulmonary artery in a patient with congenital pulmonic stenosis.

Abstract: Congenital pulmonary stenosis (PS) can be associated with pulmonary artery (PA) dilatation. In some cases, this can cause compression of nearby structures including the left main coronary artery (LMCA). This compression causes angina and is considered an indication for surgical treatment. We present the case of a patient with PS and angina secondary to LMCA compression by the right PA and review the main indications and options for surgical treatment.
