Title: A Rare Case of Aggressive Metastatic Laryngeal Chondrosarcoma Presenting as Bilateral Necrotizing Pneumonia.

Abstract: Laryngeal chondrosarcomas are rare tumors that account for only 0.2% of malignant tumors of the larynx. Approximately 80% of these tumors are low grade and well differentiated and are associated with a good long-term prognosis. Herein, we report a case of a 77-year-old male presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure that required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest CT showed multiple pulmonary nodules and cavities. He then required a tracheostomy, and a soft tissue mass in the subglottic mass was discovered. A laryngoscopy-guided excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of laryngeal chondrosarcoma. Clinicians should consider metastatic laryngeal chondrosarcoma as a differential diagnosis for lung cavities. Overall, we believe this to be the first case of aggressive laryngeal chondrosarcoma with mediastinal and pulmonary metastasis mimicking necrotizing pneumonia.
