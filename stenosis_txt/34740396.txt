Abstract: Over the past decade, TAVI has become the standard technique for treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis in patients at high or intermediate surgical risk and more recently in low-surgical-risk patients. Like any technique, TAVI is associated with certain complications such as post-TAVI thrombosis. This complication can have clinical manifestations with recurrence of symptoms and/or increase in trans-prosthetic gradients. It can also be infraclinical, i.e asymptomatic without trans-prosthetic gradient elevation as revealed by cardiac CT scan showing a thickening of the valvular leaflets or cusp thrombosis, with potential impairment of the valve opening. This greatly underestimated complication has a 10% to 15% incidence. Biomechanical factors, intrinsic patient-related predisposition as well as post-TAVI anti-thrombotic treatment have all been incriminated in the occurrence of TAVI thrombosis. The use of anticoagulation treatment by AVK or DOAC in the presence of post TAVI prosthetic thrombosis seems obvious. However, their benefit in the treatment of infraclinical thrombosis has not been clearly established.
