Title: Schmorl's nodes are associated with prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fracture and low bone mineral density: a population-based thoracic spine MRI study in older men and women.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Schmorl's node (SN) corresponds to nucleus pulposus herniation into the vertebral spongy bone with thickened trabeculae around the formed node. We hypothesize that a pathway may exist that: osteoporosis → weakened endplate → SN development ↔ endplate fracture of an osteoporotic vertebra.
METHODS: For osteoporotic fractures in men (MrOS) and in women (MsOS) Hong Kong studies, at 14-year follow-up, thoracic spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was sampled in 270 males (mean: 82.9±3.7 years) and 150 females (mean: 81.5±4.3 years). SN and Modic change were assessed as existed or not existed. For posterior disc protrusion, ligamentum flavum ossification, and spinal canal stenosis, semi-quantitative gradings were applied. For each vertebra in women, a score of 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 was assigned for no osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) or OVF of <1/5, ≥1/5-1/4, ≥1/4-1/3, ≥1/3-2/5, ≥2/5-2/3, and ≥2/3 vertebral height loss, respectively, and a summed score was calculated by summing up the scores of vertebrae T1 to T12. For men, those of minimal grade were not considered as OVF and assigned a '0' score.
RESULTS: SN prevalence in women (55.5%) almost doubled that in men (25.9%). SN was statistically significantly correlated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) derived femoral neck T-score, while the other four spine degeneration changes were not statistically significantly correlated with the T-score. SN were statistically significantly correlated with OVF score. Subjects with SN were more likely to have OVF, with odds ratio for men of 4.32 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.70-11.00, P=0.002] and odds ratio for women of 3.28 (95% CI: 1.23-8.74, P=0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: Among older population, many features of SN parallel those of OVF.
