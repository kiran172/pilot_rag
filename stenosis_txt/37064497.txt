Title: Dual Coronary-Pulmonary Artery Fistula in a Patient with Severe Bicuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: A 62-year-old male presented to the emergency department with acute viral bronchitis and worsening of his chronic dyspnea on exertion. Incidentally, a murmur was detected on physical examination. Extensive work-up, including coronary computed tomography angiography, revealed a rare combination and potential association between severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and coronary-pulmonary artery fistulas.
