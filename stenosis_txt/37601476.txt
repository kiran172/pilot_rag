Title: Hemorrhoidal Artery Ligation for the Treatment of Grade II-III Hemorrhoids: Is it Worth the Use of Doppler Guide in Long-Term Follow-Up?: A Single-Center Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) may reduce postoperative pain and complications and shorten patients' recovery when compared to standard hemorrhoidectomy. It is unclear if the Doppler guide (DG) is useful in reducing recurrence risk.
OBJECTIVE: To compare two groups of patients (treated with DG-HAL or HAL) in terms of recurrence risk and patients' satisfaction grade.
METHODS: Between January 1, 2014 and January 31, 2021, 122 patients affected by grade II-III hemorrhoidal prolapse underwent DG-HAL or HAL at Chivasso Hospital, Italy. Mucopexy was routinely performed. After discharge, patients were subjected to 1-week, 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month clinical assessment. Thereafter, they were interviewed by telephone annually.
RESULTS: Seventy-six (62.3%) DG-HAL and 46 (37.7%) HAL procedures were performed. Median surgical time was 30 (15-45) minutes for DG-HAL versus 25 (15-40) minutes for HAL (P = 0.005). No intraoperative complications occurred. Postoperative bleeding needing surgery occurred in 2 (1.6%) patients in the DG-HAL group. During a median follow-up of 46 months (6-86), we registered 18 (23.7%) recurrences in the DG-HAL group and 13 (28.3%) in the HAL one (P = 0.574). No cases of incontinence or anal stenosis occurred. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of patients' satisfaction. At multivariate analysis, age â‰¥ 65 years resulted a protective factor for recurrence (odds ratio 0.31; 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.98; P = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the use of DG did not reduce recurrence risk. Operative time was significantly increased in the DG-HAL group.
