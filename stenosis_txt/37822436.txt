Title: Percutaneous Transhepatic Direct Portosystemic Shunt for a Patient With Budd-Chiari Syndrome Using a Balloon as a Target in a Stenotic Inferior Vena Cava.

Abstract: Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) patients with portal hypertension are often treated with a direct intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (DIPS) or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)Â and angioplasty. DIPS can be problematic, however, due to the technical difficulty of the procedure. To address this problem, we describe a method using the balloon used for inferior vena cava (IVC) dilatation as a puncture target to safely perform DIPS in a BCS patient with complete hepatic vein occlusion and stenosis of the IVC. To perform balloon dilation, the puncture is made through the internal jugular vein, and the guidewire is advanced to the IVC with stenosis. After dilatation of the IVC, the direct left lateral subdistrict branch of the portal vein is percutaneously punctured directly from the cardiac fossa (targeting the inflated balloon in the IVC), and the IVC puncture is done through the portal vein. After creating a pull-through route, a stent is placed between the left portal vein and the IVC. The procedure is completed without any complications. This technique has the potential to form the basis of a safe and reliable DIPS procedure.
