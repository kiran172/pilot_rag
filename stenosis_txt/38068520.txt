Title: Effect of Nefopam on Dysesthesia, Postoperative Pain, and Satisfaction in Patients with Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Undergoing Spine Surgery: A Double-Blind, Randomized Study.

Abstract: Postoperative residual pain and dysesthesia in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) can reduce patient satisfaction. We investigated the effects of nefopam on dysesthesia, postoperative pain, and satisfaction in patients with LSS who underwent spine surgery. A total of 73 patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the nefopam group (n = 35), receiving a 20 mL normal saline-based solution containing nefopam 20 mg, and the control group (n = 38), which received 20 mL of normal saline 1 h before the end of the operation. Postoperative incisional pain, dysesthesia scores, and overall satisfaction with postoperative pain management were evaluated. The severity of dysesthesia within 12 and 24 h in the nefopam group was significantly lower than that in the control group (2.3 ± 1.9 and 1.7 ± 1.6 vs. 3.3 ± 2.1, and 2.6 ± 1.9, respectively; p = 0.029 and p = 0.048). Satisfaction scores for postoperative pain management were significantly higher in the nefopam group (3.7 ± 0.6 vs. 3.1 ± 1.0, respectively; p = 0.006). The administration of nefopam effectively reduced the severity of dysesthesia within 24 h of surgery in geriatric patients undergoing spine surgery and increased patient satisfaction with postoperative pain management.
