Title: Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the United Arab Emirates: Real-world, Single-centre Experience from an Emerging Programme.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data on outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the Middle East, particularly in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), are limited. Whether centres with a low volume of patients requiring the procedure can achieve similar outcomes as those reported in pivotal clinical trials remains unclear. This study evaluates procedural outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR in a newly established programme in the UAE.
METHODS: Procedural outcomes of consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR at a single centre in the UAE between January 2016 and November 2021 were compared with those at centres in the lowest quartile (Q1) of procedural volume in the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry, which covers centres in the US.
RESULTS: Among the 183 patients included in the study, the median age was 76 years (interquartile range [IQR] 71-82), and 42.1% of patients were women, with a median Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality score of 4.6 (IQR 2.9-7.5). Most of the patients (93.3%) received a balloon-expandable valve. All-cause death within 30 days, stroke and major vascular complications occurred in 0.6%, 0.6% and 2.2% of patients, respectively, compared with 3.1%, 2.2% and 4% in patients treated at Q1 hospitals.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR at an emerging centre in the Middle East had favourable outcomes compared with those performed at Q1 hospitals in the US. These findings suggest that careful patient selection for TAVR is critical and may help optimise patient outcomes, especially when procedural volumes are low.
