Title: Pull-through technique for hepatic vein angioplasty after liver transplantation.

Abstract: Hepatic venous outflow complication is one of the crucial vascular complications after liver transplantation. We describe successful use of the pull-through technique for hepatic vein angioplasty in a patient with stenosis of the middle and left hepatic veins (MHV and LHV) after living-donor liver transplantation. It was difficult to select the stenotic MHV with a femoral approach. However, the guidewire was unexpectedly inserted into a small collateral vein and selective angiography showed the MHV through the collaterals. Because the guidewire proceeded to the MHV via the collateral and finally into the inferior vena cava, we advanced a catheter from the inferior vena cava to the MHV using the pull-through technique and performed balloon angioplasty.
