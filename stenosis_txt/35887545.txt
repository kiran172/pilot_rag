Title: Risk Factors Predisposing to Angina in Patients with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries: A Retrospective Analysis.

Abstract: No hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic plaques are observed in up to 30% of patients reporting angina and undergoing coronary angiography. To investigate risk factors associated with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD), we analyzed the medical records of, consecutively, 136 NOCAD subjects and 128 patients with significant stenosis in at least one coronary artery (the OCAD group). The blood concentrations of the TC (4.40 [3.78−5.63] mmol/L vs. 4.12 [3.42−5.01] mmol/L; p = 0.026), LDL-C (2.32 [1.80−3.50] mmol/L vs. 2.10 [1.50−2.70] mmol/L; p = 0.003), non-HDL-C (2.89 [2.29−4.19] mmol/L vs. 2.66 [2.06−3.39] mmol/L; p = 0.045), as well as the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (1.75 [1.22−2.60] vs. 1.50 [1.10−1.95]; p = 0.018) were significantly increased in the NOCAD patients compared to the OCAD group due to the lower prevalence and intensity of the statin therapy in the NOCAD individuals (p < 0.001). Moreover, the abovementioned lipid parameters appeared to be valuable predictors of NOCAD, with the LDL-C (OR = 1.44; 95%CI = 1.14−1.82) and LDL-C/HDL-C (OR = 1.51; 95%CI = 1.13−2.02) showing the highest odds ratios. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression models determined female sex as the independent risk factor for NOCAD (OR = 2.37; 95%CI = 1.33−4.20). Simultaneously, arterial hypertension substantially lowered the probability of NOCAD (OR = 0.21; 95%CI = 0.10−0.43). To conclude, female sex, the absence of arterial hypertension, as well as increased TC, LDL-C, non-HDL, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio are risk factors for NOCAD in patients reporting angina, potentially as a result of poor hypercholesterolemia management.
