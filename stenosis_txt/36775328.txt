Title: An Increase in Plasma MicroRNA-143 Levels in the Acute Phase Is Positively Correlated With Recovery of Cardiac Function in the Chronic Phase in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: MicroRNA (miR)-143 and miR-145 are non-coding RNAs present in smooth muscle cells and the heart. However, their behavior and physiological role in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have not been clarified.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma miR-143 and miR-145 concentrations were measured on Day 0 (on admission) and on Day 7 in AMI patients who could be followed up for 6 months (n=25). The control group consisted of subjects without significant coronary stenosis (n=20). Blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein, and plasma miR-143 and miR-145 concentrations were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In AMI patients (n=25), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by echocardiography in the acute and chronic (6 months) phases. On Day 7, plasma miR-143 and miR-145 concentrations were significantly higher in AMI patients than in the control group and on Day 0 in AMI patients. Plasma miR-143 and miR-145 concentrations increased significantly from Day 0 to Day 7. The increase in plasma miR-143 concentrations (∆miR-143) in the acute phase was positively correlated with the increase in LVEF in the chronic phase. Among many factors, only ∆miR-143 was favorably correlated with left ventricle (LV) functional recovery in the chronic phase.
CONCLUSIONS: An increase in plasma miR-143 concentrations in the acute phase may be a biomarker predicting recovery of LV function in the chronic phase in AMI patients.
