Title: Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source and Carotid Intraplaque Hemorrhage on MRI : A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) has traditionally discounted the significance of internal carotid artery stenosis of <50%; however, recent studies have examined the role of carotid artery intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) as an etiology in nonstenotic carotid arteries. We performed a systemic review of the literature to determine the prevalence of carotid artery IPH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the vessel wall in patients with ESUS.
METHODS: We used PubMed, Epub ahead of print, Ovid MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Ovid Cochrane database of systematic reviews and Scopus. Our study consisted of all case series with >10 patients with IPH and ESUS published through October 2018. Additionally, we included 123 patients from an institutional database from 2015-2019. Random effects meta-analysis was used for pooling across studies. Meta-analysis results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 7 studies with 354 patients were included. The mean age was 67.5 years old. The overall prevalence estimate for prevalence of IPH ipsilateral to the ischemic lesion was 25.8% (95% CI 13.1-38.5). The odds of having IPH on the ipsilateral side versus the contralateral side was 6.92 (95% CI 3.04-15.79).
CONCLUSION: Patients with ESUS have IPH in the carotid artery ipsilateral to the ischemic stroke in 25.8% of cases. Carotid artery vessel wall MRI should be considered as part of the standard work-up in patients with ESUS.
