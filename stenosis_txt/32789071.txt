Title: Giant Left Ventricular Thrombus Formation in the Setting of Severe Aortic Stenosis and Heavy Cigarette Smoking.

Abstract: The harmful effects of cigarette smoking on the human body have been well documented. However, whether tobacco use is an independent risk factor of valvular heart disease remains debatable. Cigarette smoking has been associated with an inflammatory state and increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, which in turn activates protein kinases involved in ventricular remodeling. Subsequent ventricular dysfunction predisposes to the formation of mural thrombi which may lead to further worsening of hemodynamics. We present a case of severe aortic stenosis and giant left ventricular thrombus formation associated with chronic cigarette smoking.
