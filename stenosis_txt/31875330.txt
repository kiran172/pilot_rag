Title: Fetal cardiac intervention-Perspectives from a single center.

Abstract: Fetal cardiac intervention was first proposed in the early 1990s to impact cardiac development and survival of fetuses with fetal aortic stenosis and evolving hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Although initial attempts of fetal aortic valvuloplasty were unsuccessful and carried a high rate of morbidity and mortality, our collaborative group at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital have reinvigorated the procedure using improvements in imaging, anesthesia, balloon catheters, and surgical techniques. Two decades of experience have now allowed us to document the safety of in utero intervention and to achieve a better understanding of the impact of midgestation intervention on developing HLHS. Research into underlying genetics, predictive biomarkers, and ways to incorporate stem cell technology will hopefully allow us to further refine the procedure to most benefit children with this historically lethal disease.
