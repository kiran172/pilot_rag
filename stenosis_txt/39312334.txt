Title: The effect of multiple single cannulation technique on complications of arteriovenous fistulae: A meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of multiple single cannulation technique on the complications of arteriovenous fistula.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to investigate the impact of multiple single cannulation technique on the complications of arteriovenous fistula. The search was performed in both Chinese and English databases including Wanfang Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Vip, Pubmed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library, with a search period up to December 20, 2023. Following literature screening and data extraction, the quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Bias Assessment Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.3.
RESULTS: Thirteen papers, totaling 1299 patients, were included in the analysis. The experimental group consisted of 646 patients, while the control group had 595 patients. The meta-analysis revealed that the multiple single cannulation technique was more effective than rope ladder cannulation and buttonhole cannulation in reducing the incidence of angiomas (odds ratio [OR] = 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.10-0.35), stenosis (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.13-0.39), thrombosis (OR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.07-0.39), and blood seepage (OR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.08-0.21) of arteriovenous fistulas (P < .05). Additionally, it was found to increase the success rate of nurses' single cannulation (OR = 4.20; 95% CI = 1.78-9.95) of arteriovenous fistulas (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Multiple single cannulation technique could effectively reduce the incidence of complications of arteriovenous fistula, improve the success rate of cannulation, prolong the life span of arteriovenous fistula, and prolong the survival cycle of hemodialysis patients.
