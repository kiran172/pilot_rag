Title: Live Birth Following Transmyometrial Embryo Transfer.

Abstract: Occasionally, embryo transfer may be difficult, which is often because of anatomical position of the uterus or cervical stenosis. An alternative technique in such a scenario is the transmyometrial transfer of the embryos with the help of transvaginal ultrasound. Here, we describe the first case of successful embryo transfer through transmyometrial route leading to pregnancy and successful delivery in India.
