Title: Challenges and successful management of subglottic tracheal stenosis in a 2‑year‑old child: A case report and a mini‑review of the literature.

Abstract: Tracheal stenosis is a narrowing of the windpipe that can lead to shortness of breath, stridor and even suffocation. The present study reports the clinical course of a patient with this condition in an aim to help clinicians obtain more information about this rare condition and identify potential treatment options. A 2-year-old female child presented with progressive shortness of breath and stridor. She was initially managed with tracheostomy; however, this was unsuccessful in relieving the stenosis. Subsequent interventions, including rigid bronchoscopy and dilatation were successful in relieving the condition. A benign hypertrophy of the bronchial wall was identified through biopsy. The patient was treated with steroids and antibiotics, and she experienced a marked improvement in symptoms and remained asymptomatic after a 1-year follow-up. Tracheal stenosis is a rare, yet serious condition that may be life-threatening. Thus, the early diagnosis and treatment of this condition are essential in order to improve outcomes.
