Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Therapy for Bicuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become first-line treatment for older adults with severe aortic stenosis (AS), however, patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) have been traditionally excluded from randomised trials and guidelines. As familiarity and proficiency of TAVI operators have improved, case-series and observational data have demonstrated the feasibility of successful TAVI in bicuspid aortic valve aortic stenosis (BAV-AS), however, patients with BAV-AS have several distinct characteristics that influence the likelihood of TAVI success. This review aims to summarise the pathophysiology and classification of BAV, published safety data, anatomical challenges and procedural considerations essential for pre-procedural planning, patient selection and procedural success of TAVI in BAV.
