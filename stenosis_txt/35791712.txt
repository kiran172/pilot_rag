Title: Comparison of Sequential POT-Side-POT and Kissing Balloon Techniquesin Patientswith Coronary Bifurcation Lesions Treatedwith Single-Stent Strategy; Which One is Simple and Safe? Propensity Score Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether the novel POT-side-POT technique is more useful than the commonly preferred kissing balloon inflation in patients with non-complex coro- nary bifurcation lesions treated with a single-stent strategy. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of POT-side-POT and kissing balloon inflation techniques in one- stent strategy for non-complex coronary bifurcation lesions.
METHODS: In this study, 283 patients were retrospectively analyzed (POT-side-POT group, n = 149; KBI group, n = 134). Primary endpoints of the study were defined as follows: in- hospital and 30-day mortality, contrast-induced acute kidney injury, stent thrombosis, side branch dissection, and need for side-branch stenting. Characteristics of patients at baseline were balanced by using propensity score inverse probability weighting.
RESULTS: Procedure time (minute, 30.6 ± 8.5 vs. 34.3 ± 11.6; P = .003) and contrast volume (milliliter, 153.7 ± 42.4 vs. 171.1 ± 58.2; P = .004) were significantly lower in POT-side-POT group. Besides, side branch residual stenosis and number of patients with >50% side branch residual stenosis remained significantly higher in POT-side-POT group both in general and true bifurcation subgroup analysis (20.3 ± 19.8% vs. 16.5 ± 16.4%, P=.022; 11.9% vs. 5.7%, P = .013 and 24.1 ± 23.2% vs. 18.8 ± 18.7%, P = .033; 17.6% vs. 6.6%, P = .005; respectively). Combined clinical adverse outcomes were similar between groups. Side branch dissection (10.2% vs. 20.1%, P = .001) and need for side branch stenting (12.6% vs. 19%, P=.040) reached statistically significance in kissing balloon inflation group after adjustment.
CONCLUSION: POT-side-POT may be a simple and safe technique with a shorter procedure time and lower incidence of adverse clinical events in non-complex coronary bifurcationlesions treated with single-stent strategy.
