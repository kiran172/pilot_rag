Title: Extracardiac conduit adequacy along the respiratory cycle in adolescent Fontan patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Adequacy of 16-20mm extracardiac conduits for adolescent Fontan patients remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate conduit adequacy using the inferior vena cava (IVC)-conduit velocity mismatch factor along the respiratory cycle.
METHODS: Real-time 2D flow MRI was prospectively acquired in 50 extracardiac (16-20mm conduits) Fontan patients (mean age 16.9 Â± 4.5 years) at the subhepatic IVC, conduit and superior vena cava. Hepatic venous flow was determined by subtracting IVC flow from conduit flow. The cross-sectional area (CSA) was reported for each vessel. Mean flow and velocity was calculated during the average respiratory cycle, inspiration and expiration. The IVC-conduit velocity mismatch factor was determined as follows: Vconduit/VIVC, where V is the mean velocity.
RESULTS: Median conduit CSA and IVC CSA were 221 mm2 (Q1-Q3 201-255) and 244 mm2 (Q1-Q3 203-265), respectively. From the IVC towards the conduit, flow rates increased significantly due to the entry of hepatic venous flow (IVC 1.9, Q1-Q3 1.5-2.2) versus conduit (3.3, Q1-Q3 2.5-4.0 l/min, P < 0.001). Consequently, mean velocity significantly increased (IVC 12 (Q1-Q3 11-14 cm/s) versus conduit 25 (Q1-Q3 17-31 cm/s), P < 0.001), resulting in a median IVC-conduit velocity mismatch of 1.8 (Q1-Q3 1.5-2.4), further augmenting during inspiration (median 2.3, Q1-Q3 1.8-3.0). IVC-conduit mismatch was inversely related to measured conduit size and positively correlated with conduit flow. The normalized IVC-conduit velocity mismatch factor during expiration and the entire respiratory cycle correlated with peak VO2 (r = -0.37, P = 0.014 and r = -0.31, P = 0.04, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Important blood flow accelerations are observed from the IVC towards the conduit in adolescent Fontan patients, which is related to peak VO2. This study, therefore, raises concerns that implanted 16-20mm conduits have become undersized for older Fontan patients and future studies should clarify its effect on long-term outcome.
