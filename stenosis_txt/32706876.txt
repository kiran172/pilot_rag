Title: J-Mart: aortic valve replacement with Florida sleeve aortic root reconstruction.

Abstract: We highlight a technique combining an aortic valve replacement with the Florida sleeve repair. The patient is a 68-year-old man who had a 48-mm aortic root aneurysm and a 57-mm ascending aorta, presenting with symptomatic tri-leaflet severe aortic valve stenosis. He underwent a hemiarch, aortic valve replacement and Florida sleeve aortic root reconstruction. The patient recovered uneventfully and is now, at over 1 year postoperation, without evidence of recurrent aortic pathology.
