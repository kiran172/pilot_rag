Title: Prospective multicenter online testing of the carotid endarterectomy risk stratification calculator carotidscore.ru.

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the incidence of complications, including fatal outcomes, ischemic strokes, and transient ischemic attacks, associated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients categorized as low-, medium-, and high-risk based on their CarotidSCORE (carotidscore.ru).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective, multicenter study was conducted from January 1, 2022, to December 20, 2022, and enrolled 5,496 patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA), who were categorized into four groups according to their risk level. Group 1 (n=1,759) included patients at low risk; Group 2 (n=2,483) included those at medium risk; Group 3 (n=429) included those at high risk, who underwent carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS) due to the high risk of complications associated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA); and Group 4 (n=825) did not use CarotidSCORE (carotidscore.ru). Patients in Groups 1, 2, and 4 underwent CEA.
RESULTS: During the postoperative hospital stay, the highest number of complications, including fatal outcomes (p=0.0007), ischemic strokes (p<0.0001), and the combined endpoints (p<0.0001) were observed in Group 4. No complications were reported in Group 1.
CONCLUSION: The use of CarotidSCORE (carotidscore.ru) allows for the identification of high-risk patients, enabling clinicians to opt for CAS instead of CEA and reduce the incidence of complications.
