Title: Supravalvular pulmonary stenosis 9 years after surgically created pleuro-pericardial window.

Abstract: Supravalvular pulmonary stenosis acquired as a postoperative cardiac procedure complication is relatively common. However, that occurring after a surgically created pleuro-pericardial window has not been described until now, to the best of our knowledge. We present a case of acquired supravalvular pulmonary stenosis that developed 9 years after the pleuro-pericardial window creation for pyopericardium due to a constricting pericardial band. The child underwent successful surgical relief of the stenosis along with repair of the atrial and ventricular septal defects.
