Title: Feasibility and safety of laser balloon pulmonary vein isolation in patients with prior left atrial appendage occlusion device implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: With the increasing adoption of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) procedures and the eligibility of patients for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) post device placement, we examined the feasibility and safety of laser balloon (LB) for PVI in patients with prior LAAO.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined consecutive patients with paroxysmal or persistent, drug-resistant atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent LB PVI, after Watchman FLX device implantation at Rush University Medical Center between January 2020 and December 2021.
RESULTS: Seven patients (four persistent and three paroxysmal) with a mean age of 64 ± 11 years, predominantly male sex (86%), were included in the study. Two (29%) patients had prior cryoablation PVI with recurrence of AF. The mean CHA<sub>2</sub> DS<sub>2</sub> VASc is 2.6 ± 0.5 and the mean HAS-BLED score is 3.4 ± 0.8. The mean follow-up duration was 10 ± 7 months. The mean duration between Watchman FLX device implantation and LB PVI was 592 days. Acute first pass left pulmonary vein (PV) isolation was achieved in 100% of the procedures. There were no periprocedural complications such as death, pericardial tamponade or effusion, phrenic nerve injury, PV stenosis, device perforation or embolization, or worsening peri-device leak in any of the patients. None of the patients had AF recurrence after the blanking period.
CONCLUSION: LB PVI was safe and effective with 100% acute isolation of left-sided veins in patients with prior LAAO device.
