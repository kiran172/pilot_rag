Title: Correlation of circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 levels with inflammatory factors and the degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a secreted protein that plays an important role in atherosclerosis and pathological cardiac remodeling. However, the correlation between FGF21 and the degree of coronary artery stenosis and its potential role in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain unclear. We examined whether changes in FGF21 levels in AMI correlate with the degree of coronary artery stenosis and the levels of inflammatory factors, and preliminarily investigated the effects of FGF21 on inflammatory factor levels and myocardial injury in rats with AMI.
METHODS: Serum levels of FGF21 and inflammatory factors in the AMI group and control group were measured, and the correlation between FGF21 and clinical indicators and inflammatory factors was analyzed. The effects of FGF21 on cardiac function and inflammatory response were evaluated through echocardiography and measurement of inflammatory factors.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that neutrophil percentage (NEUT%, odds ratio [OR]: 1.232; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.028-1.477; p = 0.024) and FGF21 levels (OR: 2.063; 95 % CI: 1.187-3.586; p = 0.01) had independent effects on AMI. Spearman's rank correlation test showed that FGF21 levels were positively correlated with leukocyte count, NEUT%, neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and Gensini scores (p < 0.01), but negatively correlated with lymphocyte count (p < 0.01). FGF21 levels in myocardial tissues and serum levels of FGF21, IL-6, TNF-a, and MCP-1 were significantly higher in AMI rats than in the sham-operated group (p < 0.01). After overexpression of FGF21, serum levels of IL-6, TNF-a, and MCP-1 in rats were significantly decreased (p < 0.01), and cardiac function improved significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: FGF21 levels were independently associated with AMI and may be related to the severity of coronary artery stenosis. Overexpression of FGF21 reduced serum inflammatory factor levels and improved cardiac function in AMI rats.
