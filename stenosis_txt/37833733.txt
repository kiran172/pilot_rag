Title: Surgical treatment of severe benign tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present clinical experiences regarding surgical treatment of patients with severe cicatricial tracheal stenosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2008 to March 2020, 14 patients underwent tracheal resection and reconstruction under general anesthesia. Nine cases had cervical tracheal stenosis and five cases had thoracic tracheal stenosis. The mean diameter and length of strictured trachea was 0 - 8 mm with a mean of 4.5 ± 2.4 mm and 1 - 3 cm with a mean of 1.67 ± 0.63 cm, respectively. General anesthesia and mechanical ventilation were performed in ten cases and four patients underwent femoral arteriovenous bypass surgery due to severe stenosis. End-to-end anastomosis of trachea was performed in 13 cases and the anastomosis between trachea and cricothyroid membrane was performed in one case. Absorbable and unabsorbable sutures were used for the anterior and posterior anastomoses, respectively. Postoperative neck anteflexion was maintained by a suture between the chin and superior chest wall. The relevant data of the 14 patients were retrospectively reviewed, and the operation time, blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications and follow-up were retrieved.
RESULTS: There was no intraoperative death. The length of resected trachea ranged from 1.5 to 4.5 cm with a mean of 1.67 ± 0.63 cm. Operation time ranged from 50 - 450 min with a mean of 142.8 ± 96.6 min and intraoperative hemorrhage ranged from 10 - 300 ml with a mean of 87.8 ± 83.6 ml. Follow-up period ranged from 5 to 43 months with a mean of 17.9 ± 10.6 months. None of the patients had recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis during postoperative follow-up. Ten cases were discharged uneventfully. Anastomosis stenosis occurred in three cases who received interventional therapies. Bronchopleurocutaneous fistula occurred in one patient after 6 days postoperatively and further treatment was declined.
CONCLUSION: The strategies of anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, identification of stenosis lesion, the "hybrid" sutures and postoperative anteflexion are critical to be optimized for successful postoperative recovery.
