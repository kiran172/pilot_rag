Title: Anatomic Risk Factors for Reintervention After Arterial Switch Operation for Taussig-Bing Anomaly.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the factors related to reintervention, especially for pulmonary stenosis (PS), in patients with Taussig-Bing anomaly (TBA) after the arterial switch operation.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 34 patients with TBA who underwent the arterial switch operation between 1993 and 2018. Preoperative anatomic and physiologic differences and long-term outcomes were determined using a case-matched control with transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect and TBA with an anterior and rightward aorta.
RESULTS: At arterial switch operation, median age was 43 days (range, 16 to 102) and median body weight was 3.6 kg (range, 2.8 to 3.8 kg). Aortic arch obstruction and coronary anomalies were present in 64% and 41% of patients, respectively. The hospital mortality rate was 11%, including one cardiac death, and the late mortality rate was 2.9%. Furthermore, 41% patients underwent 26 reinterventions for PS. Patients undergoing PS-related reintervention had a significantly larger native pulmonary artery to aortic annulus size ratio than patients not receiving reintervention (1.69 vs 1.41, PÂ = .02). This ratio was the only predictor of PS-related reintervention; it was significantly higher in the TBA group than in the transposition of great arteries/ventricular septal defect group. The PS-related reintervention was required more in the TBA group than in the transposition of great arteries/ventricular septal defect group.
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of complex coronary anatomy and associated anomalies, early and late survival were acceptable. Postoperative PS was strongly associated with having a larger native pulmonary valve, suggesting that an optimal surgical reconstruction was required for achieving an appropriate aortopulmonary anatomic relationship during the arterial switch operation.
