Title: Co-existing cerebrovascular atherosclerosis predicts subsequent vascular event: a multi-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is still unknown that whether co-existing intracranial stenosis and extracranial carotid vulnerable plaques have higher predictive value for subsequent vascular events. This study aimed to determine the relationship between co-existing extracranial carotid vulnerable plaques and intracranial stenosis and subsequent vascular events utilizing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) vessel wall imaging.
METHODS: Patients who had recent cerebrovascular symptoms in anterior circulation (< 2 weeks) were consecutively enrolled and underwent multi-contrast CMR vessel wall imaging for extracranial carotid arteries and 3D time-of flight CMR angiography for intracranial arteries at baseline. After baseline examination, all patients were followed-up for at least 1 year to determined recurrence of vascular events. The co-existing cerebrovascular atherosclerosis was defined as presence of both intracranial artery stenosis and at least one the following measures of extracranial artery atherosclerosis: plaque, calcification, lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), or intraplaque hemorrhage. Univariate and multivariate Cox regressions were used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of co-existing plaques in predicting subsequent vascular events.
RESULTS: In total, 150 patients (mean age: 61.8 ± 11.9 years; 109 males) were recruited. During the median follow-up time of 12.1 months, 41 (27.3%) patients experienced vascular events. Co-existing intracranial artery stenosis and extracranial carotid plaque (HR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.63-7.82; P = 0.001) and co-existing intracranial artery stenosis and extracranial carotid LRNC (HR, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.15-9.27; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with subsequent vascular events, respectively. After adjusted for confounding factors and carotid stenosis, these associations remained statistically significant (HR, 5.12; 95% CI, 1.36-19.24; P = 0.016 and HR, 8.12; 95% CI, 2.41-27.31; P = 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The co-existing cerebrovascular atherosclerotic diseases, particularly co-existing carotid lipid-rich necrotic core and intracranial stenosis, are independent predictors for subsequent vascular events.
