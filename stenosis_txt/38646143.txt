Title: Cardiac blood vessels and irreversible electroporation: findings from pulsed field ablation.

Abstract: The clinical use of irreversible electroporation in invasive cardiac laboratories, termed pulsed field ablation (PFA), is gaining early enthusiasm among electrophysiologists for the management of both atrial and ventricular arrhythmogenic substrates. Though electroporation is regularly employed in other branches of science and medicine, concerns regarding the acute and permanent vascular effects of PFA remain. This comprehensive review aims to summarize the preclinical and adult clinical data published to date on PFA's effects on pulmonary veins and coronary arteries. These data will be contrasted with the incidences of iatrogenic pulmonary vein stenosis and coronary artery injury secondary to thermal cardiac ablation modalities, namely radiofrequency energy, laser energy, and liquid nitrogen-based cryoablation.
