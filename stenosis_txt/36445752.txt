Title: Innovative Endoscopic Management of a Duodenal Web Using Balloon Dilatation and a Gastrojejunal Tube in an Infant with Complex Esophageal Atresia.

Abstract: Introduction: Congenital partial duodenal obstruction (CPDO) is a rare type of intestinal obstruction, including webs and stenoses. Treatment has usually been operative by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Some have proposed endoscopic treatment due to a higher surgical risk in patients with CPDO. However, restenosis seems to be frequent after simple balloon dilatation. Material and Methods: We report on a patient with CPDO and complex esophageal atresia in whom we used a gastrojejunal tube to keep the lumen open after endoscopic balloon dilatation over a guidewire. Results: Follow-up endoscopy showed no evidence of restenosis. During the third endoscopy, the opening could be dilated to 15â€‰mm without any complications and the gastrojejunal tube was removed. Since then, there were no clinical signs of obstruction, and no further endoscopic intervention was necessary. Discussion and Conclusion: Using a gastrojejunal tube after endoscopic balloon dilatation of a duodenal web may lower the risk of restenosis. This technique should be considered in patients with comorbidities and considerable surgical risk that have a gastrostomy in place.
