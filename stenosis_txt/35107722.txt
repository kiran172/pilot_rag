Title: The use of Savary-Gilliard dilators in the treatment of an oesophageal stricture in a cat.

Abstract: Oesophageal strictures in cats and dogs are relatively rare and the cause of this disorder can be multifactorial. However, the most common cause in cats is an inflammatory process.Conservative treatment strategies for this disorder includes image-guided interventions. Endoscopic methods are a form of a minimally invasive surgical treatment of the oesophageal strictures. Several endoscopic methods for the therapy of this condition are known, one of them is Savary-Gilliard dilators technique.In the present study of a case of oesophageal stricture in a cat, caused probably by doxycycline treatment without water administration, the authors used the Savary-Gilliard dilators as a therapy for its condition. The animal underwent 3 endoscopy procedures, where in the third one no abnormality in the oesophagus was observed. Moreover, the cat was asymptomatic 6Â months after the last oesophagoscopy.In the authors opinion, based on the present case, some experience of the authors and previously described studies, the Savary-Gilliard dilators seems to be a safe, effective, relatively cheap and minimally invasive method of the oesophageal stricture therapy in the cat.
