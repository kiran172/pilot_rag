Title: Unequivocal interpretation of dobutamine stress echocardiography in low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis by right parasternal view.

Abstract: We present the case of a 77-years-old man with aortic valve stenosis (AS) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, in whom right parasternal view provided the best hemodynamic evaluation of AS severity during dobutamine stress echocardiography.
