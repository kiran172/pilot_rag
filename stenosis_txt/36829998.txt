Title: Electronegative LDL Is Associated with Plaque Vulnerability in Patients with Ischemic Stroke and Carotid Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Owing to the high risk of recurrence, identifying indicators of carotid plaque vulnerability in atherothrombotic ischemic stroke is essential. In this study, we aimed to identify modified LDLs and antioxidant enzymes associated with plaque vulnerability in plasma from patients with a recent ischemic stroke and carotid atherosclerosis. Patients underwent an ultrasound, a CT-angiography, and an 18F-FDG PET. A blood sample was obtained from patients (n = 64, 57.8% with stenosis ≥50%) and healthy controls (n = 24). Compared to the controls, patients showed lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoE, and higher levels of apoJ. Patients showed lower platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) enzymatic activities in HDL, and higher plasma levels of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and electronegative LDL (LDL(-)). The only difference between patients with stenosis ≥50% and &lt;50% was the proportion of LDL(-). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, the levels of LDL(-), but not of oxLDL, were independently associated with the degree of carotid stenosis (OR: 5.40, CI: 1.15-25.44, p &lt; 0.033), the presence of hypoechoic plaque (OR: 7.52, CI: 1.26-44.83, p &lt; 0.027), and of diffuse neovessels (OR: 10.77, CI: 1.21-95.93, p &lt; 0.033), indicating that an increased proportion of LDL(-) is associated with vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque.
