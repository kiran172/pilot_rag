Title: Does surgical decompression alleviate neglected cauda equina syndromes attributed to lumbar disc herniation and/or degenerative canal stenosis?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most studies recommend urgent decompression (e.g., within 48-72 h) of the symptomatic onset of a cauda equina syndrome. As patients in our area typically underwent >3 months delayed surgery for cauda equina syndromes due to disc disease/stenosis, we asked whether surgery was still worthwhile.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 12 patients (2012-2018) who underwent delayed surgical decompression for cauda equina syndromes secondary to lumbar disc herniations and/or degenerative lumbar canal stenosis.
RESULTS: After a mean postoperative duration of 8.22 months, nine patients experienced the complete restoration of bladder status; two patients required intermittent self-catheterization, while one patient had some residual symptoms (e.g., urgency but able to void with some difficulty).
CONCLUSION: For 12 patients who originally presented with cauda equina syndrome with complete incontinence, nine exhibited delayed full recovery of bladder function with average of 8.22 months postoperatively. We would, therefore, advise that delayed surgical decompression be offered to these patients, irrespective of the preoperative duration of cauda equina syndromes with complete incontinence.
