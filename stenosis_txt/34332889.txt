Title: Invasive Assessment of Microvascular Resistance in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy With Echocardiographic Correlates.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often associated with ischaemia despite lack of focal epicardial coronary stenosis. Our aim was to assess invasive coronary microvascular circulation and correlate findings with echocardiography.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with HCM and controls who were referred for diagnostic coronary angiography. A pressure-temperature sensor coronary guidewire was used with intracoronary injections of room-temperature saline to measure mean coronary transit time during rest and hyperaemia induced with intravenous adenosine. The index of microvascular resistance (IMR) was calculated. Left ventricular mass was calculated during echocardiographic studies.
RESULTS: Patients with HCM (n=12) and controls (n=7), had similar demographics. Left ventricular ejection fraction was higher in HCM (76.7%±11.0% vs 55.0%±15.9%, p=0.003). IMR was non-significantly higher in HCM (21.7±10.2 vs 15.3±4.8, p=0.16). Only patients with HCM had abnormal IMR (>25). Coronary flow reserve was non-significantly higher in HCM (2.7±1.6 vs 2.1±1.2, p=0.34). IMR correlated with left ventricular mass in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subjects (Pearson r=0.68, p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular dysfunction as assessed by IMR may be abnormal in HCM and is correlated with left ventricular mass.
