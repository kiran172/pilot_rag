Title: Myocardial Work in Echocardiography.

Abstract: Myocardial work is an emerging tool in echocardiography that incorporates left ventricular afterload into global longitudinal strain analysis. Myocardial work correlates with myocardial oxygen consumption, and work efficiency can also be assessed. Myocardial work has been evaluated in a variety of clinical conditions to assess the added value of myocardial work compared to left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain. This review showcases the current use of myocardial work in adult echocardiography and its possible role in cardiac pathologies.
