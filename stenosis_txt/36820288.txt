Title: Comparison of Antera 3D® and TcPO2 for Evaluation of Blood Flow in Skin.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a need for quick skin blood flow tests that can be performed in the wound healing field. Antera 3D® is a compact scanner using multispectral imaging. It can perform quick assessment of skin conditions. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the ability of the Antera 3D® to assess skin blood flow in comparison with transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) measurements.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 13 patients with a history of lower extremity ulcers. Measurements of hemoglobin average level (hereafter, Hb score) measured by Antera 3D® and TcPO2 measured by a transcutaneous blood gas monitor were obtained at the same sites on the dorsal foot and lower leg. Differences in Hb score and TcPO2 were analyzed by t-test for each measurement site and for the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The correlation between TcPO2 and Hb score was analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Twenty-four limbs were tested. Hb score was higher (P &lt; 0.001) and TcPO2 was lower (P = 0.056) in the dorsal foot compared to the lower leg. In the dorsal foot, Hb score was higher (P = 0.023) and TcPO2 was lower (P = 0.046) in patients with PAD compared to those without PAD. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.68; 95% confidence interval -0.85 to -0.38, P &lt; 0.001) between TcPO2 and Hb score was observed in the dorsal foot.
CONCLUSION: The negative correlation between TcPO2 and Hb score may reflect compensatory peripheral vasodilation due to occlusion or stenosis of central arteries. This study showed that Hb score measured by Antera 3D® may be related to skin blood flow.
