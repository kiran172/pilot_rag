Title: Iatrogenic bladder neck rupture due to traumatic urethral catheterization: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In this article, we present a case of iatrogenic bladder neck rupture due to catheter insertion in a 94-year-old comorbid male patient.
CASE SUMMARY: The patient, who had a urethral catheter inserted in the palliative service 3 d ago, was consulted because the catheter did not work. Because the fluid given to the bladder could not be recovered, computed tomography was performed, which revealed that the catheter had passed the bladder neck first into the retrovesical area then into the intraabdominal area. The appearance of the anterior urethra and verumontanum was normal at cystoscopy. However, extremely severe stenosis of the bladder neck, and perforated posterior wall of the urethral segment between the prostatic urethra and the bladder neck were observed. Internal urethrotomy was applied to the bladder neck with a urethrotome. An urethral catheter was sent over the guide wire into the bladder. The patient was followed in the palliative care service and the catheter was removed 7 d later. No extravasation was observed in the control urethrography.
CONCLUSION: Although catheter insertion is a simple and frequently performed procedure in hospitalized patients, it is necessary to avoid unnecessary extra-indication catheter insertion.
