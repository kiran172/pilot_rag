Title: The patient with patellar instability has a stenotic intercondylar notch and a thin anterior cruciate ligament: a retrospective comparative study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patellar instability (PI) usually combines with morphological abnormalities of femoral condyles that may affect the morphology of the intercondylar notch and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which are important in individualized ACL reconstruction. This study aimed to investigate the morphological characteristics of the intercondylar notch and ACL in patients with PI.
METHODS: 80 patients with PI and 160 age- and gender-matched controls from January 2014 to June 2022 were studied. Morphological measurements of the femoral condyles included intercondylar notch height, notch width, medial condylar width, lateral condylar width, bicondylar width, notch width index, notch angle, lateral femoral condyle ratio (LFCR), condyle flexion angle, and posterior tibial slope. Morphological measurements of the ACL included ACL length, inclination angle, and ACL size. The measurements were compared between PI and control groups, and between males and females in PI group. The independent samples t-test was performed to examine differences in continuous variables. The chi-square test was used for comparing categorical variables.
RESULTS: The intercondylar notch width, bicondylar width, notch width index, and notch angle were significantly smaller, while the LFCR was significantly larger in PI group than those of control group (p < 0.05). The ACL thickness (0.70 ± 0.16 cm vs 0.80 ± 0.21 cm, p = 0.023) and width (0.54 ± 0.14 cm vs 0.60 ± 0.13 cm, p = 0.029) were significantly smaller in PI group. The notch width was significantly smaller in female patients than males in PI group, but no significant difference was observed in the notch width index and notch angle (p > 0.05). No sex difference related to the morphology of the ACL was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The patient with PI had a stenotic intercondylar notch and a thin ACL. No significant sex difference in the intercondylar notch stenosis and ACL size was observed. The morphology of the intercondylar notch and ACL should be taken into consideration when planning individualized ACL reconstruction in the presence of PI.
