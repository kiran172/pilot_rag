Title: Incidental detection of pheochromocytoma during workup for symptomatic aortic stenosis: A case report and management discussion.

Abstract: Pheochromocytoma patients with high levels of circulating catecholamines are at risk of cardiovascular complications related to hypertensive emergencies and subsequent organ damage. A patient with concomitant aortic stenosis and pheochromocytoma has compounded risk of cardiovascular complications, especially during surgery, which complicates medical decision-making. We report a patient with Turner syndrome and congenital heart defects (CHDs) who was incidentally discovered to have a pheochromocytoma during workup of symptomatic severe bioprosthetic aortic stenosis. Management included laparoscopic adrenalectomy followed by Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). We describe considerations for multidisciplinary management in this complex clinical case.
