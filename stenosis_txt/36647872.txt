Title: Application value of transcranial contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in evaluating middle cerebral artery stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To detect the display rate and flow velocity of intracranial circle of Willis (anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries) with transcranial contrast-enhanced transcranial color-coded sonography (CE-TCCS), using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the golden diagnostic standard.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected data from 104 patients with suspected stroke treated in our hospital between December 2019 and October 2021. The detection rate of the intracranial circle of Willis, anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) were analyzed based on routine TCCS and CE-TCCS data. Based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) data, the degree of MCA stenosis was divided into mild stenosis (<50%), moderate stenosis (50-69%), severe stenosis (70-99%), and bilateral middle cerebral artery CE-TCCS examinations were performed. We evaluated MCA color blood flow on CE-TCCS, and recorded the peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and mean flow velocity (MFV).
RESULTS: The display rates of ACA, MCA, and PCA were significantly improved on the CE-TCCS, and the PSV, EDV and MFV of the MCA stenosis group were higher than those of the normal group. The flow velocity of each stenosis subgroup was increased compared to the normal group. The optimal cutoff values of normal and stenosis under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were PSV = 168.5 cm/s, EDV = 61.5 cm/s, and MFV = 110.5 cm/s. The optimal cutoff values for mild and moderate stenosis and for moderate and severe stenosis were PSV = 201.5 cm/s and 249.5 m/s, EDV = 95.2 cm/s and 141.5 cm/s, and MFV = 137.6 cm/s and 160.5 cm/s, respectively. PSV and MFV had the most significant sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial contrast-enhanced ultrasonography can improve the display rate of intracranial blood vessels and can accurately diagnose MCA stenosis.
