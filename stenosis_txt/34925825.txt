Title: Frequency of recurrence of peripheral artery disease among angioplasty and stenting patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a cardiovascular disease that is characterized by obstruction of peripheral artery. It is associated with comorbidities, reduced quality of life and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of recurrence of PAD among patients who underwent angioplasty or stenting and associated risk factors.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients referred to the cardiovascular center of (XXX) with the diagnosis of lower extremity PAD were included. Patients' demographic information, age, gender, smoking status, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, number of vessels, type of stent, recurrence of the disease, and size of the lesion were obtained from the hospital database. Endovascular revascularization therapy was either performed by angioplasty or stenting method. The data were analyzed by SPSS v21.
RESULTS: Of 88 patients included in this study, 12.5% were reported with restenosis. Gender, age, size of the lesion, the status of smoking, history of hypertension, and dyslipidemia were not significantly associated with the recurrence of stenosis, p > 0.05. There was a significant relationship between the vessels involved and the type of revascularization method and the recurrence of the PAD.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular revascularization technique and type of vessel involved in PAD are significant factors contributing to restenosis in our population of study. However, further studies with a greater sample size are required in this area.
