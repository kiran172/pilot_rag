Title: Correlations between the peripheral coronary fat attenuation index based on computed tomography images, high-risk plaque and degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease can be quantified by measuring the fat attenuation index (FAI).
OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlations between FAI, high-risk plaque and the degree of coronary artery stenosis.
METHODS: The clinical data of patients with coronary atherosclerosis who underwent a coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography examination between July 2020 and June 2023 were selected for retrospective analysis. These patients were classified into a high-risk plaque group and non-high-risk plaque group according to the presence of CT high-risk plaque. The diagnostic value of FAI and FAI combined with the degree of stenosis was evaluated for CT high-risk plaque.
RESULTS: Differences in age, body mass index, smoking history, FAI and the degree of stenosis between the two groups were statistically significant (all P< 0.05). The results of a binary logistic regression analysis revealed that FAI (odds ratio (OR): 1.131, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.101-1.173, P< 0.001) and the degree of stenosis (OR: 1.021, 95% CI: 1.012-1.107, P< 0.001) were risk factors for high-risk plaque.
CONCLUSION: The FAI can be used to monitor the inflammation level of the coronary artery; the higher the FAI is, the higher the risk of plaque and degree of stenosis.
