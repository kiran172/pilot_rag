Title: Integrated bioinformatics analysis identified leucine rich repeat containing 15 and secreted phosphoprotein 1 as hub genes for calcific aortic valve disease and osteoarthritis.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) and osteoarthritis (OA) are common diseases in the ageing population and share similar pathogenesis, especially in inflammation. This study aims to discover potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in patients with CAVD and OA. Three CAVD datasets and one OA dataset were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We used bioinformatics methods to search for key genes and immune infiltration, and established a ceRNA network. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to verify the expression of candidate genes in human and mice aortic valve tissues. Two key genes obtained, leucine rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), were further screened using machine learning and verified in human and mice aortic valve tissues. Compared to normal tissues, the infiltration of immune cells in CAVD tissues was significantly higher, and the expressions of LRRC15 and SPP1 were positively correlated with immune cells infiltration. Moreover, the ceRNA network showed extensive regulatory interactions based on LRRC15 and SPP1. The authors' findings identified LRRC15 and SPP1 as hub genes in immunological mechanisms during CAVD and OA initiation and progression, as well as potential targets for drug development.
