Title: Aortic Valve Repair in Young Patients: A Single Patch Design for Leaflet Extension.

Abstract: The surgical treatment for young patients with aortic valve diseases has not been standardized because of differences in the patients' growth. We aimed to investigate short-term results of aortic valve repair with leaflet extension techniques. From October 2017 to June 2020, we performed aortic valve repair with leaflet extension technique in 15 consecutive patients with a median age of 13 years (range, 33 months-27 years). Among them, all had moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (AR), eight had concomitant aortic stenosis, and 12 underwent prior cardiac operations. The leaflet patch design has been modified from separate patch design to single patch design. No early and late deaths were reported, no re-operations were performed, and temporary ectopic atrial arrhythmia was the only early complication noted. The patients were discharged with less than moderate AR after a median postoperative period of 5 (range, 3-7) days. All the patients were New York Heart Association class I after a median follow-up period of 17.3 (range, 4.4-34.6) months. However, two patients progressed to moderate AR postoperatively at 6 and 30 months, respectively, after which one was treated with single patch technique. Among the remaining patients, six had trace, six had mild, and one had mild-to-moderate AR. Aortic valve repair with leaflet extension is acceptable in young patients. Our single patch design was easy to manipulate and showed good short-term results. Long-term follow-up is required to further confirm the efficacy of this technique.
