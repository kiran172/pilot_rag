Title: A case of vasospastic angina with exertional sign.

Abstract: We herein report a case of a 56-year-old woman with angina pectoris. She visited our emergency room because of chest pain. She finally underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention in right coronary artery due to acute coronary syndrome. Several months later, she complained of exertional chest pain again. Exercise-stress electrocardiogram showed ST-segment depression in V2-V6. However, coronary angiography showed no organic stenosis and we conducted acetylcholine provocation test. We finally detected severe coronary artery spasm and diagnosed exercise-induced vasospastic angina (VSA). This case highlights the importance of the recognition of exercise-induced VSA. Exercise-induced VSA needs the definite diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Learning objective Many patients felt chest pain even if they have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This case highlights the importance of the recognition of exercise-induced vasospastic angina (VSA). Exercise-induced VSA needs definite diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This case report describes the importance of precise diagnosis and highlights the recognition of exercise-induced VSA. We recommend the acetylcholine provocation test after PCI in order to determine the diagnosis of exercise-induced VSA.
