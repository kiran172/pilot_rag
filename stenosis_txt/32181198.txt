Title: Idiopathic Epidural Lipomatosis Associated with Degenerative Discopathy: Grand Round Presentation of Unusual Lumbar Canal Stenosis Resolved by Weight Loss.

Abstract: Here, we report a case of idiopathic epidural lipomatosis presented with a clinical picture of lumbar canal stenosis with neurogenic claudication which resolved completely only by weight loss. A 53-year-old obese male with a body mass index of 36 without significant past medical history presented to the outpatient clinic with neurogenic claudication and bilateral sciatic radiculopathy. Initially, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed epidural lipomatosis at the level of L5 vertebral body and L5-S1 intervertebral disc. A conservative treatment was decided with dietary regime program. After 6 months of follow-up, his bilateral sciatic radiculopathy disappeared, and updated MRI showed complete disappearance of epidural lipomatosis. Based on the Grand Round case and relevant literature, we present a case of an unusual epidural lipomatosis with mixed clinical picture of degenerative lumbar disease. This case report set out the importance of Borr√© classification for differentiating the mixed clinical complaint of degenerative discopathy and epidural lipomatosis.
