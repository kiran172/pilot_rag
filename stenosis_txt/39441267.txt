Title: ENDOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS: A NEW INSIGHTS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The study efforts on evaluating the effectiveness, complications, and advancements in endovascular interventions such as angioplasty, stenting, embolization, and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) across various patient groups and vascular diseases.
METHODS: Patients undergoing endovascular procedures were meticulously prepared with detailed history, physical examinations, and relevant investigations. Procedures were conducted in dedicated areas like the Cath Lab and hybrid operation rooms equipped with fluoroscopic imaging systems. Interventions included balloon angioplasty, stent insertion, embolization, and EVAR. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness and safety of the interventions.
RESULTS: Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Out of 941 cases, 62.5% were male and 91% were over 40 years old. Femoral artery (25.8%) and below-the-knee (38%) were common lesion sites. Balloon angioplasty was used in 77.7% of cases, with a 73.7% success rate. Complications were minimal, with 96.3% reporting none. Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection Repair: Among 29 patients, 86.2% were male, and 89.7% had abdominal aortic aneurysms. EVAR was performed in 86.2% of cases, with a 96.6% success rate and minimal complications (6.9% wound infection). Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): In 16 cases, 75% of treatments were effective, with 93.75% experiencing no complications. Venous Hypertension in CKD Patients on Dialysis: All 18 patients were aged 46-65. Balloon angioplasty was performed in 38.89% of cases, with 44.44% success rate and no complications. Pelvic Congestion Syndrome (PCS): In 23 patients, coil embolization was used, achieving 100% success with no complications. Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM): Out of 23 cases, 87% were successfully treated with embolization, and 13% were referred for surgery. Arterial Aneurysms: Three cases of aneurysms in different arteries were successfully treated with stent-grafts, with no complications. Renal Artery Stenosis (RAS): All three cases were treated successfully with balloon angioplasty, with no complications.
CONCLUSION: Over two years, endovascular interventions at our center demonstrated significant advancements and high success rates with minimal complications. The study underscores the efficacy and safety of these techniques in treating a variety of vascular conditions, highlighting the potential for improved patient outcomes and recovery. Continuous advancements in endovascular technology and techniques promise further enhancements in the management of complex vascular diseases.
