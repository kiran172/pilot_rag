Title: Successful surgical treatment of congenital tracheal stenosis combined with tracheal bronchus and left pulmonary artery sling: a 10-year single-institution experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Radical surgery for congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) is technically demanding. CTS combined with tracheal bronchus (TB) and pulmonary artery (PA) sling is a particularly challenging condition. We herein report our successfully modified surgical techniques for CTS combined with TB and PA sling.
METHODS: Nine patients treated at our institution from July 2010 to December 2020 for CTS with TB and PA sling were enrolled. The patients' characteristics, operative results, and clinical outcomes were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: The mean age at the operation and body weight were 8.0 ± 4.4 months old and 6.5 ± 0.8 kg, respectively. The mean tracheal diameter and length of the stenotic lesion were 3.2 ± 1.0 mm (mean stenosis rate 46.2%) and 25.4 ± 4.9 mm, respectively. All cases were complicated with PA sling at bifurcation stenosis with tracheobronchomalacia. All patients underwent modified posterior-anterior slide tracheoplasty with an inverted Y-shaped incision at the bifurcation and repositioning of the PA. The mean postoperative intubation period was 25.0 ± 32.1 days. There were no major intraoperative or postoperative complications, including hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The mean hospital stay was 92.2 ± 73.4 days. All patients were discharged home without tracheostomy or oxygen support.
CONCLUSION: Our slide tracheoplasty technique for CTS with TB and PA sling achieved excellent outcomes.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.
