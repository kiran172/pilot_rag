Title: Case of calcific tricuspid and pulmonary valve stenosis.

Abstract: Isolated right-sided valvular disease is a much less recognised entity when compared with left-sided valvular heart disease. Almost all the cases of combined pulmonary valve with tricuspid valve involvement are a consequence of underlying carcinoid heart disease. Moreover, severe calcification of tricuspid valve is an extremely unusual finding. We report a case of a severe calcific tricuspid valve stenosis along with severe pulmonary valve stenosis where the exact aetiology could not be established. On reviewing the literature, we did not find any reports describing such a morphology.
