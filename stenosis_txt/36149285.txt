Title: Left ventricular rehabilitation in an infant with transposition of the great arteries, intact ventricular septum, pulmonary stenosis and small left ventricle.

Abstract: We report the case of successful biventricular repair after left ventricular rehabilitation in an infant with transposition of the great arteries with an intact ventricular septum, pulmonary stenosis, a large atrial septal defect and a borderline small left ventricle (mitral annulus z-score: -3.6). This baby presented to us at 2 months of age after having a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt at another hospital. We restricted the atrial septal defect with the child on cardiopulmonary bypass. Ten weeks later, the mitral annulus z-score increased to -1.5, and the transpulmonary peak pressure gradient increased to 87â€‰mmHg. Subsequently, we performed the aortic root translocation. The patient is currently an active 4-year-old boy.
