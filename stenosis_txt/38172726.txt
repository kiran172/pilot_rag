Title: Transfer RNA-derived small RNA tRF-Glu-CTC attenuates neointimal formation via inhibition of fibromodulin.

Abstract: Neointimal hyperplasia is a pathological vascular remodeling caused by abnormal proliferation and migration of subintimal vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) following intimal injury. There is increasing evidence that tRNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA) plays an important role in vascular remodeling. The purpose of this study is to search for tsRNAs signature of neointima formation and to explore their potential functions. The balloon injury model of rat common carotid artery was replicated to induce intimal hyperplasia, and the differentially expressed tsRNAs (DE-tsRNAs) in arteries with intimal hyperplasia were screened by small RNA sequencing and tsRNA library. A total of 24 DE-tsRNAs were found in the vessels with intimal hyperplasia by small RNA sequencing. In vitro, tRF-Glu-CTC inhibited the expression of fibromodulin (FMOD) in VSMCs, which is a negative modulator of TGF-Î²1 activity. tRF-Glu-CTC also increased VSMC proliferation and migration. In vivo experiments showed that inhibition of tRF-Glu-CTC expression after balloon injury of rat carotid artery can reduce the neointimal area. In conclusion, tRF-Glu-CTC expression is increased after vascular injury and inhibits FMOD expression in VSMCs, which influences neointima formation. On the other hand, reducing the expression of tRF-Glu-CTC after vascular injury may be a potential approach to prevent vascular stenosis.
