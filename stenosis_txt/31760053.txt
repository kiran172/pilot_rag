Title: Chronic Type A Aortic Dissection After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: An 87-year-old man with a hostile ascending aorta who underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a 26-mm Sapien 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) 2 years earlier presented with chronic type A aortic dissection, which was retrospectively caused by the edge of the pusher of the TAVR implantation system. Redo sternotomy and extraction of the Sapien valve, followed by replacement of the ascending aorta and the aortic valve, were performed successfully. Retrospective image analysis showed the importance of respecting the anatomy of the ascending aorta before considering transfemoral TAVR.
