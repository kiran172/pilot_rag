Title: Diagnosis and Treatment of Nonmaturing Fistulae for Hemodialysis Access via Transradial Approach: A Case-Control Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of transradial access for endovascular treatment of nonmaturing hemodialysis fistulae compared to brachial arteriography followed by unidirectional or bidirectional fistula access for intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved, retrospective, case-control study, 56 consecutive patients with nonmaturing arteriovenous fistulae underwent percutaneous intervention between 2015 and 2018. The transradial group (n = 28) underwent radial artery access for diagnostic fistulography and intervention. The control group (n = 28) underwent retrograde brachial artery access for fistulography followed by unidirectional/bidirectional fistula access for intervention. Both groups had similar demographics, fistula characteristics, and stenosis locations.
RESULTS: Fewer punctures were required in the transradial group compared to controls (1.2 vs 2.4, P < .0001), and procedure time was shorter (64.9 vs 91.3 minutes, P = .0016). Anatomic, technical, and clinical success rates trended higher in the transradial group compared to controls (93% vs 86%, 96% vs 89%, and 82% vs 64%, respectively). Nonmaturation resulting in fistula abandonment was lower in the transradial group (3.7% vs 25%, P = .025). Primary unassisted patency at 3, 6, and 12 months was 77.1% ± 8.2%, 73.1% ± 8.7%, and 53.3% ± 10.6% in the transradial group, respectively, and 63.0% ± 9.3%, 55.6% ± 9.6%, and 48.1% ± 9.6% in the control group, respectively (P = .76). Primary assisted patency at 12 months was 92.3% ± 5.3% in the transradial group compared to 61.8% ± 9.6% at 12 months in the control group (P = .021). No major complications occurred. Minor complications were lower in the transradial group than in the control group (14% vs 39%, P = .068).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of nonmaturing fistulae via a transradial approach was safe, improved midterm patency, and was associated with lower rates of fistula abandonment.
