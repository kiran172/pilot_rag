Title: Stenting Using the Rendezvous Technique for Postoperative Ureteral Complications in Cancer Patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of ureteral stent placement using the rendezvous technique for the treatment of postoperative ureteral complications in cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2005 to April 2015, 19 patients (2 men and 17 women; median age, 59; range, 42-79 years old) with unilateral ureteral lesions (ureteral leakages in 6, strictures in 4, and both in 9) underwent ureteral stent placement using the rendezvous technique. Percutaneous nephrostomy was performed, and stent placement was attempted via antegrade and retrograde approaches. The technical success, procedure-related complications, and clinical success were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 29.8 months (range, 0.3-116.5 months). The ureteral stent placement was successful in 17 out of 19 patients (89.5%). Double J ureteral stent was used in 6 patients, and straight catheter as an internal-external nephro-ureteral stent was used in 11 patients. The rendezvous technique was used in the retroperitoneal space and urinary tract in 6 and 11 patients, respectively. No major complications related to the rendezvous technique occurred. Finally, 4 patients achieved stent-free condition (21.1%), and periodic stent exchange was continued in 9 (47.4%). However, permanent external drainage and surgical reconstruction were needed in 4 (21.1%) and 2 (10.5%) patients, respectively. The final clinical success rate was 68.4% (13 out of 19 patients).
CONCLUSION: Ureteral stent placement using the rendezvous technique for the treatment of postoperative ureteral complications in cancer patients is safe and may be alternative to permanent external drainage and invasive surgical reconstruction.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4, Case series.
