Title: [Clinical application of cervical pedicle screw implantation technique under regional method].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of cervical pedicle screw implantation technique under regional method.
METHODS: The clinical data of 85 patients who met the selection criteria between April 2010 and May 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 57 males and 28 females, aged 35-68 years, with an average of 57.6 years. Among them, there were 10 cases of ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament, 68 cases of cervical spondylosis with multilevel stenosis, 3 cases of cervical tumor, 1 case of congenital malformation, and 3 cases of cervical trauma; the lower cervical spine lesions involved C <sub>3</sub>-C <sub>7</sub>. Preoperative Frankel spinal cord injury grading: 2 cases of grade C, 51 cases of grade D, and 32 cases of grade E. Cervical pedicle screw implantation technique under regional method was performed with a total of 618 pedicle screws. Postoperative changes in neurological symptoms were observed; cervical mouth opening anteroposterior and lateral X-ray films and cervical CT examinations were performed to evaluate the pedicle screws position.
RESULTS: The operation time was 2.5-4.0 hours, with an average of 3.0 hours. The intraoperative blood loss was 180-550 mL, with an average of 345 mL. No intraoperative vascular or nerve injury occurred. The patients with neurological symptoms were relieved to varying degrees. There were 2 cases of superficial incision infection after operation, the wound healed after enhanced dressing change. The postoperative hospital stay was 5-14 days, with an average of 8.4 days. At discharge, Frankel neurological grading was grade D in 26 patients and grade E in 59 patients. All the patients were followed up 6-24 months, with an average of 13 months. At last follow-up, cervical X-ray films showed the good pedicle screw fixation without loosening. Cervical CT evaluated the position of pedicle screws: 523 pedicle screws (84.7%) in grade Ⅰ, 80 (12.9%) in grade Ⅱ, and 15 (2.4%) in grade Ⅲ; the accuracy rate of the screw position was 97.6%.
CONCLUSION: Cervical pedicle screw implantation technique under regional method can significantly improve the success rate of screw implantation. It is easy to operate, does not destroy the bone cortex, and has stable fixation.
