Title: Coronary Ostial Patch Angioplasty With Femoral Artery in Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) occasionally involves the coronary ostium leading to myocardial ischemia. Although surgical coronary ostial angioplasty is desirable for ostial stenosis, the patch materials and long-term results are controversial. We used femoral artery (FA) as a patch material for coronary ostial angioplasty in 3 TA patients. Coronary ostial enlargement with a longitudinal incision followed by rectangular FA patch augmentation was performed to extend the narrowing coronary ostium. In all patients, coronary ostial stenosis was successfully repaired. Ostial angioplasty using an FA patch would be a reasonable surgical strategy to treat coronary ostial stenosis in TA.
