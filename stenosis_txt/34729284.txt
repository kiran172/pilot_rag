Title: Japanese Spotted Fever Complicated With Life-Threatening Ventricular Tachycardia and Acute Cardiac Damage.

Abstract: A 67-year-old man with high-grade fever and systemic erythema visited our hospital. Based on his symptoms and history of outdoor activities, we considered the possibility of rickettsial diseases, especially Japanese spotted fever (JSF). He was treated with antibiotics. After hospitalization, the patient complained of palpitations, and electrocardiography revealed ventricular tachycardia (VT). He was successfully treated with electrical defibrillation. Moreover, echocardiography showed decreased wall motion at the apex. However, coronary angiography showed no coronary artery-related stenosis. JSF was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction using a biopsy sample of the erythema. Subsequently, the patient was discharged without complications. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of JSF complicated with VT and acute cardiac damage.
