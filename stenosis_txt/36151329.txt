Title: Usefulness of stent placement for innominate artery stenosis via the right brachial artery under protection by balloon guide catheter: a technical case report.

Abstract: A method of cerebral protection during endovascular treatment for innominate artery stenosis (IAS) has not been established. Herein, we report a case of symptomatic IAS in a 76-year-old woman. A balloon guide catheter (BGC) was inserted through the right brachial artery (BA) and guided distally to the stenosis. The BGC balloon was inflated, and stenting was performed with balloon protection of both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation, without any complications. Stenting of the IAS with the BGC using the BA approach is useful, as it is a simple technique that can prevent distal embolization.
