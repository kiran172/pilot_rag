Title: Compensatory upregulation of MT2A alleviates neurogenic intermittent claudication through inhibiting activated p38 MAPK-mediated neuronal apoptosis.

Abstract: Neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC), a classic symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), is associated with neuronal apoptosis. To explore the novel therapeutic target of NIC treatment, we constructed the rat model of NIC by cauda equina compression (CEC) method and collected dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissues, a region responsible for sensory and motor function, for mRNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of mRNA sequencing indicated that upregulated metallothionein 2A (MT2A), an apoptosis-regulating gene belonging to the metallothionein family, might participate in NIC progression. Activated p38 MAPK mediated motor dysfunction following LSS and it was also found in DRG tissues of rats with NIC. Therefore, we supposed that MT2A might affect NIC progression by regulating p38 MAPK pathway. Then the rat model of NIC was used to explore the exact role of MT2A. Rats at day 7 post-CEC exhibited poorer motor function and had two-fold MT2A expression in DRG tissues compared with rats with sham operation. Co-localization analysis showed that MT2A was highly expressed in neurons, but not in microglia or astrocytes. Subsequently, neurons isolated from DRG tissues of rats were exposed to hypoxia condition (3% O<sub>2</sub>, 92% N<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) to induce cell damage. Gain of MT2A function in neurons was performed by lentivirus-mediated overexpression. MT2A overexpression inhibited apoptosis by inactivating p38 MAPK in hypoxia-exposed neurons. Our findings indicated that high MT2A expression was related to NIC progression, and MT2A overexpression protected against NIC through inhibiting activated p38 MAPK-mediated neuronal apoptosis in DRG tissues.
