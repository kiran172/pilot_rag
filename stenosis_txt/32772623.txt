Title: Reduction of radiation exposure using low pulse rate fluoroscopy during neuroendovascular surgery.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endovascular surgery is minimally invasive, but the radiation exposure can be problematic. There is no report assessing whether radiation exposure can be reduced by using a low pulse rate during carotid artery stenting (CAS). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether reducing the pulse rate from 7.5 to 4 frames per second (f/s) can reduce the radiation exposure while maintaining safety during CAS procedure.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the radiation data and clinical features of all 100 patients who underwent CAS between 2014 and 2019. We changed the pulse rate from 7.5 to 4 f/s in 2017. The fluoroscopic time (FT), dose area product (DAP), and total air kerma (AK) were collected. Statistical analyses were performed between the pulse rate and clinical outcomes, including radiation exposure.
