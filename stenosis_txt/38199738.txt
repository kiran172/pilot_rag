Title: Pulmonary Nocardiosis With Endobronchial Involvement Caused by Nocardiaaraoensis.

Abstract: We report a rare case of pulmonary nocardiosis with endobronchial involvement caused by Nocardia araoensis. A 79-year-old man with a history of asthma and a previous right upper lobectomy for lung cancer and organizing pneumonia presented with cough and dyspnea. He presented with right bronchial stenosis associated with various mucosal lesions, including ulcerative and exophytic lesions. N araoensis was detected in sputum samples collected via bronchoscopy. The mucosal lesions improved after a 2-week course of meropenem. After a further 6Â months of oral sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim treatment, the mucosal lesions completely disappeared. Based on bronchoscopic and pathophysiologic findings, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis with endobronchial involvement. Nocardiosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of endobronchial mucosal lesions.
