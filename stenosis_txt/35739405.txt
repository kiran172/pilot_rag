Title: Right posterior bile duct stricture after central bisectionectomy or anterior sectionectomy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Before performing anterior sectionectomy (AS) or central bisectionectomy (CBS), the anatomy of the right posterior bile duct (RPBD) must be cautiously assessed owing to the many variations of the RPBD and its variations could be related to bile duct injury.
METHODS: Clinical data of patients who underwent AS or CBS from 2009 to 2018 were reviewed. The bile duct anatomy according to Okubo's criteria and the right bile duct (RBD) length were evaluated using MRI, and we performed a risk factor analysis of the RPBD stricture (RPBDS).
RESULTS: A total of 68 patients were included. Type A bile ducts were the most common (n = 36, 52.9%). Five (7.2%) patients had RPBDS requiring intervention. RPBDS only occurred in patients with a type A bile duct and a type A portal vein undergoing surgery using the Glissonian sheath approach. Moreover, when the RBD length was > 12 mm, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.8 and 0.889, respectively. In multivariate analysis, RBD length of > 12 mm was significant.
CONCLUSION: A careful review of RPBD anatomy especially in patient with long RBD and caution when using the anterior Glissonian sheath approach might be helpful to prevent RPBDS during AS or CBS.
