Title: Unusual Cause of Heart Failure in a Patient with Marfan Syndrome: A Late Complication of Bioprosthetic Valved Graft Replacement.

Abstract: A high-velocity gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract is most often caused by aortic valve stenosis. We describe the unusual case of a high-velocity gradient caused by a kinked ascending aortic graft in a 69-year-old man who had Marfan syndrome. The patient had a history of ascending aortic aneurysm and had previously undergone replacement of the aortic root and ascending aorta with use of a bioprosthetic valved graft. The kinking was caused by dilation of the native aortic arch. The patient underwent successful hemi-arch replacement and repair of the kinked graft. Late complications and reoperation after proximal aortic surgery in patients with Marfan syndrome are rare, and a high-velocity left ventricular outflow tract gradient caused by the kinking of the aorta is unusual.
