Title: Carotid Artery Plaque Progression: Proposal of a New Predictive Score and Role of Carotid Intima-Media Thickness.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate if the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) at baseline and the HAD<sub>2</sub>S score, composed of the sum of single risk factors (hypertension, age â‰¥ 75 years, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking), were predictive of plaque progression.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis on real-life prospectively collected data from patients with any detectable carotid plaque at follow up. The plaque score, calculated at baseline (T0) and at a median follow up of 36.6 months (IQR 39.6-34.3) (T3), was defined as 0: no plaque or stenosis &lt; 30%; 1: stenosis in the range 30-49%; 2: in the range 50-69%; 3: in the range 70-99% and 4: occlusion. Carotid IMT was measured at T0 and T3; HAD<sub>2</sub>S score was calculated at baseline.
RESULTS: We included 340 patients with a mean age of 69.9 (9.1) years and 25.3% subjects had plaque progression. Individuals with progression had a median HAD<sub>2</sub>S score of 3 (1) while those without progression had 2 (1). Patients with progression had a mean baseline IMT of 0.86 (0.17) while those without progression had 0.77 (0.18) (p &lt; 0.0001). A correlation between progression and baseline IMT was found (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Baseline IMT could be considered a predictor of progression. Patients with progression had an HAD<sub>2</sub>S score higher than those without evolution.
