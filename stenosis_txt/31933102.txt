Title: Left ventricular mechanical dispersion in flow-gradient patterns of severe aortic stenosis with narrow QRS complex.

Abstract: Patients with severe aortic stenosis are classified according to flow-gradient patterns. We investigated whether left ventricular (LV) mechanical dispersion, a marker of dyssynchrony and predictor of mortality, is associated with low-flow status in aortic stenosis. 316 consecutive patients with aortic stenosis and QRS duration &lt; 120 ms were included in the retrospective analysis. Patients with severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area ≤ 1.0 cm2) were classified as normal-flow (NF; stroke volume index &gt; 35 ml/m2) high-gradient (HG; mean transvalvular gradient ≥ 40 mmHg) (n = 79), NF low-gradient (LG) (n = 62), low-flow (LF) LG ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 50% (n = 57), and LF LG EF &lt; 50% (n = 23). Patients with moderate aortic stenosis (aortic valve area 1.5-1.0 cm2; n = 95) served as comparison group. Mechanical dispersion (calculated as standard deviation of time from Q/S onset on electrocardiogram to peak longitudinal strain in 17 left ventricular segments) was similar in patients with NF HG (49.4 ± 14.7 ms), NF LG (43.5 ± 12.9 ms), LF LG EF ≥ 50% (47.2 ± 16.3 ms) and moderate aortic stenosis (44.2 ± 15.7 ms). In patients with LF LG EF &lt; 50%, mechanical dispersion was increased (60.8 ± 20.7 ms, p &lt; 0.05 vs. NF HG, NF LG, LF LG EF ≥ 50% and moderate AS). Mechanical dispersion correlated with global longitudinal strain (r = 0.1354, p = 0.0160) and heart rate (r = 0.1587, p = 0.0047), but not with parameters of aortic stenosis. Mechanical dispersion was similar among flow-gradient subgroups of severe aortic stenosis with preserved LVEF, but increased in patients with low-flow low-gradient and reduced LVEF. These findings indicate that mechanical dispersion is rather a marker of systolic myocardial dysfunction than of aortic stenosis.
