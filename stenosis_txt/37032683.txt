Title: Anesthesia management of pediatric subglottic stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Subglottic stenosis balloon dilation in selected patients may be an option for the treatment of acquired subglottic stenosis, reducing the need for open surgical approaches or tracheostomy. This treatment is a major challenge to otolaryngologists and anesthesiologists, with an interactive collaboration being critical throughout the procedure. When performed, it is fundamental that otolaryngologists and anesthesiologists communicate properly during the procedure to achieve acceptable results. The complex management of the airway and inherent delicacy and risks of the intervention may be challenging. A proper preparation of the procedure and familiarization with the step-by-step technique could optimize the results and prepare the team to deal with intervening complications. We report a case of management and treatment of an 8-month-old baby with subglottic stenosis proposed for endoscopic balloon dilation treatment from Porto, North of Portugal.
