Title: A Unique Cause of Upper Airway Obstruction in a Child: Laryngeal Lipoma.

Abstract: There are lots of diseases causing pediatric upper airway obstruction and stridor. They can be both congenital or acquired. While congenital causes are laryngomalacia, vocal cord palsy, congenital subglottic stenosis, acquired ones range from infections to foreign bodies or neoplasms. Laryngeal neoplasms develop almost epithelial in origin. Non-epithelial tumors consist 1% of laryngeal neoplasms. Although lipoma is the most common soft tissue tumor, laryngeal involvement is very rare and seen in the ages between 40-60 years. A 13-month-old child who had laryngeal lipoma and upper airway obstruction was aimed to present in this paper.
