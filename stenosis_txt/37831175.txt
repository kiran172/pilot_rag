Title: Endoscopic management of esophageal mucosal bridges in children with esophageal atresia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Esophageal mucosal bridge (EMB) may be diagnosed at the anastomotic site in children operated on for esophageal atresia (EA) but so far only a few cases (n = 4) have been reported. This study aimed to characterize EMB in children with EA, risk factors, and treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study recorded patient's characteristics, EMB diagnosis circumstances, endoscopic management, follow-up, and EMB recurrence in children with EA aged less than 18 years, compared with paired EA patients without EMB.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were included (60% male, 90% EA/tracheoesophageal fistula, 43% associated malformations). Compared to 44 paired controls, EMB was associated with a history of nasogastric tube feeding (31% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.02) and severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (history of fundoplication: 41.4% vs. 13.6%, p < 0.01). 77% had symptoms (food impaction and/or dysphagia). Endoscopic management was performed in 53% of patients (83% electrocoagulation) with no technical difficulties or complications. 80% of the symptomatic patients with EMB improved after endoscopic treatment, independently of anastomotic stricture dilatation or not.
CONCLUSION: EMB endoscopic management by electrocoagulation is safe and often leads to symptom improvement.
