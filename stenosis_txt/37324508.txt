Title: Association between CZT‑SPECT myocardial blood flow and coronary stenosis: A cross‑sectional study.

Abstract: The association between the quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters of myocardial blood flow obtained using cadmium-zinc-telluride single photon emission computed tomography (CZT-SPECT) and coronary stenosis remains unclear. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of two parameters obtained using CZT-SPECT in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. A total of 24 consecutive patients who underwent CZT-SPECT and coronary angiography within 3 months of each other were included in the study. To evaluate the predictive ability of the regional difference score (DS), coronary flow reserve (CFR), and the combination thereof for positive coronary stenosis at the vascular level, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted and the area under the curves (AUCs) were calculated. Comparisons of the reclassification ability for coronary stenosis between different parameters were assessed by calculating the net reclassification index (NRI) and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). The 24 participants (median age: 65 years; range: 46-79 years; 79.2% male) included in this study had a total of 72 major coronary arteries. When stenosis ≥50% was defined as the criteria for positive coronary stenosis, the AUCs and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for regional DS, CFR, and the combination of the two indices were 0.653 (CI, 0.541-0.766), 0.731 (CI, 0.610-0.852) and 0.757 (CI, 0.645-0.869), respectively. Compared with single DS, the combination of DS and CFR increased the predictive ability for positive stenosis, with an NRI of 0.197-1.060 (P<0.01) and an IDI of 0.0150-0.1391 (P<0.05). When stenosis ≥75% was considered as the criteria, the AUCs were 0.760 (CI, 0.614-0.906), 0.703 (CI, 0.550-0.855), and 0.811 (CI, 0.676-0.947), respectively. Compared with DS, CFR had an IDI of -0.3392 to -02860 (P<0.05) and the combination of DS and CFR also enhanced the predictive ability, with an NRI of 0.0313-1.0758 (P<0.01). In conclusion, both regional DS and CFR had diagnostic values for coronary stenosis, but the diagnostic abilities differed in distinguishing between different degrees of stenosis, and the efficiency was improved with a combination of DS and CFR.
