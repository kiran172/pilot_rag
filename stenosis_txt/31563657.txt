Title: Stenting for Innominate Artery Stenosis Under Double-Filter Protection of the Anterior and Posterior Circulation via the Right Brachial Artery.

Abstract: Several protocols for angioplasty and stenting for stenosis of an innominate artery (IA) are reported, but the protocols are sometimes complicated and have disadvantages. We report a case of IA stenosis presenting ischemic symptoms in a 58-year-old woman. Stenting for the IA stenosis was performed through the right femoral artery. The cerebral protection was placed via the right brachial artery, with a filter at the right internal carotid artery and another filter at the right vertebral artery. The symptomatic IA stenosis was resolved without any complications. Regardless of the direction of blood flow, simultaneous protection of both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation is necessary during IA stenting. Double-filter protection can provide excellent cerebral protection during an IA stenting procedure.
