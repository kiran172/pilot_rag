Title: Association of Coronary Artery Severity and Late In-Stent Restenosis: An Angiographic Imaging Study.

Abstract: Coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a challenge in interventional cardiology. We investigated the relationship between angiographic pre-interventional grade of lesion stenosis (LS) and the prognosis of late ISR. After exclusions, 110 patients with ISR and 109 patients without ISR were compared. In the ISR group, the grade of LS was greater (P &lt; .001) and the length of the critical segment (LCS) was longer (P &lt; .001). Stent length was longer in the ISR group (P = .008). Compared with the LCS, the grade of LS above 87.5% is 6.9 times more predictive of ISR than the LCS &gt;10.5 mm. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that the grade of initial LS &gt;87.5% had a higher ISR rate than the grade of LS &lt;87.5% (log-rank test P &lt; .001) and critical lesion length over 10.5 mm had a higher ISR rate than critical lesion length under 10.5 mm (log-rank test P &lt; .001). The present study found that the angiographic pre-interventional grades of LS and LCS were important predictors of ISR. Pre-interventional angiographic stenosis &gt;87.5% was significantly predictive of late ISR.
