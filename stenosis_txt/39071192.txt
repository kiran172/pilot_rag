Title: Case report of meningoencephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection showing a decrease in idiopathic focal cerebral blood flow.

Abstract: Some neurological complications are associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with infection by SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, he developed disturbed consciousness and aseptic meningoencephalitis. An analysis of cerebrospinal flood revealed an elevated cell count (184/Î¼L) and protein level (260 mg/dL). Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities. By contrast, 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography showed a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the left parietal and occipital lobes. He died suddenly 3 months after being transferred to a rehabilitation clinic without any clear cause of death. The SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause aseptic meningoencephalitis with a distinctive decrease in CBF pattern without magnetic resonance image abnormality or intracranial artery stenosis.
