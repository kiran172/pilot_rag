Title: Prediction of the Cerebral Hyperperfusion Phenomenon after Carotid Endarterectomy Using a Transit Time Flowmeter.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the cerebral hyperperfusion phenomenon (CHP) and carotid artery flow volume as measured by a transit time flowmeter during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). We retrospectively investigated 74 patients who underwent both transit time flowmetry and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The flow volumes of the internal carotid artery (ICA) before and after the endarterectomy were recorded during surgery as the pre- and the post-ICA (mL/min), respectively. We defined the difference between the pre- and the post-ICA as the ΔIC (mL/min). Two independent board-certified neurosurgeons analyzed the asymmetry index (affected side/contralateral side) of regional qualitative cerebral blood flow before and after the CEA respectively. We defined the CHP as an excessive increase in this asymmetry index between preoperative and postoperative SPECT. The CHP was observed in five of the 74 patients (6.8%). The pre-ICA of the CHP cases was significantly lower than that of the non-CHP cases (in mL/min, median 29 vs. 97; P = 0.01). The ΔIC of the CHP cases was significantly higher than that of the non-CHP cases (in mL/min, median 154 vs. 50; P = 0.002). The cut-off value of the ΔIC was 81 mL/min (sensitivity 100%, specificity 78.3%, area under the curve 0.912). The findings of this study suggest that the ΔIC is associated with the CHP. The transit time flowmeter is useful to predict the CHP during surgery.
