Title: Modification of the Indiana Pouch Ileo-Caecal Cutaneous Continent Urinary Diversion: Tubular Ileal Afferent Limb for Ureteral Anastomosis Has Low Stricture Rate and Allows Ileal Ureter Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to introduce our new modification of the Indiana pouch with a refluxing ureteral anastomosis in a tubular afferent ileal segment of the ileo-caecal urinary reservoir.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 2008 and December 2020, we performed a total of 37 modified continent ileo-caecal pouches for urinary diversion when orthotopic bladder substitution was not possible. Hereby, we modified the Indiana pouch procedure with a new refluxing end-to-end ureteral anastomosis into an 8-cm afferent tubular ileal segment.
RESULTS: We performed the modified Indiana pouch in 27 women (73%) and 10 men (27%). The median age of the patients at time of operation was 64 years (43-80 years). To date, the average follow-up is 69 months (3-156 months). In 32/37 cases, we performed the new pouch procedure after radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer and in 1/37 cases after radical cystectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer. In 4 cases, the procedure was performed after total exenteration of the pelvis due to locally advanced bladder, colorectal, or gynaecological cancers. Ureteral anastomotic strictures were seen in 2/37 patients (5.4%) or 2/72 (2.8%) of renal units.
CONCLUSIONS: Our modification of the Indiana pouch cutaneous continent urinary diversion with the ureteral anastomosis to a tubular segment of the pouch is easy to perform and effective in reducing the rate of ureteral anastomotic strictures. By lengthening, the afferent tubular ileal segment, it additionally allows easy ureteral replacement.
