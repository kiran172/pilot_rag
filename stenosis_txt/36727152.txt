Title: Clinical and Hemodynamic Factors Associated with Low Gradient Severe Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: Discrepancy between narrowed mitral valve area and transmitral gradient is not uncommon, suggesting the presence of low gradient (LG)-severe mitral stenosis (MS). Some clinical and hemodynamic factors are believed to associate with LG-severe MS. Transthoracic echocardiography reports were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate the association of all clinical and hemodynamic parameters with LG-severe MS. A 36% of total 322 patients was in the LG-severe MS group. In multivariate analysis, atrial fibrillation (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.60-16.71, odds ratio [OR] 8.77), net atrioventricular compliance &gt; 4 mL/mm Hg (95% CI 3.96-14.25, OR 7.51), tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity (TR Vmax) &gt; 3.4 m/s (95% CI 0.13-0.48, OR 0.25), stroke volume index ≤ 35 mL/m 2 (95% CI 1.49-6.25, OR 3.05), female gender (95% CI 1.30-5.33, OR 2.63), and severe tricuspid regurgitation (95% CI 1.04-5.50, OR 2.39) were found to be associated with LG-severe MS. Atrial fibrillation, net atrioventricular compliance, TR Vmax, stroke volume index, female gender, and severe TR were associated with low transmitral gradient in patients with severe MS.
