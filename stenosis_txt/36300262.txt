Title: Ross Procedure in Neonate and Infant Populations: A Meta-Analysis Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aims to perform a meta-analysis of early and late outcomes of the Ross/Ross-Konno procedures in neonates/infants.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We used Ovid versions of MEDLINE/PubMed for relevant studies and included those that reported Ross/Ross-Konno operations in neonates/infants and at least one of the predetermined clinical outcomes. I2 and double arcsine methods assessed the heterogeneity between pooled estimates. We used a random-effect model to account for heterogeneity with MetaXL. We calculated point estimates of a pooled estimates along with its 95% CI.
RESULTS: 587 neonate/infant patients were included with median age of 87.5 days old. The follow-up range was five days to 23 years. Early mortality reported in 25 studies with pooled estimates of 18.3% (95% CI: 13.6%-23.5%). Estimates ranged from 0% to 50% with relatively substantial heterogeneity (P = .01, I2 = 48.6%). Late mortality reported in 22 studies with pooled incidence of 9.7% (95% CI: 5.9%-14.3%). Estimates ranged from 0% to 53% with relatively substantial heterogeneity (P = .01, I2 = 46.1%). Autograft reintervention reported in 18 studies with pooled estimate of 19.2% (95% CI: 7.3%-34.5%). Estimates ranged from 0% to 81.8% with high heterogeneity (P &lt; .001, I2 = 90.5%). Right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit reintervention reported in 16 studies with pooled estimates of 32.0% (95% CI: 20.9%-44.12%). Estimates ranged from 0% to 92.3% with high heterogeneity (P &lt; .001, I2 = 75.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the Ross/Ross-Konno procedure in neonates/infants still carries significant risk of early/late mortality and autograft/conduit reintervention. The high variability of results among centers confirms the need for surgical expertise and good patient selection. Prospective multicenter studies are warranted to investigate the rate of autograft reintervention and the impact on long-term survival in this specific population.
