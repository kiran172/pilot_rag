Title: Crohn-like Disease Affecting Small Bowel Due to Monogenic SLCO2A1 Mutations: First Cases of Chronic Enteropathy Associated with SLCO2A1 Gene [CEAS] in France.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Multiple chronic ulcers of small intestine are mainly ascribed to Crohn's disease. Among possible differential diagnoses are chronic ulcers of small bowel caused by abnormal activation of the prostaglandin pathway either in the archetypal but uncommon non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID]-induced enteropathy, or in rare monogenic disorders due to PLA2G4A and SLCO2A1 mutations. SLCO2A1 variants are responsible for CEAS [chronic enteropathy associated with SLCO2A1], a syndrome which was exclusively reported in patients of Asian origin. Herein, we report the case of two French female siblings, P1 and P2, with CEAS.
CASE REPORT: P1 underwent iterative bowel resections [removing 1 m of small bowel in total] for recurrent strictures and perforations. Her sister P2 had a tight duodenal stricture which required partial duodenectomy. Next-generation sequencing was performed on P1's DNA and identified two compound heterozygous variants in exon 12 in SLCO2A1, which were also present in P2.
CONCLUSION: CEAS can be detected within the European population and raises the question of its incidence and recognition outside Asia. Presence of intractable recurrent ulcerations of the small intestine, mimicking Crohn's disease with concentric strictures, should motivate a genetic search for SLCO2A1 mutations, particularly in the context of family history or consanguinity.
