Title: WIRION™ embolic protection system for carotid artery stenting and lower extremity endovascular intervention.

Abstract: Aim: To summarize all available literature regarding the Wirion™ embolic protection system (EPS) and present examples from our center. Materials &amp; methods: A review of literture was performed about the utilization of Wirion EPS. Results: One study was identified investigating the outcomes of Wirion during carotid artery stenting. The study demonstrated 98.3% procedural success with stroke occurring in only 2.5%. Two single arm studies were identified investigating the efficacy of the Wirion filter during lower extremity endovascular interventions. The reported device success ranged from 95.1 to 97.3%. Conclusion: While carotid artery stenting should always be performed with adjunctive EPS in order to decrease the risk of cerebrovascular accidents, the routine use of EPS in femorpopliteal interventions remains an active area of investigation.
