Title: Combined Cardiovascular Syphilis and Aortic Valve Stenosis (Due to a Congenitally Unicuspid Valve).

Abstract: Described herein is a 53-year-old man who underwent resection of a fusiform aneurysm of the ascending aorta, and excision of a congenitally malformed stenotic unicuspid aortic valve. Examination of the wall of the aortic aneurysm disclosed classic features of syphilis. Although some degree of pure aortic regurgitation is common in patients with aortic syphilis, the presence of associated aortic valve stenosis, such as occurred in this patient, has been mentioned in only 4 previous publications, none of which included morphologic examination of the ascending aorta or aortic valve.
