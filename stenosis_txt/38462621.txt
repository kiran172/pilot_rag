Title: Left atrial myxoma with cardiogenic shock following a myocardial infarction: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumor and typically originate in the left atrium. Atrial myxomas may present following complications of obstruction and emboli. If an atrial myxoma goes untreated, complications such as congestive heart failure, embolic stroke, and sudden death can occur.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old Caucasian male presented following a cardiac arrest. He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab and received two drug eluting stents. Following the procedure, he was found to have a left atrial mass that was intermittently obstructing the mitral valve on echocardiography. After leaving the cardiac catheterization lab, he was hypotensive and placed on multiple intravenous medications for hemodynamic support as well as an Impella device. Following medical optimization, he underwent one vessel coronary artery bypass graft as well as surgical excision of the left atrial mass, which pathology had shown to be an atrial myxoma.
CONCLUSION: This patient's case of cardiogenic shock following revascularization was complicated by the identification of an atrial myxoma, which, when large enough, can obstruct blood flow through the mitral valve leading to acute mitral dynamic stenosis. This condition results in circulatory collapse due to obstruction of the left ventricle in diastole as the myxoma occludes the mitral valve.
