Title: [Treatment of atherosclerotic lesion of the first segment of subclavian artery].

Abstract: Severe subclavian artery lesion is an important medical and social problem worsening the quality of life and leading to dire consequences. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency is the main syndrome of lesion of the first segment of subclavian artery. About 20% of all ischemic strokes occur in vertebrobasilar basin. At present, surgical treatment of asymptomatic patients with severe lesion of the 1st segment of subclavian artery is still debatable. Open surgery is optimal for occlusion of this vascular segment. Carotid-subclavian transposition is a preferable option with favorable in-hospital and long-term results. However, carotid-subclavian bypass is an equivalent alternative in case of difficult transposition following anatomical and topographic features of vascular architectonics. Endovascular treatment is preferable for isolated subclavian artery stenosis and should certainly include stenting.
