Title: Prognostic role of pre- and postinterventional myocardial injury in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic pre-procedural and acute post-procedural myocardial injury are frequently observed in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of our study was to investigate the prognostic role of high sensitivity cardiac troponins (hs-cTns) elevation before and after TAVI.
METHODS: 106 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI were enrolled. High sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) was measured before and after TAVI (6, 24, 48, 72 hours). Post-procedural myocardial damage was defined as a 15-fold rise in hs-cTnT upper reference limit (URL) after TAVI. The clinical endpoints were all cause death, cardiovascular death and re-hospitalization at 24 months follow-up.
RESULTS: Before TAVI, hs-cTnT median value was 0.03 μg/L (2.3±2.1 fold over URL). After TAVI procedure, myocardial damage (MD), as defined by VARC-2 criteria, was observed in 40 patients (38%) (MD group). In our population, logarithmically transformed hs-cTnTs were independently associated with all-cause mortality at 24 months F/U (pre-TAVI hs-cTnT: Hazard ratio [HR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 4.4, P=0.027). No significant differences were observed between the MD and non-MD groups for the three endpoints of all cause death (p log rank: 0.15), cardiovascular death (p log rank: 0.86) and re-hospitalization (p log rank: 0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: Only baseline hs-cTnT levels correlated with outcomes at 24 months of follow-up. Chronic pre-procedural myocardial injury significantly affects prognosis after TAVI.
