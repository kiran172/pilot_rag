Title: Regional Distribution of Extracellular Volume Quantified by Cardiac CT in Aortic Stenosis: Insights Into Disease Mechanisms and Impact on Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Extracellular volume fraction (ECV) is a marker for myocardial fibrosis and infiltration, can be quantified using cardiac computed tomography (ECV<sub>CT</sub>), and has prognostic utility in several diseases. This study aims to map out regional differences in ECV<sub>CT</sub> to obtain greater insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ECV expansion and its clinical implications.
METHODS: Three prospective cohorts were included: patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and coexisting AS and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis were referred for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement and had ECG-gated CT angiography and Technetium-99m-labelled 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid scintigraphy to differentiate between the 2 cohorts. Controls had CT angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance demonstrating no significant coronary artery disease or infarction. Global and regional ECV<sub>CT</sub> was analyzed, and its association with mortality was assessed for patients with AS.
RESULTS: In 199 patients, controls (n=65; 66% male), AS (n=115), and coexisting AS and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (n=19) had a global ECV<sub>CT</sub> of 26.1 (25.0-27.8%) versus 29.1 (27.5-31.1%) versus 37.4 (32.5-46.6%), respectively; P&lt;0.001. Across cohorts, ECV<sub>CT</sub> was higher at the base (versus apex), the inferoseptum (versus anterolateral wall), and the subendocardium (versus subepicardium); P&lt;0.05 for all. Among patients with AS, epicardial ECV<sub>CT</sub>, rather than any other regional value or global ECV<sub>CT</sub>, was the strongest predictor of mortality at a median of 3.9 (max 6.3) years (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08-1.36]; P=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in ECV<sub>CT</sub> suggest a predilection for fibrosis and amyloid infiltration at the base, subendocardium, inferior wall, and septum more than the anterior and lateral myocardium. ECV<sub>CT</sub> can predict long-term mortality with the subepicardium demonstrating the strongest discriminatory power.
