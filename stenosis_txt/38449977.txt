Title: The Role of Transesophageal Echocardiogram in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Intracardiac Tumors: A Case of Atrial Myxoma.

Abstract: Cardiac myxoma is the most common primary heart tumor in adults. Although biologically benign, they can be life-threatening by obstructing heart function. They typically develop in the left atrium and can be polypoid (causing more obstruction) or papillary (more likely to cause embolizations). Symptoms are nonspecific, and diagnosis is relatively rare. Echocardiography is essential for quick diagnosis, and surgical removal is the primary treatment with low mortality rates, excellent postoperative survival, and low recurrence rates. We report a 73-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with extreme fatigue and weight loss. Further investigations revealed a mass in the left atrium suggestive of an intracardiac tumor on a thoracic computer tomography scan. A subsequent transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which showed a large, mobile, and friable hyperechogenic intra-auricular mass adhered to the atrial septum with moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis. This case highlights the crucial role that the transesophageal echocardiogram plays in these patients by accelerating diagnosis, assisting with myxoma resolution, and confirming the complete removal of the myxoma.
