Title: [Association of a myxoma of the left atrium and a mitral stenosis : About a case].

Abstract: Atrial myxoma is a rare and benign clinical entity. It remains common in women and mainly affects the left atrium. Its clinical picture is polymorphic. We report the case of a 53-year-old woman who consulted for dyspnea with cardiac failure's picture. The diagnosis of myxoma of the left atrium was made on echocardiography which also objectified the existence of mitral stenosis. The patient underwent surgical excision and mitral valve replacement with good postoperative outcomes.
