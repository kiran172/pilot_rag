Title: The role of preoperative venography in predicting the difficulty of a transvenous lead extraction procedure.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We hypothesized that an accurate assessment of preoperative venography could be useful in predicting transvenous lead extraction (TLE) difficulty.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A dedicated preoperative venogram was performed in consecutive patients with cardiac implantable electronic device who underwent TLE. The level of stenosis was classified as without significant stenosis, moderate, severe, and occlusion. The presence of extensive lead-venous wall adherence (≥50 mm) was also assessed. A total of 105 patients (median age: 71 years; 72% male) with a median of 2 (1-2) leads to extract were enrolled. Preoperative venography showed moderate to severe stenosis in 31 (30%), complete occlusion in 15 (14%), and extensive lead-venous wall adherence in 50 (48%) patients. Complete TLE success was achieved in 103 (98%) patients. A total of 55 (52%) were advanced extractions as they required a powered mechanical and/or laser sheath. They were more prevalent in the group with extensive lead-venous wall adherence (72% vs. 34%, p < .001), while no differences were found between patients with and without venous occlusion. In multivariate analysis, the presence of adherence was a predictor of advanced extraction (odds ratio: 2.89 [1.14-7.32], p = .025). The fluoroscopy time was also significantly longer (14.0 [8.2-18.7] vs. 5.1 [2.1-10.0] min, p < .001). The rate of complications did not differ based on the presence of venous lesions.
CONCLUSION: Although procedural success and complication rates were similar, patients with extensive lead-venous wall adherence required a longer fluoroscopy time and were three times more likely to need advanced extraction tools. Conversely, the presence of total venous occlusion had no impact on the procedure complexity.
