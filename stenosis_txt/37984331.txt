Title: Recanalized vein of marshall following bidirectional glenn surgery.

Abstract: A 6-year-old boy with a case of double outlet right ventricle with large non-routable ventricle septal defect and severe pulmonary stenosis was deemed unsuitable for biventricular repair on a prior evaluation. Hence, a bidirectional Glenn (BDG) shunt was performed at 3 years of age following cardiac catheterization.
