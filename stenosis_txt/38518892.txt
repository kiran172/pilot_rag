Title: Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers Are Associated With Reduced Valvular Fibrosis in Women With Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may slow down the progression of aortic stenosis (AS) through their antifibrotic effect. Women present more valvular fibrosis than men, so ARBs may have more effect in females. Our aim was to assess the impact of ARBs on the remodelling of the aortic valve in men and women.
METHODS: We included patients who had an aortic valve replacement with or without coronary bypass grafting from 2006 to 2013. Patients with missing echocardiographic or histologic data were excluded. Warren-Yong and fibrosis scores of the explanted valves were performed. Patients were divided into 4 phenotypes according to their Warren-Yong and fibrosis scores: mild calcification/fibrosis, severe calcification/fibrosis group, predominant fibrosis group, predominant calcification group.
RESULTS: Among the 1321 included patients, the vast majority (89%) has severe AS. Patients in the predominant fibrosis group, compared with the predominant calcium group, were more often female (39% vs 31%; P = 0.008) with bicuspid valves (44% vs 34%; P = 0.002), and less often used ARBs (25% vs 30%; P = 0.046). Female sex was independently associated with being in the predominant fibrosis group (odds ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.95; P = 0.01), with a significant interaction between female sex and ARBs. Women taking ARBs compared with women not taking ARBs had significantly lower fibrosis scores (P < 0.001). This difference was not seen in men.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of patients with moderate-severe AS, among the women there was a negative association between intake of ARBs and valvular fibrosis. Thus, the possible effects of ARBs may be sex specific, with a larger therapeutic role in women.
