Title: Amniotic Band Syndrome: Head-to-Toe Manifestations and Clinical Management Guidelines.

Abstract: LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand and describe the basic principles underlying the intrinsic versus extrinsic proposed mechanisms for the development of amniotic band syndrome (ABS). 2. Discuss risk factors and conditions that are associated with the development of ABS. 3. Understand the various presentations and associated clinical implications of ABS by anatomic location. 4. Describe the basic tenets underlying various repair technique options for ABS of the extremities. 5. Discuss the common manifestations of ABS in the face and trunk. 6. Understand clinical implications of fetoscopic surgery as it relates to ABS treatment as a novel method for limb salvage in utero.
SUMMARY: Amniotic band syndrome (ABS) refers to the development of constrictive bands of fibrotic tissue in utero. It can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations after delivery. There is much debate in the plastic surgery community regarding the exact pathophysiologic mechanism for the development of ABS, and the most appropriate management. This CME article aims to provide an overview of ABS manifestations throughout the body, and to expound on the most recent advances in anticipatory and definitive management of the condition.
