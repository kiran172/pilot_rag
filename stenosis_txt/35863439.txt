Title: Antiplatelet regimens following carotid artery revascularization.

Abstract: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is indicated following carotid artery stenting (CAS) and single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) following carotid endarterectomy (CEA), but it remains unknown how providers adhere to these guidelines in real-world clinical practice. Using the Vascular Quality Initiative New England data, we found that of 12,257 patients, 82% patients were discharged on DAPT following CAS and 66% were discharged on SAPT following CEA. While a high percentage of patients undergoing CAS appropriately receive DAPT, the use of SAPT following CEA exists with more variability and lower adherence rates.
