Title: Mitral valve repair for a parachute-like asymmetrical mitral valve during pregnancy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Parachute mitral valves (PMV) and parachute-like asymmetrical mitral valves (PLAMV) presenting in adulthood is rare.
CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old primigravida, with 25 weeks of amenorrhea, presented with exertional dyspnea (NYHA class-2). She had a PLAMV, severe mitral stenosis, moderate central mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 102 mm Hg. She underwent a successful valve repair.
DISCUSSION: PMV/PLAMV and pregnancy present a dual challenge. In our case mitral repair resulted in a near-normal valve function and allowed our patient to safely carry her pregnancy to term.
