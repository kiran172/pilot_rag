Title: Long-term fate of the incised urethral plate in Snodgrass procedure; A real concern does exist.

Abstract: We present here a case of a patient post tabularized incised plate urethroplasty for distal hypospadias without chordee who developed urethral stenosis and acquired curvature along the territory of the incised plate necessitating a redo surgery. The histological analysis of the incised urethral plate revealed absence of smooth muscles, vessels and elastin fibers within the area of the incised plate which could explain the poor compliance of this segment and the development of the curvature. To our knowledge, this case is the first in humans displaying the long-term histological findings of healing post tabularized incised plate urethroplasty.
