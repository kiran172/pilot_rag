Title: Relaxation-Enhanced Angiography Without Contrast and Triggering (REACT) for Fast Imaging of Extracranial Arteries in Acute Ischemic Stroke at 3 T.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate a novel flow-independent 3D isotropic REACT sequence compared with CE-MRA for the imaging of extracranial arteries in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 35 patients who underwent a stroke protocol at 3 T including REACT (fixed scan time: 2:46 min) and CE-MRA of the extracranial arteries. Three radiologists evaluated scans regarding vessel delineation, signal, and contrast and assessed overall image noise and artifacts using 5-point scales (5: excellent delineation/no artifacts). Apparent signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios (aSNR/aCNR) were measured for the common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA, C1 segment), and vertebral artery (V2 segment). Two radiologists graded the degree of proximal ICA stenosis.
RESULTS: Compared to REACT, CE-MRA showed better delineation for the CCA and ICA (C1 and C2 segments) (median 5, range 2-5 vs. 4, range 3-5; P < 0.05). For the ICA (C1 and C2 segments), REACT provided a higher signal (5, range 3-5; P < 0.05/4.5, range 3-5; P > 0.05 vs. 4, range 2-5) and contrast (5, range 3-5 vs. 4, range 2-5; P > 0.05) than CE-MRA. The remaining segments of the blood-supplying vessels showed equal medians. There was no significant difference regarding artifacts, whereas REACT provided significantly lower image noise (4, range 3-5 vs. 4 range 2-5; P < 0.05) with a higher aSNR (P < 0.05) and aCNR (P < 0.05) for all vessels combined. For clinically relevant (≥50%) ICA stenosis, REACT achieved a detection sensitivity of 93.75% and a specificity of 100%.
CONCLUSION: Given its fast acquisition, comparable image quality to CE-MRA and high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ICA stenosis, REACT was proven to be a clinically applicable method to assess extracranial arteries in AIS.
