Title: Association of postsystolic shortening on stress echocardiography and significant coronary artery stenosis: A single-centre retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postsystolic shortening (PSS) is one of the proposed quantitative measures to predict myocardial ischaemia in the stress echocardiographic (SE) evaluation. It is previously known that hypo-/akinesia (HA) correlates well with coronary stenosis. However, some patients undergoing SE only present with PSS, and their risk of significant coronary stenosis is less clear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between PSS and significant coronary stenosis compared with HA.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study at the hospital of S:t Görans, Stockholm, Sweden. All patients who underwent SE to investigate inducible ischaemia between 1 January 2018 and 15 October 2021 were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were normal SE and inconclusive test. Pathological SE were divided into two groups, patients with HA and those with PSS. Outcome was significant coronary artery stenosis visualized by invasive coronary angiography.
RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 108 patients (73 PSS, 35 HA). The presence of HA was associated with a higher risk of significant stenosis compared to those with PSS (63% vs. 23%, p < 0.001). This relationship was observed among males (p < 0.001), but not among females (p = 0.133). Nonsignificant stenosis trended to be more common among patients with PSS (21% vs. 6%, p = 0.053) CONCLUSIONS: The finding of PSS without HA was associated with a lower risk of significant coronary stenosis than HA. However, patients with PSS still often had nonsignificant coronary stenosis and PSS in the evaluation for nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) should be further investigated.
