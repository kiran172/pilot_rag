Title: [Contribution of coroscanner in chronic coronary syndrome].

Abstract: Cardiac division imaging by coroscanner has progressed a lot in 20 years to gradually become an important and potentially indispensable tool of chronic coronary cardiology. The European and American recommendations are Grade I for the assessment of symptomatic patients at intermediate to high risk, at the same level as traditional functional tests. The development of sophisticated post-treatment algorithms that apply the equations of fluid mechanics makes it possible to calculate an FFR value at any point from the CT image of the coronary artery. This FFR-CT is correctly correlated with invasive FFR compared to a threshold value of 0.80 and helps guide therapeutic choices. Thus, the coroscanner is a complement or an alternative to traditional functional tests and is positioned as a filter of access to coronary angiography, especially since it combines, from the same examination, a precise anatomical description, and a functional evaluation of the various possible lesions. Which is the Holy Grail of coronary cardiology.
