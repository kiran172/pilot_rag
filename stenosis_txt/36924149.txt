Title: [Complex congenital heart disease : about a case of Noonan syndrome].

Abstract: We present the case of a young girl in whom pre-natal echocardiography showed double outlet right ventricle associated with severe infundibular- and pulmonary valve stenosis. The genetic testing has shown a mutation on the LZTR1 gene, which confirms the diagnosis of a Noonan Syndrome, also present in the mother and an elder sister. The infant was born premature at 34 weeks and 5 days of gestational age. During the neonatal period, feeding difficulties are noted linked to oral aversion and exacerbated by difficulties in the mother-child bond. At 1 month of age, the child presented hypoxic spells caused by the infundibular stenosis which required emergency aorto-pulmonary anastomosis placement ensuring sufficient pulmonary blood flow. This anastomosis needed to be replaced by a larger one at 9th month of age. The child is now 4 years old and has undergone a complete surgical correction. The multidisciplinary management englobes not only follow up in cardiology, genetics, neurology, ophthalmology and hematology but also feeding support and psychomotor development support. The socio-economic precariousness of the family leads to a constant assistance to allow the best possible development of the child.
