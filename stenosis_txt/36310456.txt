Title: [Short-term effectiveness of unilateral biportal endoscopic transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for Meyerding degree Ⅰ or Ⅱ single-segment lumbar spondylolisthesis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the short-term effectiveness of unilateral biportal endoscopic transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (UBE-TLIF) in the treatment of Meyerding degree Ⅰ or Ⅱ single-segment lumbar spondylolisthesis.
METHODS: The clinical data of 26 patients with Meyerding degree Ⅰ or Ⅱ single-segment lumbar spondylolisthesis treated with UBE-TLIF between January 2021 and August 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, there were 10 males and 16 females with a mean age of 61.5 years (range, 35-76 years). The lesion segment included L <sub>3, 4</sub> in 2 cases, L <sub>4, 5</sub> in 18 cases, and L <sub>5</sub>, S <sub>1</sub> in 6 cases. There were 17 cases of degenerative spondylolisthesis and 9 cases of isthmic spondylolisthesis; according to the Meyerding classification of spondylolisthesis, 19 cases were grade Ⅰ and 7 cases were grade Ⅱ. Twenty-one cases were complicated with lumbar disc herniation and spinal stenosis and 5 cases with lumbar spinal stenosis. The operation time, hospitalization stay, complications, hemoglobin (Hb) and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels before operation and at 1 day after operation were recorded; lumbar lordosis angle changes and postoperative spondylolisthesis reduction were evaluated by lumbar anteroposterior and lateral X-ray films before operation and at last follow-up; visual analogue scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate the low back pain and leg pain before operation, at 2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks after operation, and at last follow-up; Oswestry disability index (ODI) was used to evaluate the functional recovery of the patients before operation and at last follow-up.
RESULTS: The operation was successfully completed in all 26 patients, with an average operation time of 181.9 minutes (range, 130-224 minutes) and an average hospitalization stay of 6.3 days (range, 3-9 days). Hb levels were significantly lower and serum CK levels were significantly higher at 1 day after operation when compared with those before operation ( t=7.594, P&lt;0.001; t=-15.647, P&lt;0.001). No serious complication occurred during and after operation. CT examination at 3 days after operation showed that the percutaneous screw was not in good position in 1 case, and nerve paralysis (pain, numbness) occurred in 2 cases after operation, which were improved within 2 weeks after operation. All the 26 patients were followed up 6-11 months, with an average of 8.7 months. Complete reduction (the slippage reduction rate was 100%) was achieved in 24 patients (92.3%), and partial reduction (the slippage reduction rate was 87.5%) in 2 patients (7.7%). During the follow-up, there was no complication such as incision infection, fusion Cage subsidence or displacement, and internal fixator loosening. The VAS scores of low back pain and leg pain significantly improved at each time point after operation when compared with those before operation ( P&lt;0.05); there was no significant difference in the VAS scores of low back pain and leg pain between at 2 days and 1 week after operation, the VAS scores of low back pain between at 1 week and 2 weeks after operation, and the VAS scores of leg pain between at 2 weeks after operation and last follow-up ( P&gt;0.05); but there was significant difference between the other time points after operation ( P&lt;0.05). ODI and lumbar lordosis angle significantly improved at last follow-up ( P&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: UBE-TLIF provides favorable short-term effectiveness and obvious advantages of minimally invasive in the treatment of Meyerding degree Ⅰ or Ⅱ single-segment lumbar spondylolisthesis. However, the safety and long-term effectiveness need to be further studied.
