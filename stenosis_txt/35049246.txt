Title: The clinical and neuroradiological features of patients of coexisting atraumatic convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage and large artery atherosclerosis stroke: A retrospective observational study.

Abstract: Atraumatic convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (c-SAH) concomitant with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke has been rarely discussed in the literature. Our aim in this study is to characterize the clinical and neuroradiological features of patients with LAA stroke and c-SAH.A retrospective study from a single institution was performed between January 2016 and June 2020. Only patients diagnosed with c-SAH and LAA stoke were included in this study. The clinical presentation and neuroimaging finding were summarized by our experienced neurologists.In total, 12 patients (8 men, 4 women), ranging in age from 45 to 75 years, were identified. All of them had cardiovascular risk factors and hypertension was the commonest (50%). Almost all patients presented hemiparesis (91.7%). Other clinical presentations included, dysarthria (41.7%), hemianesthesia (33.3%), facial palsy (33.3%), aphasia (16.7%), and cognitive impairment (8.3%). Internal border-zone (IBZ) infarction and cortical border-zone (CBZ) infarction occurred in 12 and 3 patients, respectively. c-SAH might occurred in different cortical sulcis. Percentages of frontal lobe, parietal lobe and fronto-parietal lobe were 41.7% (n = 5), 25% (n = 3) and 25% (n = 3), respectively. All ischemic lesions were ipsilateral to the sites of c-SAH. High-grade atherosclerotic stenosis of large artery was detected in all patients. The M1 segment of middle cerebral artery (MCA) is the second most common atherosclerotic artery after internal carotid artery (ICA).Our data suggest that LAA stroke is always ipsilateral to the site of c-SAH. Severe atherosclerotic changes can also been seen in the M1 segment of MCA apart from extracranial ICA. Moreover, border zone infarction may be a specific form of infarct when c-SAH is confronted with LAA stroke.
