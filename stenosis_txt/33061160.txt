Title: Minimally invasive and transcatheter approaches for mitral valve surgery.

Abstract: Mitral valve surgery has evolved through the ages, in response to prevalent epidemiology of mitral pathologies. In the modern era, advances in technology has allowed physicians to help a wider spectrum on increasingly sicker patients. This review summarises these advances and its associated evidence base for safety and efficacy.
