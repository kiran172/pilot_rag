Title: National and Provincial-Level Prevalence and Risk Factors of Carotid Atherosclerosis in Chinese Adults.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Epidemiologic studies on carotid atherosclerosis (CAS) based on nationwide ultrasonography measurements can contribute to understanding the future risk of cardiovascular diseases and identifying high-risk populations, thereby proposing more targeted prevention and treatment measures.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of CAS within the general population of China and to investigate its distribution among populations with potential risk factors and variation across diverse geographic regions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, population-based cross-sectional study used China's largest health check-up chain database to study 10 733 975 individuals aged 20 years or older from all 31 provinces in China who underwent check-ups from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Carotid atherosclerosis was assessed and graded using ultrasonography as increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), carotid plaque (CP), and carotid stenosis (CS). The overall and stratified prevalences were estimated among the general population and various subpopulations based on demographic characteristics, geographic regions, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Mixed-effects regression models were used to analyze the risk factors for CAS.
RESULTS: Among 10 733 975 Chinese participants (mean [SD] age, 47.7 [13.4] years; 5 861 566 [54.6%] male), the estimated prevalences were 26.2% (95% CI, 25.0%-27.4%) for increased cIMT, 21.0% (95% CI, 19.8%-22.2%) for CP, and 0.56% (95% CI, 0.36%-0.76%) for CS. The prevalence of all CAS grades was higher among older adults (eg, increased cIMT: aged ≥80 years, 92.7%; 95% CI, 92.2%-93.3%), male participants (29.6%; 95% CI, 28.4%-30.7%), those residing in northern China (31.0%; 95% CI, 29.1%-32.9%), and those who had comorbid conditions, such as hypertension (50.8%; 95% CI, 49.7%-51.9%), diabetes (59.0%; 95% CI, 57.8%-60.1%), dyslipidemia (32.1%; 95% CI, 30.8%-33.3%), and metabolic syndrome (31.0%; 95% CI, 29.1%-32.9%). Most cardiovascular disease risk factors were independent risk factors for all CAS stages (eg, hypertension: 1.60 [95% CI, 1.60-1.61] for increased cIMT, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.62-1.63] for CP, and 1.48 [95% CI, 1.45-1.51] for CS). Moreover, the magnitude of the association between several cardiovascular disease risk factors and increased cIMT and CP differed between the sexes and geographic regions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that nearly one-quarter of Chinese adults have increased cIMT or CP. The burden of this disease is unevenly distributed across geographic regions and subpopulations and may require different levels of local planning, support, and management. Addressing these disparities is crucial for effectively preventing and managing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in China.
