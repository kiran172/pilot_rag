Title: [Relationship between the features of venous drainage of supratentorial arteriovenous malformations and the risk of intracranial hemorrhage].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage is the most common complication of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). In recent years, most studies devoted to the features of AVM functioning consider venous drainage as important factor influencing the rupture of malformation.
OBJECTIVE: To review the literature data on the relationship between the features of venous drainage of cerebral arteriovenous malformations and intracranial hemorrhage.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We found 43 studies discussing the features of AVM venous drainage for the period from 1982 to 2020. Most of reports were published between 2005 and 2020.
RESULTS: Deep venous drainage and a single drainage vein were the most significant factors influencing the risk of hemorrhage. Venous ectasia, reflux, stenosis, number, length and tortuosity of drainage veins were less important for the risk of AVM rupture.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of the features of AVM venous drainage can make it possible to predict the natural course of disease and risk of intracranial hemorrhage. These aspects are essential for neurosurgical treatment.
