Title: A Propensity-Matched National Analysis of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Outcome in Patients With Gastrointestinal Bleeding.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is often observed in severe aortic stenosis, which can be attributed to the presence of arteriovenous malformations and von Willebrand's factor deficiency. GI is one of the most common complications in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The outcome of the TAVI procedure with GI bleeding is unknown. We performed an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision-based national cohort analysis using the national readmission database from 2016 to 2020. We compared cardiovascular outcomes, mortality, and readmission rates of patients with TAVI who developed GI bleeding compared with those who had no GI bleeding. A total of 320,353 hospitalizations with TAVI were identified from the year 2016 to 2020. Patients with TAVI with GI bleeding were 6,193.37 and without GI bleeding were 314,160. The median age of the patients with TAVI with GI or without GI bleeding was 80. GI bleed patients had statistically significantly higher readmission rates at 30, 90, and 180 days and they had higher odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.37 to 7.52; p <0.0001), acute kidney injury (aOR = 5.22; 95% CI:4.75 to 5.74; p <0.0001), stroke (aOR = 2.83; 95% CI 2.05 to 3.91 p:0.0001, postprocedural bleeding (aOR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.35 to 2.30; p:0.0001), cardiac tamponade (aOR = 2.54; 95% CI 1.86 to 3.49; p <0.0001), use of mechanical circulatory support (aOR: 5.33; 95% CI:4.13 to 6.86; p <0.0001), and heart failure (aOR:1.73; 95%CI: 1.54 to 1.94; p <0.0001). The total cost of hospitalization and length of stay was higher in the GI bleed group. Patients with TAVI with GI bleeding have worse clinical outcomes and higher in-hospital mortality and readmission rates compared with patients with no GI bleeding.
