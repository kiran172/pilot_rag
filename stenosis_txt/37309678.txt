Title: Single-Stage Procedure of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair Under Local Anaesthesia and Percutaneous Access.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are observed in 6% of patients with concomitant aortic valve stenosis (AS) requiring aortic valve replacement. Optimal management of these concomitant pathologies is still debated.
CASE REPORT: An 80-year-old man presented with acute heart failure due to a severe AS. Past medical history included AAA under regular surveillance. A thoracic and abdominal computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed a 6 mm increase of AAA over an 8-month period (max 55 mm). A multidisciplinary team prescribed a simultaneous endovascular approach of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) followed by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) under local anaesthesia with bilateral femoral percutaneous access. No intra or post-procedural complications were registered; technical success was confirmed by completion angiography and post-operative ultrasound. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5. A 2-month post-operative CTA confirmed ongoing technical success.
CONCLUSION: Combined TAVI and EVAR under local anaesthesia for AS and AAA was associated with reduced hospital stay and technical success at 2 months from intervention in this case report.
