Title: Research on alginate-polyacrylamide enhanced amnion hydrogel, a potential vascular substitute material.

Abstract: Although traditional synthetic vascular grafts have good mechanical stability, stenosis and even thrombus can be easily caused at the beginning of transplantation due to the material's procoagulant and low cell adhesion rate. In order to address these problems, by combining acellular amnion gel and polyacrylamide-alginate gel, we gained a composite hydrogel with high elasticity, mechanical stability, high bioactivity and low swelling ratio. The results showed that the composite gel had excellent mechanical strength, resistance to enzymatic degradation and anti-calcification ability. Also, it could significantly inhibit the adhesion, aggregation and activation of platelet and hemolysis. What is more, this composite hydrogel could significantly promote the adhesion and proliferation of ECs, as well as inducing the migration of ECs to the surface of the hydrogel. It could also stimulate the secretion of NO and PGI<sub>2</sub> from seeded HUVECs, which were important factors involved in vascular remodelling and repair. All the results indicated that prepared AlgSr/PAM-AM hydrogel was an excellent biomaterial with properties for potential use in vascular repair.
