Title: Measurement of mitral valve area by direct three dimensional planimetry compared to multiplanar reconstruction in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.

Abstract: Mitral valve area (MVA) measurement by three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D-TEE) has a crucial role in the evaluation of mitral stenosis (MS) severity. Three-dimensional direct (3D-direct) planimetry has been proposed as a new technique to measure mitral valve area. This study aimed to compare the 3D-direct mitral valve planimetry to conventional three-dimensional multiplanar reconstruction (3D-MPR) in severe MS using 3D-TEE. In this cross-sectional, prospective study; 149 patients with severe MS who were referred for transesophageal echocardiography in Shahid Madani Hospital (Tabriz Iran), just before percutaneous transmitral commissurotomy (PTMC), recruited consecutively. All patients underwent 2D transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE) and 3D-TEE in a single session before PTMC. During 2D-TTE planimetry, pressure half time (PHT), and proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) were applied to measure the MVA. Transmitral mean pressure gradient (MPG) was measured. During 3D-TEE, MVA planimetry was carried out with both 3D-direct and 3D-MPR methods. 3D-direct was applied from both atrial and ventricular views. The consistency of MVA measurements with 3D-direct, 3D-MPR, and 2D-TTE methods was statistically investigated. Our sample consisted of 109 (73.2%) women and 40 (26.8%) men. The mean age was 51.75 ± 9.81 years. The agreement between 3D-direct and 3D-MPR planimetry was significant and moderate (0.99 ± 0.29 cm2 vs. 1.12 ± 0.26 cm2, intraclass correlation = 0.716, p value = 0.001).The accuracy of the 3D-direct method reduced significantly compared to the MPR method at MVA &gt; 1.5 cm2. The maximum difference between two methods was observed in cases with MVAs larger than 1.5 cm2. MVA measured with the 3D-MPR method was significantly correlated with a 2D-TTE method, with a moderate agreement (intraclass correlation = 0.644, p value = 0.001). Also, 2D-TTE and 3D-direct TEE techniques yielded significantly consistent measurements of the MVA (1.06 ± 0.026 cm2 vs. 0.99 ± 0.29 cm2, intraclass correlation = 0.787, p value = 0.001); however, with a slight overestimation of the MVA by the former with a net difference of 0.06 ± 0.013 cm2. Mitral valve pressure gradient (MPG) had no significant correlation with planimetry results. A significant inverse correlation was seen between the MVA and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure. 3D-direct planimetry has an acceptable agreement with 3D-MPR planimetry at MVA less than 1.5 cm2, but their correlation decreases significantly at MVA above 1.5 cm2. 3D-direct planimetry underestimates MVA compared to 3D-MPR, especially at MVA above 1.5 cm2. It seems that the saddle shape of mitral valve, interferes with 3D-direct measurement of commissures at moderate MS. The 2D-TTE planimetry has generally acceptable accuracy, but its correlation to the 3D-TEE methods is significantly reduced in cases with moderate to severe MS (i.e. MVA &gt; 1.0 cm2).
