Title: Lipoprotein(a) as Part of the Diagnosis of Clinical Familial Hypercholesterolemia.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia have very high risk of cardiovascular disease due to lifelong elevations in LDL cholesterol. Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and aortic valve stenosis. It has been proposed to include elevated lipoprotein(a) in the diagnosis of clinical familial hypercholesterolemia.
RECENT FINDINGS: Lipoprotein(a) is co-measured in LDL cholesterol, and up to one-quarter of all diagnoses of clinical familial hypercholesterolemia are due to high levels of lipoprotein(a). Further, individuals with both familial hypercholesterolemia and elevated lipoprotein(a) have an extremely high risk of myocardial infarction. We discuss the background for familial hypercholesterolemia and elevated lipoprotein(a) as risk factors for cardiovascular disease and the consequences of the fact that LDL cholesterol measurements/calculations include the cholesterol present in lipoprotein(a). Finally, we discuss the potential of including lipoprotein(a) as part of the diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia and in consequence possible treatments.
