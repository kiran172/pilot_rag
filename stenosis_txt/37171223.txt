Title: Current status and future trends of reconstructing a vascularized tissue-engineered trachea.

Abstract: Alternative treatment of long tracheal defects remains one of the challenges faced by thoracic surgeons. Tissue engineering has shown great potential in addressing this regenerative medicine conundrum and the technology to make tracheal grafts using this technique is rapidly maturing, leading to unique therapeutic approaches. However, the clinical application of tissue-engineered tracheal implants is limited by insufficient revascularization. Among them, realizing the vascularization of a tissue-engineered trachea is the most challenging problem to overcome. To achieve long-term survival after tracheal transplantation, an effective blood supply must be formed to support the metabolism of seeded cells and promote tissue healing and regeneration. Otherwise, repeated infection, tissue necrosis, lumen stenosis lack of effective epithelialization, need for repeated bronchoscopy after surgery, and other complications will be inevitable and lead to graft failure and a poor outcome. Here we review and analyze various tissue engineering studies promoting angiogenesis in recent years. The general situation of reconstructing a vascularized tissue-engineered trachea, including current problems and future development trends, is elaborated from the perspectives of seed cells, scaffold materials, growth factors and signaling pathways, surgical interventions in animal models and clinical applications. This review also provides ideas and methods for the further development of better biocompatible tracheal substitutes in the future.
