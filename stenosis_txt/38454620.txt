Title: The Ross-Konno Procedure With or Without Mitral Valve Surgery: A Systematic Review With Individual Data Pooling.

Abstract: Background: The Ross-Konno procedure is a technically demanding surgical option to treat multilevel left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Methods: A systematic review with pooled analyses was conducted according to PRISMA criteria on studies published between January 2000 and May 2022 that assessed outcomes following the Ross-Konno intervention in children. Individual patient data were extracted from published Kaplan-Meier curves using digitalization software. Overall survival and freedom from reintervention were assessed by time-to-event approaches. Determinants of one-year survival were investigated by meta-regression analyses. Results: Ten studies with a total population of 274 patients were included. The overall pooled early (≤30 days) survival rate was 86.9% (95% CI [87.6%-78.4%]). Five-year survival rates in patients without and with (N = 50 [18.2%] of 274 total patients) concomitant mitral valve surgery were 82.5% (95% CI [87.6%-77.4%]) versus 56.1% (95% CI [74.1%-38.1%]), hazard ratio 2.67, 95% CI (1.44-4.93), P &lt; .0001. Five- and ten-year freedom from pulmonary autograft reoperation rates were 93.5% and 90.9%, respectively. Five- and ten-year freedom from right ventricular outflow tract reoperation rates were 74.3% and 57.3%, respectively. By meta-regression analysis, resection of endocardial fibroelastosis (N = 32 [11.7%] of 274 total patients) was associated with superior one-year survival (P = .027). Conclusion: The Ross-Konno procedure is associated with substantial early mortality and gradual attrition thereafter. Mortality is higher in patients with concomitant mitral valve surgery. Resection of endocardial fibroelastosis is associated with superior survival. Right ventricular outflow tract reinterventions are common.
