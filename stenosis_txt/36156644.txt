Title: [Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with conscious sedation and early discharge. Report of seven cases].

Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic generated multiple challenges for the health system. Cardiovascular disease is associated with a worse prognosis of infections. Moreover, most hospital resources and operative rooms were destined to patients with COVID-19 infection, deferring the treatment of most valvular patients requiring surgery. We report seven patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with conscious sedation and early discharge. No patient required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation. After a 90-day follow-up, there were no complications or unplanned readmissions.
