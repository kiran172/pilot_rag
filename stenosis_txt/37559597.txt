Title: Current use of extracorporeal life support in airway surgery: a narrative review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is widely used in patients with severe respiratory or cardiocirculatory failure. The most commonly used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) modes are veno-venous (V-V) and veno-arterial (V-A) ECMO, which can both be achieved by various types of vascular cannulation. Within the scope of tracheobronchial surgery, intraoperative ECLS may occasionally be necessary to provide sufficient oxygenation to a patient throughout a procedure, especially when conventional ventilation strategies are limited. Additionally, V-A ECMO can provide cardiopulmonary support in emergencies and in cases where hemodynamic instability can occur.
METHODS: This narrative literature review was carried out to identify the use and the specifics of ECLS in airway surgery over the last years. Data from 168 cases were summarized according to the indication for surgery and the mode of ECLS (V-V, V-A).
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: The most common tracheobronchial pathologies in which support was needed were: primary malignant disease of the airways, malignant infiltration, tracheal stenosis, injury of the airway, and congenital airway disease. With increasing experience in ECLS, the number of reported cases performed with intraoperative ECLS increased steadily over the last decade.
CONCLUSIONS: A trend favoring the use of V-V ECMO over V-A ECMO was identified. These approaches should now be considered indispensable tools for managing challenging surgical cases.
