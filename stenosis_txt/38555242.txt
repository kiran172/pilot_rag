Title: Sex differences in the association of the uric acid to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio with coronary artery disease risk among Chinese nondialysis patients with CKD stages 3-5.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evidence has indicated that serum uric acid (UA) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are positively and negatively associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). The UA to HDL-C ratio (UHR) has recently drawn attention as a new predictor for metabolic syndrome, inflammation and atherosclerosis. However, the association between the UHR and CAD in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is still unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed 733 nondialysis patients with CKD stage 3-5 who received their first coronary artery angiography (CAG), including 510 participants with CAD. All laboratory indicators were collected within one week before CAG. The median UHR of CAD and non-CAD patients was 15.52% and 12.29%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, female patients with a high UHR were 4.7 times more at risk of CAD than those with a lower UHR. Meanwhile, the positive association of the UHR with the severity of coronary artery stenosis (CAS) persisted significantly in female CAD subjects but not in males. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for CAD and severe CAS. The area under the curve (AUC) for the UHR was higher than that for UA and HDL-C alone in female patients [UHR (AUC): 0.715 for CAD and 0.716 for severe CAS].
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated UHR was independently related to an increased CAD risk and the severity of CAS in nondialysis female patients with CKD stage 3-5, and was more predictive of the onset of CAD and the severity of CAS than UA or HDL-C alone.
