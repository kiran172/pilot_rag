Title: Primary lumbar decompression using ultrasonic bone curette compared to conventional technique.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The ultrasonic bone curette (Bone Scalpel) is a novel technique in neurosurgery for bony dissection. This study aimed to evaluate its use against conventional techniques for primary lumbar decompression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort comparison, using Spine Tango Registry data. All patients undergoing a primary procedure for lumbar decompression secondary to degenerative disease during a 2-year period (2014-2016) were identified, split into age and gender matched cohorts utilising either bone scalpel or conventional techniques intra-operatively.
RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified within each cohort, which did not differ significantly in terms of age, gender, BMI, number of operative vertebral levels or seniority of the principal surgeon. The incidence of intra-operative blood loss &gt;100 ml was significantly reduced within the bone scalpel cohort (16.1% bone scalpel, 34.4% conventional, p = 0.04). There was no difference in the incidence of iatrogenic dural breach (9.7% bone scalpel, 16.1% conventional, p = 0.27). There was no significant difference in pre-operative Core Outcomes Measures Index (COMI) between the cohorts (7.91 bone scalpel, 8.02 conventional, p = 0.67) and both cohorts demonstrated a significant reduction in mean COMI at 24 months (bone scalpel p = 0.004, conventional p = &lt;0.001). No difference in mean COMI existed between either cohort at any point across the 24-month post-operative period (p = 0.18).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of ultrasonic bone curette for primary lumbar decompression is associated with reduced intra-operative blood loss compared to conventional techniques, alongside a comparable safety profile and equivalent patient reported outcomes.
