Title: Reconstruction of aortic valve by autologous pericardium (Ozaki's procedure): Single center experience in Vietnam.

Abstract: AIM: We aimed to report the experience of aortic valve reconstruction with autologous pericardium using Ozaki's procedure in Vietnam.
METHODS: The study included consecutive patients with isolated aortic valve disease who underwent Ozaki's procedure in our hospital between June 2017 and August 2019. Aortic valve leaflets were reconstructed with autologous pericardium using Ozaki's procedure.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included (mean age 55.8 years; 41 were male): 24 with aortic stenosis, 17 with aortic regurgitation, and 20 with both. Of the 61 patients, 16 had a bicuspid aortic valve, and 5 had infective endocarditis. The preoperative peak and mean gradient pressure gradients were 91.7 ± 16.1 mm Hg and 55.3 ± 10.3 mm Hg, respectively. Surgery was performed via a full or partial sternotomy. The procedure was successful in 59 cases. Two patients were converted to prosthetic valve replacement. The aortic crossclamp time was 110.9 ± 20.5 minutes. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed a mean pressure gradient of 8 ± 2 mm Hg and an aortic valve area of 3.04 ± 0.44 cm2. The mean follow-up period was 18.5 ± 5.7 months. One patient died in hospital due to cardiac tamponade. One patient underwent reoperation due to infective endocarditis 6 months after surgery. Another died at 8 months after surgery due to a mediastinal abscess. The surviving patients had no aortic regurgitation or mild aortic regurgitation at the last follow-up visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve reconstruction with autologous pericardium provided good outcomes in our study.
