Title: Radiation-induced damage in the upper gastrointestinal tract: clinical presentation, diagnostic tests and treatment options.

Abstract: Radiation-induced damage of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract results from radiation of GI tumors or structures adjacent to the GI tract. Radiation-induced damages of the upper GI tract may be acute or delayed, and ranges from lack of appetite, mucosal inflammation (i.e. esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis) to ulcers, which may be complicated by perforation, penetration, bleeding and stenosis. Radiation-related factors as well as individual patient predisposing factors may increase susceptibility to post-radiation damage. High quality evidence for the treatment of radiation-induced GI damage is scarce and the management is often extrapolated from studies on GI lesions of different etiology. Treatment depends on severity and localization of the radiation-induced damage, and ranges from supportive and dietary measures to endoscopic interventions or surgery. Modern radiation techniques may decrease the incidence and severity of the radiation-induced upper gastrointestinal disease.
