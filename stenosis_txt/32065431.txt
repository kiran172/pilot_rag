Title: Extra-anatomic aortic bypass with aortic-, mitral-, and tricuspid surgery in a 53-year old: A single-stage approach for complex coarctation associated with triple valve pathology.

Abstract: Coarctation is rare in patients over 50 years of age; however, if present, it can be associated with complex intracardiac pathologies and represent a formidable surgical challenge. Herein, we report a single-stage approach for surgical repair of coarctation associated with aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve pathology using an ascending-to-descending aortic bypass with posterior pericardial access.
