Title: Primary pelvic exenteration: Our experience with 23 patients from a single institution.

Abstract: This study was designed with an aim to share our experience of primary pelvic exenterations. The study included 23 patients with different types of pelvic cancer enrolled at a single institution between November 2011 and July 2020. The patient mean age was 55 years (range, 43-72 years) and the oncological indications included: Stage IVa cervical cancer (11 cases, 48.9%), stage IVa endometrial cancer (1 case, 4.3%), stage IVa vaginal cancer (6 cases, 26%), stage IIIb bladder cancer (3 cases, 13%), stage IIIc rectal cancer (1 case, 4.3%) and undifferentiated pelvic sarcoma (1 case, 4.3%). Total, anterior, and posterior pelvic exenterations were performed on 34.4, 56.5 and 13% of cases, respectively. Related to levator ani muscle, 13 (56.5%) pelvic exenterations were supralevatorian, 10 (43.5%) infralevatorian, and 5 (21.7%) were infralevatorian with vulvectomy. No major intraoperative complications occurred. Seven patients (30.5%) developed early complications, 4 of them (17.4%) required reoperation and 1 (4.3%) perioperative death caused by a pulmonary embolism was recorded. Only 1 patient experienced a late complication, a urostomy stenosis. Over a median follow-up period of 35 months, 8 (34.8%) patients died. The median overall survival (OS) was 33 months (range, 1-96 months). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were 72 and 66%, respectively. Primary pelvic exenteration may be related with various postoperative complications, without high perioperative morality and with long-term survival.
