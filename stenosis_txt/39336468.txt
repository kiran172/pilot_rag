Title: Early Experiences of Serbian Surgeons Using No-Touch Technique for Vein Conduits in CABG Patients: A Follow-Up Study with Multi-Slice CT Angiography.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: The saphenous vein graft (SVG) remains the most frequently used conduit worldwide, despite its common disadvantage of early graft failure. To solve the problem and reduce the SVG damage, Souza implemented a new technique where a vein is harvested with surrounding fascia and fat tissue (the so-called no-touch technique). Materials and Methods. A prospective study conducted from February 2019 to June 2024 included 23 patients who underwent myocardial revascularization using a no-touch vein, with follow-up control examinations using computed tomographic angiography to detect graft stenosis or occlusion. Results. Of the entire patient group, 17 (73.9%) were male, with a mean age of 67.39 ± 7.71 years. The mean follow-up period was 25 months. There were no major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) during hospitalization, although one patient died in the hospital. Another patient died due to malignancy, but no MACCEs occurred during the follow-up period. According to multi-slice CT coronary angiography, the results were impeccable, with an astonishing 100% patency observed in all 20 IMA grafts and 58 no-touch SVGs examined. Conclusions. The excellent patency rate during the early follow-up period confirmed that the no-touch technique is a good option for surgical revascularization.
