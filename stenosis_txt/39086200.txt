Title: [Single Center Experience in Surgical Treatment of Extracranial Supra-Aortic Aneurysms].

Abstract: Objective To evaluate the effect of surgical treatment on extracranial supra-aortic aneurysms and summarize the experience. Methods The clinical data of 10 patients undergoing surgical treatment of extracranial supra-aortic aneurysms from May 2019 to November 2023 in the Department of Vascular Surgery of Beijing Tiantan Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University were collected.The 10 patients included 5 patients with internal carotid artery aneurysm,2 patients with subclavian artery aneurysm,2 patients with vertebral artery aneurysm,and 1 patient with internal carotid artery aneurysm combined with ipsilateral subclavian artery aneurysm.The surgical indications,surgical regimens,clinical efficacy,and complications were retrospectively analyzed. Results All the 10 patients underwent surgery successfully,with the surgery duration range of 60-420 min and the median surgery duration of 180.0 (121.5,307.5) min.Intraoperative bleeding volume varied within 30-400 mL,with a median of 90 (50,125) mL.The time of carotid artery blocking and vertebral artery blocking varied within the ranges of 10-20 min and 20-30 min,with the medians of 15.0 (11.5,16.3) min and 25.0 (15.0,22.5) min,respectively.No cardiac accident,cerebral infarction,or cerebral hemorrhage occurred during the perioperative period.The 10 patients were followed up for 3-58 months,with the median follow-up time of 8.5 (5.3,17.0) months.One patient with subclavian artery aneurysm developed artificial vessel occlusion 20 months after surgery.One patient with internal carotid artery aneurysm developed distal carotid artery stenosis 6 months after surgery. Conclusion Surgical treatment should be actively adopted for extracranial supra-aortic aneurysms,and individualized surgical regimens should be designed according to patient conditions.
