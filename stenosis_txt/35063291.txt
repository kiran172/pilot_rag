Title: Myocardial Strain Imaging With Electrocardiogram-Gated and Coherent Compounding for Early Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: Myocardial elastography (ME) is an ultrasound-based technique that uses radiofrequency signals for 2-D cardiac motion tracking and strain imaging at a high frame rate. Early diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for timely treatment and improvement of patient outcome. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of ME radial and circumferential strains in the detection and characterization of CAD in patients. In this study, 86 patients suspected of CAD were imaged with ME prior to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). End-systolic radial and circumferential left ventricular strains were estimated in all patients in each of their perfusion territories: left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA). ME radial strains were capable of differentiating the obstructive CAD group (55.3 ± 29.8%) from the non-obstructive CAD (72.5 ± 46.8%, p < 0.05) and no CAD groups (73.4 ± 30.4%, p < 0.05) in the RCA territory. ME circumferential strains were capable of differentiating the obstructive CAD group (-3.1 ± 7.5%) from the non-obstructive CAD (-7.2 ± 6.8%, p < 0.05) and normal (-6.9 ± 8.0%, p < 0.05) groups in the LAD territory and to differentiate the normal group (-17.1 ± 8.2%) from the obstructive (-12.8 ± 7.2%, p < 0.05) and non-obstructive CAD (-13.6 ± 8.5%, p < 0.05) groups in the RCA territory. ME circumferential strain performed better than ME radial strain in differentiating normal, non-obstructive and obstructive perfusion territories. In the LCX territory, both ME radial and circumferential strains decreased when the level of stenosis was higher. However, it was not statistically significant. The findings presented herein indicate that ME radial and circumferential estimation obtained from ECG-gated and compounded acquisitions is a promising tool for early, non-invasive and radiation-free detection of CAD in patients.
