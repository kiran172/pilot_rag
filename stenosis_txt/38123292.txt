Title: Transplant Hepatic Artery Complications.

Abstract: Hepatic artery complications can be divided into 2 different categories, nonocclusive and steno-occlusive disease. Steno-occlusive disease is a collective term that encompasses hepatic artery thrombosis, hepatic artery stenosis, and hepatic arterial kinks, while nonocclusive arterial disease encompasses less than 5% of complications and is a collective term used to describe arteriovenous fistulae, pseudoaneurysms, arterial rupture and nonocclusive hepatic artery hypoperfusion syndrome. This article details the angiographic techniques and definitions needed to accurately diagnose arterial transplant complications and describes the technical aspects and results of endoluminal management of these arterial complications. In addition, this article discusses the presentation, etiology and indications for treatment, including surgical management of these various complications.
