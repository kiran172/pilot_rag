Title: Role of circulating mitochondria in venous thrombosis in glioblastoma.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) develop deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary emboli. Cell-free circulating mitochondria increase after brain injury and are associated with coagulopathy.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated whether mitochondria play a role in the GBM-induced hypercoagulable state.
METHODS: We examined the correlation between cell-free circulating mitochondria and venous thrombosis in patients with GBM and the impact of mitochondria on venous thrombosis in mice with inferior vena cava stenosis.
RESULTS: Using plasma samples of 82 patients with GBM, we found that patients with GBM had a higher number of mitochondria in their plasma (GBM with venous thromboembolism [VTE],: 2.8 × 107 mitochondria/mL; GBM without VTE, 1.9 × 107 mitochondria/mL) than that in healthy control subjects (n = 17) (0.3 × 107 mitochondria/mL). Interestingly, patients with GBM and VTE (n = 41) had a higher mitochondria concentration than patients with GBM without VTE (n = 41). In a murine model of inferior vena cava stenosis, intravenous delivery of mitochondria resulted in an increased rate of venous thrombosis compared with that in controls (70% and 28%, respectively). Mitochondria-induced venous thrombi were neutrophil-rich and contained more platelets than those in control thrombi. Furthermore, as mitochondria are the only source of cardiolipin in circulation, we compared the concentration of anticardiolipin immunoglobulin G in plasma samples of patients with GBM and found a higher concentration in patients with VTE (optical density, 0.69 ± 0.04) than in those without VTE (optical density, 0.51 ± 0.04).
CONCLUSION: We concluded that mitochondria might play a role in the GBM-induced hypercoagulable state. We propose that quantifying circulating mitochondria or anticardiolipin antibody concentrations in patients with GBM might identify patients at increased risk of VTE.
