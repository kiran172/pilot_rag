Title: Repair of pulmonary artery sling with tracheal and intracardiac defects.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary artery sling is commonly associated with tracheal stenosis and intracardiac anomalies. While surgical repair is standardized, coexistent anomalies often determine outcomes. With the paucity of risk stratification, this study aimed to review our experience and stratify risk factors for the surgical outcome of complex pulmonary artery sling repair in the presence of airway or intracardiac lesions.
METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive children with pulmonary artery sling were evaluated retrospectively following surgical repair. Median age at surgery was 5 months (interquartile range 3-9). Surgical approaches included pulmonary artery sling alone (n = 10), pulmonary artery sling with tracheoplasty (n = 41), and pulmonary artery sling with both intracardiac and tracheal surgery (n = 28).
RESULTS: There were 7 early (8.8%) deaths. Two patients after left pulmonary artery reimplantation needed revision of the anastomosis. The median intensive care and hospital stay were 11 (interquartile range 9.2-24.8) and 17.9 (interquartile range 4.3-19.8) days, and considerably longer when associated tracheal surgery (p = 0.002). Follow-up was complete in 66/69 and 3 (3.8%) children died late: 2.7, 10.2, and 17 months after surgery. Univariate analysis showed abnormal lung and coexisting structural heart disease as risk factors. Multivariate analysis revealed total cardiopulmonary bypass time as an independent predictor of overall mortality.
CONCLUSION: Complex pulmonary artery sling repair can be performed with a good surgical outcomes even when associated with airway malformations or structural heart diseases. Lung abnormality and longer cardiopulmonary bypass time as a surrogate marker of complex surgery, are possible risk factors.
