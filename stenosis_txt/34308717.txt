Title: Covered Stent Placement for Subclavian Vein Stenosis Associated With Basilic Arteriovenous Fistula.

Abstract: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation is used to palliate complex cyanotic heart diseases. We report an adult patient with AVF creation who subsequently developed severe left subclavian vein stenosis, causing significant left arm swelling. Covered stent placement successfully treated the venous stenosis, resulting in the normalization of his left arm swelling.
