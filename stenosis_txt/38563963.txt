Title: Midterm follow-up after embolization of intracranial aneurysms proximal to the circle of Willis with the Silk Vista flow diverter: the I-MAMA registry.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this registry was to assess technical success, procedural safety and mid- to long-term follow-up results of the Silk Vista "Mama" (SVM) flow diverter (BALT, Montmorency, France) for the treatment of proximal intracranial aneurysms.
METHODS: Between August 2020 and March 2022, data from nine Italian neurovascular centres were collected. Data included patients' clinical presentation, aneurysms' size, location and status, technical details, overall complications and mid- to long-term angiographic follow-up.
RESULTS: Forty-eight aneurysms in 48 patients were treated using the SVM. Most aneurysms were small (≤ 10 mm: no. 29, 60%) and unruptured (no. 31, 65%); 13 aneurysms were recurrent after coiling or clipping. 37/48 aneurysms involved the internal carotid artery (77%). Optimal opening and complete wall apposition of the device were achieved in 46 out of 48 cases (96%). Four intra- or periprocedural complications occurred (two thrombotic complications successfully resolved, one cerebellar ischemia, one perirenal hematoma), without new neurological deficit. No significant intra-stent stenosis or stent displacement was observed during follow-up. No FD-related morbidity nor mortality was reported. At midterm (6-12 months) to long-term (> 12 months) follow-up, complete aneurysm occlusion (OKM D) was achieved in 76% of cases. Eighty-eight percent of patients had complete aneurysm occlusion or entry remnant (OKM D + C).
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that the new generation of low-profile SVM flow diverter for the treatment of proximal intracranial aneurysms is safe and effective, with low rates of intraprocedural complications and acceptable mid- to long-term occlusion rate.
