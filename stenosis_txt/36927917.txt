Title: [A Case of Strangulated Bowel Obstruction after a Laparoscopic Hartmann's Operation for Rectal Cancer].

Abstract: A 98-year-old woman presented with hematochezia and a circumferential type 2 tumor in the rectum Rb identified on fiberoscopy. We a performed laparoscopic Hartmann's operation and D2 lymphadenectomy for advanced rectal cancer. A sigmoid colostomy was created via the intraperitoneal route. On the postoperative day 12, the patient experienced abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed that the small intestine formed a closed loop in the pelvic space. The patient was diagnosed with a strangulated bowel obstruction of the small intestine for which an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. The small intestine, which had passed through a defect between the lifted sigmoid colon and the left abdominal wall, was strangulated by the lifted sigmoid colon. We performed partial resection of the small intestine. The patient died on postoperative day 32 of acute deterioration of aortic valve stenosis. There have been few reports of strangulated bowel obstruction resulting from internal hernia associated with colostomy. These findings demonstrate that it is important to select the appropriate route for colostomy creation in each case.
