Title: Impact of Sex on Mortality in Patients Undergoing Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the second most common valvular heart disease in the United States. Although the prevalence of AS does not significantly differ between the sexes, there is some controversy on whether sex differences affect the long-term mortality of patients with severe AS undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 917 patients (female, n = 424 [46.2%]) with severe AS who had undergone isolated SAVR at a tertiary care center between January 2005 and December 2018. During a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 74 (15.0%) male patients and 41 (9.7%) female patients died. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the 10-year mortality rate was significantly higher in male than female patients (24.7% vs. 17.9%, log-rank p = 0.005). In the sequential Cox proportional hazard regression model for assessing long-term mortality up to 10 years post-surgery, the adjusted hazard ratio of male sex for mortality was 1.93 (95% confidence interval, 1.28-2.91; p = 0.002). The association between male sex and postoperative long-term mortality was not significantly diminished by any demographic or clinical factor in subgroup analyses. In conclusion, female sex was significantly associated with better long-term survival in patients with severe AS undergoing SAVR.
