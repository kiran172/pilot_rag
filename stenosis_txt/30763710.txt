Title: Comparative Analysis Using Propensity Score Matching Analysis: Primary Closure versus Patch Angioplasty During Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary closure (PC) and patch angioplasty (PA) during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have been disputed in many studies. Some studies announced that PC is associated with a higher restenosis rate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of PC and PA using propensity score matching (PSM).
METHODS: Between November 1994 and October 2016, 1,044 patients underwent primary CEA procedures at our institution and were retrospectively analyzed. The study endpoints included rates of ipsilateral stroke, any clinical stroke, cranial nerve palsy, hematoma, bleeding warranting repeat surgery within 30 postoperative days. We also investigated the restenosis rates, overall survival, stenosis-free survival, and stroke-free survival during follow-up (median follow-up 37.1 months).
RESULTS: This study includes 435 cases of PC and 476 cases of PA. After PSM analysis, baseline characteristics (age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, atrial fibrillation, previous percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting, contralateral carotid occlusion, degree of carotid stenosis, and symptomatic status within 6 months) were balanced. Finally, 377 pairs of matched cases were analyzed. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences between the 2 groups in ipsilateral stroke (P = 0.45), clinical stroke (P = 0.75), cranial nerve palsy (P = 1), hematoma (P = 0.18), bleeding which required reoperation (P = 0.12) within 30 postoperative days, and restenosis rates during follow-up (P = 0.16). In addition, there were no differences between the 2 groups during follow-up in overall, stroke-free, and restenosis-free survival with P values of 0.136, 0.07, and 0.06, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the analysis using PSM, there were no significant differences between PC and PA closure during CEA in perioperative and long-term outcomes.
