Title: Impact of routine use of a cerebral protection device on the TAVR procedure and its short-term outcomes: a single-centre experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major concern in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The introduction of a cerebral protection devices may counteract the evolution towards minimally invasive TAVR. At this time, there is insufficient data to support the routine use of these devices.
METHODS: We aimed to evaluate the outcome of the routine use of the Sentinel Cerebral protection system® (CPS) in patients undergoing TAVR, after completing a CT-based screening process for feasibility of Sentinel implantation. We report our initial experience with the routine implementation of the Sentinel CPS in all anatomically suitable patients undergoing TAVR. We retrospectively compared the procedural characteristics and outcomes between all TAVR patients treated with (n = 78) and without (n = 79) intended Sentinel.
RESULTS: The Sentinel CPS could successfully be deployed in 99% of intended cases after CT feasibility screening. TAVR procedures with Sentinel CPS were not longer than procedures without Sentinel use (89 ± 20 versus 120 ± 50 min, p = 0.007). Sentinel CPS use was not associated with an increased risk of procedural complications. Stroke was observed in none (0%) of the Sentinel CPS patients, and in 6.3% of the non-Sentinel CPS patients (p = 0.05). The finding of stroke was associated with a high risk of early postprocedural mortality: 60% of stroke patients died within 3 months.
CONCLUSION: Routine use of the Sentinel CPS in CT-screened TAVR patients is feasible with high procedural success, without significant adverse events and without counteracting the evolution towards minimally invasive TAVR. Clinically relevant stroke was observed in none of the Sentinel CPS patients.
