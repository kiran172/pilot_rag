Title: Dorsal Versus Ventral Dartos Flap to Prevent Fistula Formation in Tubularized Incised Plate Urethroplasty for Hypospadias.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the results of two different flap procedures for prevention of urethrocutaneous fistula in hypospadias patients undergoing tubularized incised plate urethroplasty .
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent hypospadias repair. The standard technique of tubularized incised plate urethroplasty was used. There were 45 patients in Group 1 and 44 patients in Group 2, in which ventral and dorsal dartos flaps were used to cover the neourethra respectively. Surgical complications were assessed as the main outcomes. The results were analyzed with Chi-square and Mann-whitney u tests.
RESULTS: There was no significiant difference between the groups in terms of age and meatus location. We observed postoperative surgical complications in 15 (33.3 %) patients in Group 1 and in 4 (9.1 %) patients in Group 2. The complications noted in the Group 1 were urethrocutaneous fistula in 10 patients ( 22.2 %) and meatal stenosis in 5 patients ( 11.1 %). In Group 2, fistula was observed in 2 patients (4.6 %) and stenosis in again 2 patients (4.6 %). Urethrocutaneous fistulas occurred statistically more frequently when ventral based dartos flaps were used (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Several flap procedures and their modifications have been suggested to avoid fistula formation. Within these procedures, dartos flaps are reported to be very useful for primary distal or proximal hypospadias repair and reoperations. In this study, we concluded that ; vascularized dorsal preputial dartos flap procedure is safe and more effective than ventral based flap in prevention of fistula formation.
