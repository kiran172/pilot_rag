Title: Endoscopic Transnasal Odontoidectomy.

Abstract: Background  Odontoidectomy may represent the treatment of choice for symptomatic ventral craniovertebral junction stenosis in selected cases. An endoscopic transnasal approach has been proposed as an alternative to a classic transoral approach. Method  We report a case of a patient with a craniovertebral junction stenosis due to the ossification of the posterior ligament. The clinical and radiological records of the patient and a step-by-step description of the surgical technique are presented ( Fig. 1 ). Conclusion  Endoscopic transnasal odontoidectomy provides a direct access to the dens and adjacent structures of the anterior upper cervical spine with a less invasive burden on the oropharingeal structures.
