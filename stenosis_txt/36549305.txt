Title: Surgical versus Interventional Treatment of Concomitant Aortic Valve Stenosis and Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is frequently diagnosed in patients with aortic valve stenosis. Treatment options include surgical and interventional approaches. We therefore analyzed short-term outcomes of patients undergoing either coronary artery bypass grafting with simultaneous aortic valve replacement (CABG + AVR) or staged percutaneous coronary intervention and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (PCI + TAVI).
METHODS: From all patients treated since 2017, we retrospectively identified 237 patients undergoing TAVI within 6 months after PCI and 241 patients undergoing combined CABG + AVR surgery. Propensity score matching was performed, resulting in 101 matched pairs.
RESULTS: Patients in the CABG + AVR group were younger compared with patients in the PCI + TAVI group (71.9 ± 4.9 vs 81.4 ± 3.6 years; p &lt; 0.001). The overall mortality at 30 days before matching was higher after CABG + AVR than after PCI + TAVI (7.8 vs 2.1%; p = 0.012). The paired cohort was balanced for both groups regarding demographic variables and the risk profile (age: 77.2 ± 3.7 vs78.5 ± 2.7 years; p = 0.141) and EuroSCORE II (6.2 vs 7.6%; p = 0.297). At 30 days, mortality was 4.9% in the CABG + AVR group and 1.0% in the PCI + TAVI group (p = 0.099). Rethoracotomy was necessary in 7.9% in the CABG + AVR, while conversion to open heart surgery was necessary in 2% in the PCI + TAVI group. The need for new pacemaker was lower after CABG + AVR than after PCI + TAVI (4.1 vs 6.9%; p = 0.010). No paravalvular leak (PVL) was noted in the CABG + AVR group, while the incidence of moderate-to-severe PVL after PCI + TAVI was 4.9% (p = 0.027).
CONCLUSION: A staged interventional approach comprises a short-term survival advantage compared with combined surgery for management of CAD and aortic stenosis. However, PCI + TAVI show a significantly higher risk of atrioventricular block and PVL. Further long-term trials are warranted.
