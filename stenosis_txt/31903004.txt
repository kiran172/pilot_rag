Title: Clinical Impact of High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T on the Chronic Phase of Stable Angina after a Successful Initial Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of elevated plasma high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) in the chronic phase in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) who underwent a successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: This study enrolled 158 consecutive SAP patients who underwent routine follow-up coronary angiography 9 months after a successful PCI with the implantation of a second-generation drug-eluting stent. Patients with previous coronary artery bypass graft and renal dysfunction were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups according to hs-TnT plasma level at follow-up: elevated hs-TnT (â‰¥ 0.015 ng/ml) group and non-elevated hs-TnT group.
RESULTS: Among the 158 subjects, 42 had an elevated hs-TnT level at follow-up. The elevated hs-TnT group had a significantly higher rate of any coronary lesion (in-stent restenosis and de novo lesions) in follow-up CAG (coronary angiography) than the non-elevated group (28.6% vs. 10.3%, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis also showed that hs-TnT elevation was independently associated with the presence of significant coronary stenosis in the chronic phase (odds ratio: 3.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.38 to 11.53). The best cut-off value of the hs-TnT level at 9 months after a successful PCI to predict the presence of significant coronary stenosis was 0.016 ng/ml (sensitivity: 50.0%; specificity: 82.1%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: hs-TnT elevation was independently associated with the presence of coronary stenosis in the chronic phase in SAP patients with successful PCI. Routine measurement of hs-TnT in the chronic phase may be useful to refine the risk of patients after PCI.
