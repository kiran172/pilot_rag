Title: Ketamine for Monitored Anesthesia Care During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To study the feasibility and outcomes of ketamine as an anesthetic adjunct during monitored anesthesia care (MAC) in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
DESIGN: This was a retrospective study.
METHODS: Data from 155 consecutive TAVR patients at a tertiary care high-volume TAVR medical center were reviewed and analyzed.
FINDINGS: Among the 155 TAVR cases under MAC, intravenous ketamine was administered as an adjunct in 126 patients. The most common ketamine dose was 20 mg. There was no significant difference for postoperative stroke, intraoperative conversion to general anesthesia, postoperative delirium, need for permanent pacemaker implantation, perivalvular leak and length of stay between the ketamine and non-ketamine groups. The ketamine group demonstrated a statistically significant lower 30-day mortality (P = .0381) and intraoperative cardiac arrest (P = .0025) rate when compared to the nonketamine group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that employing ketamine as an adjunct during MAC for TAVR is a feasible option.
