Title: C-Reactive Protein to Albumin Ratio as A Novel Inflammatory-Based Marker for 30-Day Mortality in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) predicts the early and late mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This study was retrospectively designed and includes 170 TAVR patients with a mean age of 78.4±7.1 years. Patients were divided into 2 groups as those who died and those who survived, taking into account the follow-up period. Complete blood count, serum CRP and serum albumin were obtained on admission. The CAR value of all patients was calculated and the relationship of CAR with early (≤30 days) and late mortality (>30 days) was evaluated.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 19 [7-31] months (maximum 66 months). Early mortality was observed in 20 (11.8%) patients, whereas late mortality was observed in 39 (22.9%) patients, most of them male (61.1%, P=0.04). Non-survivors had greater CAR value, higher baseline serum CRP level and lower baseline albumin level than survivors (P<0.01, for all parameters). According to multivariate analysis models, CAR (HR: 1.020, P<0.01) and TVAR score (HR: 1.294, P<0.01) were found to be independent predictors of early mortality while CRP and albumin were not. The area under the curve (AUC) for CAR was 0.73 with a P <0.01. A CAR >15.6 predicted the early mortality with 80% sensitivity and 57% specificity.
CONCLUSION: The novel inflammatory marker CAR can be used as a reliable marker in predicting 30-day mortality in patients undergoing TAVR.
