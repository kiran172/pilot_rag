Title: Cusp-overlapping TAVI technique with a self-expanding device optimizes implantation depth and reduces permanent pacemaker requirement.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of modifying the classic implantation technique for aortic transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation to a cusp-overlap-projection (COP) technique to achieve a higher implantation depth and to reduce the burden of new permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) at 30 days. Aortic self-expanding THV carries an elevated risk for PPMI. A higher implantation depth minimizes the damage in the conduction system and may reduce PPMI rates.
METHODS: From March 2017, 226 patients were consecutively included: 113 patients were treated using the COP implantation technique compared with the previous 113 consecutive patients treated using the classic technique. In all patients, implantation depth was assessed by 3 methods (noncoronary cusp to the THV, mean of the noncoronary cusp and the left coronary cusp to the THV, and the deepest edge from the left coronary cusp and the noncoronary cusp to the THV).
RESULTS: The COP group had a lower implantation depth than the group treated with the classic technique (4.8 mm± 2.2 vs 5.7 mm± 3.1; P=.011; 5.8 mm± 3.1 vs 6.5 mm± 2.4; P=.095; 7.1 mm± 2.8 vs 7.4 mm±3.2; P=.392). Forty patients (17.7%) required a new PPMI after the 30-day follow-up but this requirement was significantly lower in the COP group (12.4% vs 23%, P=.036). The COP implantation technique consistently protected against the main event (OR, 0.45; 95%CI, 0.21-0.97; P=.043), with similar procedural success rates and complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The COP implantation technique is a simple modification of the implantation protocol and provides a higher implantation depth of self-expanding-THV with lower conduction disturbances and PPMI rates.
