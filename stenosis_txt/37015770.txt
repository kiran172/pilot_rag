Title: Clinical Application of the Residual Thyroid Cartilage for Laryngeal Function Reconstruction in the Partial Laryngectomy-A Single Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the outcomes of using the residual thyroid cartilage for laryngeal function reconstruction in early glottic laryngeal carcinoma.
METHODS: From March 2017 to June 2022, 21 patients with glottic carcinoma who underwent laryngeal function reconstruction were analyzed retrospectively. The operation was performed under general anesthesia. Reconstruction of ipsilateral hemilarynx defect by downward movement of ipsilateral residual thyroid cartilage plate. During the follow-up period, the laryngeal function and tumor recurrence were evaluated.
RESULTS: otally 20 male patients and 1 female patient were enrolled in this study. Of the 20 initial primary tumors, there were 6 patients with T1N0M0 stage, 12 ones with T2N0M0 stage, 1 with T1N1M0 stage, 1 with T3N0M0 stage, and 1 with T2N1M0 stage. The patient with recurrent tumor was T3N1M0 stage. The follow-up time ranged from 9 to 63Â months. All patients were healed by first intention after surgery. All patients without laryngeal stenosis were removed from tracheotomy tube. So far, all patients have good laryngeal function. One patient relapsed at the last follow-up.
CONCLUSION: It is safe to repair hemilarynx defect with residual thyroid cartilage plate on the affected side, and it is an important choice for laryngeal function reconstruction after vertical partial laryngectomy.
