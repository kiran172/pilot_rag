Title: [Minimally invasive therapy for nasolacrimal duct obstructions].

Abstract: Today, microendoscopic minimally invasive therapy techniques, such as laser dacryoplasty (LDP) for complete stenosis and microdrill dacryoplasty (MDP) for incomplete stenoses are therapeutic options for PANDO (primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstructions). Due to excellent prognosis, external DCR is still "gold standard" especially for patients with complex problems.
