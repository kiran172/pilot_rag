Title: Metachronous Krukenberg tumor from adenocarcinoma in a Meckel's diverticulum: a case report.

Abstract: Adenocarcinoma in a Meckel's diverticulum is rare and difficult to diagnose preoperatively. We report the first case of a metachronous Krukenberg tumor from adenocarcinoma in a Meckel's diverticulum. A 45-year-old woman was admitted for recurrent abdominal pain. Computed tomography scan showed a lesion with contrast enhancement, and a Meckel's diverticulum-associated tumor was suspected. Double-ballon enteroscopy revealed intestinal stenosis and biopsy showed adenocarcinoma. Operative findings showed a Meckel's diverticulum with tumor. Histopathological evaluation revealed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, interrupted by ectopic gastric mucosa, diagnosed as adenocarcinoma in a Meckel's diverticulum. Two years postoperatively, a multi-cystic mass with contrast enhancement was observed in the pelvis on imaging evaluation and oophorectomy performed. Histological examination of the resected ovary showed proliferation of atypical glandular ducts, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. This case demonstrates that adenocarcinoma in a Meckel's diverticulum may result in distant metastases and requires appropriate follow-up.
