Title: Small and mighty - microRNAs pulling the strings.

Abstract: The current issue of Biomedical Journal gives an insight into the influence miRNAs have in myocardial injury, and in hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore the association between dysmobility syndrome and vertebral fractures is assessed, the role of doxycycline in schistosomiasis is elucidated, and the effect of stress on the blood-brain barrier is examined. An article proving the accuracy of Taiwan's largest medical record databank is presented, as well as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's. Risk factors for recurrence of papillary thyroid cancer are identified, the outcome of reirradiation in oral squamous cell carcinoma is investigated, and the post-surgery outcomes in cases of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are reviewed. Finally this issue contains two articles about COVID-19, one describes the potential neurological damage left after the infection, and the second article analysis the outcome of uptake in vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.
