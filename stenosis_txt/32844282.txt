Title: Kidney injury as post-interventional complication of TAVI.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an accepted treatment approach of aortic stenosis. In the beginning, this technique was executed in high-risk patients only. Today, intermediate-risk patients are also amenable for TAVI, as long as the transfemoral approach is chosen. Numerous predictors have been identified that could lead to periprocedural complications and are defined by patient co-morbidities as well as being inherent to the technical approach. Although vascular complications and postinterventional paravalvular regurgitation have been minimized over the past years by revised technologies and techniques, there is a prevailing individual risk brought about by the specific pathophysiology of the cardiorenal syndrome.
