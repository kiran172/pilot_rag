Title: Preoperative 3D Image Evaluation of EC-IC Bypass by 3D Visualization Analysis Software Amira速.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Careful evaluation of the preoperative imaging for extracranial-intracranial bypass performed for conditions like intracranial stenosis and Moya disease is important. The traditional use of 2D imaging has a significant limitation for neurosurgeons, primarily to determine the optimal location of the recipient artery for performing the surgical bypass. Therefore, many neurosurgeons use 3D angiograms more frequently to overcome these shortcomings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed the preoperative evaluation of the possibility of performing an anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery and the middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass by synthesizing images of computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using Amira速 of 3D visualization analysis software (Thermo Scientific Co.).
RESULTS: The 3D images prepared before surgery using this software showed good agreement with the intraoperative findings.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative image processing using tools like Amira provide optimal information for good planning and communication for performing STA-MCA bypass and may become a helpful tool.
