Title: Observational data from the adalimumab post-marketing PYRAMID registry of patients with Crohn's disease who became pregnant: A post hoc analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: PYRAMID was an international post-marketing registry that aimed to collect data on the long-term safety and effectiveness of adalimumab treatment per local standard of care in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD). Here, we present post hoc analyses of observational data from patients who became pregnant while participating in this registry and receiving adalimumab.
METHODS: From the subpopulation of patients receiving adalimumab who became pregnant while taking part in PYRAMID, data on patient characteristics, pregnancy outcomes, and complications of pregnancy were analysed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Across the PYRAMID registry, 293 pregnancies occurred in patients who had gestational adalimumab exposure (average disease duration at last menstrual period: 8.6Â years), resulting in 300 pregnancy outcomes. A total of 197 pregnancies (67.2%) were exposed to adalimumab in all trimesters per physician's decision. Of the known reported outcomes (96.3%), 81.7% (236/289) were live births, 10.4% (30/289) were spontaneous abortions, 4.8% (14/289) elective terminations, 2.8% (8/289) ectopic pregnancies, and 0.3% (1/289) was a stillbirth. Congenital malformations (pulmonary valve stenosis and tricuspid valve incompetence) were reported in one infant. In addition to the pregnancy outcomes described above, 23 complications of pregnancy were reported in 20 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis showed that adalimumab treatment in patients with CD, who became pregnant whilst participating in the PYRAMID registry, contributed no additional adverse effects during the pregnancy course or on pregnancy outcomes.
