Title: Is native aortic valvuloplasty at time of Norwood operation in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and aortic stenosis safe?

Abstract: In hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the size and function of the left ventricle vary and are dependent on the patency of the aortic valve. A patent native aortic valve, permitting left ventricular ejection, can augment cardiac output. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and a stenotic aortic valve who underwent native aortic valvuloplasty at the time of Norwood and found that none of the eight patients identified had clinically significant aortic insufficiency. This case series suggests that surgical aortic valvuloplasty at Norwood is associated with aortic valve patency/augmented systemic cardiac output without the development of clinically significant aortic regurgitation at intermediate follow-up in a limited cohort.
