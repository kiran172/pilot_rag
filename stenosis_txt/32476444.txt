Title: Achilles Tendon Thickness Is an Independent Predictor of Carotid Atherosclerosis and Is Associated With a Carotid Plaque Burden.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to research the relationship between carotid atherosclerosis markers and ultrasound parameters of Achilles tendons (AT). The study included 150 patients at high and very high cardiovascular risk (CVR). All patients underwent a carotid ultrasound scanning. We evaluated carotid plaque, carotid plaque score (cPS), carotid total plaque area (cTPA), and the percentage of stenosis. All patients underwent AT ultrasound with an assessment of thickness (Achilles tendon thickness [ATT]), width (Achilles tendon width), and cross-sectional area. An increase in the ATT â‰¥5.07 mm was associated with a 4.55-fold increase in the relative risk of carotid atherosclerosis (sensitivity 68.3% and specificity 62.5%). Direct correlations between the ATT and carotid stenosis (r = 0.277; P = .004), cPS (r = 0.225; P = .035), and cTPA (r = 0.305; P = .004) were determined. An increase in the mean ATT by 1 mm was associated with an increase in cTPA by 8.09 mm2 (95% CI: 2.26-13.9; P = .007) and carotid stenosis by 4.11% (95% CI: 0.64-7.60; P = .021). Thus, in patients with high and very high CVR, an increase in ATT is an independent predictor of carotid atherosclerosis. The ATT directly correlates with the markers of carotid plaque burden.
