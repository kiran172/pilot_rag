Title: Trans-lesional fractional flow reserve gradient as derived from coronary CT improves patient management: ADVANCE registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of change in fractional flow reserve derived from CT (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) across coronary stenoses (ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub>) in guiding downstream testing in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incremental value of ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> in predicting early revascularization and improving efficiency of catheter laboratory utilization.
MATERIALS: Patients with CAD on coronary CT angiography (CCTA) were enrolled in an international multicenter registry. Stenosis severity was assessed as per CAD-Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS), and lesion-specific FFR<sub>CT</sub> was measured 2 ​cm distal to stenosis. ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> was manually measured as the difference of FFR<sub>CT</sub> across visible stenosis.
RESULTS: Of 4730 patients (66 ​± ​10 years; 34% female), 42.7% underwent ICA and 24.7% underwent early revascularization. ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> remained an independent predictor for early revascularization (odds ratio per 0.05 increase [95% confidence interval], 1.31 [1.26-1.35]; p ​&lt; ​0.001) after adjusting for risk factors, stenosis features, and lesion-specific FFR<sub>CT</sub>. Among the 3 models (model 1: risk factors ​+ ​stenosis type and location ​+ ​CAD-RADS; model 2: model 1 ​+ ​FFR<sub>CT</sub>; model 3: model 2 ​+ ​ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub>), model 3 improved discrimination compared to model 2 (area under the curve, 0.87 [0.86-0.88] vs 0.85 [0.84-0.86]; p ​&lt; ​0.001), with the greatest incremental value for FFR<sub>CT</sub> 0.71-0.80. ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> of 0.13 was the optimal cut-off as determined by the Youden index. In patients with CAD-RADS ≥3 and lesion-specific FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤0.8, a diagnostic strategy incorporating ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt;0.13, would potentially reduce ICA by 32.2% (1638-1110, p ​&lt; ​0.001) and improve the revascularization to ICA ratio from 65.2% to 73.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> improves the discrimination of patients who underwent early revascularization compared to a standard diagnostic strategy of CCTA with FFR<sub>CT</sub>, particularly for those with FFR<sub>CT</sub> 0.71-0.80. ΔFFR<sub>CT</sub> has the potential to aid decision-making for ICA referral and improve efficiency of catheter laboratory utilization.
