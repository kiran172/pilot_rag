Title: Unusual cause of severe transvalvular eccentric jet AR: early structure valve deterioration of Trifecta valves by flail leaflet undergoing valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: The Trifecta tissue valve (Abbott, Illinois, USA) is an externally mounted bovine pericardial aortic valve (AV) prosthesis with adequate haemodynamic performance and better early results than another option. However, concerns have been raised about its durability. Recently, reports have emerged about an increased incidence of early structural valve failure after Trifecta implantation, where leaflet tear(s) with dehiscence along the stent post was the primary mode of early failure. In this article, we present the case of a patient in her 70s, 7 years after AV replacement with a Trifecta valve, who developed progressive dyspnoea. Physical examination revealed signs of chronic severe aortic regurgitation (AR). The initial transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe transvalvular AR, but the aetiology could not be determined. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) revealed a flail non-coronary cusp of the Trifecta bioprosthetic valve without vegetation. After discussion, we concluded that our patient was suitable for valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (ViV TAVR).
