Title: Central Retinal Artery Occlusion With Triple Cilioretinal Artery Sparing.

Abstract: We report a rare case of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) with triple cilioretinal artery sparing in a 76-year-old male with hypertension who presented with sudden diminution of vision in the left eye (OS) for one day. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) demonstrated the presence of three cilioretinal arteries and the absence of flow signals in the rest of the macula. Primary ophthalmic treatment was instituted immediately in the form of ocular massage, and acetazolamide 500 mg per oral (PO) stat was given. Systemic investigations revealed a significant blockage in coronary circulation on coronary angiography and an atheromatous plaque at the origin of the left internal carotid artery with 50% stenosis on digital subtraction angiography. Systemic anticoagulants and lipid-lowering agents (statins) were initiated by the cardiologist. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was subsequently performed. At the eight-week follow-up visit, best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 2/60 OS. Fundus examination of the OS revealed optic disc pallor with normal retinal background. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed diffuse retinal thinning except in the area supplied by the three patent cilioretinal arteries. En face OCTA OS showed restoration of retinal flow signal in the macula. Non-invasive imaging (OCTA) is critical in establishing early diagnosis and initiating prompt treatment in this ocular emergency with underlying potentially life-threatening systemic associations.
