Title: Mastering transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) instrumentation efficiency.

Abstract: Transcarotid artery revascularization is a relatively new minimally invasive procedure used to treat patients with carotid atherosclerosis deemed high risk for open revascularization and is reported to have lowest stroke rate of any carotid intervention. The novel applicability of this technique creates new and additional considerations with regard to efficiency in the operating theater, most notably instrumentation and turnaround. This article discusses our unique challenges and the subsequent improvements implemented to optimize and maintain our operating room efficiency and case volume throughput while ultimately reducing costs and resource wastage.
