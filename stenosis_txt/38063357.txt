Title: New strategies and methods for reconstruction of the outer ear canal (OEC).

Abstract: Background: The incidence of re-stenosis or re-atresia after reconstruction of the Outer Ear Canal (OEC) in patients with Congenital Malformation of the Middle and Outer Ear (CMMOE) is very high (up to 48%), and it has been a difficult problem for otologists not being able to solve.Aims/Objectives: To explore new strategies and methods to improve re-stenosis or re-atresia after reconstruction of the OEC in patients with CMMOE.Material and Methods: According to the characteristics of reconstructed OEC (r-OEC) re-stenosis or re-atresia summarized by us, a number of new prevention strategies and methods have been proposed and related patent products have been designed, including the improvement of covering epithelium types and skin grafting methods (7 types), simulated drum ring function to prevent the formation of negative pressure in the cavity, and strengthen postoperative support to reduce skin shrinkage and bone hyperplasia. The postoperative effects of different ages and preoperative OEC malformations are statistically analyzed.Results: The incidence of re-stenosis/re-atresia is 14.3% (5/35) in the thin sectional skin of the temporal scalp overlap splicing skin grafting, which was significantly better than 45.5% (15/33) in the whole piece mosaic splicing and barrel skin grafting from the inner thin sectional thigh skin and overlay splicing other methods, including the inner thigh thin sectional skin, chest medium thick skin and subcutaneous pedicle + chest medium thick skin (p&lt;0.05). The patent artificial drum ring and the model stent of the OEC have obvious effects. The mean operation age of postoperative atresia, stenosis, and good groups are 9.3, 13.1, and 12.5 years old, respectively. The proportion of preoperative atresia is 91.3%, 85.7%, and 57.7%, respectively. The total incidence of re-atresia and re-stenosis of r-OEC for two groups of atresia and stenosis of OEC before surgery is 40.5% (49/121) and 13.3% (8/60), respectively.Conclusions and Significance: The best result is found in overlapping the splicing thin sectional skin of the temporal scalp, combined with artificial drum ring implantation, effective support of postoperative model stent of OEC and post-pubertal surgery selection are new and effective strategies and methods to prevent re-stenosis or re-atresia of r-OEC. Atresia or stenosis of the OEC before the operation is the influence factor of the postoperative effect.
