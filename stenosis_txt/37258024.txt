Title: [Mitral Valve Repair under Ventricular Fibrillation for Acute Mitral Valve Regurgitation in a Patient with Aortitis Syndrome].

Abstract: A 73-year-old woman with a history of aortitis syndrome was referred to our hospital presenting with congestive heart failure caused by acute severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior leaflet prolapse. Upon admission, the patient fell into shock state while undergoing an examination. Medical treatment including mechanical ventilation could not alleviate circulatory collapse, so emergency surgery was performed on the day of admission. Severe calcification of the ascending aorta and severe stenosis or occlusion of the aortic arch vessels resulted from the patient's aortitis syndrome precluded aortic cannulation and aortic clamp. Therefore, mitral valve repair was performed under ventricular fibrillation at moderate hypothermia. Surgery was successful, and the patient recovered well without any cerebral complications after the surgery.
