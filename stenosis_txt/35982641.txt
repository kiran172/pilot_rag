Title: Long-term results of wide-necked intracranial bifurcation aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling using low-profile acandis acclino stents.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Little data exists on endovascular treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms with the Acandis Acclino low-profile self-expanding closed-cell stent systems and is mainly limited to short- or midterm results. We report our long-term, single-centre experience with three generations of Acclino stents treating complex intracranial aneurysms.
METHODS: 62 wide-necked intracranial aneurysms were treated electively using 88 Acclino stent systems. Single stent-assisted coiling was the preferred treatment in 38 cases and the kissing-Y stenting technique in 24 cases. We analysed demographic data and long-term follow-up results.
RESULTS: All stents were successfully deployed with immediate complete (Raymond Roy occlusion classification, RROC I) or near-complete occlusion (RROC II) achieved in 93,5%. Follow-up was available in 55 cases with a mean follow-up of 36 months (range 9-80 months). Long-term RROC I or II was achieved in 49 cases (89,1%). Three cases of stable residual aneurysmal filling were observed (5,5%). Seven aneurysms (12,7%) demonstrated a worsening on follow-up leading either to a neck remnant (4 cases, 7,3%) or to an aneurysm recurrence (3 cases, 5,5%). One recurrent aneurysm was retreated with coilembolization (1,8%). The directly procedural-related complication rate was 4,8%. Seven cases of clinically silent in-stent stenosis (12,7%; morbidity n = 0) were detected on long-term follow-up, six of them using the kissing-Y stenting technique.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of various intracranial aneurysms using the Acandis Acclino stent systems is safe and efficient with high aneurysm occlusion rates combined with low complication rates on long-term follow-up. Overall, rates of in-stent stenosis are low but may depend on the treatment technique (single stent-assisted coiling versus kissing-Y stenting with coiling).
