Title: Primary colonic melanoma: a rare entity.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal melanoma is usually metastatic in origin, and primary melanoma within the gastrointestinal tract is rarely reported. Colon is considered to be an extremely uncommon site for primary melanomas. Herein, we report the first case of a large primary melanoma within the transverse colon with gastric involvement. CT scan found a mass within the colon, which seemed to connect to the gastric antrum. Esophagogastroscopy showed an ulcerated lesion in the greater curvature of the stomach. Subsequent colonoscopy identified a large ulcerated lesion rendering significant stenosis of the transverse colon. Biopsy following colonoscopy indicated a diagnosis of colonic melanoma based on pathological findings, which identified submucosal malignant melanoma cells with epithelioid and spindle features. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for S-100, HMB-45, Vimentin, and Melan-A. A series of clinical and imaging examinations revealed no suspicious primary cutaneous or ocular lesions. The diagnosis of primary colonic melanoma was considered. A radical transverse colectomy with subtotal gastrectomy were conducted subsequently. Definite diagnosis of primary colonic melanoma can be established after ruling out the possibility of being a metastasis from other more common primary sites. Primary colonic melanomas are a challenge to diagnose and often need a multidisciplinary treatment approach, including surgery, BRAF-targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
