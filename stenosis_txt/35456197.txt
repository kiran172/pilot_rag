Title: Strategies for Facilitating Totally Percutaneous Transfemoral TAVR Procedures.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has transformed the treatment of aortic stenosis and should ideally be performed as a totally percutaneous procedure via the transfemoral (TF) approach. Peripheral vascular disease may impede valve delivery, and vascular access site complications are associated with adverse clinical outcome and increased mortality. We review strategies aimed to facilitate TF valve delivery in patients with hostile vascular anatomy and achieve percutaneous management of vascular complications.
