Title: [Takotsubo syndrome after palliative transcatheter treatment of acquired aortic stenosis in patient with congenital ventricular septal defect. Case report].

Abstract: The authors report the clinical case of secondary Takotsubo syndrome developed after transcatheter aortic valve replacement that was performed in compassionate manner in female patient with combination of congenital ventricular septal defect and acquired severe aortic stenosis. In the teams view, Takotsubo syndrome was triggered with profound changes of intracardial hemodynamics subsequent to iatrogenic impairment of preexisting interventricular shunt.
