Title: Successful treatment by stent implantation for systemic-to-pulmonary shunt obstruction due to a Staphylococcus aureus abscess: a case report.

Abstract: A 13-year-old girl with a single ventricle and bilateral systemic-to-pulmonary shunts developed hypoxia due to shunt stenosis, which was caused by a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus abscess. Stent implantation associated with appropriate antibiotic administration was crucial to dilate and maintain shunt patency.
