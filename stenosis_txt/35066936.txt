Title: Paradoxical changes of coronary computed tomography derived fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: A total of 1335 outpatients with suspected coronary artery disease and who underwent computed tomography derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub> ) analysis were examined. Only four patients showed reverse increase of FFR<sub>CT</sub> from the proximal to the distal vessel and all of them had a large ramus artery (RAM). Of all parameters (vessel length, lumen volume, plaque volume, and left ventricular mass), only the bifurcation angle was significantly higher in reverse increase of FFR<sub>CT</sub> with RAM group (106.0 ± 15.8°) than normal FFR<sub>CT</sub> with RAM group (82.6 ± 21.7°) and normal FFR<sub>CT</sub> without RAM group (66.9 ± 21.1°).
