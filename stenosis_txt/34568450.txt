Title: Computed Tomography-Based Assessment of Transvalvular Pressure Gradient in Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Background: In patients with aortic stenosis, computed tomography (CT) provides important information about cardiovascular anatomy for treatment planning but is limited in determining relevant hemodynamic parameters such as the transvalvular pressure gradient (TPG). Purpose: In the present study, we aimed to validate a reduced-order model method for assessing TPG in aortic stenosis using CT data. Methods: TPG<sub>CT</sub> was calculated using a reduced-order model requiring the patient-specific peak-systolic aortic flow rate (Q) and the aortic valve area (AVA). AVA was determined by segmentation of the aortic valve leaflets, whereas Q was quantified based on volumetric assessment of the left ventricle. For validation, invasively measured TPG<sub>catheter</sub> was calculated from pressure measurements in the left ventricle and the ascending aorta. Altogether, 84 data sets of patients with aortic stenosis were used to compare TPG<sub>CT</sub> against TPG<sub>catheter</sub>. Results: TPG<sub>catheter</sub> and TPG<sub>CT</sub> were 50.6 ± 28.0 and 48.0 ± 26 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.56). A Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement between both methods with a mean difference in TPG of 2.6 mmHg and a standard deviation of 19.3 mmHg. Both methods showed good correlation with r = 0.72 (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The presented CT-based method allows assessment of TPG in patients with aortic stenosis, extending the current capabilities of cardiac CT for diagnosis and treatment planning.
