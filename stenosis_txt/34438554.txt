Title: Pulmonary Vein Stenosis in Children: A Programmatic Approach Employing Primary and Anatomic Therapy.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is a difficult condition to treat due to recurrence and progression. In 2017, we developed a comprehensive PVS Program at our center to address the multidisciplinary needs of these patients. We discuss the components of our program and our approach to these patients, using a combination of primary (medical) therapy in addition to anatomic therapy to preserve vessel patency. A multidisciplinary approach to treating these challenging patients is critical.
