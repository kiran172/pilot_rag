Title: Permanent Pacemaker Insertion Reduction and Optimized Temporary Pacemaker Management After Contemporary Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With Self-Expanding Valves (from the Pristine TAVI Study).

Abstract: Permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) reduction and optimal management of newly acquired conduction disturbances after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are crucial. We sought to evaluate the relation between transcatheter heart valve (THV) implantation depth and baseline and newly acquired conduction disturbances on PPMI after TAVI. This study included 1,026 consecutive patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (mean age 79.7 ± 8.4 years; 47.4% female) who underwent TAVI with the newer-generation self-expanding THVs Primary outcomes were early and late PPMI defined as the need for PPMI during the index admission and between discharge and 30 days, respectively. Early and late PPMI was required for 115 (11.2%) and 21 patients (2.0%), respectively. Early PPMI rates decreased from 26.7% in 2015 and 2016 to 5.7% in 2021, and so did the mean THV depth from 4.4 ± 2.4 mm to 1.8 ± 1.6 mm. Receiver operator characteristics curve analyses showed THV depth had significant discriminatory value for early and late PPMI with cutoff values of 3.0 and 2.2 mm, respectively. Rates of early and late PPMI were significantly lower for patients with shallower compared with deeper implantations (5.1% vs 22.6% and 0.4% vs 4.1%, p <0.001 for both, respectively). Furthermore, rates of early PPMI were lower with shallower implantations in patients with new left bundle branch block after TAVI (2.4% vs 15.9%; p <0.001) and those with baseline right bundle branch block (7.5% vs 29.6%; p = 0.017). Lower rates of PPMI with shallower THV implantation were consistently observed, including in patients with baseline and newly acquired conduction disturbances. Our findings might help optimize the management of a temporary pacemaker after TAVI.
