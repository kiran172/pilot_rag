Title: The role of 4-dimensional flow in the assessment of bicuspid aortic valve and its valvulo-aortopathies.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiac malformation and the leading cause of aortopathy and aortic stenosis in younger patients. Aortic wall remodelling secondary to altered haemodynamic flow patterns, changes in peak velocity, and wall shear stress may be implicated in the development of aortopathy in the presence of bicuspid aortic valve and dysfunction. Assessment of these parameters as potential predictors of disease severity and progression is thus desirable. The anatomic and functional information acquired from 4D flow MRI can allow simultaneous visualisation and quantification of the pathological geometric and haemodynamic changes of the aorta. We review the current clinical utility of haemodynamic quantities including velocity, wall sheer stress and energy losses, as well as visual descriptors such as vorticity and helicity, and flow direction in assessing the aortic valve and associated aortopathies.
