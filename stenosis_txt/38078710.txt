Title: Endovascular carotid revascularization under open-chest extracorporeal circulation combined with cardiac surgery in unstable patients at increased risk of carotid-related stroke: SIMultaneous urgent cardiac surgery and MicroNet-covered stent carotid revascularization in extreme-risk patients-SIMGUARD Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In patients at urgent need for cardiac surgery coexisting with increased-stroke-risk carotid stenosis, any staged intervention increases the risk of complications from the primarily unaddressed pathology. In this challenging cohort, we assessed safety and feasibility of endovascular carotid revascularization under open-chest extracorporeal circulation (ECC) combined with cardiac surgery (hybrid-room true simultaneous treatment).
METHODS: Per-protocol (PP), after general anesthesia induction, chest-opening and ECC stand-by installation, carotid stenting (CAS) was performed (femoral/radial or direct carotid access) with ad-hoc/on-hand switch to ECC cardiac surgery.
RESULTS: Over 78 months, 60 patients (70.7±6.9years, 85% male, all American Society of Anesthesiology grade IV) were enrolled. All were at increased carotid-related stroke risk (ipsilateral recent stroke/transient ischemick attack, asymptomatic cerebral infarct, increased-risk lesion morphology, bilateral severe stenosis). Majority of study procedures involved CAS+coronary bypass surgery or CAS+valve replacement±coronary bypass. 45 (75%) patients were PP- and 15 (25%) not-PP (NPP-) managed (context therapy). CAS was 100% neuroprotected (transient flow reversal-64.4%, filters-35.6%) and employed micronet-covered plaque-sequestrating stents with routine post-dilatation optimization/embedding. 4 deaths (6.7%) and 7 strokes (11.7%) occurred by 30-days. Despite CAS+surgery performed on aspirin and unfractionated heparin-only (delayed clopidogrel-loading), no thrombosis occurred in the stented arteries, and 30-days stent patency was 100%. NPP-management significantly increased the risk of death/ipsilateral stroke (OR 38.5; P<0.001) and death/any stroke (OR 12.3; P=0.002) by 30-days.
CONCLUSIONS: In cardiac unstable patients at increased carotid-related stroke risk who require urgent cardiac surgery, simultaneous cardiac surgery and CAS with micronet-covered stent lesion sequestration is feasible and safe and shows efficacy in minimizing stroke risk. Larger-scale, multicentric evaluation is warranted. (SIMGUARD NCT04973579).
