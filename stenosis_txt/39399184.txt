Title: Symptomatic Valvular and Subvalvular Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is a common valvular disease that is expected to become more prevalent with the aging population. It is often undiagnosed in socioeconomically deprived groups. Diagnosis relies on echocardiography, and additional imaging techniques such as cardiac computed tomography (CCT) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) are increasingly used. Surgical aortic valve replacement is the standard treatment, except for high-risk cases where TAVR is recommended. Subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS) is the second most common cause of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This case report highlights a 72-year-old Hispanic lady with both valvular and subvalvular aortic stenosis, emphasizing the need for specialized care and surgical intervention. Early identification, accurate assessment, and appropriate intervention are crucial for improving outcomes in aortic stenosis and subvalvular stenosis cases.
