Title: Hybrid Endovascular Treatment of Dysphagia Lusoria: Report of 2 Cases.

Abstract: Dysphagia Lusoria is a condition when aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA) causes esophageal compression. We report 2 cases of Dysphagia Lusoria treated by hybrid endovascular technique which included subclavian to carotid transposition and embolization of origin of ARSA. By using this technique, we avoided the need for thoracotomy. Both patients had complete symptom relief without any surgery related complication.
