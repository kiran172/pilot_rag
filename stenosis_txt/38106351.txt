Title: A case of severe polyarteritis nodosa with critical limb threatening ischemia-promising treatment with sirolimus drug-coated angioplasty.

Abstract: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare form of vasculitis. Acute limb ischemia is a rare presentation and complication of PAN. Plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) is one of the treatment strategies for addressing PAN-related critical limb threatening ischemia (CLTI). However, recurrence of stenosis and occlusion is frequent, making POBA a poor treatment choice, as evidenced in our described clinical case. Consequently, with consideration of sirolimus's anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, we used a sirolimus-coated balloon in the treatment of PAN-induced CLTI. A 37-year-old woman first presented with acute limb ischemia as her initial symptom. Diagnostic angiography demonstrated occlusion of her tibial vessels, and POBA was performed to restore perfusion. Later in the course of her illness, she developed foot gangrene despite multiple courses of immunosuppressive drugs and several attempts with POBA to achieve limb salvage. Because of her disease trajectory, a MagicTouch (Concept Medical) sirolimus-coated balloon was deployed to her anterior tibial artery during her third angioplasty. At 17Â months after her last angioplasty, she remained ulcer free, and surveillance scans demonstrated occlusion-free tibial vessels. The use of sirolimus-coated balloon angioplasty is a promising treatment approach for successful limb salvage in patients with PAN vasculitis and CLTI.
