Title: Solitaire AB stent-angioplasty for stenoses in perforator rich segments: A single-center experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vascular angioplasty and stenting of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and basilar artery (BA) stenoses are associated with poor clinical outcomes and high mortality rates thought to be related to the abundance of perforating arteries in those segments. This study explores the use of Solitaire AB as an off-label vascular stent to treat stenoses in the MCA and BA.
METHODS: Solitaire AB stents were placed during angioplasty and stenting of MCA and BA stenoses in patients at our department between January 2015 and May 2017 with 6-36 months follow-up. Operative results were assessed by follow-up angiography and transcranial doppler after the procedure. Neurologic status was evaluated before and after treatment according to the modified Ranking Scale (mRS).
RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were included in the study. Seventeen (53.12%) patients presented with MCA stenosis and 15 (46.87%) with BA stenosis. The 30-day rate of procedure-related complications was 3.1% (1/32). Post-stenting residual stenosis degrees ranged from 0% to 40% (mean 13.44% ± 10.66%). Mean degree of residual stenosis in 26 patients followed up by DSA was 8.64% ± 9.67%. The mRS 0-2 was achieved in all (100%) patients at 6-12 months post-procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates the off-label use of Solitaire AB for stenting is effective and safe for MCA and BA stenoses with high technical success and low complications. We recommend that lesion-specific therapy with an anatomically fitted stent design enables optimal treatment for intracranial stenosis.
