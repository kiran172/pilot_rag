Title: Early and late pace-maker implantation after transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Conduction defects requiring permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation are frequent complications occurring after surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR or SAVR with a bioprosthesis from the nationwide FinnValve registry were the subjects of this study. Patients with prior PPM, who received a sutureless prosthesis, or required cardiac resynchronization therapy or implantable cardioverter defibrillator were excluded from this analysis.
RESULTS: Four thousand and ten patients underwent SAVR and 1,897 underwent TAVR. TAVR had an increased risk of PPM implantation at 30-day (10.1% vs. 3.5%, unadjusted OR 3.11, 95%CI 2.56-3.87) and 5-year (15.7% vs. 8.6%, unadjusted SHR, 2.12, 95%CI 1.81-2.48) compared to SAVR. PPM implantation within 30 days from the index procedure did not increase the risk of 5-year mortality after either SAVR or TAVR. Among 1,042 propensity score matched pairs, TAVR had an increased risk of PPM implantation at 30-day (9.9% vs. 4.7%, p < .0001) and 5-year (14.7% vs. 11.4%, p = .001), but late (>30 days) PPM implantation at 5-year (4.7% vs. 6.9% SHR 0.72, 95%CI 0.47-1.10) was comparable to SAVR. The types of prosthesis had an impact on 30-day PPM implantation after TAVR, but not on late (>30 days) PPM implantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of 30-day PPM implantation is higher after TAVR compared to SAVR, late (>30 days) PPM implantation was comparable with these treatment methods. PPM implantation within 30 days did not affect late survival.
