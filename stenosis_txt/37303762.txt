Title: Treatment of Congenital Afibrinogenemia in a Neonate With Critical Pulmonary Stenosis.

Abstract: Fibrinogen deficiencies in neonates can lead to bleeding complications. In this report, we describe a case of congenital afibrinogenemia in a newborn with critical pulmonary stenosis who presented with bilateral cephalohematomas after an uncomplicated delivery. The initial use of cryoprecipitate was followed by administration of fibrinogen concentrate. We estimated a half-life of 24 to 48 hours with the concentrate product. This patient received fibrinogen replacement and had a subsequent successful cardiac repair. The drug's shorter half-life in this neonate contrasts with prior reports of longer half-life in older patients and is important to note in treating future neonatal patients with this diagnosis.
