Title: Rare Case of Double Esophageal Web in a Two-Year-Old.

Abstract: Congenital esophageal stenosis (CES) is an uncommon condition that poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to its rarity and clinical presentation similar to other esophageal disorders.Â Symptoms typically start with dysphagia around the introduction of solid foods. A broad range of potential differential diagnoses contributes to a delay in obtaining a definitive diagnosis and administering the proper treatment. We report a two-year-old boy who presented with difficulty swallowing solid foods since 11 months of age, manifesting as choking and gagging. Initial evaluation revealed a double esophageal web, with proximal stenosis detected in an esophagram. Despite two endoscopic dilations and cauterization of the proximal web, a second web in the middle third of the esophagus was found. Subsequent dilatation successfully improved symptoms, and the child began tolerating table foods. This case report aims to contribute to the limited existing literature on CES and to add to the clinical practice in the diagnosis and treatment of this uncommon congenital anomaly.
