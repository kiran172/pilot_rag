Title: Soluble Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor as a Predictor of All-Cause Death in Patients Undergoing Coronary Angiography at 10-Year Follow-Up.

Abstract: Background: We aimed to explore the predictive role of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) in patients undergoing coronary angiography by systematically evaluating its association with adverse cardiovascular events at 10 years follow-up. Methods: The KORONEF study was a single-center, observational, prospective study with 492 subjects included. In the multivariable Cox regression model, we checked the impact of suPAR, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, and DNase 1 on long-term outcomes. Results: The mean study population age was 64.4 ± 9.9 years, and there were 37.2% women. We divided the population into tertiles of suPAR levels (T1 0.793-2.135 ng/mL; T2 2.136-2.868 ng/mL; and T3 2.872-8.677 ng/mL). Patients with higher suPAR concentrations were more often females (tertile 1 vs. tertile 3: 27.4% vs. 50.6%, p &lt; 0.001) and older age (60.8 ± 8.7 years vs. 68.8 ± 9.5 years, p &lt; 0.001). They also characterized higher incidence of diabetes (17.7% vs. 38.0%, p &lt; 0.001), previous myocardial infarction (22% vs. 44.8%, p &lt; 0.001), and chronic kidney disease (3% vs. 18.4%, p &lt; 0.001), but lower incidence of dyslipidemia (54.3% vs. 35.6%). The 10-year all-cause death rates were 14.6% vs. 34.1%, HR 2.68, 95% CI 1.66-4.33, p &lt; 0.001 for tertile 2, and 14.6% vs. 39.9%, HR 3.24, 95% CI 2.03-5.17, p &lt; 0.001 for tertile 3. The optimal cut-off suPAR value of 2.39 ng/mL provided a sensitivity of 66.9% and a specificity of 54.6% in predicting all-cause death. Conclusions: The association of elevated suPAR with increased mortality risk suggests its potential relevance in predicting long-term outcomes and may help inform more individualized management strategies for high-risk patients.
