Title: Best cutoff score of cervical-pedicle thickness as a morphological parameter for predicting cervical central stenosis.

Abstract: There are various factors for the cause of cervical central stenosis (CCS), such as osteophyte, cervical-disc degeneration, and cervical ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. However, the pedicle of the cervical vertebra has not yet been analyzed for its relationship with CCS. We created a new morphologic parameter called the cervical-pedicle thickness (CPT) to assess the association between CCS and the cervical pedicle. We obtained morphological cases involving the CPT from 82 patients with CCS. There were also 84 in the normal group who underwent cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MR) as part of routine health screening. We obtained the T2-weighted CS-MR axial images from group members, and assessed the CPT at the level of the C6 vertebra on CS-MR. The mean CPT was 3.46 ± 0.57 mm in the normal group, 4.97 ± 0.75 mm in the CCS group, which thus had a significantly higher CPT (P < .01) than did the normal group. For the prognostic value of the CPT as a predictor of CCS, ROC analysis indicated that the best cutoff score for the CPT was 4.18 mm, with 93.9% sensitivity, 92.9% specificity, and AUC 0.97. Greater CPT was highly associated with a possibility of CCS. This conclusion will be helpful for assessing the CCS patients.
