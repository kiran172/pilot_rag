Title: Tectal Plate Gliomas Masquerading as Idiopathic Aqueduct Stenosis.

Abstract: Aqueduct stenosis is a recognized cause of obstructive hydrocephalus in children and can be treated effectively with endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging is often diagnostic of the cause of aqueduct stenosis. We describe 2 pediatric cases with obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a working diagnosis of idiopathic aqueduct stenosis. Following successful endoscopic third ventriculostomy, repeat magnetic resonance brain imaging revealed tectal plate glioma as the primary cause of obstruction. We believe these 2 reported cases demonstrate a previously unreported phenomenon whereby concealed tectal gliomas presenting with hydrocephalus are only unmasked following relief of hydrocephalus and decompression and normalization of the ventricular system. We aim to raise awareness about this unusual phenomenon and recommend routine postoperative interval imaging following endoscopic third ventriculostomy to avoid missing underlying pathology masquerading as aqueduct stenosis.
