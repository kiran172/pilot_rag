Title: Upregulated miR-206 Aggravates Deep Vein Thrombosis by Regulating GJA1-Mediated Autophagy of Endothelial Progenitor Cells.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the third most prevalent vascular disease worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play regulatory roles in functions of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which is becoming a promising therapeutic choice for thrombus resolution. Nevertheless, the role of miR-206 in EPCs is unclear.
METHODS: EPCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with DVT. In DVT mouse models, DVT was induced by stenosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The levels of miR-206 and gap junction protein alpha 1 (GJA1) in EPCs and vascular tissues of DVT mice were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis were tested by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, Transwell assay, flow cytometry analysis, and in vitro tube formation assay. The levels of autophagy-related proteins as well as the level of GJA1 in EPCs and vascular tissues were evaluated by western blotting. DVT formation in vivo was observed through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The expression of thrombus resolution markers, CD34 molecule (CD34) and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), in the thrombi was measured by immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: miR-206 overexpression inhibited proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis and promoted apoptosis of EPCs, while miR-206 knockdown exerted an opposite effect on EPC phenotypes. Downregulation of GJA1, the target of miR-206, abolished the influence of miR-206 on EPC phenotypes. Furthermore, silencing of miR-206 suppressed the autophagy of EPCs via upregulating GJA1. miR-206 knockdown repressed thrombus formation, enhanced the homing ability of EPCs to the thrombosis site, and facilitated thrombus resolution in DVT mouse models. Additionally, miR-206 was upregulated while GJA1 was downregulated in vascular tissues of DVT mice. miR-206 knockdown elevated GJA1 expression in vascular tissues of DVT mice. The expression of miR-206 was negatively correlated with that of GJA1 in DVT mice.
CONCLUSION: miR-206 knockdown upregulates GJA1 to inhibit autophagy of EPCs and then promote EPC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, thereby enhancing EPC homing to thrombi and facilitating thrombus resolution.
