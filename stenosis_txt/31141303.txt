Title: Novel use of a stent graft for uncontrollable intraprocedural stent thrombosis in a patient with acute myocardial infarction.

Abstract: We report the case of a patient who developed uncontrollable intraprocedural stent thrombosis (IPST) during an emergent percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction that was mitigated only by covering the culprit lesion with a stent graft. Although several factors can induce stent thrombosis, IPST was likely a result of intrastent plaque protrusion in this patient. This is the first case report on the use of stent graft implantation as an effective bailout procedure for uncontrolled IPST. The findings described in this case study warrant the adoption of stent grafts for the complete sealing of plaque protrusion in lesions.
