Title: GPA-Induced Granulomatous Endocarditis Mimicking a Thrombotic Mitral Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: We present the case of a patient with granulomatous endocarditis of the mitral valve leading to severe valve stenosis caused by granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Endocarditis is a rare complication of granulomatosis with polyangiitis that may be misdiagnosed as infectious endocarditis or, as in our case, thrombotic lesions. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
