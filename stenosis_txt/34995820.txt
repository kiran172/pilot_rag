Title: Factors associated with pyloric hypertrophy severity and post-operative feeding and nutritional recovery in infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To examine factors that affect the severity of pyloric hypertrophy, post-operative feeding and nutritional recovery in infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS).
METHODS: Medical records of infants diagnosed with IHPS at a single tertiary center between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics, biochemistry data and outcome were assessed for their association with the severity of pyloric hypertrophy and post-operative recovery. Nutritional recovery was assessed using weight-for-age status improvement after surgery.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were recruited in this study. The mean pre-operative weight-for-age percentile was 18.2. Elevated bicarbonate was positively correlated with symptom duration (p = 0.007). Pyloric muscle thickness was significantly correlated with age, weight, and symptom duration (p = 0.004, 0.003, 0.008, respectively). The mean weight-for-age percentile increased to 41.6 by post-operative weeks 6-8. Pyloric muscle thickness was negatively correlated with nutritional recovery by post-operative weeks 6-8 (p = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, pyloric length related to nutritional recovery at week 1-2 postoperatively (OR = 1.42, p = 0.030, 95% CI = 0.03-1.94), and pyloric muscle thickness related to nutritional recovery at week 6-8 postoperatively (OR = 4.08, p = 0.032, 95% CI = 1.13-14.7).
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that favorable nutritional outcome and successful weight gain was observed 6-8 weeks after surgery in children with IHPS. Pyloric muscle thickness positively correlated with age, weight, symptom duration, and favorable nutritional recovery. Serum bicarbonate showed a positive correlation with symptom duration.
