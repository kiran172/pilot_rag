Title: Impact of right ventricle-pulmonary artery coupling in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Right ventricle-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling has been linked to clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter valve implantation (TAVI). However, the best timing for prognostic assessment remains uncertain. Our aim was to determine the impact of RV longitudinal function parameters and RV-PA coupling on mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.  Retrospective, single center, analysis including patients with AS who underwent TAVI between 2007 and 2021. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed before, shortly after the procedure, and during follow-up. RV-PA uncoupling was defined as a TAPSE/PASP ratio<0.55 (severe RV uncoupling was defined as TAPSE/PASP ratio<0.32. The effect of RV parameters on all-cause mortality up to 12 months was assessed.  Among the 577 patients included, pre-procedural TAPSE/PASP ratio data were available for 205. RV-PA uncoupling was present in 113 patients (55.1%), with severe uncoupling observed in 31 (15.1%). Within the first 12 months after TAVI, 51 patients (9%) died. Severe RV-PA uncoupling was associated with mortality in univariable Cox regression; however, this association was lost after adjusting for EuroSCORE II. A significant association was found between the TAPSE/PASP ratio (per 0.1-unit increase) after the procedure and the primary endpoint (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.97; p=0.029). Higher postprocedural PASP (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.06; p<0.001 was also associated with all-cause mortality.  V-PA uncoupling and PASP after TAVI are associated with all-cause mortality in patients and may be valuable for patient selection and for planning post-procedural care.
