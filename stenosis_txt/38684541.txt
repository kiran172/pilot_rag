Title: [Drug therapy for acute and elective stent angioplasty].

Abstract: CLINICAL ISSUE: Carotid artery stenoses are constrictions of the common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery. They cause around 15% of all cerebral ischemia, which is why their detection and correct treatment play an important role in clinical practice.
PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Depending on the severity and clinical symptoms, carotid artery stenosis is treated conservatively, surgically or endovascularly by means of stent angioplasty. In the case of stent angioplasty in particular, correct drug therapy plays an important role in avoiding/reducing thromboembolic complications.
