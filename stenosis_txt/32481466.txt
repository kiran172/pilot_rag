Title: Single Y-shaped tracheal self-expandable metallic stent for emergent carinal stenosis combined with stenosis of the right main and intermediate bronchi.

Abstract: To explore the outcome of placing a single Y-shaped tracheal self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) to treat emergent carinal stenosis combined with stenosis of the right main and intermediate bronchi.The clinical and imaging data of 10 patients (8 males, 2 females) with carinal stenosis combined with stenosis of the right main and intermediate bronchi were retrospectively analyzed. There were 4 patients with esophageal cancer and 6 patients with lung cancer. All patients underwent treatment with a single Y-shaped tracheal SEMS. The long branch was inserted into the right main and intermediate bronchi, while the short branch was inserted into the left main bronchus. A modified Borg scale score was used as the criterion for assessing dyspnea in patients before and after stenting.A total of 10 Y-shaped tracheal SEMSs were successfully placed in 10 patients without any procedure-related complications. Compared with the score before stent placement, the mean Borg score for dyspnea after stent placement decreased from 7.6 to 0.8 (P = .04). Chest computed tomography showed that the stenosis disappeared 3 to 5 days poststenting. During the follow-up period, the most common complications were tumor ingrowth (n = 5) and granulation tissue hyperplasia (n = 7). The mean survival time after tracheal stent placement was 103 ± 50 (23-172) days.The application of a single Y-shaped tracheal SEMS for emergent carinal stenosis combined with stenosis of the right main and intermediate bronchi can effectively relieve dyspnea through a simple operation.
