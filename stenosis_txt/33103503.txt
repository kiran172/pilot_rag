Title: Cilostazol plus clopidogrel in the prevention of in-stent stenosis after vertebral artery origin stenting in gout patients: three case reports.

Abstract: It is unclear whether cilostazol instead of aspirin in combination with clopidogrel could prevent in-stent thrombosis in patients with a history of gout undergoing vertebral artery origin stenting. Three men (age range, 58-74 years) were diagnosed with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Vertebral artery origin stenosis was visible by computed tomographic angiography or digital subtraction angiography. Four bare metal stents were placed in the vertebral artery origin. The patients were administered 100 mg cilostazol orally twice a day and 75 mg clopidogrel orally once a day perioperatively and 100 mg cilostazol orally twice day was administered indefinitely after 3 months. No in-stent stenosis was observed in all of these patients during a follow-up period up to 19 months. Cilostazol plus clopidogrel has the potential to become an alternative to standard dual antiplatelet therapy in vertebral artery origin stenting. A high-quality clinical trial is needed to verify these preliminary findings.
