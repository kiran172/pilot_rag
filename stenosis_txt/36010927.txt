Title: Treatment Outcomes of Computer Tomography-Guided Brachytherapy in Cervical Cancer in Hong Kong: A Retrospective Review.

Abstract: (1) Background: To report the long-term clinical outcomes of computer-tomography (CT)-guided brachytherapy (BT) for locally advanced cervical cancer. (2) Methods: A total of 135 patients with FIGO stage IB-IVA cervical cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy with an IGABT boost at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, between November 2013 and December 2019 were included. Treatment included pelvic radiotherapy 40 Gy/20 Fr/4 weeks +/- chemotherapy then CT-guided BT (7 Gy × 4 Fr) and a sequential parametrial boost. The primary outcome was local control. Secondary outcomes were pelvic control, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival (OS) and late toxicities. (3) Results: The median follow-up was 53.6 months (3.0-99.6 months). The five-year local control, pelvic control, distant metastasis-free survival and OS rates were 90.7%, 84.3%, 80.0% and 87.2%, respectively. The incidence of G3/4 long-term toxicities was 6.7%, including proctitis (2.2%), radiation cystitis (1.5%), bowel perforation (0.7%), ureteric stricture (0.7%) and vaginal stenosis and fistula (0.7%). Patients with adenocarcinomas had worse local control (HR 5.82, 95% CI 1.84-18.34, p = 0.003), pelvic control (HR 4.41, 95% CI 1.83-10.60, p = 0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (HR 2.83, 95% CI 1.17-6.84, p = 0.021) and OS (HR 4.38, 95% CI: 1.52-12.67, p = 0.003) rates. Distant metastasis-free survival was associated with HR-CTV volume ≥ 30 cm3 (HR 3.44, 95% CI 1.18-9.42, p = 0.025) and the presence of pelvic lymph node (HR 3.44, 95% CI 1.18-9.42, p = 0.025). OS was better in patients with concurrent chemotherapy (HR 4.33, 95% CI: 1.40-13.33, p = 0.011). (4) Conclusions: CT-guided BT for cervical cancer achieved excellent long-term local control and OS. Adenocarcinoma was associated with worse clinical outcomes. (4) Conclusion: CT-guided BT for cervical cancer achieved excellent long-term local control and OS. Adenocarcinoma was associated with worse clinical outcomes.
