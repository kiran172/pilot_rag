Title: Effect of acute CORticosteroids on conduction defects after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: the CORTAVI study.

Abstract: AIMS: Conduction abnormalities, requiring a permanent pacemaker (PPM), are the most common electrical complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The exact mechanism for conduction system defects is not yet clear. The local inflammatory process and edema are thought to play a role in the development of electrical disorders. Corticosteroids are effective anti-inflammatory and antiedematous agents. We aim to investigate the potential protective effect of corticosteroids on conduction defects after TAVI.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of a single center. We analyzed 96 patients treated with TAVI. Thirty-two patients received oral prednisone 50 mg for 5 days after the procedure. This population was compared with the control group. All patients were followed up after 2 years.
RESULTS: Of the 96 patients included, 32 (34%) were exposed to glucocorticoids after TAVI. No differences in age, preexisting right bundle branch block or left bundle branch block, or valve type were seen among patients exposed to glucocorticoids versus those who were unexposed. We observed no significant differences between the two groups in the overall frequency of new PPM implantations during hospitalization (12% vs. 17%, P  = 0.76). The incidence of atrioventricular block (AVB) (STx 9% vs. non-STx 9%, P  = 0.89), right bundle branch block (STx 6% vs. non-STx 11%, P  = 0.71), and left bundle branch block (STx 34% vs. non-STx 31%, P  = 0.9) was not significantly different between the STx and non-STx groups. At 2 years after TAVI, none of the patients had implanted PPM or had severe arrhythmias documented by 24-h Holter ECG or cardiac examination.
CONCLUSION: Oral prednisone treatment does not appear to significantly reduce the incidence of AVB requiring acute PPM implantation after TAVI.
