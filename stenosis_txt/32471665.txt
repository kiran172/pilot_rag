Title: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy: Incidence and predictors in a single-center cohort.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is one of the most significant complications after orthotopic heart transplantation. We aimed to investigate the incidence and predictors of CAV in a large cohort of orthotopic heart transplantation patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on a prospective cohort of 233 patients who underwent transplantation between November 2003 and May 2014. Baseline clinical data and invasive coronary angiograms (n=712) performed as part of the follow-up program were analyzed by two independent investigators.
RESULTS: We included 157 male and 45 female patients with a median age of 66 years. A third of patients had previous ischemic heart disease, 30% peripheral arterial disease, 37% hypertension and 47% dyslipidemia, and 17% were smokers. Acute moderate or severe rejection occurred in 42 patients during the first year. Over a median follow-up of 2920 days, 18% were diagnosed with CAV, with an incidence of 2.91 cases per 100 person-years. Predictors of CAV were previous ischemic heart disease (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.21-4.45, p=0.01), carotid artery disease (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.27-4.71, p<0.01), and donor age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.07, p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: In a single-center cohort of orthotopic heart transplantation patients, predictors of CAV were previous ischemic heart disease, carotid artery disease and donor age.
