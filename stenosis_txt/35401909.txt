Title: VACTERL syndrome with late presentation of annular pancreas with duodenal web: Case report.

Abstract: VACTERL Syndrome affects multiple body systems and can include various anomalies of the Vertebral column, Anus and/or rectum, heart (Cardiac), Tracheo-Esophagus, kidneys (Renal), and Limbs. Patients with VACTERL syndrome are at increased risk of having a congenital duodenal obstruction that may be extrinsic in the form of an annular pancreas or intrinsic in the form of duodenal atresia, stenosis or web. Simultaneous presentation of both the annular pancreas and duodenal web is a rare clinical entity and typically presents in neonates. However, late presentation of annular pancreas combined with a duodenal web is exceedingly uncommon. We present a case of late diagnosis of annular pancreas with duodenal web resulting in an entrapped ingested foreign body.
