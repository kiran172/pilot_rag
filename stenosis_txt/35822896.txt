Title: Double guidewire technique (DGT): Optimising endovascular revision of juxta-anastomotic stenosis in AV-fistulae: A retrospective analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred angioaccess for haemodialysis but suffers from a high stenosis rate, juxta-anastomotic stenosis (JAS) being the most frequent. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of JAS would have some advantage (such as mini-invasive and vein sparing treatment), but higher recurrence rate is observed as compared to surgery. We report results of juxta anastomotic stenosis PTA using the 'double guide technique' (DGT) as described by Turmel-Rodrigues, in a selected cohort from our Vascular Access Centre.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January to June 2018, 25 consecutive patients were treated by DGT. By means of retrograde access through the outflow vein by a 6 F introducer, two guide wires were navigated: one into proximal radial artery (GW1), the other into distal artery (GW2). GW2 was used to dilate juxta-anastomotic vein and anastomotic area with 6 mm high-pressure balloon, while by GW1 juxta-anastomotic artery was dilated with 4 mm semi-compliant balloon. Mean diameter of balloons were 6.7 and 4.1 mm for venous and arterial tract dilatation. Follow up was carried out up to 12 months. Prospectively collected data were analysed retrospectively.
RESULTS: One-year primary and secondary patency was 52% and 95% respectively. Recurrence rate was 0.56 procedure/pt/year. Mean access blood flow at 12 months was 830 ml/min.
CONCLUSION: Double Guidewire Technique is an effective and minimally invasive procedure. By avoiding under dilation of JAS the recurrence rate resulted quite satisfactorily in our population.
