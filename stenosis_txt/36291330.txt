Title: Increased Proximal Wall Shear Stress of Basilar Artery Plaques Associated with Ruptured Fibrous Cap.

Abstract: Plaque rupture of the basilar artery is one of the leading causes of posterior circulation stroke. The present study aimed to investigate the role of fluid dynamics in the ruptured fibrous cap of basilar artery plaques. Patients with basilar artery plaques (50−99% stenosis) were screened. Integrity of the fibrous cap was assessed by high-resolution MRI. Computational fluid dynamics models were built based on MR angiography to obtain the wall shear stress and velocity. A total of 176 patients were included. High-resolution MRI identified 35 ruptured fibrous caps of basilar artery plaques. Ruptured fibrous cap was significantly associated with acute infarction (27/35 vs. 96/141, p < 0.05) in the territory of the basilar artery. Proximal wall shear stress of stenosis was positively related with the ruptured fibrous cap (OR 1.564; 95% CI, 1.101−2.222; p = 0.013). The threshold of wall shear stress for the ruptured fibrous cap of basilar artery plaques was 4.84 Pa (Area under ROC 0.732, p = 0.008, 95%CI 0.565−0.899). The present study demonstrated that increased proximal wall shear stress of stenosis was associated with ruptured fibrous caps of basilar artery plaques.
