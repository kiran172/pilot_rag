Title: A new ureteroileal anastomosis technique in modified ileal orthotopic bladder substitution after radical cystectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to describe a modified technique in ileal orthotopic bladder substitution with a new ureteroileal anastomosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: After a classic open radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed extraperitoneally, a 56-cm ileal segment was used to construct the spheroidal shape bladder substitution. The 8-cm long proximal and distal ends of the ileal segment were used as afferent limbs. Two-centimeter ileal segments of afferent limbs were detubularized and transversally tubularized. The elongated ileal tube was anastomosed with the ureter in an end-to-end fashion. The pathway of the ureteroileal anastomosis was placed between the abdominal cutaneous fat and the anterior rectus muscular sheath. Perioperative data and long-term functional outcomes were assessed. Between December 2011 and December 2015, seven male patients underwent this procedure with a median 46 (30-77) months follow-up in our hospital. There was no difference between preoperative and postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rates (Z = - 1.693, P = 0.09). One of 14 sides had ureteroileal anastomotic stenosis; two of 14 sides in one patient had ureteroileal anastomotic stenosis caused by invasion of pelvic recurrence 15â€‰months postoperatively. Reflux was completely prevented by placing pressure on the corresponding point on the abdominal surface when voiding urine in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a feasible technique modification in detail, which provides some advantages for effective anti-reflux by mechanical finger pressing and abdominal contraction, a low incidence of stricture, and ease for a secondary operation in the long-term follow-up period.
