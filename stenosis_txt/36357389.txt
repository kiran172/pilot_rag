Title: Vascular endothelium deploys caveolin-1 to regulate oligodendrogenesis after chronic cerebral ischemia in mice.

Abstract: Oligovascular coupling contributes to white matter vascular homeostasis. However, little is known about the effects of oligovascular interaction on oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) changes in chronic cerebral ischemia. Here, using a mouse of bilateral carotid artery stenosis, we show a gradual accumulation of OPCs on vasculature with impaired oligodendrogenesis. Mechanistically, chronic ischemia induces a substantial loss of endothelial caveolin-1 (Cav-1), leading to vascular secretion of heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α). Endothelial-specific over-expression of Cav-1 or genetic knockdown of vascular HSP90α restores normal vascular-OPC interaction, promotes oligodendrogenesis and attenuates ischemic myelin damage. miR-3074(-1)-3p is identified as a direct inducer of Cav-1 reduction in mice and humans. Endothelial uptake of nanoparticle-antagomir improves myelin damage and cognitive deficits dependent on Cav-1. In summary, our findings demonstrate that vascular abnormality may compromise oligodendrogenesis and myelin regeneration through endothelial Cav-1, which may provide an intercellular mechanism in ischemic demyelination.
