Title: Incidence and Predictive Factors of Chronic Vessel Enlargement After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Severely Stenotic and Occluded Lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic vessel enlargement (CVE) of the coronary artery is observed in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for severely stenotic or occluded lesions. Recently, the presence of a peri-medial high-echoic band (PHB) identified by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been reported to correlate with this phenomenon. We sought to assess the incidence, predictive factors of CVE, and association between CVE and PHB.
METHODS: From January 2017 to December 2018, 97 patients, with 101 severely stenotic and occluded lesions, who underwent IVUS-guided PCI and a 9-month follow-up angiography were enrolled. CVE was defined as more than a 10% increase of distal lumen gain at follow-up angiography. All lesions were stratified into 2 groups: CVE group and non-CVE group. Clinical outcomes were compared and predictive factors for CVE were assessed. Relationships between PHB angle and CVE were also assessed.
RESULTS: At follow-up angiography, CVE was observed in 27 lesions (26.7%, 27/101). PHBs were frequently observed in the CVE group (88.9%), which was significantly higher than that in the non-CVE group (40.5%). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of PHB was the only predictive factor for CVE (odds ratio, 11.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.95-43.0; p < 0.001). In addition, a linear relationship was observed between the incidence of CVE and PHB angle. The number of patients with CVE significantly increased in cases with a PHB angle more than 180 degrees.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of PHB strongly predicts CVE after PCI for severely stenotic or occluded lesions.
