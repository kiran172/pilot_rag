Title: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) in patients with symptomatic intracranial vertebrobasilar artery stenosis (IVBS).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of all transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and ischaemic strokes occur within the posterior circulation, with vertebrobasilar stenosis identified as the cause in roughly 25% of the cases. Studies have shown that about a quarter of these patients have atherosclerotic stenosis of at least 50% of the vertebrobasilar artery. Stenosis has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of 90-day recurrent vertebrobasilar stroke, particularly in the first few weeks, which is significantly higher when compared with patients with stenosis of the anterior circulation. Therefore, aggressive treatment is important for the patient's prognosis. Stenting is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy for persistent ischaemia events that do not respond to the best medical treatment, but it is not without complications. We systematically reviewed the literature on percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) for intracranial vertebrobasilar artery stenosis (IVBS).
METHODS: PubMed, Web-of-Science and Scopus were searched upon the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to include prospective/retrospective cohort, randomised/non-randomised clinical trials and case series studies describing PTAS for IVBS. Pooled rates of intervention-related complications and outcomes were analysed with random-effect model meta-analysis using StataMP V.18.0 software.
RESULTS: 31 studies were found eligible which included 1928 cases. 1103 basilar artery stenosis cases were reported in 27 studies 0.65 (95% CI 0.53, 0.76), I2: 99.72%. 648 vertebral cases were reported in 18 studies 0.60 (95% CI 0.49, 0.70), I2: 97.49%. In four studies, the rate of vertebrobasilar stenosis cases calculated as a proportion of the total sample size was 0.10 (95% CI 0.05, 0. 15). Mean stenosis in 21 included studies was found to be 0.83 (95% CI 0.79, 0.88), I2: 0.00%, which shows variation of baseline stenosis between studies was minimal. 51 deaths were recorded in 24 studies. Meta-analysis of mortality showed the overall rate of mortality was 0.03 (95% CI 0.02, 0.05), I2: 44.90%. In 14 studies, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage events were recorded at an overall rate of 0.01 (95% CI 0.00, 0.02), I2: 0.00%. Generally, a follow-up period of at least 3 months was reported in the included studies. Furthermore, procedural stroke/TIA was evaluated in seven studies, four of which reported no events (0.03 (95% CI 0.00, 0.08), I2: 20.38%). Mean time from initial symptoms to recanalisation was 23.98 (95% CI 18.56, 29.40), I2=98.8%, p=0.00 days.
CONCLUSION: In certain individuals with medically unresolved, severe, symptomatic and non-acute IVBS, elective vertebrobasilar PTAS appears to be both safe and effective. Various stent designs and angioplasty-assisted techniques should be taken into consideration based on the specific clinical and radiological traits of the lesions. Future randomised controlled trials are required to verify these results.
