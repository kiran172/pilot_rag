Title: Konno-Rastan Operation in a Patient With Dextrocardia and Situs Inversus.

Abstract: The Konno-Rastan operation is performed for relief of complex left ventricular outflow obstruction with a small aortic annulus. When associated with situs inversus and dextrocardia, important aspects should be kept in mind due to the mirror-image anatomy. In this report, we present a case of a 10-year-old child with the diagnosis of recurrent diffuse subaortic stenosis and situs inversus and dextrocardia who underwent the Konno-Rastan operation successfully and was asymptomatic with normal physical activity after a follow-up period of one year.
