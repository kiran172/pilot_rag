Title: [How do I investigate... the vulnerability of a carotid artery plaque in 2024].

Abstract: Carotid artery atherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of stroke. Even though the association between the risk of stroke and the level of morphological stenosis of a carotid plaque has been known for a long time, growing evidence has since proven necessary to assess the composition of the plaque itself to identify vulnerability predictors. These vulnerable plaques, even more if non-stenosing, may be responsible for a significant - but hard to quantify - proportion of strokes so far classified cryptogenic. As a matter of fact, plaque composition may escape detection and characterisation with classical imaging. Several biomarkers associated with its vulnerability to destabilization and with the risk of stroke such as intraplaque hemorrhage and inflammation are now routinely assessable. After a few pathophysiological reminders and a critical reading of the historical literature concerning carotid artery atherosclerosis management, we will review in this article the imaging techniques that can be used in the routine work-up of a carotid atherosclerotic plaque, with a focus on vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging and contrast enhanced ultrasonography.
