Title: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with a silicon nitride cage demonstrates early radiographic fusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Degeneration of the lumbar spine is common in aging adults and reflects a significant morbidity burden in this population. In selected patients that prove unresponsive to non-surgical treatment, posterior lumbar fusion (PLF) surgery, with or without adjunctive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) can relieve pain and improve function. We describe here the radiographic fusion rates for PLF versus TLIF, using an intervertebral spinal cage made of silicon nitride ceramic (chemical formula Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis enrolled 99 patients from August 2013 to January 2017; 17 had undergone PLF at 24 levels, while 82 had undergone TLIF at 104 levels. All operations were performed by a single surgeon at one institution. Radiographic and clinical outcomes were compared between PLF and TLIF at 2 and 6 weeks and then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.
RESULTS: TLIF patients fused at higher rates compared to PLF at the 3-month (38.5% vs. 8.3%, P=0.006), 6-month (78.7% vs. 35.0%, P&lt;0.001) and 12-month time periods (97.9% vs. 81.3%, P=0.018), with no difference at 24 months (100% vs. 94.4%, P=0.102). Index level segmental motion was significantly less and intervertebral disc height was improved in TLIF over PLF at all follow up intervals. Foraminal height was only greater in early follow up periods (2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months). TLIF patients experienced lover rates of PI-LL mismatch which was maintained across long term follow-up. Pelvic tilt was lower following TLIF compared to PLF, with no differences in complication rates between study groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective series demonstrated that TLIF performed with silicon nitride interbody cages led to earlier radiographic fusion, greater restoration of disc and foraminal height, increased segmental rigidity and improved sagittal alignment when compared to PLF alone.
