Title: Full-endoscopic bilateral over-the-top decompression in lumbar central stenosis: surgical technique and outcomes.

Abstract: Decompression of spinal stenosis represents one of the most commonly performed procedures in spine surgery. With constantly increasing patient age and changing demographics, reducing the invasiveness of surgical procedures has become increasingly important. Over the past decades, microsurgical decompression has been established as a gold standard technique for the surgical treatment of spinal stenosis. In comparison with open techniques or surgeries that were performed with loop lenses, which required larger skin incisions, and which consecutively raised the access-related collateral damage, the microscope served to significantly reduce the invasiveness of the decompression interventions. Advantages included smaller skin incisions, reduced collateral tissue damage, less blood loss, lower infection rates and wound healing problems, shorter hospital stay, and multiple others, as widely known across various MIS techniques. For the same reasons as outlined above, the introduction of full-endoscopic surgical techniques aims to further reduce the invasiveness of surgical interventions. The present manuscript provides a delineation of the surgical technique of LE-ULBD (Lumbar Endoscopic Unilateral Laminotomy for Bilateral Decompression), gives an overview on the current state of literature, and aims to put this surgery into context with other currently available decompression techniques.
