Title: Identification and Clinical Significance of Heart Murmurs in Puppies Involved in Puppy Trade.

Abstract: The detection of a congenital heart defect at purchase is an important step in early detection from a clinical and legal standpoint. Indeed, some cardiac abnormalities may be corrected with surgery, and very often, treatment needs to be performed early before congestive heart failure or irreversible heart damage can occur. From a legal viewpoint, if the defect is revealed in a newly purchased puppy, the buyer may be required to return it and receive compensation. Puppies affected with congenital heart defects are likely to die prematurely, causing emotional suffering to the owner. Furthermore, by considering breed predisposition, early recognition allows breeders to avoid breeding from particular dogs with genetic defects and prevent the continuation of genetic defects in breeding lines. Given gaps in the literature about the recognition of murmurs in the puppy trade, the present article describes how to identify a heart murmur in a puppy during a pre-purchase examination and its significance from a clinical and legal viewpoint. In the canine population, the prevalence of cardiac defects ranges between 0.13 and 1.6%. Pulmonic stenosis is the most common defect found in puppies, followed by patent ductus arteriosus, subaortic stenosis, and ventricular septal defect. On the basis of the above considerations, the veterinarian should recognize and identify the murmur following a protocol for routine examination of puppies involved in trade.
