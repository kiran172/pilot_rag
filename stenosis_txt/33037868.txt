Title: A novel technique to manage transcatheter aortic valve embolization.

Abstract: We report a case of a 69-year-old male who was planned for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a 26 mm Sapien 3 Valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California) for the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. During rapid ventricular pacing and implantation of the TAVR valve, there was a loss of pacing capture and subsequent embolization of the valve into the aortic arch. Retrieval of the embolized valve was attempted unsuccessfully using several techniques. Finally, by using a 34 mm Evolut R Valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota), we were able to secure the embolized valve in the transverse segment of the aortic arch without compromising the branch vessels. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of using a valve-in-valve approach to fixate an embolized valve in the transverse aorta.
