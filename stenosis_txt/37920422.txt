Title: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Do We Still Need Microscope Surgery in Hepatic Artery Anastomosis to Decrease the Incidence of Complications in Living Donor Liver Transplantation?

Abstract: Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is the most serious vascular complication after liver transplantation (LT). Moreover, in comparison to deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT), hepatic artery (HA) anastomosis is more challenging in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) with a lot of controversial topics about the use of microscopic surgery. We aimed to compare the use of microscopic and loupe surgery in HA anastomosis in adult and pediatric LDLT to decrease the incidence of vascular complications. We searched PubMed, Scopes, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for eligible studies from inception to April 2023 and a systematic review and a meta-analysis were done. According to our eligibility criteria, 10 studies with a total of 1939 patients were included. In comparison to microscopic surgery, loupe anastomosis has a similar incidence of HAT (thrombosis, risk ratio (RR) = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.26-3.48, P = 0.95).Â In addition to that, no significant difference was detected between the two types in terms of stenosis, decreased blood flow and hospital stay (decreased blood flow, RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.01-86.65, P = 0.88), (stenosis, RR = 1.81, 95% CI = 0.19-17.21, P = 0.60), (hospital stay, mean deviation (MD) = 1.16, 95% CI = -3.79-6.11, P = 0.65). However, the anastomotic time was longer in the case of microscopic surgery (anastomotic time, MD = 24.09, 95% CI = 7.79-40.39, P = 0.004). With an equal incidence of complications and longer anastomotic time, there is no added benefit of the routine use of microscopic surgery in HA anastomosis in LDLT.
