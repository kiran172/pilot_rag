Title: First-in-human experience of preload regulation with percutaneous transluminal caval flow regulation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients.

Abstract: AIMS: This study aims to investigate the acute haemodynamic effects of percutaneous transluminal flow regulation (PTCR®) with an inferior vena cava regulator balloon in heart failure patients. Preload reduction in heart failure has been achieved with high potency diuretics. However, no study has been conducted in humans to assess the effect of inferior vena cava intermittent occlusion for preload reduction.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Six patients were included in the study: four men (55 ± 6 years old) and two women (63 ± 4 years old). Baseline evaluations included Doppler echocardiogram, coronary angiogram, and right heart catheterization. Caval balloon was kept inflated for 30 min, and right catheterization and control echocardiogram were performed while the balloon was still inflated. The balloon was then deflated and removed. Right haemodynamic variables were evaluated before balloon insertion and with the inflated balloon. The mean right atrial pressure decreased by 42.59% (P = 0.005); systolic right ventricular pressure decreased by 30.19% (P < 0.003); mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased by 25.33% (P < 0.043); mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased by 31.37% (P > 0.016); and cardiac output increased by 9.92% (P < 0.175).
CONCLUSIONS: The haemodynamic and echocardiographic changes obtained in our study using PTCR® suggest that this innovative approach can play a beneficial role in the heart failure treatment.
