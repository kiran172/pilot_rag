Title: Robot-Assisted Aortic Valve Replacement　- First Clinical Report in Japan.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted valve surgery represents the latest development in the field of minimally invasive approaches. Robotic assistance may provide greater visualization, enhanced dexterity, and greater precision than traditional mini-thoracotomy aortic valve replacement.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Aortic valve replacement operations using the da Vinci Xi Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) were performed on 2 patients, 1 with severe aortic insufficiency and the other with aortic stenosis. Both patients had an uneventful postoperative course and were discharged without any adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted assisted aortic valve replacement appears feasible and safe in limited cases.
