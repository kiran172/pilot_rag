Title: Outcome of modified interlaminar decompression: A conservative decompressive surgery for lumbar spine stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of modified interlaminar decompression in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: This descriptive observational study was conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar from July 2014 to June 2018. All patients with degenerative LSS who underwent modified interlaminar decompression during the study period were included in the study. The patients were followed up to one year after surgery. The data was entered into a structured questionnaire designed according to the study which was then analyzed using SPSS version 21.
RESULTS: A total of 182 LSS cases were included in the study and 236 levels were operated during the study period. According to the records increased prevalence of LSS was found among males i.e. 58.8%. The common level with degenerative stenosis involved was L4-5. Good to excellent outcomes were observed in 93.9% patients in the 1st follow-up visit. The most common complication of surgery was dural tear followed by wound infection.
CONCLUSION: Modified interlaminar decompression is a conservative surgical technique, proved to be a potential approach with acceptable complications, satisfactory outcomes and it is easy to learn.
