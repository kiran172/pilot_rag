Title: [Improving surgical technique for tracheal resection with anastomosis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To present modern aspects of improving surgical techniques in tracheal resection developed in recent years.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors have the most extensive experience in tracheal surgery (>2.000 patients over the past 50 years). Diagnostic capabilities, perioperative management and surgical techniques have changed over such a long period. This concerns the proposed classification of cicatricial tracheal stenosis, features of endoscopic and X-ray diagnostics, indications for various surgeries, choice of surgical approach, technique of tracheal tube mobilization and anastomosis after tracheal excision. Preventive measures for severe postoperative complications are described.
CONCLUSION: Such an extensive experience allowed the authors to develop an algorithm for the treatment of patients with tracheal stenosis. This significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality. Replication of such equipment is associated with technical support of hospitals and professional level of specialists consisting of endoscopist, anesthesiologist, intensive care specialist and thoracic surgeon.
