Title: Comparison of clinical examination, doppler and fistulogram for arterio-venous fistula surveillance in detecting secondary failure.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) surveillance is required to detect early dysfunction (thrombosis, stenosis) and its timely correction prolongs access-patency. Clinical examination (CE) and doppler have been used as screening/surveillance of AVF, for early detection of AVF dysfunction. Since there was inadequate evidence for KDOQI to make recommendations on AVF surveillance and on secondary failure rate. We compared CE, doppler and fistulogram as surveillance modalities in detecting a secondary failure in matured AVF.
METHODOLOGY: This prospective-observational, single-center study, was done between December 2019-April 2021. CKD stage 5 patients on dialysis/Not-on-dialysis with matured AVF were included at third month. CE, doppler (blood flow, vein diameter, depth), and fistulogram were done at third and sixth month. Secondary failure was assessed at sixth month classifying AVF to patent/functional and failed group. Diagnostic tests were performed by comparing three methods considering fistulogram as gold-standard. Residual urine output is also monitored to look for any contrast induced residual renal function loss.
RESULTS: Of total 407 created AVF, 98 (24%) had primary failure. Twenty-five (6%) had surgical complications including unsuccessful AVF and aneurysm/rupture, 156 lost follow-up at third month, 104 consented patients were enrolled, 16 lost to follow-up subsequently, and 88 patients' data were analyzed at the end. At the sixth month, 76(86.4%) had patent AVF, 8 (9.1%) had secondary failure (Thrombosis-4, Central Venous Stenosis-4), and 4 (4.1%) patients expired. Considering fistulogram as a diagnostic standard, CE showed 87.5% sensitivity, and 93.4% specificity (cohen's kappa value of 0.66). Doppler had sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 96% respectively (cohen's kappa value of 0.75), Combination of clinical examination with doppler showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 89% respectively.
CONCLUSION: Although the secondary AVF failure rate is less than the primary, CE is an important and valuable tool in the diagnosis and surveillance of AVF in detecting its dysfunction. Moreover, CE with doppler can be used as a surveillance protocol that can detect early AVF dysfunction at par with Fistulogram.
