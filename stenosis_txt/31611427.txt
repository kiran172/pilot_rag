Title: Hemopericardium Following Transseptal Puncture During Balloon Mitral Valvotomy: Management Strategies and Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hemopericardium is a major complication of balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). Only a few studies are available to address this issue following transseptal access. In addition, the management strategy regarding completion of BMV is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the incidence of hemopericardium complicating transseptal puncture during BMV. In addition, the management strategy adopted and outcomes are highlighted.
METHODS: This prospective study included 29 consecutive patients who developed hemopericardium following transseptal access during BMV.
RESULTS: Out of 1424 patients who underwent BMV, hemopericardium developed in 29 patients following transseptal access (2.0%). The mean age of the study cohort was 36.9 Â± 13.7 years and 82.8% were women. A second transseptal puncture was done and BMV was completed in 26 patients (89.6%). An acceptable hemodynamic result was obtained in 22 patients (84.6%). Six patients (20.7%) underwent emergency surgery for hemopericardium. The sites of perforation were inferior vena cava-right atrial junction in 4 cases, left atrial posterior wall in 1 case, and left atrial appendage in 1 case. In addition to repair of the perforation, a total of 2 patients underwent mitral valve replacement and 1 patient underwent open mitral commissurotomy. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of hemopericardium complicating transseptal access during BMV was 2.0%, and was associated with a mortality rate of 6.9%. BMV can be safely performed in the same sitting with a second transseptal puncture, in patients with a favorable valve morphology. Surgical intervention can be reserved for a subset of patients with persistent pericardial collection.
