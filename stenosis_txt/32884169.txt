Title: The effects of manual manipulation therapy on pain and dysfunction in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: [Purpose] This study investigated the effects of manual manipulation therapy on the pain and dysfunction of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. [Participants and Methods] In this study, 30 patients with chronic back pain were evenly divided into an experimental group, who received manual traction therapy, and a control group, who received intermittent traction therapy. Both groups received therapy three times a week for eight weeks. A visual analogue scale was used to measure participants' back pain, and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) was used to check the functional impediment they experienced as a result. [Results] The intragroup comparison showed that the visual analog scale and the ODI significantly decreased in the control group and the experimental group, respectively. The intergroup comparison after treatment showed that the visual analog scale and the ODI of the experimental group were significantly lower than in the control group. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that manual manipulation therapy is an effective intervention for treating pain and dysfunction in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
