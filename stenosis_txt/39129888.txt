Title: Outcomes Following Balloon Pulmonary Valvuloplasty in Symptomatic Neonates With Tetralogy of Fallot-A CCRC Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complete repair (CR) can be delayed in neonates with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot (sTOF) using surgical or transcatheter palliation to relieve cyanosis. Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) is an established treatment for pulmonary valve stenosis; however, its effectiveness in palliating neonates with sTOF has not been well investigated.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review between 2005 and 2017 on neonates with sTOF who underwent initial BPV from 9 participating centers of the Congenital Cardiac Research Collaborative was performed. Primary outcome was CR at >30 days after BPV without interval reintervention (RI).
RESULTS: In total, 47 neonates with sTOF underwent BPV, of whom 27 (57%) underwent CR at &gt;30 days after BPV without RI. The median time to CR was 151 days (106-210). RI before CR occurred in 17 patients (36%): surgical shunt (n = 7), outflow tract stenting (n = 6), patent ductus arteriosus stenting (n = 2), and surgical outflow patch (n = 2). Valve-sparing repair at CR was performed in 6 patients (13%) after initial BPV. RI or CR â‰¤30 days from BPV was associated with smaller infundibular diastolic diameter (P = .004). An infundibular diastolic diameter of &lt;3.4 mm demonstrated 75% sensitivity and 67% specificity to predict early CR or RI.
CONCLUSIONS: BPV can be an effective palliative therapy in select neonates with sTOF to delay CR. A smaller diastolic infundibulum diameter is a predictor of RI or early CR, and valve-sparing repair is uncommon, making patient selection and alternative palliative methods key when considering BPV palliation in neonates with sTOF.
