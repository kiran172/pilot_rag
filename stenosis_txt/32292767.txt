Title: Disobliteration of an Occluded Common Carotid Artery with Patent Bifurcation via Antegrade Ring Stripping.

Abstract: There is a lack of guidelines concerning common carotid artery (CCA) occlusive disease in the presence of a patent internal carotid artery (ICA). A novel surgical technique that disobliterates an occluded CCA was successfully performed in three cases. The detailed surgical steps are presented herein. After proximal division of the CCA behind the sternoclavicular junction, the occluded CCA was endarterectomized via antegrade ring stripping. After removal of the atheromatous core, the CCA was everted, and the wall remnants were cleaned under direct vision. Simultaneous eversion endarterectomy of the ICA was performed when necessary. After reversion of the CCA, it was transposed and anastomosed to the ipsilateral subclavian artery distal to the orifice of the vertebral artery. This novel technique can be used in selected cases by experienced surgeons.
