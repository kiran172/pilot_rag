Title: Perioperative left ventricular perforation in incomplete TAVI and completion of the procedure after surgical repair.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) continues to grow worldwide. Despite increased operator experience, evolution of the technique, and deflectable catheters, major complications still occur in ≤ 6% up to 8% of cases. Such major complications have been associated with a 2- to threefold increase in 30-day mortality. Complications specifically involving the aorta, aortic valve annulus, or left ventricle are rare, occurring in only 0.2-1.1% of cases.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 65-year-old female patient with left ventricular lateral wall perforation during incomplete implantation of a TAVI device, and successive percutaneous completion after surgical repair of the lesion under cardiopulmonary bypass. The surgical strategy and the type of surgical treatment depend on the type of perforation. In general, repair of the lesion and aortic valve replacement are performed. Removal of the TAVI prosthesis and excision of the native aortic valve are standard parts of this repair.
CONCLUSION: Here we propose a safe alternative for the completion of the TAVI approach after surgical repair, which requires close coordination between the members of the heart team (anesthesiologist, perfusionist, cardiologist, nurse and cardiac surgeon).
