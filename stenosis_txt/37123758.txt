Title: Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage Due to Spontaneous Renal Rupture as the First Presentation of Antiphospholipid Syndrome: A Case Report.

Abstract: Spontaneous renal rupture (SRR) with retroperitoneal hemorrhage is an extremely rare medical emergency and is rather challenging for the surgical team. Management of SRR often requires surgical intervention and nephrectomy as it is life-threatening. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is an autoimmune disease that affects several organs, including kidneys, causing significant abnormalities. Current data suggest that APLS can result in renal artery stenosis, renal vein thrombosis, arterial hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy, and antiphospholipid syndrome nephropathy where there is renal involvement. Here, we report the case of a 49-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with sudden-onset abdominal pain in the context of retroperitoneal bleeding due to SRR. The patient developed hemodynamic instability and underwent a total nephrectomy. The surgical specimen revealed APLS-related lesions. Serological tests confirmed the diagnosis of APLS, which was managed with acenocoumarol and hydroxychloroquine. Since then, he has not experienced any thromboembolic or hemorrhagic episodes. This article aims to present for the first time a case of SRR as the first presentation of APLS as well as to analyze the possible associated mechanisms.
