Title: The common pathobiology between coronary artery disease and calcific aortic stenosis: Evidence and clinical implications.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAS), the most prevalent valvular disease worldwide, has been demonstrated to frequently occur in conjunction with coronary artery disease (CAD), the third leading cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerosis has been proven to be the main mechanism involved in CAS and CAD. Evidence also exists that obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (among others), along with specific genes involved in lipid metabolism, are important risk factors for CAS and CAD, leading to common pathological processes of atherosclerosis in both diseases. Therefore, it has been suggested that CAS could also be used as a marker of CAD. An understanding of the commonalities between the two conditions may improve therapeutic strategies for treating both CAD and CAS. This review explores the common pathogenesis and disparities between CAS and CAD, alongside their etiology. It also discusses clinical implications and provides evidence-based recommendations for the clinical management of both diseases.
