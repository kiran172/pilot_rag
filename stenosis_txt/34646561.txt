Title: Anastomotic stenosis of a reconstructed dissecting superior mesenteric artery aneurysm undetectable by intraoperative indocyanine green angiography: A case report.

Abstract: Intraoperative evaluation of blood flow using ICG angiography revealed no significant abnormality. However, the anastomotic stenosis was revealed by postoperative CT angiography; more precise intraoperative evaluation methods need to be developed.
