Title: Association between the atherogenic index of plasma and carotid artery plaques in patients with coronary heart disease in different glucose metabolism states: an RCSCD-TCM study in Tianjin, China.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is considered a powerful biomarker of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis (AS). However, limited evidence is available regarding the relationship between the AIP and carotid artery plaques (CAPs) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).
METHODS: This retrospective study included 9281 patients with CHD who underwent carotid ultrasound. Participants were divided according to the AIP tertiles: T1, AIP < 1.02; T2, 1.02 ≤ AIP < 1.25; and T3, AIP ≥ 1.25. The presence or absence of CAPs was assessed using carotid ultrasound. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between the AIP and CAPs in patients with CHD. The relationship between the AIP and CAPs was assessed according to sex, age, and glucose metabolic status.
RESULTS: The baseline characteristics revealed significant differences in related parameters among patients with CHD after stratification into the three groups according to the AIP tertiles. Compared with T1, the odds ratio (OR) of T3 in patients with CHD was 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.35-1.74). The association between AIP and CAPs was higher in females (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.38-1.92) than in males (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.12-1.70). The OR for patients aged ≤60 years (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.14-1.71) was lower than that for patients aged >60 years (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.26-1.76). AIP was significantly associated with the risk of CAPs formation in different glucose metabolic states, with diabetes having the highest OR value (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.19-1.43).
CONCLUSION: The AIP and CAPs were significantly associated in patients with CHD, and the association was higher in female than in male patients. The association was lower in patients aged ≤60 years than in patients aged >60 years. Under different glucose metabolism statuses, the association between the AIP and the CAPs among patients with CHD was highest in patients with diabetes.
