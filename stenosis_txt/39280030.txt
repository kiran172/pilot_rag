Title: Tongue color parameters in predicting the degree of coronary stenosis: a retrospective cohort study of 282 patients with coronary angiography.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze the relationship between tongue color and coronary artery stenosis severity in 282 patients after underwent coronary angiography.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to collect data from patients who underwent coronary angiography in the Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Jiading District Central Hospital from October 1, 2023 to January 15, 2024. All patients were divided into four various stenosis groups. The tongue images of each patient was normalized captured, tongue body (TC_) and tongue coating (CC_) data were converted into RGB and HSV model parameters using SMX System 2.0. Four supervised machine learning classifiers were used to establish a coronary artery stenosis grading prediction model, including random forest (RF), logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM). Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used as classification indicators to evaluate the training and validation performance of the model. SHAP values were furthermore used to explore the impacts of features.
RESULTS: This study finally included 282 patients, including 164 males (58.16%) and 118 females (41.84%). 69 patients without stenosis, 70 patients with mild stenosis, 65 patients with moderate stenosis, and 78 patients with severe stenosis. Significant differences of tongue parameters were observed in the four groups [TC_R (P = 0.000), TC_G (P = 0.003), TC_H (P = 0.001) and TC_S (P = 0.024),CC_R (P = 0.006), CC_B (P = 0.023) and CC_S (P = 0.001)]. The SVM model had the highest predictive ability, with AUC values above 0.9 in different stenosis groups, and was particularly good at identifying mild and severe stenosis (AUC = 0.98). SHAP value showed that high values of TC_RIGHT_R, low values of CC_LEFT_R were the most impact factors to predict no coronary stenosis; high CC_LEFT_R and low TC_ROOT_H for mild coronary stenosis; low TC_ROOT_R and CC_ROOT_B for moderate coronary stenosis; high CC_RIGHT_G and low TC_ROOT_H for severe coronary stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Tongue color parameters can provide a reference for predicting the degree of coronary artery stenosis. The study provides insights into the potential application of tongue color parameters in predicting coronary artery stenosis severity. Future research can expand on tongue features, optimize prediction models, and explore applications in other cardiovascular diseases.
