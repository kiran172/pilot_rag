Title: Successful Long-term Anticoagulation with Enoxaparin in a Patient with a Mechanical Heart Valve.

Abstract: Thromboembolism related to a mechanical heart valve (MHV) is a major complication after surgical valve replacement. Warfarin remains as guideline-endorsed thromboprophylaxis in patients with MHVs. Alternative anticoagulation therapy for patients who do not tolerate or who fail warfarin is not adequately covered in the current guidelines. We report a case of successful long-term anticoagulation with enoxaparin in a patient with a mechanical aortic valve who had a contraindication to warfarin. The patient developed a left thigh hematoma requiring surgical evacuation 1 month after initiation of weight-based dosing of enoxaparin. His dose was then titrated based on peak anti-factor Xa levels (goal 0.6-1.0 IU/ml). He remained free of signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events, valve dysfunction, bleeding complications, or major adverse effects from long-term enoxaparin use for the next 13 years. Our case provides promising evidence of the potential role of enoxaparin in patients with MHVs in whom warfarin thromboprophylaxis is not possible. Meticulous monitoring of anti-factor Xa levels and dosage adjustments are crucial to treatment success.
