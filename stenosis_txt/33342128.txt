Title: [Efficacy of acellular dermis matrix combined with cervical strap muscle as a composite tissue flap for the treatment of laryngeal cancer].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the clinical efficacy of acellular dermis matrix combined with cervical strap muscle (ADM-CSM) as a composite tissue flap for repairing the laryngeal defect after partial laryngectomy. Methods: The medical records of 33 patients with laryngeal cancer who were diagnosed and treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 2014 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients consisted of 32 males and 1 female with age range from 39 to 76 years. Laryngeal defects were repaired with ADM-CSM in 14 patients (2 for supraglottic laryngeal cancer, 12 for glottic laryngeal cancer) and with CSM fascial flaps in 19 patients (3 for supraglottic laryngeal cancer, 16 for glottic laryngeal cancer). Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the 3-year overall survival and local control rate. The functions of voice and swallowing after operation were evaluated by voice handicap index-30 (VHI-30) and MD Anderson dysphagia inventory. Univariate logistic regression analysis, t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the variables between the two groups. Results: The incidence of laryngeal stenosis was 2/14 in ADM-CSM group and 4/19 in CSM group. In the ADM-CSM group, 3-year overall survival and local control rates were 92.9% and 85.7%, respectively. In the CSM group, 3-year overall survival and local control rates were 78.9% and 84.2%, respectively. The time of operation(3 h vs. 4 h, Z=193.5, P&lt;0.05), time of retaining the feeding tube(14 d vs. 17 d, Z=206.0, P&lt;0.05), and length of stay(18.5 d vs. 22.1 d, t=-2.62, P&lt;0.05) in the ADM-CSM group were significantly less than those in the CSM group. The quality of voice in the CSM group was better than that in the ADM-CSM group (66.85±27.65 vs.45.80±23.19, t=2.19, P&lt;0.05), while swallowing function in the ADM-CSM group was better than that in the ACSM group (80.00[60.00, 80.00]vs.60.00[40.00, 80.00], Z=48.0, P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: ADM-CSM is user-friendly control and safe composite tissue flap for repairing the laryngeal defect after partial laryngectomy, with less scar hyperplasia and higher satisfaction of swallowing function after operation.
