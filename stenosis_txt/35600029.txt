Title: Long-segment restrictive tear of radial artery under ultrasound guide for arteriovenous fistula by PTA: A case report.

Abstract: Considerable calcification and stenosis frequently occur in the radial artery (RA) in diabetic nephropathy. PTA was performed successfully using a balloon to expand and restrictively tear the longitudinal axis of the RA. This approach seems to be a useful measure of promoting the maturation of AVF in diabetic nephropathy.
