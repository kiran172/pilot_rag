Title: Melody Valve Implantation in the Tricuspid Position After Pediatric Heart Transplantation-A Case Report.

Abstract: Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is common after a heart transplant and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The incidence ranges from 34% immediately after transplant to 20% by 10 years. Most patients can be managed medically; however, severe TR and symptomatic right heart failure warrant tricuspid valve replacement. The use of Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve in the tricuspid position is previously described. We report a unique case of posttransplant severe TR treated with surgical bioprosthetic tricuspid valve replacement who subsequently underwent successful transcatheter Melody valve placement in tricuspid position for progressive bioprosthetic valve stenosis with 11 years of follow-up.
