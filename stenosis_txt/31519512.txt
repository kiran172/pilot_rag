Title: Outcomes of atherectomy for lower extremity ischemia in an office endovascular center.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of infrainguinal artery revascularization via atherectomy supplemented with other endovascular techniques in an office endovascular center (OEC) setting.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted examining 352 lower extremity atherectomy revascularization procedures between 2011 and 2016 at an OEC by five board-certified vascular surgeons. Patients received laser atherectomy or orbital atherectomy followed by angioplasty or angioplasty and stent placement as needed. Reintervention was indicated based on evidence of clinical symptoms and imaging studies. Demographics, vessel-specific data, treatment information, and outcome of procedures were recorded. Data analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.
RESULTS: Lower extremity atherectomy was carried out in 282 patients in 352 limbs with average age of 69 ± 11 years. Technical success of <30% residual stenosis by angiogram was achieved in 571/594 vessels treated. Within 30 days of procedure, 23/352 limbs required major amputation resulting from pre-existing disease, ranging from 3 Rutherford class 4, 17 Rutherford class 5, to 3 Rutherford class 6 limbs. No 30-day mortality was noted. The primary patency of the 571 treated vessels at 12 months was 90%, and 84% at 29 months. The patency of treated vessels that reached >50% stenosis on follow-up and required reintervention (51/571 vessels) or did not require reintervention (79/571) was 72% and 87% at 23 months' follow-up, respectively, with no difference in risk of occlusion identified (P = .181). There was a significantly increased risk of occlusion for vessels treated with laser atherectomy as compared with orbital atherectomy (odds ratio, 2.552; 95% confidence interval, 1.375-4.735; P = .003). No significant difference in risk of occlusion was found between treatment with atherectomy and angioplasty (466/571 vessels) compared with atherectomy, angioplasty, and stenting (102/571) with secondary patency of 90% and 85% at 6 months' follow-up, respectively. There was no difference in patency between claudicants and patients with critical limb ischemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Atherectomy in conjunction with angioplasty and/or stenting has satisfactory patency with minimal complications when the procedure is carried out in an OEC. Asymptomatic >50% restenosis of treated vessels does not warrant reintervention unless the patient presents with clinical symptoms. Various atherectomy devices may result in different outcomes.
