Title: [Preliminary progress in the study of the relationship between COVID-19 infection and partial arterial or venous diseases].

Abstract: Vascular complications are commonly associated with COVID-19 infection. Increasing reports suggest a close relationship between COVID-19 and venous thromboembolic diseases, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Furthermore, COVID-19 has been linked to various aortic diseases such as aortic valve stenosis, aortic thrombosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, and limb ischemia. Consequently, understanding the causes and treatment of these vascular complications has become a critical aspect of comprehensive COVID-19 management. This article provides a review of aortic diseases and venous thromboembolic diseases that may be associated with COVID-19, aiming to explore potential mechanisms underlying the development of these vascular conditions and discuss strategies for preventing thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.
