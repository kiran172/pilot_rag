Title: Clinical outcome of the patients with femoropopliteal artery disease after endovascular therapy: focused on drug-coated-balloon-related distal embolism detected by laser doppler flowmetry.

Abstract: Several trials have shown that paclitaxel drug-coated balloons (DCBs) significantly reduce restenosis rates. However, some reports have shown distal embolisms occurring after DCBs. No study has analyzed the clinical outcomes of patients with DCB-induced distal embolism. This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of DCB-induced distal embolism in patients with femoropopliteal artery disease. Between February 2018 and April 2019, consecutive patients (n = 32) who presented with de novo femoropopliteal artery disease and underwent endovascular therapy using DCB were retrospectively reviewed in a single-center study. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether distal embolism was detected using laser doppler flowmetry (DEL group) or not (non-DEL group). Baseline characteristics and 1-year clinical outcomes were compared between the groups. DEL was found in 44% of limbs (DEL group: n = 15, non-DEL group: n = 19). Below-the-knee arterial runoff ≤ 1 (p = 0.033), popliteal lesion (p = 0.044), ambulation difficulty (p = 0.021), and previous history of coronary artery disease (p = 0.013) were identified as predictive factors of DEL. Procedural factors, reference vessel diameter, lesion length, and total drug amount were not predictive of DEL. The overall target lesion restenosis (TLR) rate was 17.4% (n = 5). The TLR rate was not significantly different between the DEL and non-DEL groups (13.3% vs. 15.8%, p = 0.55). Severe calcification was the only significant factor for TLR (4.2% vs. 40.0%, p = 0.02). Among patients with femoropopliteal disease, there was no difference in 1-year clinical outcome between patients who underwent DEL and those who did not.
