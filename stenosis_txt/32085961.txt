Title: Hemodynamic events during carotid stenting are associated with significant periprocedural stroke and adverse events.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the impact of carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS)-related changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and preprocedural medications on periprocedural stroke in contemporary, real-world practice. This study evaluates the risk attributable to the CAS-related hemodynamic events and the impact preprocedural medications have on mitigating this risk in a large, population-based cohort.
METHODS: We studied all patients in the Vascular Quality Initiative who underwent CAS between January 2006 and December 2016. Kaplan-Meier, multivariable logistic, and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the impact of periprocedural hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, and medication use on immediate periprocedural stroke (IPPS), 30-day, and 1-year stroke.
RESULTS: Of the 13,698 CAS procedures studied, 1239 (9.1%), 1824 (13.3%), and 1333 (9.7%) patients experienced periprocedural hypertension, hypotension, and bradycardia, respectively. IPPS was 3.2% vs 2.1% vs 0.65% (P < .001), comparing patients with periprocedural hypertension vs hypotension vs normotension and 1.4 vs 1.0% (P = .19) for bradycardic vs nonbradycardic patients. Periprocedural hypertension was associated with a four-fold increase in IPPS (adjusted odd ratio [aOR], 3.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.63-5.99; P < .001). periprocedural hypotension and bradycardia were associated with 5.5-fold (aOR, 5.56; 95% CI, 3.24-9.52; P < .001) and 2.3-fold (aOR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.26-4.25; P = .007) increases in IPPS among patients with carotid symptoms. There was 76% decrease in IPPS for patients who did not experience a periprocedural hemodynamic event (aOR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.16-0.35; P < .001). Unlike preprocedural beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, prophylactic antibradyarrhythmic agents conferred a 58% reduction in IPPS among patients with carotid symptoms (aOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23-0.78; P = .006). The periprocedural hemodynamic events were also associated with 7.7-fold increase in myocardial infarction (aOR, 7.70; 95% CI, 4.77-12.45; P < .001), a 2.2-fold increase in 30-day mortality (aOR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.61-3.12; P < .001), and a 16% increase in length of stay (aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.04-2.28; P = .042). The occurrence of these hemodynamic events is higher in patients with prior cardiac disease and the difference in periprocedural outcomes extended to 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Periprocedural hemodynamic events are associated with an increase in periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, death, and length of stay. Periprocedural hypertension in all patients; hypotension and bradycardia in patients with symptomatic carotid disease are associated with significant increase in IPPS. Prophylactic antibradyarrhythmic agents are associated with decrease in bradycardia and IPPS. These results heighten the need to anticipate and promptly address these CAS-related hemodynamic events, especially in susceptible patients.
