Title: [The preliminary study of Neuroform EZ stent in the treatment of severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of Neuroform EZ stent in the treatment of severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). Methods: A total of 36 patients with severe ICAS receiving Neuroform EZ stent angioplasty were retrospectively analyzed at Beijing Anzhen Hospital from July 2018 to January 2020. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) before endovascular intervention confirmed the diagnosis. Follow-up information was reviewed by neurologists at 30 days and 6 months after the procedure. The primary endpoints were transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and death caused by any reason within 30 days. Results: The overall technical success rate was 100%. The median stenosis rate was reduced from 93.6%±4.5% to 18.8%±11.2% (t=37.36,P&lt;0.001).Primary endpoint event was not reported. During follow-up, one patient developed TIA and no death or ischemic stroke was observed. No in-stent restenosis at six months occurred. Conclusion: Neuroform EZ stent is safe and effective in patients with severe ICAS. However, perspective studies need to be operated for further validation via long-term follow-up.
