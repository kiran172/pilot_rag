Title: Efficacy and Safety of Cyclophosphamide Low-Dose Pre-Phase Chemotherapy in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma with Gastrointestinal Involvement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gastric Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common extranodal site of lymphoma's involvement (30%-40% of all extranodal lymphomas and 55%-65% of all gastrointestinal lymphomas). However, gastric localizations are also sometimes found in systemic DLBCL. Gastric complications such as bleeding, perforation, and stenosis under chemotherapy are well documented.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 15 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL with gastrointestinal involvement. Endoscopies were performed in these patients before and after treatment. Treatment consisted of cyclophosphamide low-dose pre-phase chemotherapy before conventional-dose chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Endoscopy at staging detected ulcers in 12 patients (80%). After low-dose pre-phase chemotherapy, GI ulcers healed in 91.6% of cases (1 ulcer detected). After the whole treatment (Low-dose pre-phase + chemotherapy) 9 patients (60%) achieved complete response, 4 patients (26.6%) partial response, 2 (13,3%) patients presented disease progression. The most frequent adverse event was neutropenia (73.3%); the most frequent non-hematological adverse event was transaminases elevation (20%).
CONCLUSION: Cyclophosphamide low-dose pre-phase chemotherapy resulted in a safe and effective way to prevent adverse events in systemic DLBCL with gastrointestinal involvement.
