Title: Unusual approach to popliteal vein bypass graft stenosis following failed angioplasty in popliteal entrapment syndrome.

Abstract: Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is where the popliteal artery is compressed-typically by the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle. PAES is typically treated surgically with popliteal artery release with or without bypass. Graft stenosis is a recognised complication of vein grafts. These are normally treated endovascularly. Endarterectomy of venous graft stenosis may be a useful tool in selected cases, where an endovascular approach was unsuccessful. Long-term follow-up of graft stenosis endarterectomy will allow us to determine effectiveness of this method of treatment where other options have failed.
