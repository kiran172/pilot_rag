Title: Repair of iatrogenic left pulmonary artery to left atrial appendage fistula using a covered CP stent: a case report.

Abstract: We report a case of iatrogenic left pulmonary artery-left atrial appendage fistula following percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for residual pulmonary artery stenosis in an 11-year-old boy. This rare complication could have been predicted by understanding the anatomical relationship of these structures. In this study, simulation using three-dimensional printing greatly contributed to successful stent placement.
