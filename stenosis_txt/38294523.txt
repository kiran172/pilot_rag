Title: Fetal Diagnosis of Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis and Pulmonary Stenosis in a Family with Non-Syndromic Elastin Mutation.

Abstract: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) has been well described in Williams-Beuren Syndrome and non-syndromic elastin (ELN) mutations. Non-syndromic ELN mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. ELN haploinsufficiency leads to progressive arteriopathy, typically affecting the aortic sinotubular junction. Multi-level pulmonary stenosis has also been reported and biventricular obstruction may portend a worse prognosis. Fetal presentation of ELN mutation with SVAS has not been previously reported in the literature. We present a case of fetal diagnosis of SVAS and multi-level pulmonary stenosis in a family with a known pathogenic ELN mutation (Exon 6, c.278del [p.Pro93Leufs*29]). On the fetus' initial fetal echo, there was only mild flow acceleration through the aortic outflow tract, however, she went on to develop progressive bilateral obstruction. In the early post-natal period, the child was clinically asymptomatic and showed similar mild SVAS and mild valvar and supravalvular pulmonary stenosis. Our case highlights the need for serial monitoring of fetuses with suspected or confirmed ELN arteriopathy.
