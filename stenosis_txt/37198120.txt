Title: [A prospective study on the safety and efficacy of excimer laser coronary angioplasty for the treatment of degenerated great saphenous vein graft].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the safety and efficacy of excimer laser coronary angioplasty (ELCA) for the treatment of degenerated great saphenous vein graft (SVG). Methods: This is a single-center, prospective, single-arm study. Patients, who were admitted to the Geriatric Cardiovascular Center of Beijing Anzhen Hospital from January 2022 to June 2022, were consecutively enrolled. Inclusion criteria were recurrent chest pain after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), and coronary angiography confirmed that the SVG stenosis was more than 70% but not completely occluded, and interventional treatment for SVG lesions was planned. Before balloon dilation and stent placement, ELCA was used to pretreat the lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination was performed and postoperative index of microcirculation resistance (IMR) were assessed after stent implantation. The technique success rate and operation success rate were calculated. The technique success was defined as the successful passage of the ELCA system through the lesion. Operation success was defined as the successful placement of a stent at the lesion. The primary evaluation index of the study was IMR immediately after PCI. Secondary evaluation indexes included thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade, corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC), minimal stent area and stent expansion measured by OCT after PCI, and procedural complications (Ⅳa myocardial infarction, no reflow, perforation). Results: A total of 19 patients aged (66.0±5.6) years were enrolled, including 18 males (94.7%). The age of SVG was 8 (6, 11) years. The length of the lesions was greater than 20 mm, and they were all SVG body lesions. The median stenosis degree was 95% (80%, 99%), and the length of the implanted stent was (41.7±16.3)mm. The operation time was 119 (101, 166) minutes, and the cumulative dose was 2 089 (1 378, 3 011)mGy. The diameter of the laser catheter was 1.4 mm, the maximum energy was 60 mJ, and the maximum frequency was 40 Hz. The technique success and the operation success rate were both 100% (19/19). The IMR after stent implantation was 29.22±5.95. The TIMI flow grade of patients after ELCA and stent implantation was significantly improved (all P&gt;0.05), and the TIMI flow grade of all patients after stent implantation was Grade Ⅲ. The cTFC decreased significantly after ELCA (33.2±7.8) and after stent placement (22.8±7.1) than preoperative level (49.7±13.0) (both P&lt;0.001). The minimum stent area was (5.53±1.36)mm2, and the stent expansion rate was (90.0±4.3)%. Perforation, no reflow, type Ⅳa myocardial infarction and other complications were not observed. However, postoperative high-sensitivity troponin level was significantly increased ((67.937±33.839)ng/L vs. (5.316±3.105)ng/L, P&lt;0.001). Conclusion: ELCA is safe and effective in the treatment of SVG lesions and could improve microcirculation and ensure full expansion of stent.
