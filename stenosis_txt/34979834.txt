Title: Surgical removal of a foreshortened right innominate vein Wallstent causing venous outflow obstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Stenting of central venous stenosis to preserve upper extremity hemodialysis access is well-described, though upper extremity complications secondary to these stents are less frequently discussed.
METHODS: We present the case of a 43-year-old male with a right brachiocephalic fistula who developed symptoms of venous hypertension following placement of a Wallstent for central venous stenosis. Workup demonstrated venous outflow obstruction secondary to stent foreshortening into the right subclavian vein.
RESULTS: The Wallstent was removed in a piecemeal fashion using an open surgical technique and a HeRO graft was placed for dedicated fistula outflow with complete relief of the patient's symptoms.
CONCLUSION: In situations where a stent has migrated and endovascular removal is not possible, individual Wallstent fibers can be removed through a limited venotomy.
