Title: Successful pregnancy in women with inferior vena cava stenosis - case report and discussion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS) is a heterogenous group of symptoms resulting in obstruction of the main vein inflow . Common reasons are thrombotic changes and tumors. Incidence of inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies is 0.3% in general population. Iatrogenic IVC lesions caused by catheter insertion play increasing role. Treatment varies depending on the condition.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 32-year old patient was diagnosed with IVC stenosis during infertility related preconception evaluation and informed about increased risk in planned pregnancy. Throughout the well progressing pregnancy patient received low molecular weight heparin.
RESULTS: The diagnosis was confirmed intraoperatively during the planned cesarean section. Early postpartum period was normal and patient was discharged with antithrombotic prophylaxis.
CONCLUSIONS: Isolated IVC stenosis in pregnancy has not been yet reported in medical literature. Even though IVC anomalies may be associated with other congenital changes, in this case the central venous line treatment in infancy seems to be the most likely cause. Malformations are often accidentally diagnosed because patients are usually asymptomatic. CT and MRI are recommended diagnostic tools. Conservative treatment is recommended for asymptomatic patients, as opposed to surgical treatment for symptomatic. However, due to condition's rarity, there is no evidence based approach management.
