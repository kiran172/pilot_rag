Title: Artery of Percheron Occlusion in China: A Case Report and Chinese Literature Review.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The artery of Percheron (AOP) is a rare anatomical variant in which bilateral paramedian thalami are supplied by a single vascular branch arising from the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery. We present a case of AOP occlusion presenting as loss of consciousness and summarize the literature in Chinese to find the clinical characteristics.
CASE REPORT: An 83-year-old woman was found unconscious for 1 day at home and was sent to the hospital the next day. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging on day 1 of the patient showed a recent bilateral paramedian thalamic infarction. Simultaneously, magnetic resonance angiography found evident artery stenosis of the right P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery, suggesting that the patient was diagnosed with AOP occlusion. Since the patient has missed the best time for thrombolytic therapy, anticoagulant therapy was given immediately; as the patient was then found to have pulmonary infections, antibiotic therapy was also initiated. The neurological status of this patient improved very slow. In about 2 weeks, the patient becomes more conscious but still could not speak or move.
CONCLUSION: Our report suggests that unusual mood disorder and language disorder of aged patients might indicate the AOP occlusion, and cerebral imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (better with magnetic resonance angiography) should be performed to establish the diagnosis of AOP occlusion. The fast and accurate diagnosis of stroke because of AOP occlusion could best benefit the patients.
