Title: Frequency of Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Patients Admitted with Acute Stroke.

Abstract: Introduction Stroke is a leading cause of chronic disability and death in both developing and developed countries. A significant proportion of stroke patients are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. About half of the HIV patients experience some sort of neurological deficit in their lifetimes. The exact reason for the occurrence of stroke in HIV infected patients is poorly understood. The purpose of our study is to determine the frequency of HIV among patients admitted with acute stroke. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study is conducted at a major metropolitan hospital in Karachi for six months. A total of 130 patients of stroke between the ages of 30 and 70 years of either gender were included in this study. A complete history was taken and a physical examination was performed. Each patient underwent a battery of tests that included HIV serology, lipid profile, electrocardiography (ECG), chest X-ray (posteroanterior (PA) view), and computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain. Carotid Doppler ultrasonography to assess carotid artery stenosis was also ordered. The means and standard deviations of age and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count were calculated. The frequencies and proportions of gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, carotid artery stenosis, and HIV status were calculated. Stratification was done by applying the chi-square test and assuming p-value ≤0.05 as significant. This helped analyze the association of age, gender, DM, HTN, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, and carotid artery stenosis to the frequency of HIV. Results The mean age of the study population was 55.54 ± 11.166 years. There were 39 (30%) patients &lt;50 years of age while 91 (70%) patients were ≥50 years of age. Gender distribution showed that 86 (66.15%) patients were male, and 44 (33.85%) patients were female. Furthermore, 71 (54.62%) patients were hypertensive, 53 (40.77%) were diabetic, 62 (47.69%) were smokers, 49 (37.69%) were obese, 52 (40%) had dyslipidemia, and 77 (59.23%) had carotid artery stenosis. The frequency of HIV was noted at 24 (18.46%). The mean CD4 count was estimated at 241 ± 103.295 cells/mm3. Stratification showed a significant relationship between the frequency of HIV with only gender (p=0.01) and dyslipidemia (p=0.037). Conclusion HIV infection in patients with stroke is not uncommon. Patients who are male, younger in age, have dyslipidemia, belong to a low socioeconomic class, or have a bad sexual history are more likely to have HIV as an underlying cause of stroke. The exact pathogenesis of such a stroke and the role of antiretroviral therapy in the prevention and treatment of this group of stroke are not completely understood and need further analysis.
