Title: Simultaneous Aortic Valve-in-Valve and Ascending Stent Grafting for Prosthetic Valve Stenosis and Ascending Flap.

Abstract: Report on total endovascular repair for a diseased aortic valve and the ascending aorta is few. Therefore, we report a case of prosthetic aortic valve stenosis and internal bovine pericardial flap after ascending aortic replacement complicated by congestive heart failure and hemolysis. Because the patient had high surgical risk and was anatomically suitable to undergo ascending endovascular repair, simultaneous transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation and ascending endografting were performed. Her symptoms of heart failure and hemolysis resolved postoperatively. Thus, a simultaneous transcatheter procedure for a diseased aortic valve and the ascending aorta is a feasible option for appropriately selected patients.
