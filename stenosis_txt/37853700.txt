Title: Three-Patch Reconstruction of Hourglass Supravalvar Pulmonary Artery Stenosis Mid-Term Results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Some patients with pulmonary stenosis present with a complex multilevel disease that involves the valve, the leaflets, and the sinotubular junction (STJ) forming an hourglass appearance. We herein report the mid-term results of our experience with the reconstruction of the supravalvar narrowing using three pericardial patches.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patient charts and echocardiography studies of patients who underwent three-patch reconstruction of the pulmonary valve (PV) from 2013 to 2022. After PV transection distal to STJ, vertical incisions into the sinuses were performed, and leaflets were trimmed and thinned. The three sinuses were augmented using three pericardial patches.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients underwent repair of hourglass supravalvar pulmonary stenosis. Mean weight at surgery was 9.4 kg (median 7.2, range 4.7-35); 16 patients underwent previous catheterization with unsuccessful balloon dilatation of the PV (13 pts.). Preoperative aortic/pulmonary annulus ratio was 1.02 (median 1, range 0.89-1.25). After surgery, gradients across the PV were significantly reduced (94 ± 26 vs 29 ± 9 mm Hg, P = .02). Postoperatively, 14 patients had mild or no pulmonary insufficiency (PI) and five had mild to moderate PI. At a mean follow-up of 71 months (median 78 months, range 8-137), gradients continued to decrease (29 ± 9 vs 15 ± 5 mm Hg, P &lt; .001).
CONCLUSION: The three-patch technique for the repair of supravalvar pulmonary stenosis is simple, reproducible, and achieves excellent and long-standing relief of the right ventricular outflow tract gradient.
