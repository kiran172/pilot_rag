Title: Predictors of the pulsatility index in the middle cerebral artery of acute stroke patients.

Abstract: Cervical and transcranial Doppler (TCD) are widely used as non-invasive methods in the evaluation of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. High-grade carotid artery stenosis induces haemodynamic changes such as collateral flow and a so-called post-stenotic flow pattern of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which appears flattened, with a reduction of the velocity difference between systole and diastole. We studied the influence of carotid artery stenosis and other variables on the flow pattern in the MCA using the pulsatility index (PI), a quantitative TCD parameter reflecting the flow spectrum in a large of cohort AIS patients. We performed ultrasound examinations of 1825 AIS patients at the CHUV from October 2004 to December 2014. We extracted patient characteristics from the ASTRAL registry. Carotid stenosis severity was classified as < 50%, 50-70%, 70-90% and > 90%, or occlusion, according to Doppler velocity criteria. We first determined variables associated with stenosis grade. Then we performed a multivariate analysis after adjusting for baseline differences, using MCA PI as dependent variable. Carotid stenosis > 70% (- 0.07) and carotid stenosis > 90%, or occlusion (- 0.14) and left side (- 0.02) are associated with lower MCA PI values. Age (+0.006 PI units per decade), diabetes (+0.07), acute ischemic changes on initial CT (+0.03) and severe plaque morphology (+0.18) are associated with higher MCA PI values. We found a number of clinical and radiological conditions that significantly influence the PI of the MCA, including high-grade ipsilateral carotid stenosis in AIS patients. We provide for the first time a quantitative evaluation of the effect of these influencing factors from a large cohort of AIS patients.
