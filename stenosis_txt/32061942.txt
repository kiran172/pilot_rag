Title: CD4+ T cells and TGFβ1/MAPK signal pathway involved in the valvular hyperblastosis and fibrosis in patients with rheumatic heart disease.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of CD4+ T cells and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ1) in the pathological process of valvular hyperblastosis and fibrosis of patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD). A total of 151 patients were enrolled, among whom, 78 patients were with RHD, and 73 were age and gender matched RHD negative patients. Blood samples and valve specimens were collected for analysis. Pathological changes and collagen fibers contents of valves were analyzed using HE and Masson staining. Percentage of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells was tested through flow cytometry. TGFβ1 level in serum were identified by ELISA. CD4+ T cells infiltration and expression of TGFβ1, p-p38, p-JNK, p-ERK in valves were detected by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein levels of p38, JNK, ERK, TGFβ1, I-collagen and α-SMA were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The heart valve tissues of RHD patients showed higher degrees of fibrosis, calcification and lymphocytes infiltration, which were mainly CD4+ T cells. In addition, compared with control group, RHD patients had more total CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood and valve tissues. Expression of TGFβ1, phosphorylation of JNK and p38, and synthesis of I-collagen in valve tissues of RHD patients were also significantly increased. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between TGFβ1 expression and phosphorylation of JNK and p38. CD4+ T cells, and fibrogenic cytokine TGFβ1, which activate the intracellular MAPK signaling pathway may participate in the fibrosis of heart valve in RHD patients.
