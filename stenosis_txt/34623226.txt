Title: Urostomal ileal conduit complications in association with abdominal wall mesh implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Parastomal hernia (PH) in association with an ileal conduit is a common complication that is difficult to treat. Mesh reinforcement has been suggested to improve outcomes; either as prophylaxis or for treatment of a parastomal hernia during abdominal wall reconstruction.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in consecutive patients subjected to mesh implantation between 2000 and 2016 having a concurrent or previous ileal conduit reconstruction. Postoperative and late urostomal complications, as well as hernia occurrence, were ascertained by a chart review of patients' records.
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were included of whom 13 (52%) developed either a urostomal complication, a PH, or both. Complications were caused by mesh erosion in four patients, of which three were diagnosed more than five years after surgery. Four patients developed a urostomal stenosis. One out of eight patients with urostomal complications were subjected to a new ileal conduit reconstruction and another four to other types of revisional surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Every second patient with an ileal conduit developed either a local urostomal complication, a PH, or both after abdominal wall mesh reconstruction. A careful and cautious attitude towards the use of mesh in patients with an ileal conduit is suggested.
