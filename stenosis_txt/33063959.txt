Title: [Transcanalicular balloon dacryoplasty for the treatment of post-dacryocystorhinostomy recurrent stenoses].

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques used for the treatment of common canalicular (CC) ostium stenosis (or obliteration) in post-dacryocystorhinostomy (post-DCR) patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 121 patients (127 cases), of which 61 patients (64 cases) had stenosis of the CC ostium and 60 patients (63 cases) had CC ostium obliteration. All stenoses and obliterations were recurrent and developed 6 months to 5 years after primary endonasal endoscopic DCR. Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 included 20 patients (20 cases) with stenosis and 21 patients (22 cases) with CC ostium obliteration who underwent transcanalicular balloon dacryoplasty (DCP), group 2 - 20 patients (21 cases) with stenosis and 20 patients (21 cases) with CC ostium obliteration who underwent transcanalicular DCP and bicanalicular intubation, and group 3 - 21 patients (23 cases) with stenosis and 19 patients (20 cases) with CC ostium obliteration who received bicanalicular intubation alone. Results were evaluated 12 months after the intervention.
RESULTS: The treatment was effective in as many as 80% and 68.2% of cases (respectively) in group 1, 76.2% and 66.7% of cases (respectively) in group 2, and 56.5% and 50% of cases (respectively) in group 3.
CONCLUSION: The study proves transcanalicular DCP effective alone and shows no need in potentially complicated lacrimal ducts intubation.
