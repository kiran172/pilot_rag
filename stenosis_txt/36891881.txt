Title: Serum ITIH4 in coronary heart disease: a potential anti-inflammatory biomarker related to stenosis degree and risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.

Abstract: Aim: This study aimed to investigate the correlation of ITIH4 with inflammatory cytokines, stenosis degrees and prognosis in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Methods: Serum ITIH4 levels of 300 CHD patients and 30 controls, together with levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-17A of CHD patients, were determined using ELISA. Results: Serum ITIH4 was reduced in CHD patients versus controls (p &lt; 0.001). ITIH4 was negatively linked with TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, C-reactive protein, serum creatinine and Gensini score in CHD patients (all p &lt; 0.050). ITIH4 quartile level negatively correlated with the cumulative major adverse cardiovascular event rate (p = 0.041). Conclusion: Serum ITIH4 may serve as an anti-inflammatory biomarker that negatively associates with stenosis degree and major adverse cardiovascular event risk in CHD patients.
