Title: The Supraclavicular Artery Island Flap for Pharynx Reconstruction.

Abstract: The supraclavicular artery island flap (SCAIF) is a reliable, easy-to-harvest and versatile fasciocutaneous flap that can be used for pharynx reconstruction. Instead of free flaps, it requires no microsurgical technique, reduced operating time and postoperative care, making it an ideal option, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary aim of our study was to present two cases of a total laryngectomy and reconstruction with the SCAIF during the pandemic. The secondary aim was to review the literature concerning surgical techniques, complications and contradictions of the SCAIF for pharynx reconstruction. A literature search was performed using the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, Google Scholar, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases, using MeSH terms: larynx AND reconstruction AND flap. Ten full-text articles comprising 92 patients with 93 supraclavicular flaps were included. The patch graft, pharyngeal interposition graft, tubularization or "U"-shaped SCAIF were the main surgical techniques. Pharyngocutaneous fistula was the most frequent postoperative complication, especially in patients with previous radiotherapy, but just 19% of patients required secondary intervention. The lack of donor-site morbidity, low flap loss rates and stenosis rates favored this reconstructive option. This review underlined that the SCAIF has comparable results with other reconstructive options, consolidating this flap in the workhorse of pharynx reconstruction.
