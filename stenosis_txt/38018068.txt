Title: [Efficacy and safety of endoscopic submucosal dissection with additional radiotherapy for T1a-MM/T1b-SM esophageal squamous cell carcinoma].

Abstract: Objective: To clarify the efficacy and safety of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) with additional radiotherapy in T1a-MM/T1b-SM esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 71 patients with T1a-MM/T1b-SM ESCC admitted to Southeast University Affiliated Zhongda Hospital from January 2015 to December 2019. The patients were divided into two groups based on the treatment method: the ESD group (ESD therapy alone) and the ESD-radiotherapy group (ESD combined radiotherapy). The follow-up duration after ESD was (44±17) months. The difference of disease-free survival (DFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate between the two groups was compared by survival analysis, and the occurrence of complications was compared. Baseline variables of the two groups were compared and the influencing factors of DFS rate were analyzed by Cox proportional risk regression model. Results: There were 44 patients in the ESD-radiotherapy group [28 males, 16 females, aged (65±7) years] and 27 patients in the ESD group [18 males, 9 females, aged (67±9) years]. The results of survival analysis show that the 1, 3 and 5-year DFS rates of ESD-radiotherapy group were 95.5%, 92.9% and 77.4%, respectively, which were higher than those of ESD group 85.2%, 73.2% and 62.7% (all P&lt;0.05). The 1, 3 and 5-year OS rates of the ESD-radiotherapy group were 100%, 94.7% and 94.7%, while those of the ESD group were 96.3%, 96.3% and 79.4%, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (all P&gt;0.05). Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis showed that ESD combined with radiotherapy (HR=0.19, 95%CI: 0.04-0.90, P=0.037), complete tumor resection (HR=0.25, 95%CI: 0.07-0.86, P=0.027), and vascular invasion (HR=12.06, 95%CI: 1.61-90.26, P=0.015) were the influencing factors of DFS rates. The most common complication of ESD was esophageal stenosis, and no grade 3 or higher radiation adverse reactions occurred after combined radiotherapy. Conclusion: ESD combined radiotherapy is an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for patients with T1a-MM/T1b-SM ESCC.
