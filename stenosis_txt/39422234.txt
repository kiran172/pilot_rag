Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy for Peripheral Artery Calcification: 30-Day Outcomes From the Disrupt PAD III Observational Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has shown promising safety and effectiveness in calcified peripheral artery disease (PAD) in large trials and small real-world experiences. Real-world evidence from a larger cohort is lacking, so we aimed to evaluate the real-world acute performance of IVL in the treatment of calcified PAD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Disrupt PAD III Observational Study (OS) is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study. Patients with claudication or critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and at least moderate calcification were eligible. Independent predictors of procedural outcomes were assessed by multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: Between November 2017 and June 2021 across 30 global sites, 1373 patients with 1677 lesions (1531, 91.3% core lab evaluable) were enrolled. Diameter stenosis and lesion length was 80.6±17.6% and 93.5±74.3 mm, respectively. Target vessels included femoropopliteal (61%), iliac (15.8%), common femoral (10.7%), and infrapopliteal arteries (12.8%). Lesion characteristics included 31.1% chronic total occlusions (CTOs) and 19.3% long lesions (≥15 cm). At final assessment, residual stenosis was 23.8±11.3%, with 0.9% serious angiographic complications, no abrupt closures, distal embolization, no flow, or thrombotic events. Independent predictors of ≤30% residual stenosis were lesion length ≥15 cm (odds ratio [OR]=0.384), female sex (OR=1.850), age ≤75 years (OR=1.625), IVL balloon to artery ratio ≥1.0 (OR=1.538), and CTO lesions (OR=0.638). Lesion length ≥15 cm (OR=16.076) was an independent predictor of procedural complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The Disrupt PAD III OS represents the largest assessment of IVL periprocedural outcomes in calcified PAD. It confirmed excellent procedural safety and effectiveness in complex lesions across multiple peripheral vascular beds.
CLINICAL IMPACT: This final analysis of the PAD III OS represents the largest report of peripheral IVL utilization in daily clinical practice. The outcomes of this study indicate that previously reported procedural results in clinical trial settings can be translated to a broader patient population. Treatment with peripheral IVL in severely calcified stenotic lower limb lesions demonstrated consistent acute safety and stenosis reduction, even in complex patients across multiple vessel beds. In addition, the importance of proper IVL balloon sizing to achieve excellent acute stenosis reduction was confirmed by multivariate analysis.
