Title: Novel Diagnostic Techniques in the Evaluation of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).

Abstract: In our present clinical paradigm, patient symptoms and presentation in the setting of traditional findings from endoscopy (erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, reflux-mediated stenosis), esophageal high-resolution manometry, and/or ambulatory reflux monitoring (distal esophageal acid exposure time, numbers of reflux events, reflux-symptom association) guide the care of patients with suspected GERD. However, novel metrics and techniques acquired from or performed at endoscopy, manometry, or pH-impedance monitoring, beyond conventional evaluation, are of great interest to the gastroenterology community given the frequent (and sometimes challenging) presentation of suspected GERD. These novel and evolving diagnostic approaches have the potential to enhance the evaluation of these patients and optimize their management. In this invited review, we discuss the present evidence and potential clinical utility of selected GERD metrics and techniques of interest at endoscopy (dilated intercellular spaces, mucosal impedance), manometry (contractile integral, impedance analysis, straight leg raise, multiple rapid swallow maneuvers), and reflux monitoring (mean nocturnal baseline impedance, post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave indices), and how these tools may be most optimally adopted and utilized for clinical care (Fig.Â 1).
