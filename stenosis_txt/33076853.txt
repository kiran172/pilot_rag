Title: Spontaneous recanalization of occluded transplant renal artery: a rare case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is a serious vascular complication that occurs after renal transplantation and can result in hypertension, renal functional impairment, and graft loss. Endovascular treatment has become the first-line treatment for TRAS because of its low invasiveness and high success rate.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old female with end-stage renal disease of unknown cause received a living-donor kidney transplantation 10â€‰months ago. Seven months after the transplantation, her blood pressure gradually deteriorated. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed bending and stenosis of the transplant renal artery, and the patient received endovascular treatment. A digital subtraction angiography revealed significant stenosis of 95% in the proximal transplant renal artery. The guidewire could not pass through the stenotic segment of the transplant renal artery even with repeated attempts by the surgeons; as a result, the transplant renal artery became occluded, and vasodilators were ineffective. After the operation, renal function gradually worsened, so she began to receive regular dialysis. Twenty-five days later, the patient's urine volume was significantly higher than that before, and ultrasound showed that the proximal transplant renal artery was not completely occluded. A re-intervention was performed, and the stent was placed successfully in the stenotic segment. After the operation, renal function gradually recovered, and dialysis was no longer needed.
CONCLUSION: Patients with iatrogenic transplant renal artery occlusion may have the possibility of spontaneous recanalization, which can help prevent the need for re-transplantation.
