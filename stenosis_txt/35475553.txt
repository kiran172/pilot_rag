Title: Swing segment stenosis: An unresolved challenge.

Abstract: The native arteriovenous fistula is considered the gold standard among all dialysis access options. Compared with alternatives such as grafts and central venous catheters, their use is associated with a lower risk of infective and thrombotic complications. This leads to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare-associated costs. Recognizing these advantages, there is a global drive to increase the creation and use of such fistulas in hemodialysis patients. Swing segment stenosis is a common problem encountered with the creation and use of these fistulas that can hurt their maturation and longevity. A "swing segment" in an arteriovenous fistula is defined as a segment of vein that pursues a sharp, curved course. Due to poorly understood reasons, these swing segments tend to develop stenotic lesions that are extremely challenging to treat. This review aims to provide an overview of the pathophysiology, incidence, management, and prevention of these swing segment lesions. We believe that such knowledge will be useful for clinicians who deal with dialysis access creation and maintenance.
