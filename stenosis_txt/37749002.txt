Title: Independent association of aortic stenosis with many known cardiovascular risk factors and many inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis is associated with age, rheumatic fever and bicuspid aortic valve, but its association with other co-morbidities, such as inflammatory disease and race/ethnicity, is less known.
AIM: To investigate any association between aortic stenosis and many co-morbidities.
METHODS: We used the large Nationwide Inpatient Sample database to evaluate any association between aortic stenosis and risk factors. We performed univariate and multivariable analyses, adjusting for co-morbid conditions.
RESULTS: Data were extracted from the first available database that used the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes specifically coding for aortic stenosis alone, spanning from 2016 to 2020 (n=112,982,565). A total of 2,322,649 patients had aortic stenosis; the remaining 110,659,916 served as controls. We found a strong and independent significant association between aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease (odds ratio [OR]: 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.09-2.13), smoking (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.07-1.08), diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.14-1.16), hypertension (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.4-1.42), hyperlipidaemia (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.3-1.32), renal disease (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.29-1.31), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04-1.05), obesity (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.29-1.32), white race/ethnicity (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.42-1.52), rheumatoid arthritis (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.11-1.15), scleroderma (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.79-2.09), systemic connective tissue disease (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.2-1.27), polyarteritis nodosa (OR: 1.5, CI: 1.24-1.81) and Raynaud's syndrome (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.09-1.24) (all P<0.001), in addition to known factors, such as age, male sex and bicuspid aortic valve.
CONCLUSION: Using a very large database, we found many new associations with aortic valve stenosis, including race/ethnicity, renal disease, several inflammatory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity, in addition to many other known cardiovascular risk factors.
