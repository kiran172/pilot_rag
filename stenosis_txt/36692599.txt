Title: Editorial Comment: Estimation of venous sinus pressure drop in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension using 4D-flow MRI.

Abstract: • Work-energy equation using 4D-flow MRI is a promising technique for non-invasive estimation of trans-stenotic pressure drop in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.• Additional research with larger and multicentric prospective cohorts is needed to validate the results, along with improvement of the segmentation process with automated techniques and shortening of scanning times to allow for practical clinical use.
