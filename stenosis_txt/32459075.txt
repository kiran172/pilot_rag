Title: Aortic valve construction using new nitinol templates and pericardial tissue.

Abstract: The use of pericardial tissue has been widely adopted in a range of cardiac surgery procedures involving the reconstruction of heart valves. Its use in aortic valve construction has been discussed in recent years by Ozaki et al. A key parameter in the optimal functioning of a fabricated valve is the sizing of the new cusps. This video tutorial demonstrates aortic valve construction using newly designed templates and forceps to facilitate sizing and enhance the symmetrical coaptation of the new cusps.
