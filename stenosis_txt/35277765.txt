Title: En bloc mesoesophageal esophagectomy through thoracoscopy combined with laparoscopy based on the mesoesophageal theory.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the effectiveness and clinical significance of thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy with mesoesophagus excision.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent en bloc mesoesophageal esophagectomy through thoracoscopy combined with laparoscopy were retrospectively enrolled. Carbon nanoparticles were used in some patients to label the esophageal drainage lymph nodes. The clinical data were analyzed.
RESULTS: En bloc mesoesophageal esophagectomy was successfully performed in 135 patients (100%). The carbon nanoparticles were used in 10 patients, among which the left gastric arterial lymph nodes were labeled in all patients and excised together with the left gastric mesentery, mesoesophagus, esophageal cancer, lymph nodes, vessels, nerves, and adipose tissues as one intact package. The mean operation time was 182.5 ± 26.4 min, intraoperative blood loss 45.9 ± 17.6 ml, mean number of lymph nodes dissected 20.9 ± 8.12, extubation time of drainage tubes 7.5 ± 3.8 days, first oral feeding time 7.5 ± 1.8 days, and postoperative hospital stay 13 ± 5.11 days. Postoperatively, anastomotic leakage occurred in six patients (4.4%), anastomotic stenosis in eight (5.9%), hoarseness in seven (5.2%), and inflammation of the remnant stomach in four (3.0%), with a complication rate of 18.5%. Patients were followed up for 13-34 months (median 23). Eighteen patients presented with organ metastasis. No local recurrence or death during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Based on the membrane anatomy or mesoesophagus theory, thoracolaparoscopic en bloc mesoesophageal esophagectomy is safe, with decreased blood loss, and it is necessary to resect the left gastric artery lymph nodes together with the left gastric mesentery and its contents to completely remove the cancer.
