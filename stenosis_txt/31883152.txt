Title: Post-intubation subglottic stenosis in children: Analysis of clinical features and risk factors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Subglottic stenosis (SGS) is a complication that develops after intubation and is characterized by respiratory distress. The aim was to evaluate patients with post-intubation SGS and to discover the factors contributing to its development.
METHODS: A total of 112 patients who had a history of intubation were included. The case group consisted of 50 patients with post-extubation persistent respiratory symptoms for which flexible bronchoscopy (FOB) was conducted and showed SGS. The control group consisted of 62 patient with no post-extubation persistent respiratory symptoms, for whom FOB was not done (n = 54), and who had post-extubation persistent respiratory symptoms and underwent FOB, which did not show subglottic stenosis (n = 8).
RESULTS: No significant differences were detected related to age, gender, and gestational age. The median number of recurrent intubations was 2.5 and 3 in the case group and in control group, respectively (P = 0.14). The median duration of intubation was 20.5 days in the case group, and 6 days in the control group (P < 0.001). The Myer-Cotton classification indicated a degree of obstruction of grade 1 (mild) in 30% (n = 15), grade 2 in 16% (n = 8), grade 3 in 48% (n = 24), and grade 4 in 6% (n = 3) of the case group.
CONCLUSION: The duration of intubation was found to be a significant risk factor for SGS development. Age at intubation, gender, gestational age, indication of intubation, and the number of recurrent intubations were found to have no significant association. Patients with post-extubation persistent respiratory problems, especially those with prolonged intubations, should be evaluated for SGS.
