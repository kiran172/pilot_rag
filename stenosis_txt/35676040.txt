Title: An Increased Diagnostic Accuracy of Significant Coronary Artery Stenosis Using 320-slice Computed Tomography with Model-based Iterative Reconstruction in Cases with Severely Calcified Coronary Arteries.

Abstract: Objective High-quality images can be obtained with 320-slice computed tomography (CT) with model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). We therefore investigated the diagnostic accuracy of 320-slice CT with MBIR for detecting significant coronary artery stenosis. Methods This was a retrospective study of 160 patients who underwent coronary CT and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). The first 100 consecutive patients (Group 1) underwent 320-slice CT without MBIR or small-focus scanning. The next 60 consecutive patients (Group 2) underwent 320-slice CT with both MBIR and small-focus scanning. Patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery were excluded. The diagnostic performance of 320-slice CT without MBIR or small-focus scanning and 320-slice CT with both of them, with ICA regarded as a reference standard, was compared to detect significant coronary artery stenosis (≥70% on CT, ≥75% on ICA). Results In a patient-based analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of detection of significant stenosis on CT against ICA were 95%, 85%, and 91% in Group 1, and 93%, 83%, and 90% in Group 2, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the patient- and segment-based analyses. However, among cases with a severe coronary artery calcium score >400 (31 cases in Group 1 and 28 in Group 2), the specificity and overall accuracy were significantly higher (all p<0.01) in Group 2 than in Group 1 according to the segment-based analysis. Conclusion The diagnostic accuracy of the detection of coronary artery stenosis on CT was improved using 320-slice CT with MBIR.
