Title: The safety and efficacy of peroral endoscopic cardial constriction in gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common digestive disorders, which seriously affects the quality of life and brings a heavy burden to the medical care. Peroral endoscopic cardial constriction (PECC) can narrow the cardia through mucosal ligation to alleviate acid reflux symptoms. This study aims to assess the clinical efficacy of PECC.
METHODS: This was a retrospective case series including patients diagnosed with GERD and undergoing PECC from September 2019 to July 2021. GERD-Q questionnaire and GERD-QOL questionnaire were applied to evaluate the symptom severity and the impact of life because of GERD.
RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were included in our study. The mean GERD-Q score was 10.94 ± 2.11 before PECC, while 5.38 ± 3.90 after PECC. The mean GERD-QOL score was 43.60 ± 16.94 before PECC, while 73.65 ± 22.08 after PECC. 62.5% of patients were satisfied with the symptom control and no serious complications were reported in our study.
CONCLUSIONS: PECC is an efficient and safe minimally invasive endoscopic intervention for GERD. It can significantly improve GERD-related symptoms and quality of life.
