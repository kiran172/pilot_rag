Title: Current Treatments for Congenital Aural Atresia.

Abstract: Congenital aural atresia is an ear malformation evident at birth, involving various degrees of failed external ear canal development. A true external ear canal is desirable, as devices that replace the canal are inconvenient and expensive. Therefore, an optimal surgical technique is required. Here, we review useful preoperative and operative techniques. Surgical correction is often not the preferred treatment; the hearing outcome is no better than the outcomes afforded by bone-conduction devices, and surgery may be associated with recurrence or complications such as meatal stenosis. Preoperative evaluation and appropriate management are important. Several means of preventing meatal stenosis are discussed in this review.
