Title: Benign postoperative hepaticojejunostomy stricture: percutaneous recanalisation using the reverse end of a microwire.

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of percutaneous recanalisation of benign postoperative hepaticojejunostomy strictures using the reverse end of a microwire.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with benign postoperative hepaticojejunostomy strictures that had failed to recanalise following management with conventional percutaneous techniques from January 2012 to March 2019 were included in the study. The stricture was punctured by the reverse end of a microwire. Subsequently, serial balloon dilatation and covered stent placement was performed. Technical as well as clinical success, complications, and patency of the hepaticojejunostomy were evaluated.
RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 19 of 21 (90.5%) patients. The mean number of treatment sessions was 1.2 (range, 1-2). The obstructive symptoms were resolved within 3 days after the procedure in 19 patients (100%). There were no major complications. The 1-year and 3-year patency rates were 76.9% and 61.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous recanalisation using the reverse end of a microwire is technically feasible and safe in the treatment of benign postoperative hepaticojejunostomy strictures. This technique is useful when the conventional percutaneous technique cannot be used to cross the stricture.
