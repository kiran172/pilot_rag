Title: Treating patients with excessively large annuli with self-expanding transcatheter aortic valves: insights into supra-annular structures that anchor the prosthesis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Some patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have excessively large annuli (ELA) without device options according to current sizing charts. This retrospective study aims to summarize the presentation and outcomes of ELA patients receiving first-generation self-expanding valves.
METHODS: The TAVR database was reviewed in search for cases of self-expanding valves. Patients who had annuli exceeding the perimeter limit on the device sizing chart were referred to as the ELA group. Patients who had annuli within the range covered by the two largest sizes and received the corresponding valve size served as the control group (CG). Baseline, procedures, outcomes, and imaging characteristics on multislice computed tomography (MSCT), such as native anatomy and postimplant stent geometry, were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 28 patients were included in the ELA group and 82 in the CG. The patients in the ELA group were younger than those in the CG (72.5 ± 6.2 vs. 75.4 ± 5.8 years, P = 0.03). The median intended perimeter oversizing in relation to the annulus in the ELA group was much smaller than in the CG (-0.4 [-4.6, 4.1] % vs. 16.1 [11.7, 20.8] %, P &lt; 0.01). The calcium burden in the aortic root was around 1.3-fold greater in the ELA group than the CG (756.0 [534.5, 1670.9] vs. 582.1 [310.3, 870.9] mm3, P = 0.01). The need for second valve implantation was higher in ELA (21.4% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.23) but no valve embolization was encountered. The 1‑year follow-up was comparable, including &gt;mild paravalvular leak.
CONCLUSION: Under cautious patient selection using MSCT, TAVR with self-expanding valves in patients with ELA appears feasible. Supra-annular structures likely provide the extra anchoring.
