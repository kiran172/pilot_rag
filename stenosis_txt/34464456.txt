Title: Outcomes of non-left bundle branch block conduction abnormalities after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheteraortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a revolutionized treatment for severe aortic valve stenosis. Although new and improved TAVR devices are constantly being developed, cardiac conduction abnormalities post-TAVR requiring permanent pace14353maker implantation (PPMI) still occur frequently. Previously, pre-existing right bundle branch block (RBBB) has been shown to be predictive of PPMI after TAVR compared with patients without RBBB, while occurrence of new left bundle branch block (LBBB) was associated with a higher rate of PPMI. However, less attention has been paid to the clinical values of new onset non-LBBB conduction disturbances such as RBBB, left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) or atrioventricularÂ block (AVB). To our knowledge, this is the first report focus on the association of new-onset non-LBBB and PPMI after TAVR. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of HwaMei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
