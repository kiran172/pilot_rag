Title: Enterprise stents for the treatment of symptomatic non-acute intracranial artery stenosis disease: safety and efficiency evaluation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Enterprise stent was approved for the treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. However, it has been widely used in the endovascular treatment of intracranial artery stenosis, which is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the Enterprise stent in the endovascular treatment of intracranial artery stenosis disease.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series of 107 patients with intracranial artery stenosis who received Enterprise stent implantation at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from January 2020 to December 2022. The rates of recanalization, perioperative complications, in-stent restenosis at 3-12 months and stroke recurrence were assessed for endovascular treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 107 individuals were included in this study, 88 were followed up, and 19 (17.8%) patients were lost to follow-up. The operation success rate was 100%, During the procedure,4（3.7%）patients had vasospasm, and 2(1.9%) patients showed symptomatic bleeding. The overall perioperative complication rate was 5.6%, including 2.8% distal artery embolism, 0.9% in-stent thrombosis, and 1.9% symptomatic bleeding. 88 (82.2%) patients were followed up from 3 to 12 months, of whom 12 (13.6%) had in-stent restenosis, 4 (4.7%) recurrent strokes and 2 died of pulmonary infection caused by COVID-19. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the cerebral artery, including the middle cerebral artery group, internal carotid artery group, and vertebrobasilar artery group.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the placement of the Enterprise stent in patients with symptomatic non-acute intracranial stenosis was successful. However, the occurrence of periprocedural and long-term complications after stenting remains of high concern.
