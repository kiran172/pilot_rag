Title: Diagnostic potential of SORT1 gene in coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies identify SORT1 gene associated with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Sortilin protein enhances LDL absorption, form cell development, and atherosclerosis in macrophages.
AIM: We therefore explored SORT1 expression in CAD patients and its gene expression's predictive usefulness for the severity of the disease.
METHODOLOGY: This is a case control study and Quantitative real-time PCR; Sandwich ELISA and western blotting were used to determine the expression of SORT1 gene at the mRNA and protein level in two hundred healthy controls and two hundred patients with various CAD syndromes.
RESULTS: CAD patients exhibit higher SORT1 gene expression in CAD patients, a higher concentration of sortilin in their plasma, and distinct expression patterns in various CAD syndromes. The study reveals a positive correlation between gene expression and the severity of coronary artery stenosis, the number of diseased vessels, and the presence of diabetes. ROC curve analysis of SORT1 gene expression both at mRNA and protein level showed strong discrimination between significant CAD and control subjects.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, elevated SORT1 gene expression in various CAD syndromes may be a potential biomarker for the disease.
