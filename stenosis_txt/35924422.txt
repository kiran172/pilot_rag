Title: Hemodynamic and anatomic changes after fetal aortic valvuloplasty are associated with procedural success and postnatal biventricular circulation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are minimal data characterizing the trajectory of left heart growth and hemodynamics following fetal aortic valvuloplasty (FAV).
METHODS: This retrospective study included patients who underwent FAV between 2000 and 2019, with echocardiograms performed pre-FAV, immediately post-FAV, and in late gestation.
RESULTS: Of 118 fetuses undergoing FAV, 106 (90%) underwent technically successful FAV, of which 55 (52%) had biventricular circulation. Technically successful FAV was associated with improved aortic valve growth (p < 0.001), sustained antegrade aortic arch (AoA) flow (p = 0.02), improved mitral valve (MV) inflow pattern (p = 0.002), and favorable patent foramen ovale (PFO) flow pattern (p = 0.004) from pre-FAV to late gestation. Compared to patients with univentricular outcome, patients with biventricular outcome had less decrement in size of the left ventricle (LV) (p < 0.001) and aortic valve (p = 0.005), as well as more physiologic PFO flow (p < 0.001) and antegrade AoA flow (p < 0.001) from pre-FAV to late gestation. In multivariable analysis, echocardiographic predictors of biventricular outcome were less decline in LV end diastolic dimension (p < 0.001), improved PFO flow (p = 0.004), and sustained antegrade AoA flow (p = 0.002) from pre-FAV to late gestation.
CONCLUSION: Stabilization of left heart growth and improved hemodynamics following successful FAV through late gestation are associated with postnatal biventricular circulation.
