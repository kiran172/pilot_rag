Title: Differences in intracranial atherosclerosis plaque between posterior circulation and anterior circulation on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The clinical characteristics and mechanisms of stroke caused by anterior circulation atherosclerotic plaques (ACAPs) and posterior circulation atherosclerotic plaques (PCAPs) are distinct. We aimed to compare the differences in vulnerability, morphology, and distribution between ACAPs and PCAPs based on hign-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang database were retrieved from inception through May 2023. Meta-analysis was performed by R 4.2.1 software. The quality of the literature was assessed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore the heterogeneity of the pooled results.
RESULTS: There were a total of 13 articles, including 1194 ACAPs and 1037 PCAPs. The pooled estimates demonstrated that the incidence of intraplaque hemorrhage in the PCAPs was higher (OR 1.72, 95%CI 1.35-2.18). The plaque length (SMD 0.23, 95%CI 0.06-0.39) and remodeling index (SMD 0.29, 95%CI 0.14-0.44) of PCAPs were larger than those in ACAPs. However, there were no evident differences in significant enhancement or stenosis degree between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: There were more unstable features in PCAPs, highlighting an elevated risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in the posterior circulation. Furthermore, PCAPs were prone to developing penetrating artery disease due to their wider distribution. Nevertheless, posterior circulation arteries exhibited a greater propensity for outward remodeling, which may lead treatment team to miss the optimal intervention stage by being overlooked on angiographic detection.
