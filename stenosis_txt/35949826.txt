Title: Modified endoscopic ultrasound-guided selective N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate injections for gastric variceal hemorrhage in left-sided portal hypertension: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Left-sided portal hypertension (LSPH), also known as sinistral portal hypertension or regional portal hypertension, refers to extrahepatic portal hypertension caused by splenic vein obstruction or stenosis. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBC) has been widely used in the endoscopic hemostasis of portal hypertension, but adverse events including renal or pulmonary thromboembolism, mucosal necrosis and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding may occur after treatment. Herein, we report successfully managing gastric variceal (GV) hemorrhage secondary to LSPH using modified endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided selective NBC injections.
CASE SUMMARY: A 35-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to an upper GI hemorrhage. Gastroscopy revealed GV hemorrhage and computed tomography venography (CTV) confirmed LSPH. The patient requested endoscopic procedures and rejected surgical therapies including splenectomy. EUS-guided selective NBC injections were performed and confluences of gastric varices were selected as the injection sites to reduce the injection dose. The "sandwich" method using undiluted NBC and hypertonic glucose was applied. No complications occurred. The patient was followed up regularly after discharge. Three months later, the follow-up gastroscopy revealed firm gastric submucosa with no sign of NBC expulsion and the follow-up CTV showed improvements in LSPH. No recurrent GI hemorrhage was reported during this follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: EUS-guided selective NBC injection may represent an effective and economical treatment for GV hemorrhage in patients with LSPH.
