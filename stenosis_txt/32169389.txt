Title: A change of heart: Transformation of the electrocardiogram in a patient with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: An asymptomatic 83-year-old man with a history of hypertension, prior stroke with no residual deficits, and bilateral carotid artery stenosis, presented for evaluation prior to cataract surgery. His transthoracic echocardiogram was typical for apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM), and his electrocardiograms (ECG) showed large precordial R-waves and inverted T-waves, previously associated with AHCM, while his ECG 7Â years earlier was normal. Mechanistic explanations for the developed ECG abnormalities, and their importance for the detection and monitoring of patients with AHCM are provided.
