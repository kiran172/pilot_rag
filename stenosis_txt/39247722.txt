Title: Demographics and mortality trends of valvular heart disease in older adults in the United States: Insights from CDC-wonder database 1999-2019.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) represents a spectrum of cardiac conditions, including valvular stenosis, valvular regurgitation, or mixed lesions affecting single or multiple valves. The severity of VHD has emerged as a major cause of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality among the older population in the United States (U.S).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate temporal trends in mortality associated with VHD in the elderly U.S population between 1999 and 2019.
METHODS: We utilized the CDC WONDER database for VHD mortality in adults ≥75 from 1999 to 2019, using ICD-10 codes. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 people with associated annual percentage change (APC) were calculated. Joinpoint regression was used to assess the overall trends and trends for demographic, geographic, and type of valvular disease subgroups.
RESULTS: A total of 666,765 VHD deaths in older adults from 1999 to 2019 was identified, with an initial decline in AAMR until 2007 with an APC: 0.62, 95 % CI (-1.66-0.33), stability until 2014, and a significant decrease until 2019 (APC: 1.47, 95 % CI [-2.24-1.04], P < 0.0001). Men consistently had higher AAMRs compared to women (overall AAMR men: 173.6; women: 138.2). The AAMRs were found to be highest in the White (166.5), followed by American Indian or Alaska Native population at (93.8) Hispanic or Latino at (80.7), Black or African American populations at (74.1) and lastly Asian or Pacific Islander (73.4). Non-metropolitan areas manifested higher AAMRs for deaths related to VHD than metropolitan areas (overall AAMRs 160.5 vs 149.5) respectively. State-wide AAMRs varied, with the highest in Vermont at 324.2 (95 % CI [313.0-335.4], P < 0.0001) and the lowest in Mississippi at 88.0 (95 % CI [85.0-91.0], P < 0.0001). Non-rheumatic and aortic valve disorders in adults ≥75 years had higher mortality rates compared to rheumatic or mitral valve conditions in those <75 years.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed a decline in U.S. VHD mortality from 1999 to 2019 but found persistent disparities by gender, race, age, region, and VHD type. Targeted policies for prevention and early diagnosis are needed to address these inequalities.
