Title: Safety and efficacy of kidney transplantation in patients with aortoiliac stenosis: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The impact of aortoiliac occlusive disease on kidney transplantation remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the clinical outcomes of kidney transplant patients with aortoiliac atherosclerotic stenosis.
METHODS: Retrospective data from our transplant center were used to identify patients undergoing kidney transplantation between January 2010 and December 2020. Aortoiliac atherosclerotic stenosis was screened and stratified by the Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) II classification. The primary outcome was patient survival. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, death-censored graft survival, graft function, and arterial complications. Propensity score matching was used to match all patients in the stenosis group with patients without stenosis sharing similar characteristics.
RESULTS: The analysis included 655 patients, 524 without stenosis and 131 with aortoiliac stenosis (95 with TASC A/B stenosis and 36 with TASC C/D stenosis). Recipient age [median (IQR), 66 (60-70) vs. 66 (59-71) years; P =0.47], sex [male: 87 (66%) vs. 355 (68%), P =0.85], and comorbidities were comparable between the stenosis and no-stenosis groups. Forty-six (35%) patients with stenosis were symptomatic. Patient survival was significantly lower in the stenosis group compared with the no-stenosis group (TASC A/B: 30.6% vs. no-stenosis: 44.1%, P =0.013; TASC C/D: 11.4% vs. no-stenosis: 44.1%, P <0.001). The incidence rates of artery dissection, lower extremity ischemia, and acute thrombosis were significantly higher in the stenosis group ( P <0.001). However, death-censored graft survival (TASC A/B: 73.6% vs. no-stenosis: 72.9%, P =0.62; TASC C/D: 58.1% vs. no-stenosis: 72.9%, P =0.16) and graft function were comparable between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortoiliac atherosclerotic stenosis significantly impacts patient survival but not graft survival. Our analyses suggest that patients with TASC A/B stenosis have prolonged survival and enhanced quality of life through kidney transplantation. However, for patients with TASC C/D stenosis, kidney transplantation improves quality of life without bringing survival benefits.
