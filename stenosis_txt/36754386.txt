Title: Right Ventricular Dysfunction in Patients With Concomitant Tricuspid Regurgitation Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study investigated the impact and predictive factors of concomitant significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and evaluated the roles of right ventricle (RV) function and the etiology of TR in the clinical outcomes of patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed grading of TR severity, TR etiology, and RV function in pre- and post-TAVI transthoracic echocardiograms for 678 patients at Keio University School of Medicine. TR etiology was divided into 3 groups: primary TR, ventricular functional TR (FTR), and atrial FTR. The primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular death. At baseline, moderate or greater TR was found in 55 (8%) patients and, after adjustment for comorbidities, was associated with increased all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-3.77; P=0.011) and cardiovascular death (HR 2.29; 95% CI 1.06-4.99; P=0.036). RV dysfunction (RVD) also remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 2.06; 95% CI 1.03-4.14; P=0.042). Among the TR etiology groups, patients with ventricular FTR had the lowest survival rate (P<0.001). Patients with persistent RVD after TAVI had a higher risk of cardiovascular death than those with a normal or recovered RV function (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of TR and RV function play an important role in predicting outcomes in concomitant TR patients undergoing TAVI.
