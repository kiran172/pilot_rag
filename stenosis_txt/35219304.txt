Title: Laparoscopic-assisted Soave procedure for Hirschsprung disease: 10-year experience with 106 cases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to summarize the clinical experience and 10 year follow-up results of laparoscopic assisted Soave procedure for the treatment of long-segment Hirschsprung disease (HD).
METHODS: From January 2010 to February 2020, 106 children with long-segment HD participated in this study. The laparoscopic-assisted Soave procedure was performed for the treatment of long-segment HD. The follow-up time was two weeks, one month, and three months after the operation, and then every six months to one year.
RESULTS: The operation was successful for all 106 children. All patients were discharged 5-7 days after the operation. The median time in surgery was 150 (100-190) minutes, and the median volume of bleeding was 6 (3-10) ml. The short-term postoperative daily defecation frequency was 4-11 times, 3-7 times within 6 months, and 2-3 times after 6-12 months. Postoperative complications included anastomotic leakage in two cases, perianal dermatitis in 13 cases, anastomotic stenosis in four cases, adhesive bowel obstruction in two cases, enterocolitis in 16 cases, soiling in 11 cases, and constipation recurrence in three cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic-assisted Soave procedure is a safe and effective surgical method for treating long-segment HD, and it causes little trauma or bleeding and has a fast postoperative recovery. Yet some complications may occur. Preoperative diagnosis, intraoperative and postoperative standardized processing can reduce the postoperative complications.
