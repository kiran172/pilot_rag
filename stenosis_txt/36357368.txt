Title: Use of drug-eluting, balloon-expandable resolute onyx coronary stent as a novel treatment strategy for vertebral artery ostial stenosis: Case series.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Vertebral artery (VA) ostial stenosis is notoriously difficult to treat using bare-metal stents owing to high rates of restenosis and stent kinking and breakage. We investigated the safety and effectiveness of treatment with a drug-eluting, balloon-expandable coronary stent (Resolute Onyx, Medtronic).
METHODS: Our prospectively maintained database was retrospectively searched for consecutive patients diagnosed with VA ostial stenosis who underwent Resolute Onyx stenting with/without angioplasty between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2022. Patient demographics and clinical and radiographic presentations were recorded. Occlusion location, stenosis severity, contralateral disease, devices used, and intraprocedural and postprocedural complications were noted. Outcomes were assessed based on new or recurrent stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Patients were followed up clinically and with radiographic imaging for in-stent stenosis.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in our study (21 men [80.8%]; mean age 70.3 ± 9.8 years). Symptomatic patients presented with TIA (11/26, 42.3%) and stroke (10/26; 38.5%). Mean stenosis in the study cohort was 74.9 ± 13.0%. One (3.8%) intraprocedural complication was encountered whereby the stent failed to open despite several attempts and was exchanged with a new one without issues. No in-hospital postprocedure stroke, TIA, or mortality was reported. During a mean 16.2 ± 13.6 months' follow up, two patients developed symptomatic in-stent restenosis that was treated with balloon angioplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case series of Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stenting including 30-day postprocedure stroke/TIA rates and clinical/radiographic follow up and demonstrate safe and effective treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic VA ostial stenosis.
