Title: Relationship between echocardiographic parameters and ALBI score in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis.

Abstract: An increase in the volume and pressure of the heart chambers has been shown to increase liver stiffness. The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score is useful and easy-to-use for objectively assessing liver function. There is no information in the literature regarding changes in ALBI scores in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS). The aim of our study was to investigate changes in ALBI score and its clinical impact in patients with MS. Of the 247 patients analyzed, 54 were excluded from the study. The remaining 193 patients with MS were divided into two groups: Group I (64 patients with mitral valve area &gt; 1.5 cm2 and mean transmitral gradient &lt; 10 mmHg) and Group II (129 patients with mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2 and mean transmitral gradient ≥ 10 mmHg). The ALBI score was calculated based on serum albumin and total bilirubin levels using the following formula: ALBI= (log10 bilirubin [µmol/L] × 0.66) + (albumin [g/L] × - 0.085). A significant correlation was found between the ALBI score and mitral valve area in patients with MS (r = - 0.479, p &lt; 0.001*) (Table 4; Fig. 3A). An ALBI score greater than - 2.61 was associated with severe MS (mitral valve area &lt; 1.5 cm2), with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 69% (Area under the ROC curve = 0.726; p &lt; 0.001; 95% CI 0.650-0.802) (Fig. 4A). A significant correlation was found between the ALBI score and mean transmitral gradient in patients with MS (r = 0.476; p &lt; 0.001*) (Table 4; Fig. 3B). An ALBI score greater than - 2.57 was associated with severe MS (mean transmitral gradient &lt; 10 mmHg), with a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 67% (Area under the ROC curve = 0.684; p &lt; 0.001; 95% CI 0.608-0.759) (Fig. 4B). In multivariate linear regression analysis, mitral valve area and mean transmitral gradient were significantly associated with increased ALBI scores (p &lt; 0.05). Mitral valve area, mean transmitral gradient, and NT-proBNP levels were significantly associated with the ALBI score. The ALBI score could provide an information about the severity of MS. The ALBI score is a simple, evidence-based, objective, and discriminatory method for assessing liver function in patients with MS.Please check and confirm that the authors and their respective affiliations have been correctly identified and amend if necessary.Authors and their respective affiliations are correctly identified.
