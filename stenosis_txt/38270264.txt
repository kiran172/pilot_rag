Title: Bronchoscopic Intervention for Tracheobronchopathia Osteochondroplastica: A Report of Two Cases.

Abstract: Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) is an uncommon non-malignant tracheal ailment characterized by the existence of numerous bone and/or cartilage nodules in the submucosa of the trachea and bronchi. At present, there is a lack of standardized treatment recommendations for TO. This article presents two instances of severe tracheal stenosis caused by TO, which were effectively managed through the implementation of bronchoscopic stent placement and rigid bronchoscopy curettage, respectively. Both cases exhibited favorable outcomes, providing novel insights and references for the treatment of TO. Laryngoscope, 134:3093-3095, 2024.
