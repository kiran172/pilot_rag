Title: Long-term safety and efficacy of stenting on correcting internal jugular vein and cerebral venous sinus stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To compare the long-term safety and efficacy of stenting in correcting cerebral venous sinus stenosis (CVSS) and internal jugular venous stenosis (IJVS).
METHODS: Patients confirmed with CVSS or IJVS by imaging were enrolled in this real-world study from 2014 through 2021. Clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of these two diseases entities post-stenting were followed up and compared.
RESULTS: Three hundred and nineteen patients were enrolled in this study, with a mean age of 48.83 years and a BMI of 25.08 on average. In which, 144 patients underwent stenting, the stenotic segments were corrected and the venous blood flow was restored immediately post-stenting. At 6.15 ± 1.67 days follow-up, significant improvement was observed in headache, tinnitus, insomnia, ICP, and mean pressure gradient in both groups (all p < 0.05). At 30.53 ± 4.41 months follow-up post-stenting, the headache, tinnitus, visual loss, papilledema, and insomnia were attenuated remarkably or even completely disappeared. The Frisen papilledema grade scores declined from 2 (0-4) to 1 (0-3) in IJVS group and from 4 (1-5) to 1 (0-4) in CVSS group compared to the baseline. One hundred and twenty-seven out of the 144 patients (95.5%) maintained sufficient blood flow verified by followed up computed tomographic venography or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography. Adverse events related to stenting included three cases of intraluminal restenosis and three cases of in-stent thrombosis, no intracranial hemorrhage, venous thromboembolisms, stent-adjacent stenosis, and stent displacement occurred.
INTERPRETATION: Using stents to correct IH and related neurological issues has shown to be a safe and effective approach for both IJVS and CVSS.
