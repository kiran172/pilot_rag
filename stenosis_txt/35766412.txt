Title: Midterm Results of Intravascular Lithotripsy for Severely Calcified Common Femoral Artery Occlusive Disease: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Common femoral artery (CFA)-occlusive disease has traditionally been treated with open surgery, yet nowadays the frailty of patients has induced to find new techniques of revascularisation by endovascular means. So far, intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has shown promising results in several lower limbs arterial districts. The purpose of this article is to report our experience with IVL for severely calcified peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the CFA.
METHODS: From November 2018 and October 2020, 10 consecutive patients (12 limbs) treated with IVL were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database. Inclusion criteria were CFA localization of PAD, with a severe degree of calcification, a lesion length ≥10 mm, and a degree of stenosis ≥70% (severe). The only admitted adjunctive treatment was drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty. Primary outcomes were technical and procedural success, clinical success, and target lesion revascularisation (TLR). Secondary outcomes were target extremity revascularisation (TER) and major adverse events (MAEs).
RESULTS: All patients underwent IVL with associated DCB angioplasty. The median percentage of achieved stenosis reduction was 55.5% (interquartile range [IQR] 50-60.75), with a technical and procedural success of 100%. Over the study period, TLR only occurred in one limb (8.3%), with a mean upgrade in Rutherford class of 2.7 ± 0.77. No target vessel and access site complications were reported, as well as no distal embolization. One death and one major amputation occurred over the follow-up period, both in the same patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, IVL for selected cases of severely calcified CFA disease, associated with DCB angioplasty, may be considered a safe and effective technique. Of course, a long-term follow-up and a larger series of patients are needed to validate our results.
