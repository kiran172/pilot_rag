Title: Spontaneous Recanalization of Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion: A Case Report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous recanalization of an occluded internal carotid artery (ICA) is thought to be unlikely. However, there has been a growing number of reports describing this phenomenon. Despite this, the frequency, time course, and mechanism of spontaneous recanalization remain unknown. In this paper, we describe a patient with a symptomatic recanalization of an occluded left ICA.
CASE REPORT: A 70-year-old woman presented with transient speech arrest and right upper extremity weakness related to an occluded ICA. After 3 days, her weakness and aphasia reappeared and worsened transiently. A repeat computed tomography angiography revealed recanalization of the occluded ICA, as well as new ischemic changes in the previously hypoperfused left insular region. This finding changed the management from medical management to revascularization with a stent, after which the patient was discharged home with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel.
CONCLUSIONS: Although previously thought to be a rare occurrence, spontaneous recanalization is not uncommon. Further research into this phenomenon as proper identification and characterization of this phenomenon can influence follow-up and management.
