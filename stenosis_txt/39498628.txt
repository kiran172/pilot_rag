Title: Successful Management of Myval Transcatheter Heart Valve Embolization Into Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter heart valve embolization is a serious and rare complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Having a strategy for promptly managing transcatheter heart valve embolization is crucial to avoid emergency conversion from transcatheter aortic valve replacement to open-heart surgery. Many cases of transcatheter heart valve embolization occurring with balloon-expandable prostheses such as the SAPIEN 3 (Edwards LifeSciences Corporation) valve and self-expandable prostheses such as the ACURATE neo (Boston Scientific Corporation) valve have been reported in the literature. Here, for the first time (to the authors' knowledge), the case of a Myval (Meril Life Sciences Pvt Ltd) transcatheter heart valve embolization during transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which was treated percutaneously with favorable outcomes, is reported.
