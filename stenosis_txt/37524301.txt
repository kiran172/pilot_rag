Title: What is the current optimal antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation? Current evidence from Japan and the world.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a major valvular disease that can have a negative impact on patients' prognosis, and its prevalence is increasing due to an aging population worldwide. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a well-established therapy for symptomatic severe AS utilized across the entire surgical risk spectrum. Based on the recently published evidence of large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the number of patients undergoing TAVI is increasing worldwide. Ischemic and bleeding events are common after TAVI and can have serious consequences both immediately after the procedure and in the long-term. Antiplatelet therapy has been traditionally recommended to prevent thromboembolic events after TAVI. The situation regarding the optimal antithrombotic regimen following TAVI is rapidly changing because many game-changing RCTs have been published. This report provides an overview of the current status and remaining issues in the field of optimal antithrombotic therapy following TAVI, including its possible effect on leaflet thrombosis.
