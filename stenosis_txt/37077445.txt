Title: Huge Morgagni Hernia, a Rare Criterion to Favor TAVI Against SAVR.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is now a validated treatment option for severe aortic stenosis in patients inÂ whom surgical aortic valve replacement is recommended, especially those associated with an elevated surgical risk. Here, we discuss the surgical management of a case of severe aortic stenosis in a patient with huge Morgagni hernia. (Level of Difficulty: Beginner.).
