Title: Unilateral biportal endoscopic laminectomy with lateral mass screw fixation for treating cervical spinal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) technique is less invasive and has a faster recovery time than open surgery. Compared with the uniportal technique, the biportal technique has a larger field of vision and a wider operation range.
METHOD: We attempted the posterior UBE approach for cervical stenosis at the C4-C6 levels. UBE decompression of C4-C6 with unilateral lateral mass screw fixation at the C4-C5 levels was performed under general anesthesia.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully performed cord decompression at the C4-C6 levels using the UBE technique. This approach could be used as an alternative method to treat cervical stenosis with instability.
