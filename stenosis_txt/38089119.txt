Title: Bailout MitraClip therapy for deteriorated systolic anterior motion-related severe mitral regurgitation post-alcohol septal ablation: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is a non-surgical treatment for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. It has a potential risk for systolic anterior motion (SAM)-related mitral regurgitation (MR) deterioration, leading to acute congestive heart failure. In such clinical scenarios, additional surgical interventions for SAM-MR are risky.
CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old man experienced acutely deteriorated heart failure caused by SAM-related MR following ASA, for which venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (Impella CP, Abiomed, MA, USA) were required. Transoesophageal echocardiography showed that an interventricular septal oedematous protrusion led to a large coaptation gap of mitral leaflets with a pseudo-prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet (PML). Because of his prohibitive surgical risks, we opted for transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with MitraClip therapy. After removing the Impella device, an XT clip (Abbott Vascular, CA, USA) was located to cover the pseudo-prolapsed PML, resulting in optimal MR reduction with an acceptable mean transmitral valve-pressure gradient. Thereafter, his heart failure was well controlled, and venous-arterial ECMO was successfully removed on post-MitraClip Day 2.
DISCUSSION: This case demonstrated that MitraClip therapy rescued the patient from a rare complication of severe acute heart failure with haemodynamic collapse caused by massive SAM-related MR following ASA. MitraClip therapy can be a feasible, less-invasive interventional therapy for SAM-related MR in cases with acceptable severity of iatrogenic mitral stenosis post-MitraClip implantation.
