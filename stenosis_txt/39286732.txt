Title: An uncommon and challenging finding regarding the tricuspid valve: case report, clinical considerations, and practical management.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of tricuspid masses remains challenging.
CASE SUMMARY: This case involves the incidental detection of a lesion with a non-solid appearance, exhibiting the characteristic 'finger-in-glove' and 'garland-like' morphology, resembling a blind-ended protrusion of the tricuspid leaflet. This presentation is consistent with a tricuspid valve aneurysm, without significant associated stenosis or regurgitation.
DISCUSSION: Given the lesion's morphological features, the patient's asymptomatic status, and the absence of a precipitating event suggestive of an alternative diagnosis, we concluded that the most likely diagnosis is aseptic tricuspid valve aneurysm. Following a multidisciplinary heart team discussion, surgical intervention was deemed unnecessary.
