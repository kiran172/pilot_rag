Title: Growth assessments for children with recurrent tracheoesophageal fistulas.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the growth status of children with recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula (rTEF), and determine the possible risk factors of growth retardation (GR).
METHODS: The medical records of 83 patients with rTEF who underwent surgical repair were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were retrospectively divided into two groups according to whether they had GR. The clinical variables were compared between the GR and non-GR groups. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify the risk factors for GR.
RESULTS: Eighty-three children diagnosed with rTEF were included in this study. After a median follow-up of 31.4 (19.8, 48.7) months, GR occurred in 28 patients (33.7%). Among them, six patients with only weight for age Z score (WAZ) < -2SD, five patients with only height for age Z score (HAZ) < -2SD, and six patients with only BMI for age Z score (BAZ) < -2SD, while seven patients with both WAZ and HAZ < -2SD and four patients with both WAZ, HAZ and BAZ < -2SD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that birth weight, anastomotic stricture and dysphagia after rTEF repair were independent risk factors with OR of 0.325 (0.119, 0.891), 4.396 (1.451, 13.324) and 5.341 (1.153, 24.752) for GR, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: GR is a common complication after rTEF repair. Birth weight, anastomotic stricture and dysphagia after rTEF repair are independent risk factors affecting growth.
