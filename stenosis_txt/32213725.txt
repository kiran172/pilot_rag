Title: Impact of Valvular Heart Disease on Mortality, Thromboembolic and Cardiac Events in Japanese Patients With Atrial Fibrillation　- The Fushimi AF Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a growing burden of valvular heart disease (VHD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) due to population aging, but data regarding the characteristics and outcomes of patients with AF and concomitant VHD are lacking.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Fushimi AF Registry is a community-based prospective survey of AF patients in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto. Among 3,566 patients with available echocardiographic data, 20% had VHD, consisting of 131 valvular AF (VAF: 3.7%) and 583 nonvalvular AF with VHD (NVAF-VHD: 16.3%). Here, VAF was defined as AF with mitral stenosis or a prosthetic heart valve. AF patients with VHD were older, had more comorbidities with a higher CHADS<sub>2</sub> score, and were prescribed oral anticoagulants more frequently than those without VHD. After adjusting for confounders, VHD was not associated with stroke or systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, or cardiac death. NVAF-VHD was significantly associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.78), whereas VAF was not (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.86-1.92). Among all types of VHD, aortic valve diseases were associated with a higher risk of cardiac events, whereas mitral valve diseases were not.
CONCLUSIONS: Although VHD did not significantly affect thromboembolism or mortality, it affected cardiac events depending on type, with aortic valve diseases having higher risk, in Japanese patients with AF.
