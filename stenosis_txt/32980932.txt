Title: Postoperative "complications" following laparoscopic-assisted anorectoplasty: A systematic review.

Abstract: AIM: This study reviewed the literature on the postoperative complications following laparoscopic-assisted anorectoplasty (LAARP).
METHODS: A Medline and Embase search was performed for the terms "anorectal malformation" (ARM) "laparoscopic" and "complication". Articles without English full text, review articles, systematic reviews, case reports, case series < 5 cases and duplicate articles were excluded. Two reviewers independently performed the eligibility assessment and data extraction. Data were collected for type of malformation, surgical technique, postoperative complications and functional outcomes RESULTS: The search retrieved 108 articles, of which 38 met the inclusion criteria and offered 1058 patients for analysis. Rectoprostatic and rectobladder neck fistula were the most common types of ARM in males, whereas it was the common cloaca in females. Analysis of complications demonstrated rectal prolapse (n = 149; 14.08%) being the most prominent, followed by urethral diverticulum (n = 32; 3.02%), anal stenosis (n = 37; 3.49%), recurrent fistula (n = 7; 0.66%) and rectal stricture (n = 4; 0.37%). Krickenbeck classification was used for functional assessment in 638 patients, with fecal soiling grade 2 or > 2 in 79. Data on functional outcome specific to the type of malformation was available for 246 patients: fecal soiling grade 2 or > 2 in 15/94 (15.95%) with rectoprostatic fistula, 26/73 (35.61%) with rectobladder neck fistula, 6/47 (12.76%) with common cloaca, and 1/22 (4.54%) with no fistula.
CONCLUSION: Rectal prolapse, posterior urethral diverticulum and anal stenosis are the most common complications after LAARP. Inconsistent and non-uniform functional assessment and non-availability of information about the sacrum and spine make it difficult to analyze the functional outcome following LAARP.
