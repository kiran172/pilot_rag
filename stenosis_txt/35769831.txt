Title: A giant left atrial myxoma causing left-sided heart failure.

Abstract: This report presents a case study on giant left atrial myxoma. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a giant mass in the left atrium of a 53-year-old female patient causing functional mitral stenosis. Tumor resection was performed, and the pathological diagnosis confirmed the atrial myxoma. Postoperative echocardiography showed no evidence of any remaining mass and mitral stenosis.
