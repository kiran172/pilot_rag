Title: [Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Instrumented fusion of lumbar motion segments using a minimally invasive technique.
INDICATIONS: Degenerative disc disease, segmental degeneration, degenerative spondylolisthesis, isthmic spondylolisthesis, pseudarthrosis, other spinal lumbar instabilities, disc prolapse, revision for failed back surgery syndrome, unilateral neuroforaminal stenosis, facet joint arthrosis.
CONTRAINDICATIONS: High-grade spondylolisthesis (Meyerding grades III/IV, spondyloptosis), bilateral nerve root compression, vertebral fractures, tumors, high-grade spinal instabilities, primary spinal deformities, multilevel pathologies.
SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Ipsilateral minimally invasive approach using a self-retaining tubular retractor system, partial or complete facetectomy, insertion of pedicle screws, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) cage insertion preserving nerve roots, fusion, contralateral insertion of pedicle screws using a minimally invasive or percutaneous technique.
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Mobilization with physiotherapy, followed by standing plain x‑ray examinations, clinical and radiological follow-up at 6-12 weeks and 1 year postoperatively.
RESULTS: Fusion rates >90%, comparable to open TLIF. Complication rates lower than open TLIF. Shorter radiation exposure during surgery, lower blood loss. Less surgical trauma leads to shorter hospitalization time and earlier return-to-work. Oswestry Disability index (ODI) scores and visual analog scale (VAS) scores significantly decreased.
