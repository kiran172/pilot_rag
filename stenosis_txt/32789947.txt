Title: Central venous stenosis in a transplant patient due to thyroid pathology: A teachable moment.

Abstract: Central venous stenosis is a well-recognized complication of central venous catheter use in hemodialysis patients, which may present with significant swelling of the upper limbs, neck, and face. Here, we describe a renal transplant recipient previously on hemodialysis, who underwent endovascular intervention for central venous stenosis after presenting with facial swelling and exertional dyspnoea. His symptoms continued to progress, however, until the underlying thyroid pathology was recognized. Ruling out the possible mimics of central venous stenosis is important in preventing unnecessary intervention. This case highlights the role of specialty bias in the process of diagnosis.
