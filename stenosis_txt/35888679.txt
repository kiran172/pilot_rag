Title: Superficial Femoral Artery Recanalization Using Fiber Optic RealShape Technology.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Report of a successful case of endovascular recanalization of an occluded superficial femoral artery (SFA) using Fiber Optic RealShape (FORS) technology.
CASE REPORT: A 79-year-old male was referred for evaluation of multiple ischemic pretibial ulcers of the right lower extremity. Computed tomography-angiography (CTA) imaging confirmed significant stenosis of the right common femoral artery (CFA) and an occlusion of the SFA from its origin to the Hunter's canal. The patient was treated with a hybrid surgical procedure: an endarterectomy of the CFA and SFA origin was performed combined with an endovascular recanalization of the occluded SFA using FORS technology. During recanalization, the FORS guidewire slowly twisted subintimally around the occluded lumen of the SFA, maintaining the created corkscrew shape after pre-dilation with the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon and subsequent stenting.
CONCLUSIONS: FORS technology can be successfully used during recanalization of an occluded SFA without the use of fluoroscopy. The corkscrew shape formed during recanalization in this case was retained during PTA balloon pre-dilation and stenting; this potentially improves hemodynamics and thereby reduces the risk of in-stent restenosis. However, expanding patient series and longer follow-up data are needed to increase the understanding of the feasibility and effectiveness of using FORS in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
