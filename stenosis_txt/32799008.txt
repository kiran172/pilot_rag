Title: An unusual cause of changing QRS morphology.

Abstract: A 7-day old term neonate with D-malposition of great arteries, large perimembranous ventricular septal defect (almost single ventricle), without pulmonary stenosis was admitted with cyanosis and congestive heart failure. ECG revealed supraventricular tachycardia with alternating QRS axis with every beat. We discuss our approach to this scenario, which leads us to a rather rare cause of changing QRS morphology.
