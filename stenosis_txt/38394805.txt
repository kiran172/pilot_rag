Title: Design and hierarchical analysis of magnetic actuated robot: A governing equation based approach.

Abstract: As the alternative solution to the conventional guidewire, the magnetic robot can help interventionists perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) because magnetic fields are transparent and safe for biological tissues. Despite extensive research on magnetic robots, the exploration of their deflection control for practical applications still requires further research. In this paper, a hierarchical analysis framework (HAF) is proposed to control the magnetic robot's deflection. Six deflection subpatterns are analyzed through HAF, incorporating statistical and regression analyses to establish governing equations of magnetic robots. The performance of the control equations is validated through precise control of the magnetic continuum robot (MCR) and magnet-tipped robot (MTR) in both uniform and gradient magnetic fields. Experimental results show that under the uniform magnetic field, the average root mean square error (RMSE) of governing equation of MCR is 0.08±0.05°, 0.41±0.34°, 1.47±0.49° and 1.07±0.66° for four-types horizontal deflection, 0.19±0.07mm and 0.16±0.10mm for two-types vertical deflection, respectively. Based on the governing equations, the MTR is able to precisely navigate to coronary arteries with various degrees of stenosis (30%, 52%, and 60%), and successfully pass through a series of rings, with an average error of 1.05 mm. The research successfully demonstrates the potential of HAF in creating robust and reliable governing equations for magnetic actuation in medical robotics, with significant implications for enhancing the precision and safety of PCI procedures.
