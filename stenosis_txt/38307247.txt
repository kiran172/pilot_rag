Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in Germany with need for a surgical bailout.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), complications may force the need for a surgical bailout, but knowledge is rare about outcomes in Germany.
METHODS: Using national health records, we investigated all TAVR in German hospitals between 2007 and 2020, focusing on 2018-2020. We extracted data on those interventions with need for a surgical bailout.
RESULTS: A total of 159,643 TAVR were analyzed, with an overall rate of surgical bailout of 2.30 %, an overall in-hospital mortality of 3.85 %, and in-hospital mortality in case of bailout of 16.51 %. The number of all annual TAVR procedures increased substantially (202 to 22,972), with the rate of surgical bailout declining from 27.23 to 0.61 % and overall mortality from 11.39 to 2.29 %. However, in-hospital mortality after bailout was still high (28.37 % in 2020). The standardized rates of overall mortality and surgical bailout between 2018 and 2020 were significantly lower for balloon-expandable and self-expanding transfemoral TAVR than for transapical TAVR after risk adjustment [transapical/transfemoral balloon-expandable/transfemoral self-expanding TAVR: in-hospital mortality: 5.66 % (95 % CI 4.81 %; 6.52 %)/2.30 % (2.03 %; 2.57 %)/2.32 % (2.07 %; 2.57 %); surgical bailout: 2.33 % (1.68 %; 2.97 %)/0.79 % (0.60 %; 0.98 %)/0.42 % (0.31 %; 0.53 %)]. Coronary artery disease [risk-adjusted OR = 1.50 (1.21; 1.85), p < 0.001] and atrial fibrillation [OR = 1.29 (1.07; 1.57), p = 0.009] were found to be the main risk factors for bailout.
CONCLUSIONS: Rates of TAVR with need for a surgical bailout and overall in-hospital mortality have declined noticeably over the years in Germany. However, the outcomes are still unfavorable after surgical bailout, as in-hospital mortality is continuously high. We present risk factors for surgical bailout to improve preparation of subsequent measures. It must be a major goal to further reduce the rate of surgical bailouts in the future.
