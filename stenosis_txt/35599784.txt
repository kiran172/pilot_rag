Title: Endovascular Materials and Their Behavior in Peripheral Vascular Surgery.

Abstract: Endovascular techniques have progressively become the first option for the treatment of stenosis and occlusions of both aorto-iliac and femoro-popliteal district. The development of new technologies and new materials has broadened the applicability of the endovascular techniques, allowing the treatment of each lesion with the most suitable material. A knowledge of the behavior of endovascular materials when treating peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is, therefore, crucial for optimization of the results. Here, we aim to review the most important technical features of the actually available endovascular materials for treating PAD.
