Title: Ultra-high resolution coronary CT angiography on photon-counting detector CT: bi-centre study on the impact of quantum iterative reconstruction on image quality and accuracy of stenosis measurements.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the impact of different quantum iterative reconstruction (QIR) levels on objective and subjective image quality of ultra-high resolution (UHR) coronary CT angiography (CCTA) images and to determine the effect of strength levels on stenosis quantification using photon-counting detector (PCD)-CT.
METHOD: A dynamic vessel phantom containing two calcified lesions (25 % and 50 % stenosis) was scanned at heart rates of 60, 80 and 100 beats per minute with a PCD-CT system. In vivo CCTA examinations were performed in 102 patients. All scans were acquired in UHR mode (slice thickness0.2 mm) and reconstructed with four different QIR levels (1-4) using a sharp vascular kernel (Bv64). Image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sharpness, and percent diameter stenosis (PDS) were quantified in the phantom, while noise, SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), sharpness, and subjective quality metrics (noise, sharpness, overall image quality) were assessed in patient scans.
RESULTS: Increasing QIR levels resulted in significantly lower objective image noise (in vitro and in vivo: both p < 0.001), higher SNR (both p < 0.001) and CNR (both p < 0.001). Sharpness and PDS values did not differ significantly among QIRs (all pairwise p > 0.008). Subjective noise of in vivo images significantly decreased with increasing QIR levels, resulting in significantly higher image quality scores at increasing QIR levels (all pairwise p < 0.001). Qualitative sharpness, on the other hand, did not differ across different levels of QIR (p = 0.15).
CONCLUSIONS: The QIR algorithm may enhance the image quality of CCTA datasets without compromising image sharpness or accurate stenosis measurements, with the most prominent benefits at the highest strength level.
