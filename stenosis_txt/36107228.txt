Title: Contemporary treatment of mitral valve disease with transcatheter mitral valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) with self-expanding (SAV) or balloon-expandable (BAV) valves are rising as promising treatment options for high-risk patients with symptomatic mitral valve (MVD) disease unsuitable for alternative treatment options.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the clinical, procedural and outcome parameters of patients undergoing SAV or BAV for MVD.
METHODS: In this observational and single-center case series, fifteen consecutive patients treated with the Tendyne Mitral Valve System (SAV) and thirty-one patients treated with SAPIEN prosthesis (BAV) were included.
RESULTS: The patients (aged 78 years [interquartile range (IQR): 65.5 to 83.1 years], 41% women, EuroSCORE II 10.3% [IQR: 5.5 to 17.0%] were similar regarding baseline characteristics, despite a higher rate of prior heart valve surgery and prevalence of MV stenosis in the SAV-group. At discharge, the SAV-group had a mean transvalvular gradient of 4.2 mmHg, whereas the BAV-group had a mean transvalvular gradient of 6.2 mmHg. None or trace paravalvular leakage (PVL) was assessed in 85% in SAV-group and 80% in the BAV-group. 320 day all-cause and cardiac mortality rates were comparable in both groups (SAV: 26.7% vs BAV: 20%, p = 0.60). Four deaths occurred early in the SAV-group until 32 days of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk patients with MVD, TMVI presents a promising treatment option with encouraging mid-term outcomes and good valve durability. TMVI either with BAV or SAV may be developed to an established treatment option.
