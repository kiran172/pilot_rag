Title: Anesthesia for Neurosurgical Emergencies.

Abstract: Neurosurgical procedures are unique in that the best monitoring modality is the neurologic examination and the most important sign includes an intact mental status. Anesthesiologists play a vital role in medical management of neurosurgical emergencies. The authors discuss the important management strategies for these emergencies, including increased intracranial pressure and impending brain herniation, acute alteration of mental status, status epilepticus, and trauma to cervical spine. The key is to maintain cerebral and spinal cord perfusion pressure at all times to salvage neuronal recovery.
