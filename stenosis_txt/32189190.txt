Title: Impact of gender on immature platelet count and its relationship with coronary artery disease.

Abstract: The impact of platelet parameters on the cardiovascular risk is still debated. Gender differences in platelet volume indexes and turnover have been previously reported, potentially conditioning their role in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, few studies have addressed, so far, the impact of gender on the immature platelet fraction (IPF) and count (IPC) and their relationship with CAD. We enrolled consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography in a single centre. IPF and platelet indexes were measured at admission. Significant CAD was defined as the presence of at least one coronary stenosis more than 50%. A total of 2550 patients were included, 1835 (72%) were males, and 715 (28%) were females. Female patients were older (p < 0.001), with lower BMI (p = 0.002), lower prevalence of active smoking (p < 0.001), previous MI, previous PCI and CABG (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, p < 0.001), whilst a higher prevalence of renal failure (p = 0.02), acute presentation (p < 0.001) and CAD (p < 0.001). Platelet count was higher in females (p < 0.001), as well as the IPC levels (838.38 ± 562.05 vs 792.24 ± 535.66, p = 0.05) with no difference in the levels of immature platelet fraction (3.67 ± 2.68% vs 3.74 ± 2.6%, p = 0.55) or the prevalence of patients with IPF ≥ 3rd tertile (33.7% vs 35.2%, p = 0.26). At multivariate analysis, after correction for baseline confounders, gender did not emerge as an independent predictor of higher IPF (adjusted OR [95% CI] = 0.82 [0.64-1.06], p = 0.13). When dividing our patients according to the levels of IPF, in women we observed an inverse association between IPF ≥ 3rd tertile and coronary calcifications (p = 0.025) and a higher prevalence of restenosis (p = 0.003), but no difference in CAD (65.6% vs 66.9%, p = 0.71) or severe CAD (28.1% vs 24.7%, p = 0.31). In males, the IPF ≥ 3rd tertile related with a lower TIMI flow (p = 0.001). Males with lower IPF had a significantly higher percentage of CAD (87.7% vs 83.3%, p = 0.007; adjusted OR: 0.699 [95% CI] = [0.54-0.91], p = 0.008) but not for severe CAD (36.5% vs 39.9%, p = 0.134). The present study shows that among patients undergoing coronary angiography, gender is not associated to the levels of immature platelet fraction. Moreover, we found no association between IPF and the prevalence and extent of CAD in female gender, whereas in male gender the IPF was inversely related with the prevalence of CAD.
