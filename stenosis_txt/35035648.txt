Title: Vertebral and carotid artery aneurysms and polyarthritis in a patient with Takayasu arteritis: A case report.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a common autoimmune disease in the clinical setting. However, vertebral artery aneurysms caused by TA are rarely reported. We herein describe a 28-year-old man with multiple vertebral artery aneurysms and carotid artery aneurysms caused by TA, which showed typical wall thickening and lumen dilation with a "string of beads" appearance by Doppler ultrasound and radiology. Previous studies have shown that most TA-associated vertebral artery lesions are stenosis, occlusion, and dissection of the intracranial part of the artery. In this case, TA mainly affected the cervical segment of the vertebral artery (the intracranial segment was not obviously involved), and the main manifestations were aneurysms and occlusion. This case provides more information for further understanding of TA-associated vertebral artery lesions.
