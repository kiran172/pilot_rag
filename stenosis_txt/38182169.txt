Title: Long-term palliation of a malignant colonic anastomotic stricture using a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS).

Abstract: Malignant recurrent colonic strictures at the anastomotic site are difficult to treat long term with traditional uncovered metal stents due to the location and risk for tumour ingrowth. We present a case with the use of a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) to successfully palliate a high-grade obstruction at an anastomotic site without recurrence of obstructive symptoms for 14 months.
