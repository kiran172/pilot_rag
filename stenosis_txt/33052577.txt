Title: Reclassification of aortic stenosis by fusion of echocardiography and computed tomography in low-gradient aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The integration of computed tomography (CT)-derived left ventricular outflow tract area into the echocardiography-derived continuity equation results in the reclassification of a significant proportion of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) into moderate AS based on aortic valve area indexed to body surface area determined by fusion imaging (fusion AVA<sub>i</sub>). The aim of this study was to evaluate AS severity by a fusion imaging technique in patients with low-gradient AS and to compare the clinical impact of reclassified moderate AS versus severe AS.
METHODS: We included 359 consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation for low-gradient, severe AS at two academic institutions and created a joint database. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and rehospitalisations for heart failure at 1 year.
RESULTS: Overall, 35% of the population (n = 126) were reclassified to moderate AS [median fusion AVAi 0.70 (interquartile range, IQR 0.65-0.80) cm2/m2] and severe AS was retained as the classification in 65% [median fusion AVAi 0.49 (IQR 0.43-0.54) cm2/m2]. Lower body mass index, higher logistic EuroSCORE and larger aortic dimensions characterised patients reclassified to moderate AS. Overall, 57% of patients had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%. Clinical outcome was similar in patients with reclassified moderate or severe AS. Among patients reclassified to moderate AS, non-cardiac mortality was higher in those with LVEF &lt;50% than in those with LVEF ≥50% (log-rank p = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: The integration of CT and transthoracic echocardiography to obtain fusion AVAi led to the reclassification of one third of patients with low-gradient AS to moderate AS. Reclassification did not affect clinical outcome, although patients reclassified to moderate AS with a LVEF <50% had worse outcomes owing to excess non-cardiac mortality.
