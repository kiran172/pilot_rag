Title: Hybrid approach to pulmonary vein stenting after Fontan palliation.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis is poorly tolerated in patients who have undergone Fontan palliation and typically requires surgical or transcatheter intervention. Percutaneous transcatheter approaches to intervention can be technically difficult due to challenging anatomy. A hybrid per-atrial transcatheter approach for stenting pulmonary veins provides a direct approach to the pulmonary veins and has the potential to improve safety and efficacy of this complex intervention. We describe our experience with hybrid per-atrial pulmonary vein stenting in three patients with pulmonary vein stenosis following Fontan palliation.
