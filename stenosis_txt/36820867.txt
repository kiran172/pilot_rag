Title: Stenting of branch pulmonary artery stenosis in children: initial experience and mid-term follow-up of the pul-stent.

Abstract: Not all stents are suitable for children. For instance, premounted stents can be used in infants and small children but cannot dilate with age to accommodate adult-sized pulmonary arteries. Conversely, the Pul-Stent adapts to somatic growth. Thus, our hospital implemented the Pul-Stent in pediatric patients with branch pulmonary artery stenosis. This study summarizes our initial experience with Pul-Stents in this patient population, including the efficacy and safety. We implanted 37 Pul-Stents in 35 patients between August 2014 and June 2015. The patients' mean age and weight at stent implantation were 6.7 ± 3.0 years and 20.9 ± 8.7 kg, respectively. Bench testing revealed that axial shortening of the Pul-Stent was minimal with further dilation, and the radial strength did not change. The stents were successfully deployed in all cases, except two with minor malpositioning. Primarily, 8-12 mm mounting balloons were used for the initial implantation, and a long sheath (8-10 F) was used for delivery. After stent implantation, the minimal lumen diameter in the stenosed segment increased by 50% in 97% (34/35) of patients. Furthermore, the pressure gradient across the stenosed segment decreased by 50% in 77% (23/30) of biventricular patients. One stent fracture and one stent restenosis were noted during the follow-up visits (mean follow-up time: 4.6 ± 1.7 years). Eighteen patients (51%) underwent repeat catheterization; ten had successful redilation. No aneurysms or stent fractures were observed. Our initial results indicate that the Pul-Stent is safe and effective in pediatric patients and can be further dilated over time to accommodate somatic growth. Moreover, the Pul-Stent has good compliance and adequate radial strength to treat pulmonary artery stenosis effectively.
