Title: Risk stratification of anastomotic stricture using early postoperative endoscopic and computed tomography findings in patients undergoing esophagectomy with cervical esophagogastric anastomosis for esophageal cancer.

Abstract: Anastomotic stricture (AS) is one of the major complications after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. We have previously reported that severe mucosal degeneration (MD) of the anastomotic site was associated with the incidence of AS. Meanwhile, there are few reports to correlate anastomotic internal circumference (AIC) with computed tomography (CT) with the incidence of AS. Therefore, this study was conducted to clarify the correlation of early postoperative endoscopic and CT findings with the incidence of AS. We assessed 205 patients who underwent esophagectomy. We then divided them into the non-AS group (n = 164) and the AS group (n = 41) and compared their background data and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. We also evaluated the risk factors for AS using logistic regression model. Multivariate analysis revealed small AIC (P = 0.003; OR = 4.400; 95% CI = 1.650-11.700) and severe MD (P < 0.001; OR = 7.200; 95% CI = 2.650-19.600) as the independent risk factors for AS development. We also stratified the patients into the following four groups according to the incidence of AS: low-risk (normal AIC and intact or mild MD, 6.2%), intermediate-risk (small AIC and intact or mild MD, 29.4%), high-risk (normal AIC and severe MD, 42.9%), and very high-risk (small AIC and severe MD, 61.1%). Early postoperative endoscopic and CT findings were useful in predicting the development of AS after esophagectomy.
