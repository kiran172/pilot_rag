Title: Hemodynamic response to transseptal transcatheter mitral valve replacement in patients with severe mitral stenosis due to severe mitral annular calcification.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the invasive hemodynamic changes with transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) in patients with severe mitral stenosis due to severe mitral annular calcification.
BACKGROUND: The hemodynamic response to TMVR in patients with mitral stenosis related to degenerative mitral annular calcification has not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: We conducted retrospective review of patients who underwent successful transseptal TMVR with balloon-expandable valves for symptomatic severe mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification at our institution between January 2014 and February 2020. Invasive hemodynamic measurements were obtained both before valve implantation (predeployment) and after (postdeployment).
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (age 72 ± 10 years, 44% female) were included for the analysis. There was a significant reduction in mean left atrial pressure (23.7 ± 5.6 mmHg versus 20.6 ± 4.8 mmHg; p = .01), left atrial v-wave (mean 39.3 ± 10.2 mmHg versus 32.9 ± 9.9 mmHg; p = .01), and an increase in systemic mean blood pressure (72.6 mmHg ±11.2 versus 79.5 ± 9.9 mmHg; p = .02) postdeployment compared to predeployment. Patients who had symptom improvement at 30-day follow-up tended to have greater reduction in mean left atrial pressure (4.4 ± 4.4 mmHg versus 0.5 ± 5.2 mmHg; p = .16) and v-wave (8.6 ± 9.0 mmHg versus 0.7 ± 8.4 mmHg; p = .10) compared to those who did not experience improvement of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Transseptal TMVR for severe mitral stenosis due to mitral annular calcification is associated with reductions in mean left atrial pressure and left atrial v-wave, and an increase in systemic arterial pressure.
