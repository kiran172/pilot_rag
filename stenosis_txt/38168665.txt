Title: Multi-pose-based convolutional neural network model for diagnosis of patients with central lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: Although the role of plain radiographs in diagnosing lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) has declined in importance since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diagnostic ability of plain radiographs has improved dramatically when combined with deep learning. Previously, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using a radiograph for diagnosing LSS. In this study, we aimed to improve and generalize the performance of CNN models and overcome the limitation of the single-pose-based CNN (SP-CNN) model using multi-pose radiographs. Individuals with severe or no LSS, confirmed using MRI, were enrolled. Lateral radiographs of patients in three postures were collected. We developed a multi-pose-based CNN (MP-CNN) model using the encoders of the three SP-CNN model (extension, flexion, and neutral postures). We compared the validation results of the MP-CNN model using four algorithms pretrained with ImageNet. The MP-CNN model underwent additional internal and external validations to measure generalization performance. The ResNet50-based MP-CNN model achieved the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 91.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.9-91.8%) for internal validation. The AUROC of the MP-CNN model were 91.3% (95% CI 90.7-91.9%) and 79.5% (95% CI 78.2-80.8%) for the extra-internal and external validation, respectively. The MP-CNNÂ based heatmap offered a logical decision-making direction through optimized visualization. This model holds potential as a screening tool for LSS diagnosis, offering an explainable rationale for its prediction.
