Title: One-Stage Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Tricuspid Valve Repair for Double Valve Dysfunction in a High-Risk Patient.

Abstract: A 75-year-old female patient was referred to our institution for severe symptomatic low-flow low-gradient aortic valve stenosis and tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) associated with heart failure. After multidisciplinary discussion, the patient was scheduled for one-stage totally percutaneous treatment of her valve lesions by transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and transcatheter edge-to-edge tricuspid valve repair (TEER) through transfemoral access. The patient had an uneventful hospital stay and was discharged home on the third postoperative day. During the following 24 months, the patient did well with regression of her heart failure signs and symptoms.
