Title: Association of Metabolic Syndrome with Stroke, Myocardial Infarction, and Other Postoperative Complications Following Carotid Endarterectomy: A Multicenter, Retrospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of hypertension, insulin resistance, obesity, and dyslipidemia and is known to increase the risk of postoperative morbidity. This study aimed to assess the impact of MetS on stroke, myocardial infarction, mortality, and other complications following carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Patients undergoing elective CEA between 2011 and 2020 were included. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists status 5, preoperative length of stay (LOS) > 1 day, ventilator dependence, admission from nonhome location, and ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis of < 50% or 100% were excluded. A composite cardiovascular outcome for postoperative stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality was generated. Multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association of MetS with the composite outcome and other perioperative complications.
RESULTS: We included 25,226 patients (3,613, 14.3% with MetS). MetS was associated with postoperative stroke, unplanned readmission, and prolonged LOS on bivariate analysis. On multivariable analysis, MetS was significantly associated with the composite cardiovascular outcome (1.320 [1.061-1.642]), stroke (1.387 [1.039-1.852]), unplanned readmission (1.399 [1.210-1.619]), and prolonged LOS (1.378 [1.024-1.853]). Other clinico-demographic factors associated with the cardiovascular outcome included Black race, smoking status, anemia, leukocytosis, physiologic risk factors, symptomatic disease, preoperative beta-blocker use, and operative time ≥ 150 min.
CONCLUSIONS: MetS is associated with cardiovascular complications, stroke, prolonged LOS, and unplanned readmissions following CEA. Surgeons should provide optimized care to this high-risk population and strive to reduce operative durations.
