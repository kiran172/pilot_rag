Title: Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I Diagnosed by Aortic and Mitral Valve Replacement.

Abstract: A 32-year-old developmentally delayed man presenting with dyspnea was found to have severe aortic and mitral valveÂ stenosis. After double valve replacement, unique histologic findings prompted a genetics evaluation, ultimately leading to the diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis type I, a rare lysosomal storage disorder with high rates of cardiac manifestations. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
