Title: Stensen's Duct Stenosis Balloon Dilatation: Long-term Evaluation of Clinical Outcomes and Quality of Life Impacts.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To conduct a long-term retrospective evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of sialographic balloon dilatation in Stensen's duct stenosis (SDS).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
SETTING: Single-institution academic tertiary referral center.
METHODS: All SDS balloon dilatations (SSBDs) performed from 2011 to 2017 were monitored. Pain relief was evaluated by a numeric rating scale at 3-year follow-up at least. Long-term glandular swelling frequency patterns, quality of life (QoL), and drug consumption were retrospectively assessed. Procedure-related complications were recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty-one SSBD procedures were recorded (mean ± SD age, 55 ± 12 years), all performed under local anesthesia. SSBD led to complete dilatation in 7 patients (33%), residual stenosis in 8 (38%), and no dilatation (failure) in 6 (29%). Retrospective analysis of clinical outcomes was possible for 17 patients, 71% of whom presented with long-term pain relief, at a mean relief of 3.2 points on the numeric rating scale (P < .001). Long after SSBD, patients presented with a mean decrease of 15.4 glandular swellings per month (P < .001). Medical consumption was reduced to 18% of patients taking some drugs because of SDS after SSBD vs 71% before. SSBD showed an impact on QoL in >80% of patients, with mean improvements of 26% and 25% in the percentage point reduction of physical and mental QoL, respectively (P < .001). No complications were noted except temporary discomfort due to the procedure.
CONCLUSION: Despite the advent of sialendoscopy-guided techniques, SSBD should be considered for SDS treatment, as it is a safe procedure and provides sustained pain relief.
