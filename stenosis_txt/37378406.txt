Title: Risk prediction in patients with classical low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis undergoing surgical intervention.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Classical low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis (LFLG-AS) is an advanced stage of aortic stenosis, which has a poor prognosis with medical treatment and a high operative mortality after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). There is currently a paucity of information regarding the current prognosis of classical LFLG-AS patients undergoing SAVR and the lack of a reliable risk assessment tool for this particular subset of AS patients. The present study aims to assess mortality predictors in a population of classical LFLG-AS patients undergoing SAVR.
METHODS: This is a prospective study including 41 consecutive classical LFLG-AS patients (aortic valve area ≤1.0 cm2, mean transaortic gradient &lt;40 mmHg, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%). All patients underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE), 3D echocardiography, and T1 mapping cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Patients with pseudo-severe aortic stenosis were excluded. Patients were divided into groups according to the median value of the mean transaortic gradient (≤25 and &gt;25 mmHg). All-cause, intraprocedural, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates were evaluated.
RESULTS: All of the patients had degenerative aortic stenosis, with a median age of 66 (60-73) years; most of the patients were men (83%). The median EuroSCORE II was 2.19% (1.5%-4.78%), and the median STS was 2.19% (1.6%-3.99%). On DSE, 73.2% had flow reserve (FR), i.e., an increase in stroke volume ≥20% during DSE, with no significant differences between groups. On CMR, late gadolinium enhancement mass was lower in the group with mean transaortic gradient &gt;25 mmHg [2.0 (0.0-8.9) g vs. 8.5 (2.3-15.0) g; p = 0.034), and myocardium extracellular volume (ECV) and indexed ECV were similar between groups. The 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were 14.6% and 43.8%, respectively. The median follow-up was 4.1 (0.3-5.1) years. By multivariate analysis adjusted for FR, only the mean transaortic gradient was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio: 0.923, 95% confidence interval: 0.864-0.986, p = 0.019). A mean transaortic gradient ≤25 mmHg was associated with higher all-cause mortality rates (log-rank p = 0.038), while there was no difference in mortality regarding FR status (log-rank p = 0.114).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with classical LFLG-AS undergoing SAVR, the mean transaortic gradient was the only independent mortality predictor in patients with LFLG-AS, especially if ≤25 mmHg. The absence of left ventricular FR had no prognostic impact on long-term outcomes.
