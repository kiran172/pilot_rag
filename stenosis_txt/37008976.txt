Title: The Influence of Systolic Blood Pressure at the Time of Extubation on the Development of Postoperative Spinal Epidural Hematoma.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The most common cause of neurological complications after a biportal endoscopic spine surgery (BESS) is postoperative spinal epidural hematomas (POSEH). The objective of this study was to determine the influence of systolic blood pressure at extubation (e-SBP) on POSEH.
METHODS: A total of 352 patients who underwent single-level decompression surgery including laminectomy and/or discectomy with BESS under the diagnosis of spinal stenosis and herniated nucleus pulposus between August 1, 2018, and June 30, 2021, were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two, a POSEH group and a normal group without POSEH (no neurological complication). The e-SBP, demographic factors, and the preoperative and intraoperative factors suspected to influence the POSEH were analyzed. The e-SBP was converted to a categorical variable by the threshold level that was decided by maximum area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Antiplatelet drugs (APDs) were taken in 21 patients (6.0%), discontinued in 24 patients (6.8%), and not taken in 307 patients (87.2%). Tranexamic acid (TXA) was used in 292 patients (83.0%) in the perioperative period.
RESULTS: Of the 352 patients, 18 patients (5.1%) underwent revision surgery for the removal of POSEH. The POSEH and normal groups were homogenous in age, sex, diagnosis, operation segments, operation time, and lab findings that were related to blood clotting, whereas there were differences in e-SBP (163.7 ± 15.7 mmHg in POSEH group and 154.1 ± 18.3 mmHg in normal group), APD (4 takers, 2 stoppers, 12 non-takers in POSEH group and 16 takers, 22 stoppers, 296 non-takers in normal group), and TXA (12 use, 6 not use in POSEH group and 280 use, 54 not use in normal group) in single variable analysis. The highest AUC in the ROC curve analysis was 0.652 for 170 mmHg e-SBP (p &lt; 0.05). There were 94 patients in the high e-SBP group (≥ 170 mmHg) and 258 patients in the low e-SBP group. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, only high e-SBP was a significant risk factor for POSEH (p = 0.013; odds ratio, 3.434).
CONCLUSIONS: High e-SBP (≥ 170 mmHg) can influence the development of POSEH in biportal endoscopic spine surgery.
