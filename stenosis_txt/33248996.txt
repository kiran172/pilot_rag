Title: Transapical Transcatheter Valve Replacement Using J-Valve for Aortic Valve Diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The J-Valve system (Jie ChengMedical Technologies, Suzhou, China) is designed specifically for transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement and has three U-shaped graspers. With the unique structure, the J-Valve is suitable for both aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation. We used the J-Valve system for patients with aortic valve diseases and observed favorable results.
METHODS: From January 2018 to August 2019, 23 patients underwent transapical transcatheter valve replacement using the J-Valve system. High-risk patients with diseased peripheral vessels (small diameter, heavily calcified, and tortuous arteries), pure aortic regurgitation, and complex prosthetic valve-in-valve cases were enrolled. Ten patients mainly had aortic stenosis, 11 patients had pure aortic regurgitation, and 2 patients had valve-in-valve aortic valve position. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation average preoperative scores were 8.9% and 8.7%, respectively.
RESULTS: The technique success rate was 91.3% (21 of 23; 1 patient was referred for open surgery and 1 patient received intraoperative valve-in-valve), and 1 patient died of cardiogenic shock after the procedure (mortality 4.3%, 1 of 22). One patient had stroke postoperatively and recovered well; no cases needed to undergo permanent pacemaker implantation. During the follow-up period, 1 patient died of acute heart attack. No moderate or severe paravalvular leakage was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement surgery with the J-Valve system is effective, even when it is traumatic and requires the transapical route. The applicability of the J-Valve system in pure aortic regurgitation patients is the advantage of this system.
