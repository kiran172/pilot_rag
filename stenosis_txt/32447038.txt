Title: Early and long-term results of the endovascular treatment of patients with isolated infrarenal aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report our results of patients' characteristics, procedural complications, and long-term patency in treatment of isolated infrarenal aortic stenosis (IIAS).
METHODS: Forty symptomatic patients (28 female, 12 male; median age, 60 years [54.8-68 years]) with IIAS who underwent endovascular intervention between 2001 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Patient, lesion, procedure, and balloon/stent characteristics were assessed. Follow-up included clinical status evaluation and color Doppler ultrasound examination.
RESULTS: The cause of IIAS was atherosclerosis in all patients. Twenty percent of the patients were younger than 50 years; 85% had hypertension, 80% were smokers, 38% had hyperlipidemia, 23% had diabetes mellitus, 15% were obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2), and 8% had chronic kidney disease. The median stenosis grade was 80% (70%-80%), and the median lesion length was 19.9 mm (13-29.4 mm). Severe calcification was present in 8% of the patients. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in four cases (10%), whereas stenting was performed in 36 (90%). One complication, an aortic rupture requiring surgical repair, occurred. The median follow-up was 61 months (17-101 months). The primary patency rate was 100% at 6 months, 97% at 12 and 24 months, and 88% at 60 and 96 months. Restenosis developed in three patients (8%); reintervention was carried out in two cases (5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular therapy for IIAS provides a safe and effective long-term treatment strategy.
