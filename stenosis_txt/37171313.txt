Title: Application of transurethral prostate resection instrumentation for treating rectal anastomotic stenosis: Case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anastomotic stenosis is a common complication of colorectal surgery with anastomosis. To explore a minimally invasive novel approach surgical method for the treatment of rectal anastomotic strictures using transurethral prostate resection instrumentation.
METHODS: From 2012 to 2022, 18 patients for the treatment of rectal anastomotic strictures using transurethral prostate resection instrumentation. The transurethral prostate resection instrumentation enters the rectum through the anus to incise the narrow anastomotic orifice in a 4-point radial manner under the resectoscope.
RESULTS: The surgery was successfully completed in 18 patients, and there were no postoperative complications. Postoperatively, 12 patients achieved satisfactory improvement in defecation after 1 incision, and 4 patients underwent another incision 3 months later. Two patients underwent incisions thrice, and the ease of defecation improved in a short period; however, they later underwent permanent colostomy due to repeated stenosis and pain.
CONCLUSION: The transanal 4-point radial incision of the prostate using transurethral prostate resection instrumentation is a minimally invasive, safe, effective, and simple surgical method for the treatment of rectal anastomotic stenosis supplemented by postoperative dilatation, and is worthy of clinical application.
