Title: Lead Extraction and Baffle Stenting in a Patient with Transposition of the Great Arteries.

Abstract: This case report discusses a 42-year-old male with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) status post Mustard repair and sick sinus syndrome status post dual-chamber pacemaker implant, who developed symptomatic superior vena cava (SVC) baffle stenosis. He was treated with a combined pacemaker extraction and subsequent SVC baffle stenting. The case highlights the complexities of treating SVC baffle stenosis in the presence of cardiac implantable devices and demonstrates the efficacy of this combined approach. Furthermore, the authors delve into the intricacies of D-TGA, its surgical history, and the long-term complications associated with atrial switch procedures.
