Title: Bacterial Pericarditis With Underlying Severe Aortic Stenosis and Myelodysplastic Syndrome.

Abstract: We herein describe a case of a 79-year-old male who presented with severe aortic stenosis with myelodysplastic syndrome. He was hospitalized to undergo presurgical evaluation and puncture of pericardiocentesis. After the placement of pericardial drainage, he developed bacterial pericarditis. His heart failure had worsened due to new onset of atrial fibrillation and pericardial constriction. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was identified as the pathogen from the puncture. A pericardial windowing was performed so that his circulatory status was stabilized. An aortic valve replacement as well as resection of pericardial fibrosis was finally performed, and he was discharged without any sequela.
