Title: A common hepatic artery aneurysm with splenic artery involvement: an unusual cause of abdominal pain.

Abstract: Forty-eight year old man with epigastric pain. CT scan shows a common hepatic artery aneurysm (HAA) of 4,6 cm in size with permeable portal vein. Angiography demonstrates that it affects from the beginning of the celiac trunk until hepatic arteries bifurcation, producing a proximal splenic artery stenosis. Proximal and distal embolization is done achieving a complete aneurysm occlusion. A stent is placed in celiac trunk in order to maintain splenic flow. Permeability of distal hepatic artery through choledochal arteries is observed in a month follow-up CT scan. HAA are infrequent but potentially lethal. Endovascular techniques should be considered of choice currently. HAA embolization has an elevated risk of hepatic ischemia.
