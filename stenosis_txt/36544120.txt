Title: Robot-assisted laparoscopic ileal ureter replacement with extracorporeal ileal segment preparation for long ureteral strictures: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complete intracorporal robotic ileal ureteric replacement is challenging. We aimed to present the surgical technique of robotic ileal ureter replacement with extracorporeal ileal segment preparation for long ureteral strictures.
METHODS: From March 2019 to March 2021, 18 patients underwent robotic ileal ureter replacement with extracorporeal ileal segment preparation by one experienced surgeon. The demographic, perioperative, and follow-up data were recorded. Success was defined as the resolution of the presenting symptom, a stable estimated glomerular filtration rate and unobstructive drainage on imaging examination.
RESULTS: All 18 surgeries were successfully completed without conversion. The median length of the intestinal tube used was 20 (12-30) cm. The median operative time was 248 (170-450) min, the median estimated blood loss was 50 (10-200) ml, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 (5-27) days. At a median follow-up of 16 (13-28) months, all patients were symptom-free. No or mild hydronephrosis was confirmed in 17 patients; 1 patient had moderate hydronephrosis without peristalsis of the ileal ureter. The renal function was stable in all patients. The overall success rate was 100%. Postoperative complications, including 4 cases of urinary infections (Grade I), 1 case of an incision hernia (Grade I), 4 cases of kidney stone formation (Grade I), 6 cases of metabolic acidosis (Grade I), 4 cases of incomplete ileus (Grade II), and 1 case of an incision infection (Grade IIIb).
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted laparoscopic ileal ureter replacement with extracorporeal ileal segment preparation is safe, feasible, and effective for the treatment of long ureteral strictures, especially in high-volume tertiary referralÂ centers with extensive robotic surgery experience capable of managing severe peri-operative complications.
