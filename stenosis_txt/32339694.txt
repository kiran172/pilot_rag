Title: A Quantitative Method for Prediction of True Lumen Recanalization in Chronic Total Occlusion of the Superficial Femoral Artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine a quantitative method for evaluating calcification in failure in recanalization (FR) in endovascular treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) chronic total occlusion, and to investigate the possibility of using a formula to predict the incidence of true lumen recanalization (TR) in such cases.
METHODS: Patients who met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively analyzed in our center from January 2012 to September 2017. A Calcification Lesion Analyzing and Scoring System (CLASS) was established to quantify the characteristics of calcification in SFA computed tomography slices, which were ranked as grade 1-4 and class A-E. Corresponding scores were obtained, and the Cumulative Calcification Score (CCS<sub>O</sub>) of occlusive SFA was calculated on the basis of CLASS. The factors correlating to FR and the formula for predicting TR were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 215 patients were included in this study. There were 150 cases of TR and 65 cases of subintimal recanalization; 12 (5.6%) cases had FR. The maximum CLASS of occlusion was correlated with FR. Not only the formula including Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II grade and CCS<sub>O</sub> but also the formula including occlusion length and CCS<sub>O</sub> predicted the incidence of TR well.
CONCLUSIONS: The degree of the most severe calcification in occlusive lesions clearly affects success in recanalization. Two quantitative formulas that combine occlusion length or Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II grade with CCS<sub>O</sub> can predict TR in endovascular treatment of SFA lesions with chronic total occlusion.
