Title: Valve deterioration: A victim of construct over time?

Abstract: Surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR) remains one of the most common cardiac operations performed globally on an annual basis. Biological and mechanical valves comprise the two classes of prosthetic valves available to surgeons. Biological prosthetic valves can be prone to failure and structural valve deterioration (SVD), which may necessitate reintervention. Recent literature suggests that the Trifecta heart valve is susceptible to early failure. In this retrospective study, Yount et al. use institutional data to assess the longevity of the Trifecta heart valve. The investigators included patients who had undergone sAVR and had received either a Trifecta prosthetic heart valve or a Magna/Magna Ease heart valve. While there were some baseline differences between the patient groups, the study found that those who had received a Trifecta valve had higher rates of valve failure. This is an important study that adds valuable evidence pertaining to the incidence of failure and SVD with the Trifecta heart valve. Although further studies may shed light on the precise mechanisms that drive valve failure and deterioration, surgeons should be aware of the mounting clinical data in this area.
