Title: Computed Fluid Dynamics Analysis for SVC-to-RPA Anastomosis With Antegrade Pulmonary Flow.

Abstract: We report an infant case after superior vena cava -to-right pulmonary artery anastomosis with antegrade pulmonary flow in which computational fluid dynamics analysis showed that restriction of antegrade blood flow by the remaining right pulmonary stenosis resulted in reduced shear stress and energy loss in the superior vena cava.
