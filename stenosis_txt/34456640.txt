Title: Early Efficacy of In Situ Fenestration with a Triple Chimney Technique for High-Risk Stanford Type A Aortic Dissection: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The objective of this investigation was to study the early efficacy of in situ fenestration with triple chimney technique for high-risk type A aortic dissection patients.
METHODS: This study included 24 patients who were treated by in situ fenestration with TCT for high-risk TAAD between January 2018 and December 2019. Multiple comorbidities or preoperative critical conditions rendered patients ineligible for open surgery, but all patients that were evaluated and considered had to undergo operation. By analyzing the regular follow-up data, the early postoperative efficacy of the patients was evaluated.
RESULTS: The average age of the 24 patients was 65.4 ± 9.3 years. The success rate of the operation was 100%, as all the patients were discharged successfully. There were no serious neurological complications or persistent endoleakage. The mean follow-up time was 21.4 ± 6.9 months. The patency rate of all branching stents was 100%, with no stent displacement, stenosis, or blockage observed. While none presented with type I endoleakage, one patient (4.2%) presented asymptomatic type II endoleakage around the left subclavian artery stent. Currently, 23 of the 24 patients remain alive.
CONCLUSION: Initial results are encouraging with TCT for high-risk TAAD. However, due to its high selectivity and potential complexity related to surgical risks, the mid- and long-term efficacy of this technique remains unknown. For patients who are eligible for open heart surgery, we still recommend it be performed.
