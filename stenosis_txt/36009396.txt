Title: Plasma A<sub>2A</sub>R Measurement Can Help Physicians Identify Patients Suspected of Coronary Chronic Syndrome: A Pilot Study.

Abstract: The evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) in the medical community is challenging. Patients with suspected coronary chronic syndrome (CCS) are referred by the medical community to be assessed by specialists for the performance of noninvasive tests that have high rates of false positives and false negatives. While troponins are the gold standard for evaluate myocardial injuries, there is no biomarker to assess myocardial ischemia in patient populations with negative electrocardiography or without an increase in troponin level. A2A adenosine receptors control the coronary blood flow through its vasodilating properties. It has been shown that patients with CAD have a lower A2AR expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting a link between A2AR production and the severity of CAD. Herein, we present a new and innovative method of inhibition ELISA for A2AR in the plasma of patients who permit the evaluation of the amount of soluble A2AR. For this analysis, the total study sample was 54, including 31 patients with CAD with stenosis > 50% and a significant fractional flow reserve (FFR < 0.8) (Group 1) and 23 patients with normal or non-obstructive coronary arteries (stenosis < 50% and nonsignificant FFR > 0.8) (Group 2). The % inhibition (which is linked to the presence of soluble receptors) with the plasma of patients with FFR < 0.8 was significantly lower than that of patients with FFR > 0.8 (median [range]: 68% [20.7−86.9] vs. 83% [67−88.4]; p < 0.001). The ROC curve indicated a good sensitivity/specificity ratio with a cut off of 72.5% and an area under the curve of 0.87. In conclusion, a rapid ELISA to assess soluble A2AR in the plasma shows promise to screen patients suspected of having CAD.
