Title: Special considerations for the stabilization and resuscitation of patients with cardiac disease in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Abstract: Effective resuscitation of neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) depends on comprehensive planning, thorough understanding of physiology, vigilant monitoring, and interdisciplinary collaboration to achieve the best outcomes. Neonatal heart disease can affect cardiac structure, rhythm, or ventricular function, and may be either congenital or acquired. Critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) can result in inadequate pulmonary blood flow, impaired intracardiac mixing, airway obstruction, or insufficient cardiac output. Tailored resuscitation strategies are important as early as the delivery room, where some CHD lesions may cause immediate cardiovascular instability during the transition from fetal to postnatal circulation. Premature infants with CHD are at higher risk due to their small size and the complications associated with prematurity, affecting both CHD management and overall clinical stability. Addressing both cardiac and non-cardiac causes of decompensation requires a precise understanding of each patient's unique physiology and trajectory from delivery through postintervention intensive care.
