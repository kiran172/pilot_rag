Title: Functional outcome after laparoscopic assisted gastric transposition including pyloric dilatation in long-gap esophageal atresia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Among the options for esophageal replacement in long-gap esophageal atresia (LGEA), gastric transposition (GT) is accessible for an endoscopic approach. Here we report a novel technique and functional results after laparoscopic-assisted gastric transposition (LAGT), including pyloric dilatation in patients with LGEA.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 14 children undergoing LAGT. Surgical steps included the release of the gastrostomy, transumbilical ante-situ section of the stomach including pyloric balloon-dilation, and laparoscopically controlled transhiatal retromediastinal blunt dissection followed by LAGT for cervical anastomosis to the proximal esophagus.
RESULTS: The median age at LAGT was 110 days (33-327 days), bodyweight 5.3 kg (3.1-8.3 kg). Operation time was 255 min (180-436 min); one conversion was necessary. The duration of ventilation was 4 days (1-14 days). Postpyloric feeding was started after 2 days, and oral feeding after 13 days. Complications were recurrent pleural effusion or pneumothorax and transient Horner syndrome or transient incomplete paresis of the recurrence nerve. After a median follow-up of 60 months (13-240 months), all children have a patent upper GI tract, show weight gain, and are fed without delayed gastric emptying, dumping, or reflux. Severe (n = 1) or mild (n = 2) anastomotic or pyloric (n = 5) stenosis was resolved with endoscopic dilatations.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional outcome after LAGT in patients with LGEA is good. The laparoscopic retromediastinal dissection preserves thoracal structures and increases patients' safety. The technique of pyloric dilatation might also prevent dumping syndrome.
TYPE OF STUDY: Case Series with no Comparison Group.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.
