Abstract: The 31-year-old female patient was admitted to the General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for 3 days after the corneal transplantation of her right eye for 5 months.Four years ago, the patient developed red eyes, pain, dryness and photophobia after intravenous drip of cefuroxime sodium and metronidazole due to pelvic inflammation, accompanied by high fever, systemic rash and epidermal exfoliation, fingernail peeling, and mucosal ulceration in the eyes and mouth.Later, the patient received systemic hormone shock and point eye treatment in a local hospital, and the dry eyes gradually worsened. Despite continuous artificial tears and bandage mirror treatment, the corneal ulcer perforation in both eyes still occurred successively. After several penetrating keratografts and drug therapy, the ulcer and dissolution could not be prevented. He was admitted to our hospital due to corneal perforation in both eyes.Ophthalmic examination: visual acuity manual/15 cm in the right eye, intraocular pressure T-2, conjunctival sac stenosis, extensive corneal opacity and edema, ulcer about 8 mm, corneal perforation near the corneal limbus about 2 mm×5 mm below.The left eye had no light perception, a central corneal ulcer of about 8 mm, bulge of the posterior elastic layer, no anterior chamber, and atrophy of the eyeball.B-ultrasound showed choroidal detachment of the right eye.On the second day, the patient received right eye intraocular exploration, vitrectomy, ecotopic keratoscleral carrier Boston Ⅱ artificial keratoplasty, glaucoma valve implantation, autogenous ear cartilage implantation, conjunctival occlusion, and left eye lamellar keratoplasty, conjunctival occlusion.Postoperative visual acuity of right eye was -6.50 DS=0.12, intraocular pressure TN, ocular surface was stable.The left eye has no light perception and the ocular surface is stable.
