Title: Procedural and one-year outcomes following drug-eluting stent and drug-coated balloon combination for the treatment of de novo diffuse coronary artery disease: the HYPER Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: De novo diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD) is a challenging scenario in interventional cardiology with limited treatment option, beside stent implantation. In this context, a hybrid approach, combining the use of drug-eluting stent (DES) and drug-coated balloon (DCB) to treat different segments of the same lesion (e.g. long lesion and/or true bifurcation), might be an interesting and alternative strategy to limit the metal amount. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a hybrid approach in addressing percutaneous treatment of de novo diffuse CAD.
METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter study including patients affected by de novo diffuse CAD treated with a hybrid approach from April 2019 to December 2020. Angiographic and clinical data were collected. The primary endpoint was the one-year device-oriented composite endpoint (DOCE, cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [ID-TLR]). Periprocedural myocardial infarctions and periprocedural success were included among secondary endpoints.
RESULTS: One hundred six patients were included, mean age was 68.2Â±10.2 years and 78.3% were male. De novo diffuse CAD consisted of 52.8% long lesions and 47.2% true bifurcation lesions. Significant increase in the final minimal lumen diameters and significant decrease in the final diameter stenosis were observed when compared to the baseline values in both DES- and DCB-target segments. Procedural success was 96.2%. DOCE at one-year was 3.7%, with all the adverse events characterized by ID-TLR.
CONCLUSIONS: Combination of DES and DCB could be a safe and effective treatment option for the treatment of de novo diffuse CAD (NCT03939468).
