Title: Early reverse remodeling by echocardiography after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Oslo University Hospital is a tertiary center conducting a significant number of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures per year. In this follow-up MediPace study, we aimed to investigate early echocardiographic changes in systolic and diastolic functions after TAVI in these patients.
METHODS: All patients enrolled in the previous study were contacted 3 months after TAVI for echocardiographic evaluation. Detailed echocardiography was performed 3.5 ± 1.6 months after TAVI, and compared with baseline evaluations.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 80.1 ± 6.8 years and 40% of the patients were female. We observed a significant improvement in global longitudinal strain (GLS) (pre-TAVI -16.8 ± 4.1%, post-TAVI -17.8 ± 3.6%, p &lt; .001), with no notable change in LVEF. More than half of the patients (52%) experienced a significant reverse remodeling with ≥10% decrease in left ventricular mass index (LVMi) following TAVI (pre-TAVI 123.6 ± 32.1 vs. 109.7 ± 28.9 g/m2 post-TAVI, p &lt; .001). Pre-TAVI LVMi was a positive predictor, whereas history of HT was a negative predictor of LVMi reduction. There was no significant improvement in diastolic function following TAVI. Highest degree of paravalvular leakage was mild to moderate and was observed in only 2%.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant improvement in GLS and LVMi was found following TAVI. History of hypertension and baseline LVMi were predictors of LVMi change. There was no notable change in diastolic function, including left atrial strain.
