Title: Volumetric Flow Assessment in Doppler Ultrasonography in Risk Stratification of Patients with Internal Carotid Stenosis and Occlusion.

Abstract: (1) Background: Alterations of blood flow volume in extracranial arteries may be related to the risk of occurrence of neurological symptoms. The aim of this study was the estimation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in Doppler ultrasonography, as well as comparison of the flow volume in asymptomatic patients over 65 years old with ≥50%, and symptomatic patients with ≥70% internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, in order to assess whether the changes in the CBF correlates with the presence of neurological symptoms. (2) Methods: 308 patients over 65 years old were included in the retrospective cohort observational study: 154 asymptomatic with ≥50% ICA stenosis, 123 healthy volunteers, and 31 symptomatic referred for surgical treatment. The study group was split according to ICA stenosis (50-69%, 70-99% and occlusion). In all patients an extensive Doppler ultrasound examination with measurements of flow volume in common, internal, external carotid (ECA) and vertebral arteries (VA) was performed. (3) Results: Among asymptomatic (A) and symptomatic (S) patients with carotid stenosis 3 subgroups were identified: 57/154-37% (A) and 8/31-25.5% (S)-with significantly increased flow volume (CBF higher than reference range: average CBF + std. dev in the group of healthy volunteers), 67/154-43.5% (A) and 12/31-39% (S)-with similar to reference group flow volume (CBF within range average ± std.dev), and 30/154-19.5% (A) and 11/31-35.5% (S)-with decreased flow volume in extracranial arteries (flow lower than average-std.dev. in healthy volunteers). In symptomatic patients the percentage of patients with significant compensatory increased flow tends to raise with the severity of the stenosis, while simultaneous decline of number of patients with mild compensation (unchanged total CBF) is observed. The percentage of patients without compensation remains unchanged. In the group referred for surgical treatment (symptomatic, ≥70% ICA stenosis) the percentage of patients with flow compensation is twice as low as in the asymptomatic ones with similar degree of the ICA stenosis (8/31-25.8% vs. 26/53-49%, p = 0.04). Compensatory elevated flow was observed most frequently in ECA. (4) Conclusions: The presence of significant volumetric flow compensation has protective influence on developing ischaemic symptoms, including TIA or stroke. The assessment of cerebral inflow in Doppler ultrasonography may provide novel and easily accessible tool of identifying patients prone to cerebral ischaemia. The multivessel character of compensation with enhanced role of ECA justifies the importance of including this artery in the estimation of CBF.
