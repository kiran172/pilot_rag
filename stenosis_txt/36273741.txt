Title: Excellent results seen with both transaxillary and infraclavicular approaches to first rib resection in patients with subclavian vein thrombosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) is a debilitating condition with several well-documented treatment paradigms. We reviewed the outcomes from a large academic institution of patients who had undergone transaxillary first rib resection with delayed venography (TA) or infraclavicular first rib and subclavius muscle resection with concomitant venography (ICV) for VTOS with subclavian vein thrombosis.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the medical records of all patients who had undergone first rib resection and scalenectomy for VTOS with subclavian vein thrombosis at a single academic institution. The demographics, presentation, operative records, and outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 73 patients had undergone first rib resection for VTOS during the study period. Of the 73 patients, 36 (49%) had presented with thrombosis of the subclavian vein and were included in the present review. Of the 36 patients, 26 (72%) had undergone TA and 10 (28%) had undergone ICV. No significant differences were seen between the two groups in female gender (54% vs 50%; P = 1.00) or age (28.7 years vs 29.5 years; P = .88). A higher percentage of the ICV group had undergone preoperative thrombolysis (70% vs 27%; P = .02). All the patients in the ICV group had undergone intraoperative balloon venoplasty at resection. The mean time from thrombosis to resection was 2.3 months. All of the TA group had undergone venography at 2 weeks postoperatively. Venography had revealed 15 stenotic veins requiring venoplasty, 8 widely patent veins, 1 acutely thrombosed vein, and 3 chronically occluded veins. The time from initial thrombosis to surgical intervention was 10 months for the patent group, 6 months for the stenotic group, and 4 months for the occluded group. In the TA group, 19% of the patients had required chest tube placement intraoperatively for pneumothorax. In the ICV group, complications included postoperative hematoma (n = 1), wound infection (n = 1), and hemothorax (n = 1). The mean length of stay was 1.04 days for the TA group and 2.00 days for the ICV group (P < .0001). The mean follow-up was 10.4 months and 15.8 months for the TA and ICV groups, respectively. No mortalities were reported. No differences in the vein patency rates were seen between the two groups at follow-up (TA, 93%; vs ICV, 100%; P = 1.00). All the patients were asymptomatic at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes for the patients who had undergone TA or ICV for subclavian vein thrombosis were excellent with no mortality and few complications. The subclavian vein patency rates were high, and all the patients were asymptomatic at follow-up.
