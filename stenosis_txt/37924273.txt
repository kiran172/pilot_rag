Title: 12-Month Outcomes of Carotid Artery Stenting With CGuard MicroNET-Covered Stent: A Single-Center Study in 113 Patients.

Abstract: Dual layer mesh stents constitute a novel treatment option for patients who undergo carotid artery stenting (CAS). The aim of this prospective study is to report 12 month outcomes of patients who underwent CAS with CGuard (Inspire MD, Tel Aviv, Israel) microNET self-expanding stent with embolic protection system in a tertiary center from October 2018 to March 2022. Primary endpoints included in-stent restenosis >70% verified by ultrasound (DUS), ipsilateral transient ischemic attack (TIA), and stroke at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular-related mortality (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure) and all-cause mortality during follow-up. One hundred thirteen patients were included in the study (male 72.5%), symptomatic 47.8%. Median follow-up was 25 months (2-48). By 12 months, there was one in-stent occlusion that manifested as stroke (1/113, 0.8%) but no other forms of in-stent restenosis. Two patients experienced contralateral TIA (1.7%). CVRM was 3.5% (4 MI) and all-cause mortality was 6% at follow-up. This prospective study shows that CAS with CGuard MicroNET-covered stent is safe with minimal neurological adverse events at 12 months follow-up. Larger, and longer-term studies are necessary to define CGuard long-term safety and protection against carotid-related stroke.
