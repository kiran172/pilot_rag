Title: [Valvular heart disease in patients with chronic kidney disease].

Abstract: Valvular heart disease is a common comorbidity in patients with impaired renal function, especially in those with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis. Sclerosis and calcification of the heart valves and the valve ring are particularly relevant in the etiology of the diseases. These typically occur at the aortic and mitral valves and can lead to both insufficiency and stenosis of the affected valve. In the current guidelines of the European Society for Cardiology published in 2017, surgical treatment remains the standard of care for most forms of severe valvular heart disease; however, the presence of chronic kidney disease impairs clinical outcomes and is associated with higher mortality rates when compared to patients with preserved renal function. Catheter-based treatment options have emerged as an effective and safe alternative for patients >75 years and/or with increased surgical risk. Consequently, in patients with appropriate anatomy and elevated risk, interventional treatment options should also be discussed in the heart team.
