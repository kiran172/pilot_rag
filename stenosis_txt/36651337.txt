Title: Esophageal stenosis as an independent factor of poor prognosis in patients with ESCC treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy.

Abstract: Aim: To evaluate the clinical outcome and elucidate the prognostic factors in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients: Data for patients newly diagnosed with ESCC receiving definitive CRT at our institution between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: A total of 201 patients were included. Severe stenosis after radiotherapy was an independent factor relevant to prognosis. Maximal esophageal wall thickness, short-term responses, severe stenosis at diagnosis and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were independent risk factors for the occurrence of severe stenosis after radiotherapy. Conclusion: Severe stenosis after radiotherapy is a useful predictive indicator in patients with ESCC receiving definitive CRT. Further studies are needed to verify these findings.
