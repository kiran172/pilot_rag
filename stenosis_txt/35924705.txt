Title: [Treatment Outcome of Ureteral Reconstruction Surgery].

Abstract: We retrospectively reviewed the surgical outcome of ureteral reconstruction that was performed in Asahikawa Medical University Hospital between 2005 and 2021. A total of 14 patients (3 males, 11 females; 15 ureters) were included in this analysis. The median age was 57 years old. The reason for ureteral reconstruction was ureteral injury or stenosis due to pelvic surgery in 9 patients, transurethral lithotripsy for ureteral stone in 3, ureteral invasion of sigmoid colon cancer in one and ovarian cancer in one. The site of ureteral reconstruction was proximal ureter in 2, middle in 3 and distal in 10. The surgical procedure was ureteroneocystostomy with Boari flap in 8 patients (57%), ureteroureterostomy in 4 (21%), transureteroureterostomy in one (7%), and transureteroureterostomy combined with Boari flap for bilateral ureteral stenosis in the remaining patient (7%). Postoperatively, vesicoureteral reflux, ileus and surgical site infection were observed in 3, 2 and 1 patient, respectively. No patient required nephrostomy or ureteral catheter, or any additional procedure after the surgery. There was no episode of febrile urinary tract infection after the surgery. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was, respectivery 75.8 and 78.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 before surgery and at 1-101 months (median of 18) after the surgery. In conclusion, satisfactory outcome was achieved after ureteral reconstruction surgery. We emphasize the importance of selecting the most appropriate procedure for ureteral reconstruction in each patient to prevent renal function deterioration and urinary tract infection.
