Title: Post-transurethral resection of prostate urethral strictures: Are they often underreported? A single-center retrospective observational cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Post-transurethral resection of prostate urethral stricture (PTS) is a well-documented delayed complication following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The aim is to analyze various risk factors of PTS and see if the overall incidence is underreported.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in our institution between January 2017 and December 2018 in men who underwent TURP. Data obtained from the medical records department were analyzed. Statistical analysis was done using Fisher's exact test. A two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Of the 447 men who underwent TURP, 57 developed PTS. Fifteen of 334 patients who underwent calibration before the procedure developed stricture compared to 42 of 137 without calibration (P &lt; 0.01). There was a significantly lesser incidence of stricture with 24 Fr resectoscope compared with 26 Fr sheath (P &lt; 0.04). Two patients with 24 Fr Foley and 30 of 35 (86%) patients with 22 Fr Foley catheter developed stricture of urethra. Distal bulbar urethra was the most common site of narrowing following TURP. Eighteen patients had Salvaris swab placed for traction and 12 patients required full-thigh traction, of which majority developed meatal stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: TURP is one of the common surgical procedures performed by urologists. Meatitis and meatal stenosis, if included as complications of TURP, would increase the overall incidence of PTS. Factors such as the size of resectoscope sheath used, size of catheter inserted, placement of Salvaris swab traction, and preoperative calibration of urethra have a significant impact on the ultimate outcome.
