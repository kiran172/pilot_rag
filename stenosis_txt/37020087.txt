Title: Effects of proximal gastrectomy with narrow gastric tube anastomosis compared with total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis on upper gastric cancer.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy of proximal gastrectomy with narrow gastric tube anastomosis (PG-NGT) and total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis (TG-RY) for upper gastric cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-three upper gastric cancer patients were enrolled into the PG-NGT group and TG-RY group. The propensity score matching method was used to conduct a one-to-one match between the two groups with 38 patients in each group.
RESULTS: Compared with the TG-RY group, the PG-NGT group had significantly (P < 0.05) shorter operation time, shorter hospital stay, and less intraoperative blood loss. The TG-RY group had significantly (P = 0.009) more lymph nodes dissected and greater (P = 0.014) total cost than the PG-NGT group, but no significant difference existed in the surgical cost between the two groups (P = 0.214). There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference in the incidence of anastomotic stenosis (10.5% vs. 13.1%) or the reflux esophagitis rate (8.6% vs. 9.1%) in the PG-NGT group and the TG-RY group. One year after surgery, the weight and hemoglobin and albumin levels in the PG-NGT group were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those in the TG-RY group.
CONCLUSIONS: PG-NGT may be better than TG-RY in improving patient weight loss and hemoglobin and albumin levels, without increasing the rate of anastomotic stenosis and reflux symptoms.
