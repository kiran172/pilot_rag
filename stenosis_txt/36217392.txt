Title: Evaluation of the surgical and functional outcomes of secondary vaginoplasties with free skin mesh graft in patients following transfeminine genital reconstructive surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gender-affirming surgery is classically done using the penile inversion vaginoplasty technique, however in some patients it may not promote adequate depth. In patients whose vaginal conduits became short or stenotic, we propose to perform a secondary vaginoplasty using an abdominal free skin mesh graft. In this study, we present ours results of a series of cases using this technique.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing secondary vaginoplasty with free skin mesh graft from 2000 to 2017 at our hospital was performed. Demographic data, surgical characteristics, complications, personal satisfaction and neovagina functionality (defined as the ability to have satisfactory sexual intercourse) were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 186 patients who were submitted to primary vaginoplasty, 36 patients (19.3%) were then submitted to secondary vaginoplasty. This study sample included 35 patients. The average age of patients was 41.0 years (37.0 to 50.5) and the average time between gender affirmation surgery and secondary vaginoplasty was 6 months (4-24). Ten patients (28.6%) developed postoperative complication, the most frequent being: neovagina introitus stenosis (22.9%), rectal fistula (8.6%), tissue dehiscence (2.9%), and urethral fistula (2.9%). Subjective personal satisfaction and neovagina functionality of patients was reported by 77.1% of the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that secondary vaginoplasty surgery using a free skin mesh graft has good results and is a functional option with low complexity and low rate of serious complications.
