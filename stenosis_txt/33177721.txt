Title: Application of 64-slice Spiral CT in coronary artery imaging.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the use of 64-slice spiral CT in coronary artery imaging and to explore the value and limitation of non-invasive examination in clinical application. A total of 100 patients with clinical diagnosis or suspected coronary heart disease were included in this study.
METHODS: All patients underwent 64-slice spiral CT coronary angiography and selective coronary angiography. The coronary artery was divided into 16 segments with not more than 2 weeks before and after treatment. The visual diameter method was used to judge the degree of coronary artery stenosis. Coronary angiography was used as the "golden standard" for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic coincidence rate of 64-slice spiral CT moderate and severe coronary artery stenosis were calculated.
RESULTS: The results showed that 1547 (96.7%) of the 1600 coronary segments could be simultaneously displayed and evaluated. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic coincidence rate of 64-slice spiral CT were 91%, 97%, 84%, 98% and 97%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: It could be concluded that the 64-slice spiral CT had good diagnostic value for moderate and severe coronary stenosis, and could basically meet the diagnostic needs of coronary heart disease, helping to avoid invasive coronary angiography in patients with normal coronary artery or without interventional therapy.
