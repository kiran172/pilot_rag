Title: Current Usefulness of Transesophageal Echocardiography in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: This review article describes in depth the current usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography in patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Pre-intervention, 3D-transesophageal echocardiography allows us to accurately evaluate the aortic valve morphology and to measure the valve annulus, helping us to choose the appropriate size of the prosthesis, especially useful in cases where the computed tomography is not of adequate quality. Although it is not currently used routinely during the intervention, it remains essential in those cases of greater complexity, such as for patients with greater calcification and bicuspid valve, mechanical mitral prosthesis, and "valve in valve" procedures. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography is the best technique to detect and quantify paravalvular regurgitation, a fundamental aspect to decide whether immediate valve postdilation is needed. It also allows to detect early any immediate complications such as cardiac tamponade, aortic hematoma or dissection, migration of the prosthesis, malfunction of the prosthetic leaflets, or the appearance of segmental contractility disorders due to compromise of the coronary arteries ostium. Transesophageal echocardiography is also very useful in follow-up, to check the proper functioning of the prosthesis and to rule out complications such as thrombosis of the leaflets, endocarditis, or prosthetic degeneration.
