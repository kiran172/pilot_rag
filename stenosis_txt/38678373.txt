Title: Canaliculocoele: A Case Series and Review of Literature.

Abstract: AIM: To report a case series on canaliculocoele and to review the existing literature.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis of the case records of all patients diagnosed with canaliculocoele between January 1st, 2018, and December 31st, 2019, was conducted. Only histopathologically proven cases of canaliculocoele with a minimum follow-up of 6 weeks were included.
RESULTS: Five cases of canaliculocoele that presented over 2 years were included. The mean age was 58.8 ± 9.63 years, with a female preponderance. The mean duration of symptoms was 22.2 ± 22.71 months. All patients had medial cystic swelling, either at the upper or lower lid. Four patients had gross stenosis of the punctum, while the punctum was absent in one patient. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed canalicular cystic distension with intra-lesional hyper-reflective echoes. All patients were managed with a complete cystectomy, except for one where a marsupialization was done. Adjunctive mini-Monoka intubation was done in two patients. The histopathological diagnosis of all cases was consistent with canaliculocoele. The mean follow-up was 3.82 ± 2.77 months.
CONCLUSION: Canaliculocoele is mostly unilateral and seen in middle-aged women. A good clinical evaluation supported by diagnostic imaging along with an affirmative histopathology can confirm the diagnosis.
