Title: Decline in typical angina among patients referred for cardiac stress testing.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate temporal trends in the prevalence of typical angina and its clinical correlates among patients referred for stress/rest SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence of chest pain symptoms and their relationship to inducible myocardial ischemia among 61,717 patients undergoing stress/rest SPECT-MPI between January 2, 1991 and December 31, 2017. We also assessed the relationship between chest pain symptom and angiographic findings among 6,579 patients undergoing coronary CT angiography between 2011 and 2017.
RESULTS: The prevalence of typical angina among SPECT-MPI patients declined from 16.2% between 1991 and 1997 to 3.1% between 2011 and 2017, while the prevalence of dyspnea without any chest pain increased from 5.9 to 14.5% over the same period. The frequency of inducible myocardial ischemia declined over time within all symptom groups, but its frequency among current patients (2011-2017) with typical angina was approximately three-fold higher versus other symptom groups (28.4% versus 8.6%, p < 0.001). Overall, patients with typical angina had a higher prevalence of obstructive CAD on CCTA than those with other clinical symptoms, but 33.3% of typical angina patients had no coronary stenoses, 31.1% had 1-49% stenoses, and 35.4% had ≥ 50% stenoses.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of typical angina has declined to a very low level among contemporary patients referred for noninvasive cardiac tests. The angiographic findings among current typical angina patients are now quite heterogeneous, with one-third of such patients having normal coronary angiograms. However, typical angina remains associated with a substantially higher frequency of inducible myocardial ischemia compared to patients with other cardiac symptoms.
