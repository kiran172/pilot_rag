Title: Elevated Plasma von Willebrand Factor Antigen and Activity Levels Are Associated With the Severity of Coronary Stenosis.

Abstract: von Willebrand factor (VWF) acts as a bridge between platelets and the subendothelial matrix following vessel damage and plays a vital role in coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between VWF and the severity of coronary stenosis quantified by the Gensini score in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the most dangerous complication of CAD. Plasma VWF antigen (VWF: Ag) and VWF-collagen binding (VWF: CB) in normal controls (n = 123) and in patients with AMI (n = 205) were tested, and then the patients were divided based on Gensini scores. The levels of VWF: Ag and VWF: CB in patients with AMI were significantly higher than those in the control group (P &lt; .001). Plasma levels of VWF: Ag and VWF: CB were positively correlated with both Gensini score and the number of affected vessels. Both VWF: Ag and VWF: CB were independent factors for coronary stenosis, adjusting confounding factors. Thus, the levels of VWF: Ag and VWF: CB were positively correlated with the severity of coronary stenosis. Screening of VWF at time of AMI may have prognostic value in terms of the severity of coronary stenosis.
