Title: Endovascular recanalization of common carotid artery Total occlusion: two case reports and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Common carotid artery total occlusion is rare but can be associated with a variety of neurological symptoms due to inadequate cerebral perfusion. The treatment includes bypass surgery, endarterectomy, and endovascular revascularization.
CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report two cases of common carotid artery total occlusion treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and review the literature.
CONCLUSION: Both of our cases were successfully treated with endovascular revascularization for common carotid artery total stenosis. Endovascular therapy provided an alternative treatment. Further large clinical study for comparing the safety and efficiency in surgical and endovascular treatment may be required.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4, Case Series.
