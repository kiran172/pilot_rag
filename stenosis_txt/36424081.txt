Title: Biomarkers in Urethral Stricture Disease and Benign Lower Urinary Tract Disease.

Abstract: Increased understanding of molecular pathophysiology has led to the detection of clinically applicable biomarkers across medicine, which allow for minimally invasive detection, management, and monitoring of disease processes. Although biomarkers have traditionally played a more significant role in malignancy, these goals also pertain to benign disease. Herein, the authors review ongoing research into biomarker investigation and application in urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder outlet obstruction, and overactive bladder. No biomarkers for these entities are currently in clinical use; however, numerous physiologic pathways provide targets for current and future study.
