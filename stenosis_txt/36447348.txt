Title: Technical Nuances of Cervical Laminoplasty: Supplemental Manuscript to Operative Video.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Operative video and supplemental manuscript.
OBJECTIVE: The technical nuances of open-door laminoplasty are described. Potential complications of open-door laminoplasty and strategies for their minimization are discussed.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cervical laminoplasty may be indicated in patients with cervical myelopathy due to cervical stenosis in the setting of spondylosis, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, congenital stenosis, and traumatic central cord syndrome.
METHODS: A video illustrates the nuances of the surgical technique for cervical laminoplasty.
RESULTS: Myelopathic patients with preserved lordotic sagittal profile, central stenosis involving several levels, and minimal to no axial neck pain are ideal candidates for laminoplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical laminoplasty provides more stability compared with laminectomy alone and a better range of motion compared with laminectomy with posterior spinal fusion. Understanding the nuances of laminoplasty may help surgeons to avoid complications.
