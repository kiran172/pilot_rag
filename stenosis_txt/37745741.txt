Title: Exploring Gender Disparities in the Prevalence and Clinical Characteristics of Atherosclerotic Cranial Stenosis.

Abstract: Background Atherosclerotic cranial stenosis (ACS) is a significant contributor to vascular events, including ischemic strokes. While early clinical studies suggested a divergence in the distribution of intracranial and extracranial stenosis between genders, recent evidence has highlighted the complexity of these disparities. Therefore, this study aims to investigate gender differences in the prevalence and clinical characteristics of atherosclerotic cranial stenosis in patients admitted with stroke. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital located in the Southern Region of Saudi Arabia between June 2022 and December 2022. It included patients of all age groups who had been diagnosed with an ischemic stroke during the study period. Data were collected from electronic health records and medical archives, and data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 26, IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results In our study, 201 stroke patients were analyzed, with 161 (80.09%) identified as having atherosclerotic stenosis. Of these, 57.8% were male, and 42.2% were female. Gender disparities were evident, with higher stenosis prevalence in males (46.27% vs. 33.83% in females). Significant gender differences were observed in dyslipidemia (p = 0.013), metabolic syndrome (p = 0.019), and smoking habits (p < 0.001). Males exhibited higher rates of extracranial stenosis (p = 0.012) and combined stenosis (p = 0.009) compared to females; however, females exhibited higher rates of intracranial stenosis (p = 0.013). Further analyses revealed significant associations in dyslipidemia (adjusted odd ratio (AOR): 0.245, p = 0.004), metabolic syndrome (AOR: 5.159, p = 0.006), obesity (AOR: 8.085, p = 0.016), smoking habits (AOR: 0.002, p < 0.001), and intracranial stenosis (AOR: 5.667, p = 0.005) within the female cohort. Conversely, age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and extracranial stenosis did not show statistically significant associations in females (p > 0.05). Conclusion We observed a substantial presence of atherosclerotic cranial stenosis, with males showing higher rates, and identified significant gender-related variations in dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and smoking habits as important factors. This highlights the necessity of tailoring ACS assessment and treatment by considering gender-specific risk factors and clinical characteristics for improved patient care and stroke management.
