Title: A Multi-armed Unfurling Actuator for Airway Lumen Measurement.

Abstract: Objective measurement of the lumen area demands an intraoperative diagnostic tool to aid on-site decision-making. We present a compliant mechanism-based unfurling actuator assembly integrated with a shaft connected to a motorized encoder to translate torque from the user at the proximal end to the actuator at the distal end. The actuator assembly has flexible arms coiled inside a cylindrical casing that moves radially outward upon actuation. Leveraging 3D printing of flexible materials, the unfurling actuator's four-arm design enables patency measurements in circumferential tracheal stenosis of varying grades. The rotary encoder output is correlated with the radially outward movement of the unfurling arms to estimate the lumen diameter. The measurement stability is analyzed using process control charts; data distribution over ten iterations reveals nearly 100% of process data falls between Â±3 sigma (Upper and Lower control limits). Comparing measurements from the tool with direct measurement (vernier caliper) and ImageJ analysis, one-way ANOVA for circular morphology yields no significant differences in diameter p = 0.974 and area measurements p = 0.975.Clinical Relevance- Central airway narrowing reduces the effective lumen area in the tracheal and bronchial segments. Grading the degree of narrowing is often based on a suspicion index. A quick but thorough assessment of the airway caliber is essential in emergent or planned intubation, whether congenital, iatrogenic, or idiopathic tracheal stenosis.
