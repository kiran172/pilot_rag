Title: Atrial fibrillation before and after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: short- and long-term clinical implications.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have been associated with worse short-term outcomes compared with patients in sinus rhythm but data on long-term outcomes are limited. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between AF and short- and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients undergoing TAVI between 2012 and 2022 in four tertiary centres. Two different analyses were conducted: (i) in-hospital and (ii) postdischarge analysis. First, we evaluated the association between preexisting AF and short-term outcomes according to VARC-3 criteria. Second, we analyzed the association between AF at discharge (defined as both preexisting and new-onset AF occurring after TAVI) and long-term outcomes at median follow-up of 3.2â€Šyears (i.e. all-cause death, hospitalization and major adverse cardiovascular events).
RESULTS: A total of 759 patients were initially categorized according to the presence of preexisting AF (241 vs. 518 patients). The preexisting AF group had a higher occurrence of acute kidney injury [odds ratio (OR) 1.65; 95%confidence interval ( CI) 1.15-2.38] and major bleeding (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.06-3.27). Subsequently, the population was categorized according to the presence of AF at discharge. At the adjusted Cox regression analysis, AF was independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalization [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.42, 95% CI 1.09-1.86], all-cause death and all-cause hospitalization (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.06-1.78) and all-cause hospitalization (aHR 1.59, 95% CI 1.14.2.22).
CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world cohort of patients undergoing TAVI, the presence of AF (preexisting and new-onset) was independently associated with both short- and long-term adverse outcomes.
