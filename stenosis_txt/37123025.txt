Title: A rare case of colorectal metastasis found 8 years and 10 months after gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: Colorectal metastasis from gastric cancer is rare and may develop several years after gastric cancer surgery. Therefore, colonoscopic findings provide useful diagnostic information. The present report describes a case of gastric cancer colon metastasis diagnosed 8 years and 10 months after gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. A 64-year-old male patient underwent gastrectomy in December 2010 and received chemotherapy for 4 years and 10 months after the surgery. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed as having colorectal cancer by computed tomography in February 2019. Colonoscopy revealed linitis plastica-like colon stenosis; however, biopsy pathology did not reveal any findings indicating malignancy. Right hemicolectomy was performed, and pathological examination revealed colon metastasis from gastric cancer. The patient received chemotherapy but died of peritoneal carcinomatosis 1 year and 8 months after the colectomy. According to literature, colorectal metastasis from gastric cancer is often attributed to hematogenous metastasis and often exhibits characteristic macroscopic features. Treatments, such as chemotherapy for gastric cancer and/or colorectal resection, are considered effective for gastric cancer colorectal metastasis.
