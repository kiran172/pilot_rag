Title: The relationship between geometry and hemodynamics of the stenotic carotid artery based on computational fluid dynamics.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to investigate the relationship between the geometric factors and the hemodynamics of the stenotic carotid artery.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of patients with carotid stenosis (40%-95%). The Navier-Stokes equations were solved using ANSYS CFX 18.0. Correlation analysis was based on Spearman's test. Geometric variables (p < 0.1 in the univariate analysis) were entered into the logistical regression. A receiver-operating characteristics analysis was used to detect hemodynamically significant lesions.
RESULTS: 81 patients (96 arteries) were evaluated. The logistic regression analysis revealed that the translesional pressure ratio was significantly correlated with the stenosis degree (OR = 1.147, p < 0.001) and the angle between internal carotid artery and external carotid artery (angle γ) (OR = 0.933, p = 0.01). The translesional wall shear stress ratio was significantly correlated with stenosis degree (OR = 1.094, p < 0.001), lesion length (OR = 0.873, p = 0.01), lumen area of internal carotid artery (OR = 0.867, p = 0.002), and lumen area of common carotid artery (OR = 1.058, p = 0.01). For predicting low translesional pressure ratio, the AUC was 0.71 (p < 0.001) for angle γ, and was 0.87 (p < 0.001) for stenosis degree. For predicting high translesional wall shear stress ratio, the AUC was 0.62 (p = 0.04) for lumen area of internal carotid artery, and was 0.77 (p < 0.001) for stenosis degree.
CONCLUSIONS: Apart from stenosis degree, other geometric characteristics of lesions may also have an inﬂuence on hemodynamics of the stenotic carotid artery.
