Title: Female gender increases risk of stroke and readmission after carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has historically demonstrated a higher rate of perioperative adverse events for female patients. However, recent evidence suggests similar outcomes for CEA between genders. In contrast, fewer studies have examined gender in carotid artery stenting (CAS). Using contemporary data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we aim to determine if gender impacts differences in postoperative complications in patients who undergo CEA or CAS.
METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried from 2005 to 2017 using Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases codes for retrospective review. Patients with carotid intervention (CEA or CAS) were stratified into asymptomatic vs symptomatic cohorts to determine the effect of gender on 30-day postoperative outcomes. Symptomatic patients were defined as those with perioperative transient cerebral ischemic attack or stenosis of carotid artery with cerebral infarction. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Risk-adjusted odds of 30-day postoperative outcomes were calculated using multivariate regression analysis with fixed effects for age, race, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: There were 106,568 patients with CEA or CAS (104,412 CEA and 2156 CAS). The average age was 70.9 years, and female patients accounted for 39.9% of the population. For asymptomatic patients that underwent CEA or CAS, female gender was associated with significantly higher rates of cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/stroke (13%; P = .005), readmission (10%; P = .004), bleeding complication (32%; P = .001), and urinary tract infection (54%; P = .001), as well as less infection (26%; P = .001). In the symptomatic cohort, female gender was associated with significantly higher rates of CVA/stroke (32%; P = .034), bleeding complication (203%; P = .001), and urinary tract infection (70%; P = .011), whereas female gender was associated with a lower rate of pneumonia (39%; P = .039). Subset analysis found that, compared with male patients, female patients <75 years old have an increased rate of CVA/stroke (21%; P = .001) and readmission (15%; P < .001), whereas female patients ≥75 years old did not. In asymptomatic and symptomatic patients that underwent CEA, female gender was associated with significantly higher rates of CVA/stroke (13%; P = .006 and 31%; P = .044, respectively), but this finding was not present in patients undergoing CAS.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing carotid intervention, female gender was associated with significantly increased rates of postoperative CVA/stroke in the asymptomatic and symptomatic cohorts as well as readmission in the asymptomatic cohort. Female gender was associated with higher rates of CVA/stroke following CEA, but not CAS. We recommend that randomized control trials ensure adequate representation of female patients to better understand gender-based disparities in carotid intervention.
