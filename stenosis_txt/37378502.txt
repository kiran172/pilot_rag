Title: Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofool and remifentanil during operative endoscopy tracheobronchial laser therapy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to assess how total intra-venous anaesthesia (TIVA) achieved by propofol and remifentanil continuous infusion could ensure proper success of the endobronchial laser therapy, in optimal conditions for the endoscopist, determining at the same time an adequate hypnosis and a good analgesia.
METHODS: We studied 50 patients (28M - 22F), ASA class I-IV, mean age 42 ± 32.5 years , subjected to laser endoscopy to repair tracheal stenosis. TIVA was performed in all patients, and spontaneous breathing was maintained.
RESULTS: 10.2% of patients experienced episodes of coughing during induction. The depth of the anaesthesia plan, monitored by BIS, was 55 ± 5. The awakening was fast in all patients, with an Aldrete score of 7.71 ± 1.14 at 1 minute and 9.31 ± 1.12 at 10 minutes.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study allow us to state that the continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil proved to be the gold standard in patients ASA I-II-III undergoing endobronchial laser therapy. The use of TIVA has also allowed to perform endoscopic intervention on patients who suffered from a significant decrease of both cardiac and respiratory functions.
