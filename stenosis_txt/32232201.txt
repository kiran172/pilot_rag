Title: An investigation into hemodynamically significant coronary artery lesions predictors assessed by fractional flow reserve: A propensity score matching analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) provides more useful information regarding myocardial metabolism and demand-supply convenience as compared to anatomical measurements. In this study, we aimed to investigate FFR predictors after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis in patients with intermediate coronary lesions.
METHODS: Patients who underwent coronary angiography between January 2014 and March 2015 due to suspicion of coronary artery disease were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the FFR status and predictors of FFR before and after PSM analysis were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 290 patients (a total of 310 lesions) were included in this study (61Â±12 years, 75.5% male). In univariate analysis, after PSM analysis, Diameter stenosis (DS) and proximal LAD lesion (PLL) were associated with lower FFR values.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that the majority of traditional FFR predictors did not reach the limit of significance after PSM analysis and we suggest that DS and PLL are one step ahead of predicting lesion severity compared to other traditional risk factors.
