Title: Voice Restoration after Traumatic Subglottic Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Tracheal stenosis post intubation is one of the most common complication for which resection and anastomosis is done. Here we present a 21 year male patient who was intubated post organophosphorous poisoning. Diagnosed with tracheal stenosis post intubation and managed with tracheal resection and anastomosis with uneventful recovery. Post intubation tracheal stenosis is one of the serious complications and requires a multidisciplinary team and high volume centre for adequate management. Considering the fact that this case report has tracheal stenosis of grade IV type with resected length of tracheal cartilage of more than 3 cm and trachea- tracheal anastomosis makes this a rare case report.
