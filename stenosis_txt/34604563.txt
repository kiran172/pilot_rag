Title: Safety and effect of Neuroform Atlas stent in the treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis: A single-center experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vascular intracranial stenosis (IS) is a significant cause of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This single-center study aims to show that symptomatic IS treatment by using the Neuroform Atlas stent (Stryker neurovascular, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) could be effective in reducing vessel stenosis.
METHODS: Ten patients affected by AIS or TIA, in the vascular territory of high-grade intracranial atherosclerotic lesions (>70% of vessel stenosis), older than 18-year-old, were treated by implanting a Neuroform Atlas stent (diameter of 4.5mm in 80% and 4mm in 20%). 70% of the patients underwent pre-stenting intracranial angioplasty.
RESULTS: Patients were between 54.8 and 83 years old (mean 68.46y ± 8.44y), 70% males and 30% females. At admission, 50% of all patients had an AIS and 50% a TIA. Restoration of the stenotic lumen was obtained after the endovascular procedure. The percentage mean of vascular stenosis was 83.7% ± 6.09% before treatment (t0), 52.2% ± 10.42% at the end of treatment (t1) and 46.2% ± 8.28% at the follow-up (t2). The IS percentage mean reduction between t0 and t1 was 31.5% ± 7.31%, and between t1 and t2 was 6% ± 5.47%, t0 and t2 of 37.5% ± 7.38%. Percentage reduction of IS was highly significant between time t0 and t1 (p = 0.005), and t0 and t2 (p = 0.005), also with a significant reduction between t1 and t2 (p = 0.012). No patient had experienced an increase of the ischemic area in the vascular territory of the target vessel at 3 months from the initial assessment. 10% of patients experienced a 3-months negative outcome (mRS = 5), 90% experienced a favorable outcome (mRS ≤2).
CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial stenosis endovascular treatment with Neuroform Atlas stent provides encouraging results, with a statistically significant association between the vascular caliber improvement and the endovascular treatment.
