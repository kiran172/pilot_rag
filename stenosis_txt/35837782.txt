Title: A young patient with recurrent myocardial infarction within a half month.

Abstract: In this study, we reported a young male patient with acute chest pain who was diagnosed as myocardial infarction. The regular medication was performed following coronary intervention. Under such condition, this patient had 3 times myocardial infarction within a half month. The laboratory results showed that there might be a state of hypercoagulability. Aspirin combined with clopidogrel and other treatment were administrated. Meanwhile, the examination demonstrated that there was aspirin-resistant in the patient. The antiplatelet drug and extended anticoagulation therapy were carried out. There was no further myocardial infarction, and no coronary arteries stenosis was found in the re-examination angiography. Aspirin resistance and hypercoagulability should be considered when patients occurred the repeated myocardial infarction after regular medication and coronary intervention. Replacement of the antiplatelet treatment or combination with anticoagulant therapy is necessary in similar patient to avoid the sever consequence.
