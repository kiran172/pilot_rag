Title: EUS-B-FNA Enhances the Diagnostic Yield of EBUS Bronchoscope for Intrathoracic Lesions.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopes have been used mainly through the airway for EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA); however, they can also be used through the esophagus. The esophageal approach, endoscopic ultrasound with bronchoscope-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA), has gradually become popular, as it can evaluate lesions that cannot be accessed through the airway.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the value of adding EUS-B-FNA to EBUS-TBNA performed by pulmonologists for intrathoracic lesions in the clinical setting.
METHODS: Between March 2009 and March 2020, all patients who underwent EUS-B-FNA and EBUS-TBNA for diagnostic purposes were included and retrospectively analyzed at a single institution.
RESULTS: A total of 1794 procedures using an EBUS bronchoscope including, EBUS-TBNA, EUS-B-FNA, and the combination of EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA for evaluating intrathoracic lesions, were performed. We finally analyzed 276 patients who underwent EUS-B-FNA for diagnostic purposes. EUS-B-FNA provided diagnostic materials from only EBUS-TBNA-inaccessible lesions in 26 patients and in 18 patients whose conditions were inappropriate for bronchoscopy (e.g., respiratory failure, airway stenosis, etc.). EUS-B-FNA provided diagnostic results in four patients with non-diagnostic EBUS-TBNA results. EUS-B-FNA was preferable to EBUS-TBNA in 4.4% (48 of 1091) of patients; therefore, adding EUS-B-FNA to EBUS-TBNA increased the diagnostic yield from 72.6% (1043 of 1437) to 75.9% (1091 of 1437).
CONCLUSION: Pulmonologists are able to enhance diagnostic yields by acquiring the EUS-B-FNA technique.
