Title: IVC Stent to Improve Ventricular Assist Device Filling Following Pediatric Cardiac Transplant.

Abstract: Poor ventricular assist device filling is often seen in patients supported with the Berlin Heart Excor. Caval stenosis is an uncommon complication following the bicaval approach to orthotopic heart transplantation. We report the case of a five-year-old female patient post heart transplantation whose poor right ventricular assist device filling immediately resolved following management of caval stenosis.
