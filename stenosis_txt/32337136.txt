Title: Triple Valve Replacement in a Patient with Severe Combined Aortic and Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: With recent advancements and evidence in favor of transcatheter approach for valve replacements including valve-in-valve procedures, it has become a favorable choice particularly in critically ill patients. Additionally, transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement (TMViVR) is emerging as a less invasive substitute for patients with early dysfunctional bioprosthetic valve. We describe the clinical course of a 52-year-old male whose initial presentation to the hospital for dyspnea on exertion secondary to combined severe aortic and mitral stenosisÂ got complicated requiring three valvular replacement procedures with favorable outcomes.
