Title: Renal artery intervention for a patient with flash pulmonary edema accompanied by elevation of troponin levels due to bilateral renal artery stenosis and multivessel coronary disease: a case report.

Abstract: An 84-year-old woman complaining of acute-onset chest distress for 2 hours was referred to the Department of Cardiology, Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital, China. A physical examination showed signs of acute pulmonary edema with considerably elevated blood pressure of 186/120â€‰mmHg. An electrocardiogram showed ST segment depression in leads I, II, and III, and from V4 to V6. A laboratory test showed markedly elevated creatine, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels. Echocardiography showed a mildly enlarged left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 43%. The patient was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and Killip 3 grade heart function. The non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score was 156. Emergency coronary angiography showed severe three-vessel disease with a global ejection fraction of 50% based on left ventricular angiography. Selective renal artery angiography was performed and major stenosis at the ostia in both renal arteries was found. We did not touch the coronary artery, but performed intervention of the renal artery by implanting two bare metal stents in both ostia of bilateral renal arteries. An unexpected clinical benefit was obtained.
