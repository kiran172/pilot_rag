Title: Analysis of the incidence and influencing factors associated with binary restenosis of target lesions after drug-coated balloon angioplasty for patients with in-stent restenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloon (DCB) is a novel and effective device for coronary artery disease patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). However, the incidence and possible influencing factors associated with binary restenosis have not yet been adequately assessed.
METHODS: The data are extracted from a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. A total of 211 patients with ISR were enrolled at 13 centers from August 2017 to October 2018 and treated with DCB. At the 9-month coronary angiographic follow-up, patients were divided into restenosis and non-restenosis groups, and demographic data, lesion features, and laboratory tests were retrospectively reviewed. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was used to identify possible influencing factors.
RESULTS: All patients successfully underwent treatment, and 166 patients with 190 lesions took part in angiography follow-ups at 9 months. Of these, 41 patients with 44 target lesions developed restenosis following treatment, and the incidence of ISR was 24.7%. There were significant differences in the average length of target lesions and the number of multivessel lesions and fasting plasma glucose (FBG) between the two groups (p < 0.05). Demographic data, cardiac risk factors, left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF), blood routine tests, biochemical tests, and other features of devices and lesions showed no difference. Logistic regression analyses showed that FBG > 6.1 mmol/L (OR: 7.185 95% CI: 2.939-17.567 P < 0.001) and length of lesion (OR:1.046 95% CI: 1.001-1.093 P = 0.046) were associated risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The longer length of lesions, more target lesions and FBG > 6.1 mmol/L per individual may be characteristics of patients showing ISR following treatment. Studies with larger sample size, and more complete follow-up data are needed in the future to expend on these findings.
