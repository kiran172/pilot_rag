Title: [Association between smoking and the severity of coronary lesions among young and middle-aged female patients with acute coronary syndrome].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the association between smoking and the severity of coronary lesions among young and middle-aged female patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: Data of this study were derived from the Improving Care for Cardiovascular Disease in China (CCC)-ACS project, a collaborative study of the Chinese Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. Since 2014, the CCC-ACS project consecutively enrolled inpatients with ACS, systematically collected their clinical data and evaluated medical quality of these patients from 158 tertiary hospitals and 82 secondary hospitals across China. This study enrolled female patients less than 60 years old with initial ACS, who received coronary angiography in CCC-ACS project. Patients were divided into two groups according to smoking status. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between smoking and the severity of coronary lesions among young and middle-aged female patients with ACS. Results: A total of 2 863 female patients younger than 60 years old with initial ACS, who received coronary angiography, were enrolled. Among them, 12% (340 cases) was smokers. Proportion of patients younger than 45 years old was higher (13.2% (45/340) vs. 8.5% (215/2 523), P&lt;0.01) and prevalence of hypertension (59.4% (202/340) vs. 66.7% (1 683/2 523), P&lt;0.01) and diabetes (39.4% (134/340) vs. 44.2% (1 116/2 523), P=0.09) was lower in smoker group than in non-smoker group. However, prevalence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (66.8% (227/340) vs. 53.7% (1 354/2 523), P&lt;0.01), coronary multi-vessel lesions (39.1% (133/340) vs. 32.6% (822/2 523), P&lt;0.01) and severe stenosis in either single-vessel (56.2% (109/194) vs. 46.1% (706/1 530), P&lt;0.01) or multi-vessel (63.2% (84/133) vs. 58.2% (478/822), P=0.29) was significantly higher in smoker group than in non-smoker group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that after adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated triglyceride, renal insufficiency, family history of coronary heart disease and types of ACS, smokers faced a higher risk of coronary multi-vessel lesions, coronary multi-vessel severe lesions and coronary severe lesions with the odds ratios and 95% confidence interval of 1.41 (1.11-1.79), 1.40 (1.10-1.78) and 1.78 (1.11-2.87), compared with non-smokers. Conclusions: Smoking is significantly associated with an increased risk of extensive and severe coronary lesions among young and middle-aged female patients with ACS. This study provides crucial evidence for further understanding the harms of smoking and the need to strengthen the tobacco control education and smoking cessation guidance for young and middle-aged women.
