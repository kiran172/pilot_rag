Title: Conservative treatment for residual lung congestion after left upper trisegmentectomy: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Currently, segmentectomy is the procedure of choice in approximately 10% of lung cancer surgeries in Japan. However, complications are often observed in that procedure. In particular, residual pulmonary congestion after segmentectomy often leads to surgical intervention.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of improved congestion in the residual lung after left upper trisegmentectomy (LUTS) with conservative treatment under careful observation. A 65-year-old man was diagnosed with bilateral lung cancer and initially underwent LUTS. On the next day after surgery, blood sputum was observed. Computed tomography (CT) showed consolidation in the lingual region of the left lung and stenosis of V4+5 in the left lung. The cause of the congestion was thought to be an isolated segment with part of the remaining S3 and a thin V4+5 with poor flow. Because pulmonary torsion or necrosis of the residual lung was not observed, conservative treatment with antibiotics under careful follow-up by CT was chosen. The pulmonary congestion and inflammatory reaction gradually improved, and the patient was discharged home on the 26th day after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: We experienced a case of residual pulmonary congestion after LUTS that resolved with conservative treatment. Careful follow-up of the patient's general condition and imaging studies are considered to be important.
