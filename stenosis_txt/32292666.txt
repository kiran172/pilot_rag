Title: Imaging Findings of Pseudo-occlusion of Common Iliac Artery: Pitfall of Time-resolved Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography.

Abstract: Time-resolved contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (TRC-MRA) is a contrast-enhanced MRA technique commonly used for the qualitative hemodynamic assessment in digital subtraction angiography. TRC-MRA is a reliable method that seldom shows flow-related false findings which are sometimes observed on noncontrast or single-phase contrast-enhanced MRA techniques. Here we present a case of a patient with large fibroids that showed pseudo-occlusion of common iliac artery in TRC-MRA. Flow alternation can take place depending on patient posture and positioning status, especially in cases with large pelvic mass lesions. This is the first report of false image findings related to pelvic mass observed on TRC-MRA. For patient preparation, coil setting position is important and physicians should be familiar with the potential risk of transient arterial luminal stenosis or even occlusion in patients with large pelvic mass.
