Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement vs. Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement for Long-Term Mortality Due to Stroke and Myocardial Infarction: A Meta-Analysis during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Abstract: Background and objectives: One of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in people over the age of 50 is stroke. The acceptance of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as a treatment option for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) has increased as a result of numerous randomized clinical trials comparing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and TAVR in high- and intermediate-risk patients, showing comparable clinical outcomes and valve hemodynamics. Materials and Methods: An electronic search of Medline, Google Scholar and Cochrane Central was carried out from their inception to 28 September 2022 without any language restrictions. Results: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that, as compared with SAVR, TAVR was not linked with a lower stroke ratio or stroke mortality. It is clear from this that the SAVR intervention techniques applied in the six studies were successful in reducing cardiogenic consequences over time. Conclusions: A significantly decreased rate of mortality from cardiogenic causes was associated with SAVR. Additionally, when TAVR and SAVR were compared for stroke mortality, the results were nonsignificant with a p value of 0.57, indicating that none of these procedures could decrease stroke-related mortality.
