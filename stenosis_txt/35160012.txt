Title: Incidence and Predictors of Permanent Pacemaker Implantation after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Procedures: Data of The Netherlands Heart Registration (NHR).

Abstract: Atrioventricular conduction disturbance leading to permanent pacemaker (PM) implantation is a frequent and relevant complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aimed to evaluate the rate of post-TAVI permanent PM implantation over time and to identify the predictive factors for post-TAVI PM. The data were retrospectively collected by the Netherlands Heart Registration (NHR). In total, 7489 isolated TAVI patients between 2013 and 2019 were included in the final analysis. The primary endpoint was a permanent PM implantation within 30 days following TAVI. The incidence of the primary endpoint was 12%. Post-TAVI PM showed a stable rate over time. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02), weight (OR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.01), creatinine serum level (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.31), transfemoral TAVI approach (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.11-1.61), and TAVI post-dilatation (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.33-1.89) were shown to be independent predictors of PM. Male sex (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.93) and previous aortic valve surgery (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.69) had a protective effect on post-TAVI PM. From a large national TAVI registry, some clinical and procedural factors have been identified as promoting or preventing post-TAVI PM. Further efforts are required to identify high-risk patients for post-TAVI PM and to reduce the incidence of this important issue.
