Title: Urethral metastasis from esophageal cancer: symptoms of dysuria and cystoscopic diagnosis.

Abstract: Urethral malignant tumors are rare and can lead to stenosis, causing dysuria. We report a case of urethral metastasis secondary to esophageal cancer. At the time of diagnosis, a patient with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma presented with voiding difficulties, feeble stream, terminal dribbling and incomplete voiding. The urethral tumor was diagnosed using cystoscopy, and biopsy was thereafter performed. Histopathology of the urethral tumor microscopically resembled to that of esophageal cancer. On immunohistochemistry, the urothelium markers uroplakin 2 and GATA3 were negative in the carcinomatous component; however, GATA3 was detected on the lesion's surface. This case demonstrated that esophageal cancer metastasized to the urethra. Medical oncologists should consider this diagnosis in patients with cancer presenting with dysuria.
