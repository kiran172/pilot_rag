Title: Cystatin C in risk prediction after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a retrospective analysis.

Abstract: AIMS: No study has evaluated the prognostic value of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification by cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (CKD<sub>Cys</sub> classification) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aimed to compare the prognostic value of CKD<sub>Cys</sub> classification and CKD classification by creatinine-based eGFR (CKD<sub>Cr</sub> classification) in risk prediction after TAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analysed consecutive 219 patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR at our institute between December 2016 and June 2019. Pre-operative CKD<sub>Cr</sub> and CKD<sub>Cys</sub> classifications were evaluated for their prognostic value of 2-year major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) after TAVR. MACCE was defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and rehospitalization for worsening congestive heart failure. Participants had a median age of 86.0 years and were predominantly female (76.9%). In 96.6% of the cases, TAVR was performed using transfemoral access. The median creatinine-based eGFR (52.85 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was higher than the cystatin C-based eGFR (41.50 mL/min/1.73 m2 ). Downward reclassification in CKD stages based on eGFR<sub>Cys</sub> was observed in 49.0% of patients. During a median follow-up period of 575.5 (interquartile range: 367.0-730.0) days, 58 patients presented with MACCE. CKD<sub>Cys</sub> classification, but not CKD<sub>Cr</sub> classification, significantly stratified the risk of 2-year MACCE in patients after TAVR by log-rank test (P = 0.003). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, only CKD<sub>Cys</sub> stage 3b [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-14.91; P = 0.019] and CKD<sub>Cys</sub> stage 4 + 5 (HR = 3.72; 95% CI: 1.06-12.99; P = 0.040) were significant predictors of MACCE after adjustment for potential confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: The CKD<sub>Cys</sub> classification could better assess the risk than the CKD<sub>Cr</sub> classification in patients undergoing TAVR. CKD<sub>Cys</sub> stage 3b and stage 4 + 5 correlated with adverse outcomes.
