Title: Impact of Plaque Components on Fractional Flow Reserve-Derived Computed Tomography in Severe Coronary Stenosis.

Abstract: Fractional ﬂow reserve derived from computed tomography decreases across severe coronary stenosis. The diagnostic accuracy of fractional ﬂow reserve-derived computed tomography is high for severe coronary stenosis. In this report, we present a case of no signiﬁcant fractional ﬂow reserve-derived computed tomography changes even in severe coronary stenosis. A 75-year-old man showed severe stenosis (85% diameter stenosis) in the distal segment of the right coronary artery on both computed tomography angiography and invasive coronary angiography. However, fractional ﬂow reserve-derived from computed tomography showed no signiﬁcant changes from the proximal (0.97) to the distal (0.95) segments despite the presence of severe stenotic lesion. This patient had diﬀerent features including the presence of a large acute marginal branch and signiﬁcantly lower plaque components in the stenotic lesion compared with another patient who had coronary stenosis in the same segment. A large bifurcation branch and/or proportion of plaque components can aﬀect fractional ﬂow reserve-derived from computed tomography hemodynamics.
