Title: Endovascular Therapy for Intracranial Artery Stenosis: Results from the Japanese Registry of Neuroendovascular Therapy (JR-NET)3.

Abstract: A total of 907 patients enrolled in the Japanese Registry of Neuroendovascular Therapy (JR-NET)3, a surveillance study in Japan, who underwent intracranial percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)/stenting for intracranial stenosis during the period from 2010 to 2014 were investigated. Technical success was achieved in 97.5% of the patients, and 6.8% had a residual stenosis of â‰¥50%. The incidence rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic complications were as low as 5.3% and 3.1%, respectively, and the mortality rate was 1.9%. However, the mortality rate of cases with either complications was higher at 10.7%. About half of the treatment cases were performed between 24 h and 14 days after onset, and the incidence of perioperative complications was similar to that after at least 15 days. Although it is necessary to verify the effectiveness of PTA/stenting within 14 days, the results of this treatment were stable regardless of the intervention period.
