Title: Drug-eluting balloon treatment in femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis of different lengths.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In this study, we present one-year results of drugeluting balloon treatment of femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis.
METHODS: A total of 62 patients (48 males, 14 females; mean age 64.2±9.1 years; range, 54 to 81 years) who underwent drugeluting balloon stenting for femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis between August 2013 and October 2017 were included in the study. The patients were classified into three groups based on the narrowing length of stenosis in the stents. Group/Class 1 (n=17): narrowing <1/2 of the stent length; Group/Class 2 (n=22): narrowing >1/2 of the stent length, not totally occluded; and Group/Class 3 (n=23): totally occluded. In-stent restenosis was treated with drug-eluting balloon treatment.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference among all classes in terms of in-stent restenosis. The length of stenosis was a predictor for in-stent restenosis. The mean stent length was 107.7±24.6 mm in Group 1, 164.6±17.9 mm in Group 2, and 180±19.3 mm in Group 3. For non-occluded in-stent restenosis, restenosis rate at one year after balloon angioplasty was 47.1% in Group 1, 86.4% in Group 2, and 95.7% in Group 3. Femoropopliteal bypass was performed in five patients in whom treatment failed. None of the patients required amputation.
CONCLUSION: The length of in-stent restenosis in the femoropopliteal arterial stents is an important predictor for recurrent stenosis, when re-flow is achieved with drug-eluting balloons.
