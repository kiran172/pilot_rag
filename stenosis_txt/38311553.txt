Title: [Association of ITGA4 and ICAM-1 gene polymorphisms with the risk and clinicopathological characteristics of Crohn's disease].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between the polymorphism of integral protein Î±4 (ITGA4) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) genes and the risk and clinicopathological characteristics of Crohn's disease (CD) among Chinese patients.
METHODS: From January 2010 to January 2021, a total of 215 CD patients and 529 gender- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University as the study subjects. Genotypes of ITGA4 (rs6740847, rs7562325) and ICAM-1 (rs5498) were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) was applied to assess the disease activity of CD, and the patients were further divided into subgroups based on the Montreal Classification Criteria of CD. Unconditional logistic regression was employed to analyze the distribution of ITGA4 (rs6740847, rs7562325) and ICAM-1 (rs5498) polymorphisms between the patients and healthy controls and their association with the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients.
RESULTS: The frequencies of T allele and CT+TT genotypes of ITGA4 (rs7562325) were higher in CD patients than the healthy controls (40.70% vs. 31.57%, P = 0.001; 62.79% vs. 54.36%, P = 0.042). The G variant and AG+GG genotypes of ITGA4 (rs6740847) were less common in patients with moderately to severely active CD compared with those with mildly active CD (31.18% vs. 51.72%, P = 0.002; 55.91% vs. 75.86%, P = 0.042). However, the opposite conclusion was drawn for the G allele (G) and AG+GG genotypes of ICAM-1 (rs5498) (31.45% vs. 17.24%, P = 0.027; 54.30% vs. 31.04%, P = 0.020). Compared with patients with terminal ileal or ileocolic CD, G allele and AG+GG genotypes of ITGA4 (rs6740847) were more prevalent in patients with colonic CD (55.26% vs. 29.38%, P < 0.001; 84.21% vs. 53.11%, P<0.001). The same conclusion could also be drawn for the G allele and AG+GG genotypes of ICAM-1 (rs5498) (42.11% vs. 26.84%, P = 0.008; 73.69% vs. 46.33%, P = 0.002). The frequency of homozygous GG genotype of ICAM-1 (rs5498) was lower in patients with stricturing and penetrating CD than those with non-stricturing and non-penetrating CD (0.00% vs. 12.32%, P = 0.001). The G allele and AG+GG genotypes of the ITGA4 (rs6740847) were more common in patients with perianal lesions than those without (40.28% vs. 30.77%, P = 0.049; 72.22% vs. 51.75%, P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Variants of the ITGA4 (rs7562325) may be a risk factor for CD, whilst those of the ITGA4 (rs6740847) may be associated with the decline of disease activity and risk for colon involvement and perianal lesions. Variants of the ICAM-1 (rs5498) may increase the risk of disease activity and colonic involvement in CD patients, however, it may be a protective factor for stenosis and penetration. In addition, variants of the ITGA4 (rs6740847) and ICAM-1 (rs5498) may be associated with the early onset of CD.
