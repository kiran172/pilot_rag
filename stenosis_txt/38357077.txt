Title: Long-Standing Overt Ventriculomegaly in Adults (LOVA) With Absent Septum Pellucidum and Spontaneous Ventriculostomy: Report of a Rare Case.

Abstract: Long-standing overt ventriculomegaly in adults (LOVA) is a type of chronic hydrocephalus with presumable infant onset characterized by macrocephaly and massive ventriculomegaly that causes clinical presentations in later adult life. We report a case of a 20-year-old man who was referred from the ophthalmology department for further investigation of his visual disturbances. MRI of the head revealed massive ventriculomegaly with an Evan's index of 0.44. A careful investigation revealed coexisting aqueductal stenosis, absent septum pellucidum, ventricular rupture, and spontaneous ventriculostomy. The clinical presentations were relatively mild compared to his MRI findings. He was referred to a neurosurgeon for potential surgical interventions after the administration of conservative hyperosmolar drugs and neuroprotective agents.
