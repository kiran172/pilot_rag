Title: Extracorporeal Femoro-Carotid Shunt for Transcarotid Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement may be performed with a transcarotid approach when peripheral vascular disease is prohibitive for transfemoral access. In this case, a patient who presented in cardiogenic shock secondary to severe aortic stenosis developed electroencephalographic changes during transcarotid TAVR. A temporary extracorporeal femoro-carotid shunt permitted successful TAVR.
