Title: Lumbar Spinous Process-Splitting Technique for Ligamentum Flavum Cyst Removal.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: 窶キaminotomy for lumbar stenosis is a well-defined procedure and represents a routine in every neurosurgical department. It is a common experience that the uni- or bilateral paraspinal muscle detachment, together with injury of the supra- and interspinous ligaments, can lead to postoperative pain. In the literature, the application of a minimally invasive technique, the lumbar spinous process-splitting (LSPS) technique, has been reported.
METHODS: 窶オn this study, we present a case series of 12 patients who underwent LSPS from September 2019 to April 2020. Two patients had a cyst of the ligamentum flavum, eight a single-level lumbar canal stenosis (LCS), and two a two-level LCS. Moreover, we propose a novel morphological classification of postoperative muscle atrophy and present volumetric analysis of the decompression achieved.
RESULTS: 窶サhere were no complications related to this technique. In all patients, the vertebral canal area was more than doubled by the procedure. The muscle sparing showed grade A, according to our classification.
CONCLUSION: 窶サo our knowledge, this is the first description of this surgical technique and the first LSPSL case series in Europe. Furthermore, cases of ligamentum flavum cyst removal using this safe and effective technique have not yet been reported.
