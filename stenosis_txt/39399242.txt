Title: Advances in studies on tracheal stent design addressing the related complications.

Abstract: Tracheal stents can be used to quickly reconstruct the airway and relieve symptoms of dyspnea in patients with tracheal stenosis. However, existing tracheal stents lead to complications such as granulation tissue formation, difficulty in removal, persistent growth of malignant tumors, stent migration, and mucus plugging. In this article, we reviewed the main methods used to reduce complications associated with tracheal stent design. Drug-eluting stents can inhibit granulation tissue formation and prevent infection and local chemotherapy. The biodegradable stent can support the trachea for some time, maintain tracheal patency, and degrade gradually, which avoids removing or replacing the stent. Radioactive stents loaded with I125 have good potential for inhibiting the persistent growth of malignant tumors. Three-dimensional printing technology enables the manufacturing of patient-specific stents, which increases the degree of matching between the complex tracheal anatomy and the stent, thus providing a new solution for stent migration caused by structural mismatch. Minimizing the barrier of the stent to mucociliary clearance, providing an anti-fouling coating, and culturing respiratory epithelial cells on the surface of the stent are the main methods used to reduce mucus plugging. We also proposed future research directions for tracheal stents to guide the design and manufacture of ideal tracheal stents.
