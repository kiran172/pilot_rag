Title: Role and Value of Intravascular Ultrasound in the End-Stage Renal Disease Population: A Narrative Review.

Abstract: Vascular access for hemodialysis is the lifeline for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD); therefore, maintenance of the vascular access is of the utmost importance. The dialysis circuit can be complicated by stenosis or thrombosis. In particular, central venous stenosis is frequently encountered in the vascular access of patients with ESRD, and this complication may require endovascular management. Conventional catheter-based venography may be inadequate for identifying dynamic forms of extrinsic compression and intravascular webs associated with these lesions. For these types of access complications, balloon angioplasty remains the first-line intervention, with stenting reserved for selected scenarios. Accurate assessment of the venous configuration is therefore important to ensure an adequate treatment response. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been shown to be beneficial in lower extremity venous interventions. The use of IVUS in dialysis access interventions is currently limited but may be indicated in selected challenging clinical situations. In this article, we discuss the potential uses of IVUS in the ESRD population based on our institutional experience and on the current literature.
