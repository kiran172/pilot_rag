Title: Prognostic Implication of Intestinal Wall Edema in Patients with Aortic Stenosis Receiving Trans-Catheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A recently proposed mechanism, the intestinal-cardiovascular relationship, serves as a framework to elucidate the interplay between these two systems. In our investigation, we assessed the prognostic implications of colon wall thickness, a marker correlated with intestinal congestion and dysfunction, in patients diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR at our institution during the period spanning 2015 to 2022 were retrospectively enrolled. As part of the institutional protocol, patients underwent abdominal computed tomography upon admission, preceding TAVR. Our analysis aimed to assess the influence of colon wall thickness on the occurrence of either all-cause mortality or readmission due to heart failure within a two-year period.
RESULTS: A total of 345 patients were included. The median age was 85 (82, 88) years, and 99 patients were male. Baseline colon wall thickness was distributed widely, with a median value of 2.2 (2.0, 2.5) mm. Patients with thicker colon walls tended to have lower pulmonary artery pulsatility index values, indicating more impaired right ventricular function and more advanced malnutrition. A thicker colon wall was independently associated with 2-year death or heart failure readmission with a hazard ratio of 2.02 (95% confidence interval 1.01-14.07), adjusted for hemoglobin, age, and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide levels (p = 0.049), and significantly stratified the primary endpoint at a cutoff of 2.7 mm (25% versus 10%, p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our initial observation revealed that a thicker baseline colon wall correlated with increased rates of mid-term mortality and readmission due to heart failure subsequent to TAVR. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying causality necessitates further in-depth investigations through subsequent studies.
