Title: Acute Myocardial Infarction Caused by Plaque Erosion After Recovery From COVID-19 Infection Assessed by Multimodality Intracoronary Imaging.

Abstract: We report a case of non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction after recovery from COVID-19 infection. An emergency coronary angiography revealed 50% stenosis with thrombotic occlusion in the middle left anterior descending artery. Optical coherence tomography and coronary angioscopy revealed plaque erosion with mixed thrombus on a lipid-rich plaque. This case report may help to understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiac complications following COVID-19 infection.
