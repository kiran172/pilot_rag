Title: Congenital unicuspid aortic valve repair without cusp patch augmentation.

Abstract: Unicuspid aortic valves are rare congenital malformations. Surgical repair is feasible in aortic regurgitation, and in some cases of aortic stenosis. The standard surgical approach is a bicuspidization and symmetrization with pericardial patch augmentation of valve leaflets. Herein, we are describing our original technique for bicuspidization of a unicuspid aortic valve in adults without leaflet patch augmentation. We also address the surgical management of a commissural diastasis.
