Title: [New Sk2 guideline idiopathic posterior urethritis : Discussion of the current guideline using a case study].

Abstract: Posterior urethritis is diagnosed in prepubertal or pubertal boys mainly with terminal asymptomatic haematuria or postmicturition blood spotting on the meatus or in the underwear. It presents with typical changes in the bulbar urethra (hyperaemia, oedema and denuded mucosa) without laboratory or radiological findings. The pathology is self-limiting with a very good prognosis. This condition is most likely caused by dysfunctional voiding and urotherapy with biofeedback therapy offers good treatment results. Although urethrocystoscopy is the only way to confirm the diagnosis, the patient should be prevented from having a (usually unnecessary) urethrocystoscopy and the relatives should be reassured.
