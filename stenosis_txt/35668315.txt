Title: TAVI Under Pressure: Intra-balloon Pressure Profiles During Balloon-Expandable TAVR-First Data from a Feasibility Study.

Abstract: Our study investigated the feasibility to measure pressure profiles inside the inflation balloon during direct implantation of Edwards Sapien 3 ultra-prostheses using an additional syringe with a digital pressure read-out. Pressure profiles of 15 patients for 26 mm valve size were analyzed. Uniform patterns were found for 5 patients similar to those of previously acquired in vitro curves. 10 patients showed strikingly different pressure profiles compared to the above-mentioned group, marked by an earlier pressure increase, single or multiple pressure drops or higher overall pressure. Measuring the percentage of under-expansion of the prostheses, using calibrated angiographic projections revealed a significant difference between both groups. Our data raises the hypothesis that the acquisition of pressure profiles might help to better understand not only the implantation procedure itself but also the highly individual patient-device interaction, offering new information and a new perspective on optimization of TAVR implantation in the future.
