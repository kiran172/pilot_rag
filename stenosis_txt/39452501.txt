Title: External Carotid Artery Entrapment by the Hyoid Bone Associated with an Atherosclerotic Stenosis of the Internal Carotid Artery.

Abstract: The mechanical compression of an external carotid artery (ECA) is a rare pathology. The compression of the carotid bifurcation can be positional, induced by anatomical elements, or provoked by volumetric formation in the neck area. In this study, we describe a rare case of an entrapment of the ECA. A 67-year-old man who had two episodes of transient ischemic attack (TIA) demonstrated by loss of consciousness was transferred to our hospital. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed the atherosclerotic stenosis (80%) of a right internal carotid artery (ICA) and, at the same time, entrapment of the right ECA by the elongated right greater horn of the hyoid bone (GHHB). A 1 cm section of the GHHB was resected. After clamping of the carotid arteries, longitudinal arteriotomy and endarterectomy surgeries were performed from the right ICA. At the two months follow-up examination, the patient's condition was reported as normal, with no episodes of TIA, dysphagia, or pharyngeal discomfort.
