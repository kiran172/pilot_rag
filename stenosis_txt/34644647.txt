Title: Preoperative Risk Factors for Access Site Failure in Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Treatment of TASC C and D Aorto-Iliac Occlusive Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: At our institution, we adopted routinely ultrasound guided approach for all percutaneous procedures. The objective of this study was to describe the predictors of access site failures (ASFs) in patients undergoing percutaneous aorto iliac revascularization and to also evaluate whether other factors such as time period or different vascular devices may influence outcomes in terms of ASFs.
METHODS: We reviewed all consecutive percutaneous revascularizations performed for aortoiliac occlusion or stenosis at our institution from 2011 to 2020. All procedure were performed using an ultrasound (US) guided common femoral access. The primary outcome was ASFs, defined as bleeding or groin hematomas that required transfusions; pseduoaneurysm (diagnosed by US); retroperitoneal hematoma; artery laceration or ruptured (diagnosed intraoperatively); and thrombosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of ASFs.
RESULTS: A total of 502 femoral arteries were accessed under DUS guidance with no failure in sheath placement. Technical success was achieved in 498 of 502 procedures (99.2%). ASFs occurred in 21 patients (7%); but year of procedure appear to be associated with an excess of ASFs as rates were different between the first and second period of the study (10.9% vs. 4.8%, P = 0.04). Results of multivariable logistic regression model indicated that independent predictors of ASFs were common femoral artery (CFA) calcification peripheral artery calcium scoring system (PACCS) grade (odds ratio [OR], 8.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5-13.7), and CFA diameter (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.85). Compared to patients with successful percutaneous access, ASFs resulted in longer post-op lengths of stay (P = < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous US guided access can be safely performed in patients undergoing endovascular procedures for aorto iliac revascularization with TASC C and D lesions. CFA calcification PACCS grade greater than 3 and smaller femoral vessel diameter are independent risk factors for ASFs.
