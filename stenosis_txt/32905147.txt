Title: Reconstruction of superior mesenteric artery by prostheses placement in a case of chronic mesenteric ischemia: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: Although superior mesenteric artery stenosis is a relatively common situation, it is rarely symptomatic due to the fact that in a significant number of cases an adequate collateral circulation exists. The aim of this study is to report a case in which arterial reconstruction was needed due to the absence of such a patent collateral circulation. The 47-year-old patient was investigated for chronic postprandial pain and was diagnosed with superior mesenteric artery stenosis. Percutaneous treatment was the initial option of choice but the patient rapidly became symptomatic again. Therefore surgery was performed, the segment of arterial stenosis was resected and the arterial continuity was re-established by using a synthetic prosthesis. The postoperative outcome was uneventful, the patient was discharged in the seventh postoperative day under anticoagulant therapy. In conclusion, superior mesenteric artery reconstruction by using a synthetic prosthesis can be useful in cases presenting chronic mesenteric ischemia and failure of percutaneous treatment.
