Title: Interventional pulmonology techniques in lung transplantation.

Abstract: Lung transplantation is a key therapeutic option for several end-stage lung diseases. Interventional pulmonology techniques, mostly bronchoscopy, play a key role throughout the whole path of lung transplantation, from donor evaluation to diagnosis and management of post-transplant complications. We carried out a non-systematic, narrative literature review aimed at describing the main indications, contraindications, performance characteristics and safety profile of interventional pulmonology techniques in the context of lung transplantation. We highlighted the role of bronchoscopy during donor evaluation and described the debated role of surveillance bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy) to detect early rejection, infections and airways complications. The conventional (transbronchial forceps biopsy) and the new techniques (i.e. cryobiopsy, biopsy molecular assessment, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy) can detect and grade rejection. Several endoscopic techniques (e.g. balloon dilations, stent placement, ablative techniques) are employed in the management of airways complications (ischemia and necrosis, dehiscence, stenosis and malacia). First line pleural interventions (i.e. thoracentesis, chest tube insertion, indwelling pleural catheters) may be useful in the context of early and late pleural complications occurring after lung transplantation. High quality studies are advocated to define endoscopic standard protocols and thus help improving long-term prognostic outcomes of lung transplant recipients.
