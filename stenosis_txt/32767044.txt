Title: Evaluation of the discussion of late effects and screening recommendations in survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) lymphoma.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The study objective was to assess the discussion of late effects (LEs) and screening recommendations (SRs) for adolescent and young adults (AYAs) treated for lymphoma.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on AYA lymphoma survivors aged 15-24 years at diagnosis who received radiation therapy (RT) ± chemotherapy between 1984 and 2010 at any of the six British Columbia (BC) Cancer treatment centers across the province. Charts were reviewed to evaluate discussion of LEs and SRs. Susceptibility to specific LEs was determined by reviewing treatment details.
RESULTS: Of 305 patients, 212 (70%) had documented discussion of at least one specific LE, 39 (13%) had non-specific documentation only, and 54 (18%) had no documented discussion of LEs. Accounting only for patients susceptible to each LEs, the most frequently discussed LEs was radiation-induced (RI) neoplasm (42%), and the least frequently discussed LEs was carotid artery stenosis (0.4%). The most common SRs discussed in susceptible patients was for RI breast cancer (43%). Of patients discharged between 1985 and 1999 vs 2000 and 2014, LEs were discussed in 63 vs 93% (P < 0.0005), and SRs were discussed in 30 vs 65%, respectively (P < 0.0005). Older age at discharge, presence of a discharge note, and occurrence of a discharge appointment were associated with increased discussion of SRs.
CONCLUSIONS: Most survivors of AYA lymphoma received some discussion of LEs and SRs, but each relevant LEs and SRs was discussed in only a minority of susceptible patients.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Survivors of AYA lymphoma and their primary care professionals may not be appropriately informed of health risks and how to screen for them.
