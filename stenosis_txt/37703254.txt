Title: B-mode ultrasound characteristics of carotid plaques in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with low-grade stenosis.

Abstract: Carotid plaque features assessed using B-mode ultrasound can be useful for the prediction of cerebrovascular symptoms. Therefore, the aim of this retrospective study was to determine the ability of ultrasound B-mode imaging to differentiate between carotid plaques causing less than 50% stenosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A dataset of 1,593 patients with carotid disease who underwent carotid ultrasound between 2016 and 2021 was evaluated retrospectively between January and April of 2022. A total of 107 carotid plaques from 35 symptomatic and 52 asymptomatic patients causing low-grade stenosis on B-mode images were included in the analysis. Chi-square, independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the variables. There was a significant association between hypertension and the presence of cerebrovascular symptoms (p = 0.01). Predominantly hypoechoic and hyperechoic carotid plaque were significantly associated with the presence and absence of cerebrovascular symptoms, respectively (predominantly hypoechoic: p = 0.01; predominantly hyperechoic: p = 0.02). Surface irregularity was significantly associated with the presence of cerebrovascular symptoms (p = 0.02). There is was a significant difference in the carotid plaque length and area between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (plaque length: symptomatic median 9 mm, interquartile range [IQR] 6 mm; asymptomatic median 6 mm, IQR 4.5 mm, p = 0.01; plaque area: symptomatic median 24 mm, IQR 30 mm; asymptomatic median 14 mm, IQR 17 mm, p = 0.01); however, this difference was not significant for plaque thickness (p = 0.55), or common carotid artery intima-media thickness (p = 0.7). Our findings indicate that hypertension patients with predominantly hypoechoic carotid plaques and plaques with an irregular surface are associated with the presence of cerebrovascular symptoms. In addition, the carotid plaques in symptomatic patients were longer and larger compared to asymptomatic patients.
