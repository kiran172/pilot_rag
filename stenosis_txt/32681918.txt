Title: A Multi-Institutional Experience With Robotic Appendiceal Ureteroplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report a multi-institutional experience with robotic appendiceal ureteroplasty.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 13 patients undergoing right appendiceal flap ureteroplasty at 2 institutions between April 2016 and October 2019. The primary endpoint was surgical success defined by the absence of flank pain and radiographic evidence of ureteral patency.
RESULTS: Eight of 13 (62%) underwent appendiceal onlay while 5/13 (38%) underwent appendiceal interposition. Mean length of stricture was 6.5 cm (range 1.5-15 cm) affecting anywhere along the right ureter. Mean operative time was 337 minutes (range 206-583), mean estimated blood loss was 116 mL (range 50-600), and median length of stay was 2.5 days (range 1-9). Balloon dilation was required in 1/12 (8%). One patient died on postoperative day 0 due to a sudden cardiovascular event. Otherwise, there were no complications (Clavien-Dindo > 2) within 30 days from surgery. At a mean follow up of 14.6 months, 11/12 (92%) were successful.
CONCLUSION: Robotic appendiceal ureteroplasty for right ureteral strictures is a versatile technique with high success rates across institutions.
