Title: [Pay attention to the diagnosis and treatment of long-term complications after pancreatectomy].

Abstract: Recently,with growing numbers of pancreatectomy and continuous improvement of comprehensive treatment,more patients have survived surgery of benign or malignant pancreatic tumors. As a result, pancreatic surgeons meet more long-term complications after pancreatic surgery. For many years,there is no uniform definition, diagnosis or therapeutic standard for long-term complications after pancreatic surgery. Such unsatisfactory situation has an indirectly negative impact on the life quality of patients as well as development of clinical research. By reviewing literature,the definition,diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies of some common long-term complications after pancreatic surgery were analyzed, including bilioenteric anastomotic stricture, pancreatic exocrine or endocrine insufficiency,and pancreatico-digestive tract anastomotic stricture,in order to improve the treatment effect of long-term complications and life quality of these patients.
