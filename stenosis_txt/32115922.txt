Title: [Effect of Tongdu Shujin Decoction () plus Lijin () manipulation on degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical efficacy of Tongdu Shujin Decoction (, TSD) combined with manipulation for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.
METHODS: The clinical data of 50 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis diagnosed from October 2015 to October 2017 were retrospectively studied. Fifty patients were divided into a treatment group and a control group, 25 cases in each group. In the treatment group, 25 patients were treated by TSD plus combined manipulation, including 10 males and 15 females, with an average age of (53.43±5.26) years old, the course of disease was (6.9± 2.3) years. In the control group, 25 patients were treated by the adenosine cobalamin tablets and loxoprofen sodium tablets, including 12 males and 13 females, with an average age of (56.37±4.61) years old, the course of disease was (7.1±3.4) years. The two groups were treated for 4 weeks. After treatment, the clinical efficacy of the two groups were evaluated by the low back pain evaluation criteria (JOA) and visual analogue scale (VAS) .
RESULTS: Fifty patients were followed up for 2.2 to 3.2 (2.62± 0.47) months. After treatment, JOA and VAS scores of the two groups were significantly improved compared with those before treatment, the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.01) , and the improvement degree of the treatment group was better than that of the control group, the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.01) .
CONCLUSION: TSD combined with manipulation for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis has a good effect.
