Title: Rest, replace, and recover: TandemHeart to transcatheter aortic valve replacement-a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) can present insidiously, with the end stages resulting in significant valvular-induced cardiomyopathy and can lead to cardiogenic shock (CS). Such cases result in a myriad of complex manifestations and are often associated with a poor prognosis. These patients require emergent cardiac evaluation and valvular intervention. Unfortunately, the immediate nature of the CS provides little time for a detailed valvular evaluation. Possible management involves use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) prior to urgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
CASE SUMMARY: The patient was a 70-year-old female who developed refractory CS, and acute decompensated heart failure was complicated by AV block secondary to severe AS. Due to progressively worsening haemodynamics, the need for MCS for cardiovascular support and eventual valve replacement resulted in the decision to pursue TandemHeartÂ® (TH; LivaNova Inc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). We discuss the novel implementation of the TH as a means of bridging to TAVR.
DISCUSSION: TandemHeart system provides the benefits of improving haemodynamic support in CS while allowing unencumbered access to the stenotic valve for balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) or TAVR. In our evaluation, we discuss the utilization and benefits associated with TH to TAVR in allowing for cardiac rest, replacement of the valve, and recovery of left ventricular function.
