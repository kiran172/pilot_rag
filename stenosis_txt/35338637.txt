Title: A case of salivary gland choristoma presenting with ear discharge in a child having external auditory canal stenosis.

Abstract: Salivary gland choristoma in the middle ear or external ear canal is rare. Generally, it is difficult to differentiate salivary gland choristoma from congenital cholesteatoma or cholesterol granuloma on Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It is challenging to diagnose preoperatively without specific clinical or radiological symptoms or signs. Thus, histopathological examination is required for a definitive diagnosis, and a histopathological sample of the lesion is acquired. We discuss the imaging and histology of salivary gland choristoma with the best recommendation on the management.
