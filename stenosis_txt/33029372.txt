Title: Idiopathic stenosis of foramina of Monro in an asymptomatic adult patient: a rare entity radiologists should be aware of.

Abstract: Bilateral Adult Idiopathic Oclussion of Foramen of Monro is a rare entity, with less than 22 cases published in the literature so far, all of them symptomatic.1 When the symptoms require it, the current first-line treatment is endoscopic foraminoplasty, sometimes associated with septum pellucidum fenestration, although some authors consider that a more conservative treatment in paucisymptomatic patients.2 We report the case of an idiopathic biventricular hydrocephalus found incidentally in an asymptomatic 42-year-old female with temporomandibular joint disfunction. The fact that some patients with Monro foraminal stenosis may be asymptomatic increases the possibility of underdiagnosis, so we consider it a condition that radiologists should be aware of, mainly taking into account the fact that the diagnosis of this entity is usually radiologic3 and the potential complications associated with treatment.
