Title: [Effect of spinopelvic sagittal parameters and facet joint angle on degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and correlation of spinopelvic sagittal parameters and facet joint angle on degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis.
METHODS: From July 2016 to September 2019, a total of 120 patients with L<sub>4</sub>-L<sub>5</sub> single segment degenerative spondylolisthesis were selected as observation objects (spondylolisthesis group), and 120 patients with L<sub>4</sub>-L<sub>5</sub> single-segment degenerative spinal stenosis matched by gender and age were selected as the control group. The following parameters were measured by imaging data:pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), lumbar lordosis (LL), thoracic kyphosis (TK), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), L<sub>4</sub>-L<sub>5</sub> cephalic facet joint angle, caudal facet joint angle and facet asymmetry.The differences of parameters between the two groups were compared and the meaningful parameters were analyzed by Logistic regression. The correlations between facet joint direction and spinopelvic parameters in patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in PI, PT, LL, SVA, cephalic facet angle and caudal facet angle between two groups (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that PI, PT and cephalic facet joint angle were the risk factors for lumbar spondylolisthesis (P<0.05). The sagittal of the cephalic facet joint in spondylolisthesis group was significantly correlated with PI and PT(P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: High PI, PT and sagittal of cephalic facet joint are the risk factors for lumbar spondylolisthesis, and the sagittal degree of facet joints is closely related to high PI and PT.
