Title: Functional outcomes in single stage bilateral ACL reconstruction with a maximum follow up of 10 years.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bilateral ACL injuries are a rarity and there is no particular consensus on whether this rare problem has to be tackled in stages or in a single stage. There are a few studies and case reports in the literature about the outcomes in single staged bilateral Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). This study is focused on functional outcomes after a single staged bilateral ACLR, as well as impact of simultaneity of the injury, meniscal tears, notch stenosis and hyperlaxity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted from 2013 to 2021. Patients with bilateral ACL injury either simultaneous or non simultaneous, with or without meniscal tears were included in this study. Pre operative diagnosis was made both clinically and by MR imaging. All patients underwent a single staged bilateral ACL reconstruction. Pre operative functional scores (IKDC and Lysholm) were taken at admission and patients were examined at regular follow ups. Final functional scores were collected in a phone interview.
RESULTS: 33 patients underwent bilateral ACLR in a single stage during the study period but one patient had revision ACLR in one knee and so was excluded. Of the 32 patients, 25 (78%) had non simultaneous injury and 7 (22%) had a simultaneous injury, meniscus tear was noted in 27 (84.4%), notch stenosis in 19 (59.3%) and hyperlaxity in 12 (37.5%). IKDC and Lysholm scores have improved postoperatively. No statistically significant difference was found with or without simultaneous injury or meniscus tears.
CONCLUSION: Single stage bilateral ACL reconstruction is a safe, reproducible approach to bilateral ACL injuries whether they were simultaneous or non simultaneous or with or without meniscal tears.
