Title: Transmural variation in microvascular remodeling following percutaneous revascularization of a chronic coronary stenosis in swine.

Abstract: Remodeling of the coronary microcirculation is known to occur distal to a chronic coronary stenosis, but the reversibility of these changes and their functional significance on maximum myocardial perfusion before and after revascularization is unknown. Accordingly, swine instrumented with a chronic silastic stenosis on the left anterior descending coronary artery to produce hibernating myocardium underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; n = 8) and were compared with animals with a persistent stenosis (n = 8), as well as sham controls (n = 6). Stenotic animals demonstrated an increased subendocardial arteriolar wall thickness-to-lumen ratio (37.8 ± 3.3 vs. 28.3 ± 1.3% in sham, P = 0.04), reduced lumen area per arteriole (597 ± 88 vs. 927 ± 113 μm2, P = 0.04), and a compensatory increase in arteriolar density (9.4 ± 1.0 vs. 5.3 ± 0.4 arterioles/mm2, P &lt; 0.01). As a result, vasodilated flow immediately after PCI was similar to normally perfused remote regions (5.1 ± 1.0 vs. 4.8 ± 0.9 ml·min-1·g-1, P = 0.87). When assessed 1-mo after PCI, increases in wall thickness-to-lumen diameter (42.2 ± 3.3%) and reductions in lumen area per arteriole (638 ± 59 μm2) remained unchanged, but arteriolar density returned to normal (5.2 ± 0.5 arterioles/mm2). As a result, maximum subendocardial flow during adenosine declined and was lower than remote regions (2.6 ± 0.3 vs. 5.9 ± 1.1 ml·min-1·g-1, P = 0.01). There was no microvascular remodeling in subepicardial arterioles, and maximum perfusion remained unchanged. These data demonstrate that subendocardial microvascular remodeling occurs distal to a chronic epicardial stenosis. The regression of arteriolar density without increases in luminal area may precipitate stress-induced subendocardial ischemia in the absence of a physiologically significant stenosis.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Swine with a chronic coronary stenosis exhibit subendocardial microvascular remodeling distal to a critical stenosis characterized by an increase in arteriolar wall thickness and reduction in lumen area with a compensatory increase in arteriolar density. The present study is the first to demonstrate that subendocardial arteriolar density normalizes 1-mo after revascularization, but the lumen area of individual arterioles remains reduced. This leads to a reduction in maximal subendocardial perfusion at this time point despite initial normalization of vasodilator reserve after revascularization. This pattern of chronic microvascular structural remodeling could contribute to recurrent subendocardial ischemia in the absence of coronary restenosis during tachycardia and increases in myocardial oxygen demand.
