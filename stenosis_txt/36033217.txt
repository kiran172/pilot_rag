Title: Predictors and outcomes of ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization in deferred lesion based on fractional flow reserve: a multi-center retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) has become the gold standard for diagnosing ischemia in angiographically intermediate epicardial coronary artery stenosis. This study investigated the clinical outcomes and predictors of revascularization deferral based on FFR.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed 474 lesions (440 patients) where revascularization was deferred based on the FFR value. Minimum lumen diameter and %-diameter stenosis were measured. Calcification was graded as none, mild, moderate, or heavy. The synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with taxus and cardiac surgery (SYNTAX) score I was also determined. The primary outcome was ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) in deferred lesions within 3 years. Patients were also assigned into two groups based on FFR value.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 69.7±10.4 years. The average FFR value was 0.86±0.05. Stable angina pectoris was noted in 298 (67.7%) cases, and in-stent restenosis (ISR) was present in 28 (5.9%). The average SYNTAX score was 7.2±4.2. The 3-year ischemia-driven TLR was 18 lesions (3.8%). Cox proportional hazard model revealed that the SYNTAX score and ISR were independent predictors for TLR in deferred lesions [hazard ratio (HR) =1.10, 95% confidential interval (CI): 1.01-1.19, P=0.03; HR =6.33; 95% CI: 2.25-17.8, P<0.01, respectively]. The deferral group, with a low FFR value, tended to have higher TLR rates than other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Lesions with lower FFR values were associated with a higher incidence of ischemia-driven TLR than those with higher FFR values. SYNTAX score and ISR were predictors for ischemia-driven TLR at 3 years in the deferred lesions.
