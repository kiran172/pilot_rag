Title: Anomalous Arising of Right Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery.

Abstract: Coronary artery anomalies are seen in less than 1% of the general population and in 1.6% of cardiac catheterization cases. The anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of four groups of coronary artery origin anomalies. The incidence of anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is 1 in 500,000 and was first described in 1882 by John Brook. This case report reports on a 67-year-old man with a diagnosis of asymptomatic anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. The patient underwent surgery of the aortic valve because of valve stenosis. A concomitant surgical procedure included repositioning of the right coronary artery origin to the aortic root sinus. The patient was discharged on the 12th postoperative day, in good condition. Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is commonly asymptomatic, and surgery is required only if myocardial ischemia is presented.
