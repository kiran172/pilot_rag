Title: Risk factors and ambulatory outcome in ischemic stroke patients with pre-stroke depression.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: It is well known that post-stroke depression might be a negative factor for stroke recovery, however there is limited evidence to establish the link between pre-stroke depression and stroke outcome such motor recovery. The objective is to determine clinical risk factors in ischemic stroke patients with pre-stroke depression that are associated functional ambulatory outcome.
METHODS: Data from acute ischemic patients from a regional stroke registry were collected for consecutive recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(rtPA)-treated acute ischemic stroke patients between January 2010 and June 2016. Logistic regression model was used to predict risk factors that served as predictive variables, while the increase or reduce odds of improvement in ambulatory outcome was considered as the primary outcome. Multicollinearity and possible interactions among the independent variables were analyzed using the variance inflation factor.
RESULTS: A total of 1446 patients were eligible for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and 596 of these patients received rtPA. Of the 596 ischemic stroke patients, 286 patients presented with recent pre-stroke depression, 310 had no pre-stroke depression. Carotid artery stenosis (OR = 11.577, 95% CI, 1.281-104.636, P = 0.029) and peripheral vascular disease (OR = 18.040, 95% CI, 2.956-110.086, P = 0.002) were more likely to be associated with increase odds of improvement in ambulation in patients with no pre-stroke depression treated with rtPA, while antihypertensive medications (OR = 0.192, 95% CI, 0.035-1.067, P = 0.050),previous TIA (OR = 0.177, 95% CI, 0.038-0.818, P = 0.027), and congestive heart failure (OR = 0. 0.160, 95% CI, 0.030-0.846, P = 0.031) were associated with reduced odds of improvement in ambulation. In addition, carotid artery stenosis (OR = 0.078, 95% CI, 0.10-0.614, P = 0.015, congestive heart failure (OR = 0.217, 95% CI, 0.318-0.402, P = 0.030), previous TIA (OR = 0.444, 95% CI, 0.517-0.971, P = 0.012), higher NIHSS scores ((OR = 0.887, 95% CI, 0.830-0.948, P < 0.001), and antihypertensive medications (OR = 0.810, 95% CI, 0.401-0.529, P = 0.019) were associated with the reduced odd of improvement in ambulation in an ischemic stroke population with pre-stroke depression treated with rtPA.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that more risk factors were associated with the decreased odds of an improvement in ambulation following thrombolytic therapy in an ischemic stroke population with pre-stroke depression when compared with those without pre-stroke depression. This finding maybe helpful in the development of management strategies to increase the use of thrombolytic therapy for pre-stroke depressed ischemic stroke to increased their eligibility for rtPA.
