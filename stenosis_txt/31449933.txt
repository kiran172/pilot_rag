Title: Contralateral HeRO Graft Insertion to Treat Severe Venous Hypertension and Preserve Arteriovenous Fistula Patency.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Central venous stenosis and occlusion (CVO) is an increasing problem in the growing hemodialysis population. Sequelae include loss of access, loss of sites suitable for future venous access, and venous hypertension. Endoluminal techniques are often unsuitable to treat long-standing stenoses, and open surgery confers higher morbidity and is not appropriate in many patients.
CASE: We present a case of long-standing central venous stenosis with an ipsilateral functioning fistula but with significant symptoms and signs of venous hypertension. The stenosis was not considered appropriate for endoluminal treatment, and the patient was considered to be at too high risk for open surgery. The Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) (Merit Medical Systems, UT) device was used to bypass the fistula to the superior vena cava via the contralateral internal jugular vein.
CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the utility of the HeRO device in cases of long-standing CVO necessitating contralateral bypass. This technique confers the benefits of open surgery while minimizing the associated risks.
