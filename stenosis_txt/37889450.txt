Title: Acute esophageal stricture after bone marrow transplant.

Abstract: Esophageal stricture after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is exceptionally rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature. We present an interesting case of a 58-year-old male with refractory multiple myeloma who developed dysphagia five days following his second bone marrow transplantation. He was found to have a severe esophageal stricture. The patient was treated with multiple esophageal dilations and triamcinolone injections in the following weeks to months, resulting in an improvement in symptoms. Although the exact underlying mechanism remains unknown, high-dose chemotherapy conditioning with melphalan prior to BMT likely contributed to the stricture. Our case highlights the importance of heightened post-bone marrow transplantation management for rare complications, such as an esophageal stricture.
