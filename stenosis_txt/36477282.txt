Title: [Wellens Syndrome: A rare entity not to be neglected].

Abstract: Wellens syndrome is a particular presentation of acute coronary syndrome which manifests, in a patient most often asymptomatic at the time of the examination, by specific electrocardiographic signs, in particular T waves in the precordial leads V2 and V3. The absence of chest pain at the time of the examination and the normality of cardiac enzymes can be falsely reassuring and constitute diagnostic pitfalls. This syndrome is associated with an often critical stenosis of the IVA (anterior descending artery). A good reading of the ECG is mandatory for the diagnosis. The management is done in interventional cardiology in order to avoid a massive anterior infarction.
