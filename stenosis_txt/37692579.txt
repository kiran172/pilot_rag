Title: Medical and Surgical Management of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis: A Comprehensive Literature Review.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenosis is a condition where the carotid artery is blocked by fatty cholesterol deposits called plaque, increasing the risk of stroke. Elderly individuals with high cardiovascular risk are more susceptible, along with smokers, those with high cholesterol, males, and older individuals. Young females may also be affected by fibromuscular dysplasia. Carotid stenosis significantly raises stroke risk, and the severity is closely linked to stroke incidence and other cardiovascular events. Early detection and treatment are essential to prevent complications. Treatment options include medical and surgical interventions, such as carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS). The choice between surgery and medical management varies depending on patient characteristics and risk factors. This review explores carotid artery stenosis pathophysiology, risk factors, the importance of early detection and treatment, and the surgical approaches of CEA and CAS, addressing their roles and controversies. Healthcare professionals must understand these aspects to provide optimal care to patients with this condition.
