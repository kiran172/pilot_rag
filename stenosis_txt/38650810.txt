Title: Moyamoya Disease with Non-Functional Pituitary Macroadenoma: A Case Report of a Rare Presentation.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare neurological condition characterized by brain blood vessel narrowing, leading to collateral vessel formation. Diagnosis typically involves cerebral angiography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), with surgical revascularization often providing superior outcomes. Here, we present the case of a 55-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes, and a history of ischemic stroke. She recently experienced a hemorrhagic stroke due to MMD, compounded by a non-functional pituitary macroadenoma. Recognizing signs of a hemorrhagic stroke is crucial to prevent future occurrences and ensure optimal outcomes. However, our understanding of the connection between MMD and pituitary macroadenoma remains incomplete. Further research is essential to refine diagnostic techniques and treatment strategies. Through continued research and awareness, we can strive for improved outcomes and an enhanced quality of life for individuals affected by MMD and its complications.
