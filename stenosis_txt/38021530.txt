Title: Anesthetic Considerations for Patients With Mitral Stenosis Undergoing Orthotopic Liver Transplant.

Abstract: A 70-year-old male presented for an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) with co-existing moderate-severe mitral valve stenosis. The hemodynamic goals of managing mitral stenosis posed a significant additional challenge to this patient's care. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was critical in guiding volume status and resuscitation. In addition, the patient's valvulopathy guided our vasoactive medication selection and arrhythmia prevention. In this article, we describe the multidisciplinary discussions regarding preoperative valvular intervention as well as the intraoperative techniques used to preserve cardiac output while avoiding coagulopathy and arrhythmias. We discuss the pathophysiology of valvular disease in the context of liver failure and the guidelines by which this disease process is classified. In addition, we discuss the benefits and limitations of intraoperative TEE in evaluating this unique physiology.
