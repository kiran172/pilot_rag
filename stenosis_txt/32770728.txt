Title: What's happening in carotid stent? A case report of prominent plaque protrusion after carotid artery stenting observed on angioscopy.

Abstract: Thromboembolic complications after carotid artery stenting (CAS) remain an unsolved problem, and several intravascular imaging tools have been proposed to clarify the mechanism of these complications. We report a case of intraprocedural plaque protrusion revealed by angioscopy. A 64-year-old woman underwent CAS for left carotid artery stenosis. After stent placement, optical frequency domain imaging demonstrated some plaque protrusion, and angioscopy showed prominent mobile plaque fragments protruding into the vessel between stent struts and confirmed the coverage of the protruded plaque after the overlapping stent was placed. Compared with other tools, angioscopy more clearly revealed plaque protrusion in the vessel after CAS.
