Title: Ischemic Nephropaty: The Role of the Renal Artery Stenosis Revascularization on Renal Stem Cells.

Abstract: We report the case of a 65-year-old man with acute GFR decline to 37 mL/min and uncontrolled high blood pressure. He was suspected for renovascular hypertension and underwent a renal color Doppler ultrasound scan that detected a bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. A digital selective angiography by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTRAs) was successfully performed. Blood pressure rapidly normalized, GFR increased within a few days, and proteinuria disappeared thereafter. These clinical goals were accompanied by a significant increase of circulating renal stem cells (RSC) and a slight increase of resistive index (RI) in both kidneys. This single observation suggests the need for extensive studies aimed at evaluating the predictive power of RI and RSC in detecting post-ischemic renal repair mechanisms.
