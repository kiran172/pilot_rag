Title: Effect of Statins on Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Coronary Artery Spasm: A Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect of statins on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) related to coronary artery spasm (CAS) and to evaluate the effectiveness of statins in patients with CAS.
METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases, including Google Scholar, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed, was conducted. These studies were all published in English, and the databases were searched from inception to July 2021. All articles were evaluated independently by 2 researchers on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the research, data about the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in CAS patients undergoing statin therapy was included and divided into different subgroups. A random effects model was conducted to synthesize the data.
FINDINGS: Five cohort studies were included in the analysis. These results indicated that statins failed to reduce the incidence of stroke in patients with CAS in general. However, subgroup analysis revealed that statins were more effective in improving outcomes for CAS patients without severe coronary stenosis compared with those with severe coronary stenosis.
IMPLICATIONS: Statins may have a potential benefit in patients with CAS who do not have coronary stenosis. To investigate these findings further, future prospective, randomized controlled research will be required.
