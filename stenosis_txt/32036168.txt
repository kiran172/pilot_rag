Title: Endonasal endoscopic surgery for pediatric anterior cranial fossa encephaloceles: A systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS) is a well-established management strategy for anterior cranial fossa (ACF) encephaloceles in adults. However, its application to the pediatric population has not been evaluated in large-scale studies. This study systematically reviews the safety of ESBS for pediatric ACF encephaloceles.
METHODS: Articles reporting on pediatric patients undergoing purely ESBS for encephaloceles were reviewed from three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library). Main outcomes were post-operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and other surgical complications.
RESULTS: Twenty-three articles provided data on 110 eligible patients with a mean age of 4.3 years (range birth - 18 years). Intraoperative CSF leaks occurred in 18.5% of children while post-operative CSF leaks developed in 6.0% of cases. Rates of meningitis and hydrocephalus were each 3.7%. Other complications included alar collapse, nasal stenosis, transient diabetes insipidus, pneumonia, and neurologic injury, collectively occurring in 7.0% of cases. The rate of death was 4.8%. The average duration of follow-up was 25.3 months. Encephaloceles recurred in 5.2% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: ESBS for pediatric ACF encephaloceles provides a relatively favorable risk-benefit profile, with a low rate of post-operative CSF leak, other surgical complications, and disease recurrence.
