Title: Stent for the management of Esophagic Stenosis by caustics in pediatry.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Esophageal stricture is one of the most serious complications of caustic ingestion in children, and may occasionally recur or be refractory to management with repeated dilations.
OBJECTIVE: To pre sent a case of the use of a silicone-coated metallic stent in a child with recurrent esophageal stricture secondary to caustic ingestion.
CLINICAL CASE: A 6-year-old boy with accidental caustic ingestion, with evidence of Zargar grade IIIA esophagitis in all three portions of the esophagus and a 3 cm prepyloric gastric ulcer that received initial treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids. After 21 days, the esophageal lumen diminished in relation to the healing process, which required serial di lations. Later, he developed a punctal stenosis, so it was decided to place two silicon-coated metallic esophageal stents, which were kept for 4 months, without new stenosis episodes.
CONCLUSIONS: The silicone-coated metallic stent is an alternative for the treatment of recurrent esophageal stricture due to caustic ingestion in children.
