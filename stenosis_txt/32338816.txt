Title: Total laparoscopic sigmoid vaginoplasty: a novel therapeutic approach.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and outcomes of total laparoscopic sigmoid vaginoplasty (TLSV) in women with congenital absence of the vagina.
METHODS: We investigated 10 women with congenital absence of the vagina, who underwent TLSV at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital between April 2013 and July 2016.
RESULTS: All 10 women were unmarried, the mean age was 22.8 (range 17-33) years, mean estimated blood loss was 149.2 ± 54.8 (60-170) mL, mean operative time was 108.4 ± 52.6 (130-210) min, mean post-operative hospital stay was 8.0 ± 2.8 (6-12) days and the mean neovaginal length was 13.4 ± 3.0 (12-16) cm. Eight of the 10 women were heterosexually active. Trocar port site infection and neovaginal stenosis occurred 3 months after TLSV in one patient; a vaginal mould was used to relieve the stenosis.
CONCLUSION: TLSV is an optimal minimally invasive procedure to treat women with congenital absence of the vagina and is associated with rapid recovery and acceptable cosmetic effects.
