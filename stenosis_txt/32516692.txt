Title: Anterior urethral strictures and retrograde urethrography: An update for radiologists.

Abstract: Urethral strictures are a relatively common affliction of men with the anterior urethra being most frequently affected. Anterior urethral strictures (AUS) typically present with obstructive voiding symptoms and appropriate management is often based on findings at cystourethroscopy and retrograde urethrography (RUG). In particular, determining the number, length, severity and location of urethral strictures is of pivotal importance. The accurate reporting of findings at RUG is dependent on a thorough knowledge of the urethral anatomy as well as recognizing periurethral structures that may opacify during the procedure. Obtaining a diagnostic, high-quality RUG study requires adherence to proper fluoroscopic technique as well as recognizing when to adjust or modify the technique to address pitfalls that may be encountered during the procedure. AUS may be treated by a variety of procedures including urinary diversion, transurethral procedures such as urethral dilation and internal urethrotomy and open surgical repair techniques termed urethroplasty. Some authors have recommended urethroplasty as first-line treatment given the high rate of stricture recurrence with other treatment options. Buccal mucosal grafts are a mainstay of modern urethroplasty. Familiarity with the commonly performed urethroplasty procedures allows radiologists to accurately assess the post-operative urethra thus guiding the management of these patients.
