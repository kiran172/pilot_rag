Title: Pulsatile energy consumption as a surrogate marker for vascular afterload improves with time post transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis.

Abstract: The effect of arterial stiffening on elevated pulsatile left ventricular afterload patients with aortic stenosis (AS) is pronounced beyond systemic hypertension. Circulatory afterload pulsatile efficiency (CAPE) is a marker of vascular function, defined as the ratio of steady state energy consumption (SEC) to maintain systemic circulation and pulsatile energy consumption (PEC). Twenty patients aged 80 ± 7 years were assessed at baseline and a median of 60 days post transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), with pulsatile vascular load calculated using simultaneous radial applanation tonometry derived aortic pressure and cardiac magnetic resonance phase-contrast imaging derived ascending aortic flow. Eight out of 20 patients had a reduction in PEC post TAVR, and the reduction of PEC correlated strongly with the number of days post TAVR (R = 0.62, P &lt; 0.01). Patients assessed within the 100 days of TAVR had a rise in their PEC when compared to baseline (0.19 ± 0.09 vs 0.14 ± 0.08 W, P = 0.04). Baseline PEC correlated moderately with baseline SEC (R = 0.49, P = 0.03), and a high baseline PEC was predictive of post TAVR PEC reduction (R = 0.54, P =0.01). Overall, no significant differences were found between baseline and post TAVR for systolic aortic pressure (131 ± 20 vs 131 ± 20 mmHg), systemic vascular resistance (1894 ± 493 vs 2015 ± 519 dynes.s/cm5), aortic valve ejection time (337 ± 22 vs 324 ± 34 ms) or aortic characteristic impedance (120 ± 48 vs 107 ± 41 dynes.s/cm5). Improved flow profiles after TAVR likely unmask the true vascular properties by altering ventriculo-valvulo-arterial coupling, leading to downstream vascular remodelling secondary to flow conditioning, and results in eventual improvement of pulsatile afterload as reflected by our proposed index of CAPE.
