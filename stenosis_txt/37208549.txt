Title: Interventional Bronchoscopy in Children: The Way Forward.

Abstract: Bronchoscopy in children has been utilized primarily to diagnose airway anomalies and obtain bronchoalveolar lavage. Gradual development of thinner bronchoscopes and instruments has opened the gates to the world of bronchoscopic interventions in children. Endobronchial ultrasound guided mediastinal aspiration has been used in adults and children. In younger children, esophageal approach has also been used for sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes. Lung biopsies using cryoprobe have been increasingly used in children. Other bronchoscopic interventions discussed include dilatation of tracheobronchial stenosis, airway stenting, foreign body removal, hemoptysis control, re-expansion of atelectasis etc. Patient safety during the procedure is of paramount importance. Expertise and availability of equipment to handle complications is of huge significance.
