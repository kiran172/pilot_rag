Title: Identification of risk factors associated with numerous reoperations following primary hypospadias repair.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Complications remain the top evaluation priority subsequent to hypospadias repair. Complications vary in further management, and usually require one or more reoperations. Patients and/or their parents concern not only with the success rate of reoperation, but also with the risk of numerous reoperations.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors associated with numerous reoperations following primary hypospadias repair.
STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected retrospectively from patients who underwent reoperations for complications following primary hypospadias repair at a single institution from August 2008 to October 2017.
RESULTS: A total of 507 patients required reoperations following 2754 primary hypospadias repairs. Eventually, 486 patients were eligibly included with a median age of 2.2 years. The median follow-up period was 6.5 years. Preserved urethral plate urethroplasty for primary repair (including Snodgrass, Onlay and Mathieu techniques) was performed in 307 (63.2%) patients, Duckett technique was performed in 121 (24.9%) patients, and staged urethroplasty (including staged Duckett, Byars and Bracka techniques) was performed in 58 (11.9%) patients. The complications included 302 fistulas, 108 dehiscence, 50 urethral strictures, 18 meatal stenosis, 38 diverticula, 24 mild recurrent ventral curvature and 23 severe recurrent ventral curvature. A total of 363 (74.7%) patients needed 1 reoperation, 87 (17.9%) needed 2 reoperations, 19 (3.9%) needed 3 reoperations, and 17 (3.5%) needed >3 reoperations. Ordinal logistic regression demonstrated that severe recurrent ventral curvature, urethral stricture, dehiscence and primary staged hypospadias repair increased the risk of numerous reoperations, with odds ratios of 75.991-fold, 36.967-fold, 11.765-fold and 3.074-fold, respectively. In contrast, diverticulum decreased the risk, with an odds ratio of 0.443-fold.
DISCUSSION: Our data demonstrated significant heterogeneity in the risk of numerous reoperations for each complication. Severe recurrent ventral curvature conferred the highest risk of numerous reoperations, followed by urethral stricture, dehiscence. In additional, our data showed an increased risk of numerous reoperations following primary staged repairs. Identification the risk factors confers advantages in the assessment of postoperative outcomes and anticipation of future reoperations.
CONCLUSION: Severe recurrent ventral curvature, urethral stricture, dehiscence and primary staged hypospadias repair were associated with numerous reoperations following primary hypospadias repair.
