Title: Apolipoprotein L Domain Containing 1 Inhibits Tissue Factor to Impede Thrombus Formation in a Rat Model of Deep Vein Thrombosis via Activating PI3K/Akt Pathway.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is one of the major health problems worldwide. Apolipoprotein L domain containing 1 (APOLD1) was reported to be downregulated in DVT. The present study intended to investigate whether APOLD1 affects thrombus formation in a rat model of DVT.
METHODS: The rat model of DVT was established by inferior vena cava (IVC) stenosis. At 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr after IVC stenosis, the gross IVC with thrombus was dissected and observed. Then, the rats were preinjected with the lentiviral overexpression vector, APOLD1-LVs, 1 hr before IVC stenosis, to evaluate the influence of APOLD1 on thrombosis in rats. The serum levels of D-dimer and TAT as well as the content of TF in IVC tissues were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: IVC stenosis resulted in thrombus formation in rats, increased serum levels of D-dimer and TAT, and decreased APOLD1 expression. APOLD1 overexpression inhibited in vivo thrombosis, reduced serum levels of D-dimer, and downregulated tissue factor (TF) activity and level. APOLD1 overexpression also increased p-PI3K and p-Akt protein levels.
CONCLUSIONS: APOLD1 suppresses thrombus formation in a rat model of DVT via downregulating TF expression by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway.
