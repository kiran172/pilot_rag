Title: Possible technical aspects involved in the development of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy: Surgical technique considerations.

Abstract: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most common bariatric surgery worldwide and has shown to cause de novo or worsen symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Esophageal motility and physiology studies are mandatory in bariatric and foregut centers. The predisposing factors in post-SG patients are disruption of His angle, resection of gastric fold and gastric fundus, increased gastric pressure, resection of the gastric antrum, cutting of the sling fibers and pyloric spasm. There are symptomatic complications due to sleeve morphology as torsion, incisura angularis stenosis, kinking and dilated fundus. In this article, we present recommendations, surgical technique and patient selection flow diagram for SG and avoid de novo or worsening GERD.
