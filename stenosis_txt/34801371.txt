Title: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A retrospective cohort study from the largest tertiary care facility.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is the most common condition requiring surgery in infancy, but the etiology of IHPS is still unclear. The study aimed to analyze the epidemiological and clinical features of the infants with IHPS in our setting and determine the yearly trends in IHPS incidence in the Sarajevo Canton between 2007 and 2016.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed epidemiologic, clinical, and operative data of all infants undergoing pyloromyotomy for IHPS over ten years in the largest tertiary care facility in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
RESULTS: Fifty-three IHPS patients were diagnosed, yielding an overall incidence of 1.17 per 1000 live births (1.25 and 1.09 cases in 2007-2011 and 2012-2016, respectively). IHPS was more prevalent among male infants (ratio 6.6:1, p < 0.001). The mean age at onset of symptoms was 39.6 days (range, 17-107 days). The estimated median time from symptoms onset to hospitalization was 11 days (range, 1-17 days). The mean age at diagnosis was significantly longer in premature infants compared with term infants (p = 0.003). Both first-born rank and bottle-feeding were significantly associated with IHPS (p = 0.001 and p = 0.04, respectively). No seasonal variation associated with IHPS was detected (p = 0.25). No evidence was found of differences in the incidence of IHPS related to maternal age (p = 0.24) and smoking (p = 0.59).
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate a declining trend and provide insights into the clinical characteristics of IHPS in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most of the obtained results are in line with the published data and could improve the quality of local pediatric services.
