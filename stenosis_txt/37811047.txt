Title: Results of laminoplasty versus laminectomy and posterior fusion for multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The authors compared the clinical, MR, and clinical outcomes for patients with multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM) who underwent laminoplasty (LP) versus laminectomy with fusion (LPSF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors evaluated 65 patients with MCSM (2019-2021) with 31 undergoing LP versus 34 having LPSF. Variables studied included JOA scores, T2W MR hyperintense cord signals, preoperative lordosis, number of stenotic levels, and neurological outcomes.
RESULTS: Both groups showed similar preoperative JOA scores, number of stenotic levels, T2-weighted MR hyperintense cord signals, and nearly identifcal 12-month postoperative outcomes (good for 83.9 in the LP group vs. 85.3% in the LPSF group). Differences included: higher preoperative visual analog scale in the LPSF versus LP group, plus the LPSF patients significantly less preoperative cervical lordosis versus LP patients.
CONCLUSION: LP and LPSF used to treat MCSM resulted in similar clinical improvement and 1-year postoperative outcomes. However, our recommendation would be for patients with neck pain, instability, and/or cervical kyphosis to undergo LPSF.
