Title: Upper endoscopy after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: diagnostic yield and factors associated with relevant findings.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: After laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass many patients present with complaints for which an upper endoscopy is performed. However, often no abnormalities are found.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of relevant findings at upper endoscopy and identify patient characteristics associated with a relevant finding.
SETTING: A high-volume bariatric center.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed. All patients presenting with complaints after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who consequently underwent a diagnostic upper endoscopy were identified from a prospective endoscopic database. Primary outcomes were the number and type of relevant findings at upper endoscopy and its association with patient characteristics. Relevant findings were defined as abnormalities requiring treatment.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight (39.2%) of 250 patients had a relevant finding at upper endoscopy, mostly marginal ulcer and stomal stenosis. Male sex (odds ratio [OR] 3.47 [1.12-10.76]), alcohol consumption (OR 7.27 [1.58-33.36]), dysphagia or suspicion of bleeding as referral reason (OR 3.62 [1.54-8.52] and 39.93 [4.96-321.47], respectively, compared with abdominal pain), an abnormal upper gastrointestinal series (OR 6.81 [2.06-22.48]), and no abdominal ultrasound (OR 7.41 [1.48-37.08] compared with a normal ultrasound) were significantly associated with a relevant finding at upper endoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study sex, alcohol consumption, referral reason, and prior imaging studies were associated with a relevant finding at upper endoscopy after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
