Title: Tracheostomies in term and preterm infants: A single-center Canadian retrospective cohort.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine patient characteristics, hospital course, and medical outcomes of neonatal tracheostomy at a single center.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Edmonton, Canada.
PATIENTS: Infants admitted to NICU who underwent tracheostomy between January 2013 and December 2017 inclusive.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital course, discharge, and 3-year post-tracheostomy outcomes were compared between preterm infants <29 weeks gestation and infants with congenital anomalies.
RESULTS: Forty-three infants were identified; seven were lost to follow-up and excluded. Of the 36 analyzed, 86% survived to discharge. At discharge, 13% were decannulated, 36% required no mechanical ventilation, and 52% required mechanical ventilation. Median hospitalization was 295 days. At 3 years post-tracheostomy, 97% were alive. Proportions of infants with tracheostomy in situ was 80%, 73%, and 60% at 1, 2, and 3 years post tracheostomy. Tracheostomy incidence was 2.7% for preterm infants <29 weeks gestational age with 55% for subglottic stenosis. All preterm infants received postnatal steroids. Preterm infants underwent tracheostomy at later chronological age (123 vs. 81 days, p < 0.001), but similar corrected gestational age (42 + 5 vs. 51 + 2 weeks, p = 0.095). Preterm infants had more intubation attempts (17 vs. 4, p < 0.001), total extubations (8 vs. 2, p < 0.001), and days on ventilation before tracheostomy (100 vs. 78, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Infants who underwent tracheostomy in a Canadian public healthcare setting demonstrated decreasing tracheostomy dependence and high survival post tracheostomy, despite prolonged hospitalization. Preterm infants had more intubation and extubation events which may have contributed to airway injury.
