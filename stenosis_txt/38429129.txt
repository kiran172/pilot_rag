Title: Long-term Airway Outcomes and Interventions in Children With Oesophageal Atresia With Tracheoesophageal Fistula: A 20-year Single Centre Observational Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Airway anomalies, symptoms and interventions are commonly reported in children with oesophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula (OA/TOF). The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of these airway pathologies and those requiring interventions in the long-term.
METHODS: A retrospective case note review of all patients admitted to the Neonatal Unit at the Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow between January 2000 and December 2015 diagnosed with OA/TOF. Included patients had a minimum of 5 years follow-up.
RESULTS: 121 patients were identified. 118 proceeded to OA/TOF repair. 115 patients had long-term follow-up data. Ninety-five (83%) children had one or more airway symptom recorded. Thirty-six (31%) neonates underwent airway endoscopy at the time of their initial OA/TOF repair. Forty-six (40%) children underwent airway endoscopy at a later date due to airway symptoms. Airway pathologies identified included airway malacia, thirty-two (28%), subglottic stenosis, eleven (10%), tracheal pouch, twenty-five (22%), laryngeal cleft, seven (6%) and recurrent fistula, five (4%). Airway interventions included endoscopic division of tracheal pouch, ten (9%), tracheostomy, seven (6%), aortopexy, six (5%), repair of recurrent fistula, five (4%), endoscopic repair of laryngeal cleft, three (3%) and four (3%) required open airway reconstruction for subglottic stenosis. One child (1%) remains tracheostomy dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term airway pathologies are common in children with OA/TOF. Many of these are remediable with surgical intervention. Clinicians should be cognisant of this and refer to Airway Services appropriately.
