Title: Incidence and predictors of vascular complications following transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A comparison of the MANTA and suture-based vascular closure devices.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vascular complications post-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are common. Recent data regarding predictors of vascular complications are limited, particularly comparing newer plug-based devices versus traditional suture-based vascular closure devices (VCD).
AIM: The primary objective was to identify characteristics that predict a higher risk of vascular complications in TAVI patients, as judged by the VARC-3 criteria, specifically comparing risk factors between suture-based vs MANTA device closure.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent TAVI between December 2019 and September 2023 was performed. Logistic regression and propensity score matching was performed to ascertain risk factors for vascular complications post-TAVI.
RESULTS: Of the 1763 patients, there were 106 vascular complications (6%). There was a nonsignificant increased complication rate in MANTA vs suture-based device closure (8.3% vs 5.3%, p = 0.064). Among these, the most common complications were VCD failure (23%), pseudoaneurysm (20%) and arterial dissection (19%). Obesity (p = 0.021), anemia (p = 0.039) and MANTA device use (p = 0.027) were predictors of vascular complications. Within the MANTA cohort, novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) use was predictive of vascular complications (p = 0.002). Among suture-based devices, obesity (p = 0.037) and anaemia (p = 0.017) were significant predictors. A propensity matched analysis derived 90 pairs of patients matched for age, gender, diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, NOAC use, anemia and obesity, identifying an average treatment effect of 0.039 (p = 0.04) when MANTA device closure was performed.
CONCLUSION: Vascular complications in TAVI remain common. Identifying predictors such as MANTA device closure, obesity, anemia, and baseline NOAC use will allow for improved risk stratification and appropriate VCD selection in patients undergoing TAVI.
