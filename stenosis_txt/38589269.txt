Title: Self-reported exercise activity influences the relationship between coronary computed tomography angiographic finding and mortality.

Abstract: AIM: Recent studies suggest that the application of exercise activity questionnaires, including the use of a single-item exercise question, can be additive to the prognostic efficacy of imaging findings. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic efficacy of exercise activity in patients undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed 9772 patients who underwent CCTA at a single center between 2007 and 2020. Patients were divided into 4 groups of physical activity as no exercise (n ​= ​1643, 17%), mild exercise (n ​= ​3156, 32%), moderate exercise (n ​= ​3542, 36%), and high exercise (n ​= ​1431,15%), based on a single-item self-reported questionnaire. Coronary stenosis was categorized as no (0%), non-obstructive (1-49%), borderline (50-69%), and obstructive (≥70%). During a median follow-up of 4.64 (IQR 1.53-7.89) years, 490 (7.6%) died. There was a stepwise inverse relationship between exercise activity and mortality (p ​< ​0.001). Compared with the high activity group, the no activity group had a 3-fold higher mortality risk (HR: 3.3, 95%CI (1.94-5.63), p ​< ​0.001) after adjustment for age, clinical risk factors, symptoms, and statin use. For any level of CCTA stenosis, mortality rates were inversely associated with the degree of patients' exercise activity. The risk of all-cause mortality was similar among the patients with obstructive stenosis with high exercise versus those with no coronary stenosis but no exercise activity (p ​= ​0.912).
CONCLUSION: Physical activity as assessed by a single-item self-reported questionnaire is a strong stepwise inverse predictor of mortality risk among patients undergoing CCTA.
