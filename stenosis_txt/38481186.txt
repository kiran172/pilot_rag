Title: Total intracorporeal laparoscopic ileal ureter replacement in a single position for ureteral stricture based on membrane anatomy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to present our initial experience and prove the feasibility of total intracorporeal laparoscopic ileal ureter replacement (TILIUR) in a single position for ureteral stricture based on membrane anatomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2021 and April 2023, six patients underwent TILIUR in a single position for ureteral strictures based on membrane anatomy. All patients with a past medical history underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection as well as extensive ureteral stricture due to radiotherapy. The procedure is performed completely laparoscopically. Dissection of the digestive system as well as ureteral stricture or renal pelvis is based on membrane anatomy. The surgery is performed in a single position.
RESULTS: TILIUR in a single position for ureteral stricture based on membrane anatomy was successfully performed without open conversion in all patients. Among the 6 patients, 3 patients underwent combined ileal ureter replacement (IUR) and abdominal wall ostomy, 2 underwent unilateral IUR, and 1 underwent bilateral IUR. The mean length of the ileal substitution was 22.83 cm (range: 15-28). The average operative time was 458 ± 72.77 min (range 385-575 min), and the average intraoperative blood loss was 158 mL (range 50-400 mL). The median postoperative hospital stay was 15.1 d (range: 8-32). The median duration of postoperative follow-up was 15 months (range: 3-29 months). The success rate was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: TILIUR in a single position may be a promising option for ureteral stricture based on membrane anatomy in selected patients. Moreover, it has a positive effect on patients with renal insufficiency and urinary incontinence. Although IUR is difficult and risky, proficient surgeons can perform the procedure safely and effectively.
