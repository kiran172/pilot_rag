Title: Clinical effect of home enteral tube feeding supplementation on nutritional status after esophagectomy with retrosternal gastric tube reconstruction.

Abstract: Body weight loss and poor nutritional status are frequently observed after esophageal cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to pilot an investigation on the impact of home enteral tube feeding supplementation (HES) for up to 3 months after esophageal cancer surgery. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive 67 esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. We started HES from April 2017. The patients were divided into 2 groups. Among 67 patients, 40 patients underwent HES between April 2017 and November 2020 (HES group). Other 27 patients who underwent esophagectomy between January 2012 and March 2017 were not administered HES (C group). Thereafter, multiple factors concerning patient nutritional status at long-term follow-up were evaluated. The baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. There were no significant differences in nutritional status scores before esophagectomy. The percentage weight loss was less in the HES group compared with the C group both at 3 months and 1 year after surgery: 7.3% (-7.6 to 15.2), 7.7% (-4 to 13.9) in the HES group and 10.6% (-3.6 to 29.1), 10.8% (-5.8 to 20.0) in C group (P < 0.05, P < 0.05). In the patients with anastomotic stenosis, the percentage weight loss was less in the HES group compared with the C group: 7.2% (2.0-14.9) and 14.6% (6.2-29.1), P < 0.05. HES may improve early weight loss in postesophagectomy patients.
