Title: Carotid lesion length independently predicts stroke and death after transcarotid artery revascularization and transfemoral carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Prior data from the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial suggested that the higher perioperative stroke or death event rate among patients treated with transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TFCAS) appears to be strongly related to the lesion length. Nonetheless, data regarding the impact of lesion length on outcomes of transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) with flow reversal are lacking. Herein, we aimed to compare the outcomes of TCAR vs TFCAS stratified by the length of the carotid lesion.
METHODS: Our cohort was derived from the Vascular Quality Initiative database for carotid artery stenting between 2016 and 2021. Restricted cubic spline analysis was used to describe the relationship between the primary outcome (in-hospital stroke/death) and the exposure variable (lesion length) in the overall cohort. This relationship was not linear, and knots were identified where significant changes in the slope of the curve occurred. We therefore divided patients based on knot with the most significant inflection into two groups: lesion length <25 mm (short) and lesion length ≥25 mm. Clinically relevant and statistically significant variables on univariable analysis were added to the final logistic regression model clustered by center identifier to study the association between lesion length and in-hospital outcomes stratified by the stent approach.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 17,931 TCAR (52.6% with long lesions) and 12,036 TFCAS (53.2% with long lesions) patients. Patients with long lesions had higher rates of being symptomatic among both TCAR (27.2% vs 24.3%, P < .001) and TFCAS (43.5% vs 38.5%, P < .001) and were more likely to undergo general anesthesia in TCAR (84.7% vs 81.9%, P < .001) and TFCAS (21.6% vs 15.8%, P < .001). After adjusting for potential confounders, long carotid lesions were associated with higher odds of stroke, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), and stroke/death compared with short lesions among patients who underwent TCAR or TFCAS. However, when comparing TCAR vs TFCAS outcomes in patients with long lesions, TCAR was found to be associated with a 30% reduction in stroke/TIA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6-0.9, P = .015), stroke (aOR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9, P = .009), and extended length of stay (ELOS) (aOR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8, P < .001). There was also a 40% reduction in the odds of in-hospital stroke/death (aOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5-0.8, P < .001) and a 70% reduction in mortality (aOR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2-0.4, P < .001) in TCAR compared with TFCAS.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large contemporary retrospective national study, carotid lesion length appears to negatively impact in-hospital outcomes for TCAR and TFCAS. In the presence of lesions longer than 25 mm, TCAR appears to be safer than TFCAS with regard to the risk of in-hospital stroke, stroke/TIA, death, stroke/death, and ELOS. These favorable outcomes seem to confirm the relative advantage of flow reversal compared with distal embolic protection devices in terms of neuroprotection.
