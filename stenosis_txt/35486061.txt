Title: Long-term Follow up after Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Lower Risk Patients Using the Balloon-Expandable Bioprosthesis: Gender-Dependent Outcomes.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Long-term data on gender-related outcomes after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) using newer generations heart valves in lower-risk patients are sparse. We aimed to evaluate gender-dependent long-term outcomes after TF-TAVI in lower-risk patients using the third-generation balloon expandable bioprosthesis.
METHODS: Data of 103 patients undergoing TF-TAVI using the third-generation balloon expandable bioprosthesis were analyzed. We conducted up to six years follow up and performed comparison on gender basis: men (45 patients; 82 ± 4.7 years; STS Score 3.7 ± 1.6%) vs. women (58 patients; 83.2 ± 4.5 years; STS Score 3.6 ± 1.8%). The mean follow-up time was 30 months.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular risk factors at baseline were similar, without significant differences between men and women. The 30-day mortality was 4.4% in men vs. 3.4% in women (P = 0.745). The 30-day stroke was 4.4% in men vs. 1.7% in women (P = 0.582). The major vascular injury rate and the pacemaker rate was 2.3% vs. 10.7% (P = 0.134) and 19.5% vs. 18.9% (P = 1) in men vs. women, respectively. There was a significant difference of mean long-term survival: men, 42.1 months [95%CI: 33.154-51.101] vs. women, 57.3 months [95%CI: 50.618-64.159], P = 0.015.
CONCLUSION: Although considerably more prone to procedural complications, women had a significantly long-term survival benefit after TF-TAVI in lower-risk patients despite similar baseline characteristics.
