Title: Incidental Moyamoya Disease in an Elderly Patient Presenting With Acute Ischemic Pontine Stroke.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare occlusive cerebrovascular disease that is characterized by progressive stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and its main branches with compensatory development of dilated and fragile collateral vasculature at the base of the brain. MMD has a bimodal age distribution commonly affecting children and adults, whereas onset in the elderly population is a rare occurrence. Here, we present a case of a 78-year-old patient of Indonesian descent who was incidentally found to have moyamoya arteriopathy after presenting with acute ischemic stroke in the left pons. The patient underwent diagnostic cerebral angiogram that showed right middle cerebral artery stenosis with pathognomonic collateral moyamoya vessels. The patient was discharged on antiplatelet therapy. We report a rare case of an elderly patient with MMD. The role of medical or surgical management in asymptomatic MMD in elderly patients remains largely unknown.
