Title: Congenital Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis in a Preterm Dizygotic Female Twin Infant: Case Report.

Abstract: Infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are usually diagnosed at about 3 to 8 weeks of age. The clinical onset of symptoms in preterm babies is observed normally at a later age than in term or post-term newborns. This report describes a rare case of a 2-day old preterm twin girl presenting with drinking laziness and recurrent vomiting. Five days after the beginning of symptoms and after several studies, including an upper gastrointestinal contrast study, the diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis was made and confirmed at surgery. The postoperative course was uneventful. Interestingly, the mother of the child herself had a history of postnatal surgery on her fifth day of life due to congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. To our best knowledge, this is the first report in the literature describing congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in a mother and her child.
