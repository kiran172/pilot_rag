Title: Supra-Aortic Vessel Stenting to Stabilize an Embolized Acurate NEOTranscatheter Heart Valve: The Chandelier Technique.

Abstract: THV aortic embolization can be managed percutaneously by snaring the prosthesis in a stable position in ascending aorta. We report two cases of embolized Acurate NEO with extreme mobility of devices in ascending aorta in which a bailout supra-aortic trunk stenting with consistent aortic protrusion were performed stabilizing the devices.
