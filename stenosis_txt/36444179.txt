Title: Late Transcatheter Aortic Valve Thrombosis Leading to Cardiogenic Shock.

Abstract: A 67-year-old woman with prior transcatheter aortic valve replacement presented with worsening dyspnea. Imaging revealed transcatheter aortic valve thrombosis and aortic stenosis. Despite oral anticoagulation, she progressively deteriorated and developed cardiogenic shock. We highlight the Heart Team's role in treating this unusual late thrombosis.
