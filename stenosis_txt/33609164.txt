Title: Solid Swallow Examination During High Resolution Manometry and EGJ-Distensibility Help Identify Esophageal Outflow Obstruction in Non-obstructive Dysphagia.

Abstract: Single water swallow (SWS) high-resolution manometry (HRM) may miss relevant esophageal motility disorders. Solid test meal (STM) during HRM and lately the functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) have been shown to be of diagnostic value in the assessment of motility disorders. We aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of STM and FLIP in non-obstructive dysphagia (NOD). Patients assessed for dysphagia with both HRM and FLIP between April 2016 and August 2019 were analyzed for signs of non-obstructive EGJ outflow obstruction (EGJOO) according to Chicago Classification 3.0 (CCv3) and CC adapted for the use with solid swallows (CC-S), followed by an individual group-specific analysis. Five subjects without dysphagia served as control group. Standard HRM- and FLIP-values as well as esophagograms and Eckardt Scores were analyzed. Forty-two patients were identified (male/female, 14/36, median age 62). Twenty-five (59.5%) were diagnosed with EGJOO during STM only (= SWS-negative patients; CC-S). The EGJ distensibility index (EGJ-DI) of symptomatic patients was significantly lower compared to the control group (p = 0.006). EGJ-DI was &lt; 3mm2/mmHg in 67% and 88% of patients diagnosed according to CC-S and CCv3, respectively. The IRP during STM showed a significant association to the corresponding EGJ-DI values (p &lt; 0.001). Seventy-six percent of patients received treatment because of additional STM evaluation with a favorable clinical response rate of 89%. STM and FLIP identify EGJOO in symptomatic patients with normal SWS during HRM. STM resembles an inexpensive and clinically meaningful option to diagnose motility disorders and helps to select patients for interventional treatment.
