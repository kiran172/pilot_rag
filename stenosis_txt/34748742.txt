Title: Predicting Factors of Protracted Intestinal Failure in Children with Gastroschisis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To identify prenatal and neonatal predictors of short bowel syndrome-related intestinal failure (SBS-IF) in gastroschisis.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study included all patients with gastroschisis born between 2000 and 2017 who were enrolled in our home parenteral nutrition program, and all patients with gastroschisis born in our institution who survived 2 weeks, during the same time period. Prenatal ultrasound features, neonatal status, anatomic features, oral feeding, and parenteral nutrition dependency were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 180 patients, 35 required long-term parenteral nutrition (SBS-IF group) and 145 acquired full oral feeding within 6 months (oral feeding group). The mean follow-up was 7.9 years (IQR, 1.6-17.5 years) and 5.0 years (IQR, 0.1-18.2 years), respectively. Both bowel matting (OR, 14.23; 1.07-16.7; P = .039) and secondarily diagnosed atresia or stenosis (OR, 17.78; 3.13-100.98; P = .001) were independent postnatal predictors of SBS-IF. Eighteen children (51% of the SBS-IF group) were still dependent on artificial nutrition at the last follow-up. patients with SBS-IF who achieved full oral feeding had a median residual small-bowel length of 74 cm (IQR, 51-160 cm) vs 44 cm (IQR, 10-105 cm) for those still dependent on artificial nutrition (P = .02). An initial residual small bowel length of more than 50 cm was the best predictive cut-off for nutritional autonomy, with a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Bowel matting, complex gastroschisis, and secondary intestinal obstruction were associated with SBS-IF in gastroschisis. For patients with SBS-IF, a small bowel length of more than 50 cm was predictive of secondary nutritional autonomy.
