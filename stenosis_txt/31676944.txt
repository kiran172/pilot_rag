Title: Evaluation of computed tomography myocardial perfusion in women with angina and no obstructive coronary artery disease.

Abstract: Women with angina and no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) have worse cardiovascular prognosis than asymptomatic women. Limitation in myocardial perfusion caused by coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is one of the proposed mechanisms contributing to the adverse prognosis. The aim of this study was to assess myocardial perfusion in symptomatic women with no obstructive CAD suspected for CMD compared with asymptomatic sex-matched controls using static CT perfusion (CTP). We performed a semi-quantitative assessment of the left ventricular myocardial perfusion and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR), using static CTP with adenosine provocation, in 105 female patients with angina and no obstructive CAD (< 50% stenosis) and 33 sex-matched controls without a history of angina or ischemic heart disease.  Patients were on average 4 years older (p = 0.04) and had a higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors. While global perfusion during rest was comparable between the groups (age-adjusted p = 0.12), global perfusion during hyperemia was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls (163 ± 23 HU vs. 171 ± 25 HU; age-adjusted p = 0.023). The ability to increase myocardial perfusion during adenosine-induced vasodilation was significantly diminished in patients (MPR 148% vs. 158%; age-adjusted p < 0.001). This remained unchanged after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (p = 0.008). Women with angina and no obstructive CAD have reduced hyperemic myocardial perfusion and MPR compared with sex-matched controls. Impaired myocardial perfusion may be related to the presence of CMD in some of these women.
