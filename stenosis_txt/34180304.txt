Title: Early outcomes of novel Temren atherectomy device combined with drug-coated balloon angioplasty for treatment of femoropopliteal lesions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In this study, perioperative properties and early outcomes of patients who underwent combined Temren rotational atherectomy (RA) and drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty treatment for complex femoropopliteal lesions in a single center were reported.
METHODS: Between June 2019 and February 2020, 40 patients who underwent combined Temren RA and DCB treatment due to critical lower limb ischemia or claudication-limiting daily living activities were retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 73.2 ± 7.8 years and the majority of the patients were male (65%). Of the patients, 17 had critical limb ischemia and 23 had lifestyle-limiting claudication. Pathologies were total occlusion in 33 limbs and critical stenosis in seven limbs. Nine patients previously underwent endovascular intervention or surgery. The mean total occlusion length was 140.9 ± 100.9 (range, 20-360) mm in patients with chronic total occlusion. There was an additional iliac artery pathology in 5 and below the knee pathology in 8 patients. Rotational atherectomy was possible in all cases. Flow-limiting dissection was seen in six patients (15%). Provisional stent was performed to these patients. Following Temren RA, all patients underwent DCB. Adequate vascular lumen (less than 30% stenosis) was provided in all patients and the symptoms regressed. No distal embolization was encountered. Access site complications (17.5%) were small hematoma in four patients, ecchymosis in two patients, and pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery in one patient. The mean follow-up was 13.55 ± 4.2 (range, 1-18) months. Re-occlusion was seen in three patients (7.5%) (n = 2 at 2 months and n = 1 at 4 months). Of these patients, two had required open revascularization via femoropopliteal bypass graft with common, superficial femoral, and popliteal artery endarterectomy and one had required femoro-posterior tibial artery bypass. Four minor toe amputations (10%) were performed to reach complete wound healing in the critical limb ischemia patients. A below-knee amputation was performed in a 94-year-old patient with long segment stenosis at the end of a 1-month follow-up period. There was no mortality after follow-ups. The Kaplan-Meier estimator estimated the rate of freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) which was 92.3%. The decrease in the Rutherford levels after the procedure was found to be statistically significant in 36 patients (p &lt; 0.001). The increase in the ankle-brachial index after the procedure was found to be statistically significant in 36 patients (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Combined use of Temren RA with adjunctive DCB is safe and effective method with high rates of primary patency and freedom from TLR and low rates of complication in the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions.
