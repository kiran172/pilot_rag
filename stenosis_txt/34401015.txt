Title: Duodenal stenosis after transcatheter arterial embolization for rupture of an inferior pancreaticoduodenal aneurysm.

Abstract: A 64-year-old man presented with epigastric pain and underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Ruptured aneurysm of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery was diagnosed. TAE was successfully accomplished using coils, but vomiting appeared 9 days later. Duodenal stenosis was diagnosed from contrast-enhanced computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and was attributed to edematous changes in the duodenum. Conservative management led to successful recovery and discharge.
