Title: Left Ventricular Remodeling in Patients with Low Flow Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Low-flow (LF) aortic stenosis (AS) is common among older adults and associated with worse outcomes than AS with normal stroke volume. It is unknown whether left ventricular (LV) remodeling identifies patients with LF AS at higher risk of complications. LV remodeling was evaluated in 463 patients with severe LF AS referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and classified as adaptive (normal geometry and concentric remodeling) or maladaptive (concentric and eccentric hypertrophy) using the American Society of Echocardiography gender-specific criteria. Of these, the 390 patients who underwent TAVR were followed for the end points of heart failure (HF) hospitalization and all-cause mortality. The mean patient age was 79 (74.5 to 84) years. LV remodeling was adaptive in 57.4% (62 normal geometry, 162 concentric remodeling) and maladaptive in 42.6% (127 concentric hypertrophy, 39 eccentric hypertrophy). During a median follow-up of 3 years, 45 patients (11.5%) were hospitalized for HF and 73 (18.7%) died. After adjustment for widely used echocardiographic parameters, maladaptive remodeling was independently associated with HF hospitalization and death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.75, confidence interval 1.03 to 3.00). There was no significant difference between men and women in the association of maladaptive LV remodeling with the composite outcome (p = 0.40 for men and p = 0.06 for women). In conclusion, in patients with LF AS, maladaptive LV remodeling before TAVR is independently associated with higher incidences of postprocedural HF rehospitalization and death in both men and women. Assessment of LV remodeling has prognostic value over and above LV ejection fraction and may improve risk stratification for patients with LF AS.
