Title: Impact of Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 (VARC-3) minor access site vascular complications in patients undergoing percutaneous transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 minor access site vascular complications (VCs) in patients who underwent percutaneous transfemoral (TF) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: This single-centre retrospective study included consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous TF-TAVI from 2009 to 2021. A propensity score-matched analysis was performed to compare early and long-term clinical results between patients with VC and without VC (nVC).
RESULTS: A total of 2161 patients were included, of whom 284 (13.1%) experienced access site VC. Propensity score analysis allowed to match 270 patients from the VC group with 727 patients from the nVC group. In the matched cohorts, the VC group showed longer operative times (63.5 vs 50.0 min, P < 0.001), higher operative and in-hospital mortality (2.6% vs 0.7%, P = 0.022; and 6.3% vs 3.2%, P = 0.040, respectively), longer hospital length of stay (8 vs 7 days, P = 0.001) and higher rates of blood transfusion (20.4% vs 4.3%, P < 0.001) and infectious complications (8.9% vs 3.8%, P = 0.003). Overall survival during follow-up was significantly lower in the VC group (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.03-1.82, P = 0.031) with 5-year survival rates being 58.0% (95% CI 49.5-68.0%) and 70.7% (95% CI 66.2-75.5%) for the VC and nVC groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study observed that minor access site VCs during percutaneous TF-TAVI can be serious events affecting early and long-term outcomes.
