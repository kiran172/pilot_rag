Title: Impaired autonomic function after incomplete revascularisation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Incomplete cardiac revascularisation (ICR) assessed by residual SYNTAX score (rSs) is associated with increased 5-year mortality. Furthermore, in the general population, our group has demonstrated that impaired autonomic function determined by heart rate recovery time between 10 and 20 s (HRR<sub>10-20</sub>) following an active stand is associated with increased all-cause mortality.
PURPOSE: We hypothesised that ICR would be associated with impaired autonomic function determined by HRR<sub>10-20</sub>.
METHODS: After ethical approval and informed consent, consecutive patients attending cardiac rehabilitation in a tertiary referral centre were enrolled. All patients had percutaneous coronary revascularisation. During an active stand, real-time heart rate, blood pressure and ECG recordings were taken using non-invasive digital photoplethysmography and HRR<sub>10-20</sub> determined. Assessment of autonomic function was performed by determining speed of HRR<sub>10-20</sub> post-orthostatic challenge.Patients with an rSs &gt;0 were considered incompletely revascularised and those with an rSs of 0 fully revascularised. Demographic data were recorded and statistical analysis performed.
RESULTS: Patients (n=53) comprised those with complete revascularisation (CR) (n=37) and ICR (n=16). In the ICR group, mean rSs was 9.4.HRR<sub>10-20</sub> was impaired in the ICR group (-3±0.60) compared with the CR cohort (-6.56±0.52) (p&lt;0.0001). Completeness of revascularisation was strongly associated with HRR<sub>10-20</sub> (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.529; p&lt;0.0001). Baseline demographics did not differ significantly. Use of rate-limiting medication was similar between cohorts (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ivabradine).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm significant correlation between ICR and impaired autonomic function determined by speed of heart rate recovery. Thus, determining autonomic dysfunction post-ICR may identify those at increased mortality risk.
