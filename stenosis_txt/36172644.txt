Title: Creation of an arteriovenous graft for hemodialysis using a previously placed stent graft: A case report.

Abstract: Successful hemodialysis (HD) treatment depends on well-functioning arteriovenous access. Thrombosis and stenosis are the main causes of access failure. The current report describes the successful establishment of an arteriovenous graft for HD using a previously placed stent graft in an HD patient who developed multiple episodes of access stenosis and thrombosis.
