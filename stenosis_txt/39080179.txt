Title: Prepyloric gastric antral muscular ring in an infant.

Abstract: We present a unique case of a prepyloric gastric muscular ring, a pathology distinct from a gastric web. There is scarcity of literature on this topic, nearly all cases of prepyloric antral rings or webs published in literature are mucosal or submucosal in nature with no evidence of muscle hypertrophy. Given the prevalence of pyloric stenosis as the most common gastric outlet malformation in neonates, gastric rings and webs are not readily considered in the differential diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction. While most cases of gastric outlet obstruction are diagnosed radiologically, less common pathologies will be confirmed with direct visual inspection during surgery. The term "congenital gastric outlet obstruction" has been used to encompass rare cases, making it appropriate to include a muscular ring in this category. We propose the term "gastric ring" be used with a semantic modifier of "muscular" versus "submucosal/mucosal" to avoid confusion.
