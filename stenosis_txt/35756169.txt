Title: Complex Vascular Reconstruction of an En Bloc Pediatric Kidney Damaged during Organ Procurement.

Abstract: En bloc pediatric kidney (EBPK) allografts are a potential solution to expand the organ donor pool; however, EBPK transplantation has been traditionally considered suboptimal due to concerns of perioperative vascular and urologic complications. Accidental organ or vasculature injury during harvest is not uncommon; however, this does not necessarily mean that the organ should be discarded. Careful vascular reconstruction can be performed using donor vascular grafts, salvaging the organ without stenosis or thrombosis of the vessels. We report an extensive vascular reconstruction of the right renal artery, aorta, and inferior vena cava of a damaged EBPK allograft using a donor pediatric aorta vascular patch with the goal of avoiding postoperative vascular complications.
