Title: Feasibility of intraoperative aortic root imaging in congenital heart surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intraoperative vascular imaging is a useful tool to evaluate coronary ostia in congenital heart patients with suboptimal preoperative imaging findings. Additionally, vascular imaging has potential value for visualization of the ascending aortic intima media thickness (IMT) in certain clinical scenarios. This study sought to evaluate the feasibility of intraoperative vascular imaging of coronary ostia and IMT during congenital heart surgery.
METHODS: We describe the technique for performance of intraoperative vascular imaging by a pediatric cardiologist using a high-resolution linear sequential array transducer.
RESULTS: Intraoperative vascular imaging was obtained on seven patients. Coronary ostia were normal in all except one. This patient had congenital stenosis of the left coronary ostium discovered during intraoperative imaging and confirmed by the surgeon. In another patient with Williams syndrome, the IMT was noted to be prominent.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to perform intraoperative vascular imaging in less than 5Â minutes of operator's time and provides superior visualization of the coronary ostia and IMT.
