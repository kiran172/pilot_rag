Title: A new cannula for antegrade selective cerebral perfusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to perform antegrade selective cerebral perfusion with a different surgical technique using a new type of cannula.
METHODS: This cannula has been designed to be introduced in the supra-aortic vessels directly using a standard guidewire technique (Seldinger technique). The cannula can also be inserted from the ostia of a vessel if preferred. Furthermore, this device can be introduced before the institution of hypothermic circulatory arrest and opening the aortic arch.
RESULTS: We have performed operations on 5 patients so far using this cannula. No stroke or spinal cord injuries were detected. At the moment, both intraoperatively and at computed tomography scan follow-up, no significant stenosis of the cannulation sites were noted. Follow-up at 2Â years found that patients are alive and free from new major neurological events.
CONCLUSIONS: Transarterial introduction using the Seldinger technique of our cannula (AV Flow; MedEurope Srl, Bologna, Italy) represents an alternative to the current well-established techniques. The major advantages we describe are complete cerebral protection throughout the hypothermic circulatory arrest and easier arch vessels reimplantation or hemiarch operations.
