Title: The effect of coronary calcification on diagnostic performance of machine learning-based CT-FFR: a Chinese multicenter study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of coronary calcification morphology and severity on the diagnostic performance of machine learning (ML)-based coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) with FFR as a reference standard.
METHODS: A total of 442 patients (61.2 ± 9.1 years, 70% men) with 544 vessels who underwent CCTA, ML-based CT-FFR, and invasive FFR from China multicenter CT-FFR study were enrolled. The effect of calcification arc, calcification remodeling index (CRI), and Agatston score (AS) on the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR was investigated. CT-FFR ≤ 0.80 and lumen reduction ≥ 50% determined by CCTA were identified as vessel-specific ischemia with invasive FFR as a reference standard.
RESULTS: Compared with invasive FFR, ML-based CT-FFR yielded an overall sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.94, and accuracy of 0.90 in a total of 344 calcification lesions. There was no statistical difference in diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity of CT-FFR across different calcification arc, CRI, or AS levels. CT-FFR exhibited improved discrimination of ischemia compared with CCTA alone in lesions with mild-to-moderate calcification (AUC, 0.89 vs. 0.69, p < 0.001) and lesions with CRI ≥ 1 (AUC, 0.89 vs. 0.71, p < 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy and specificity of CT-FFR were higher than CCTA alone in patients and vessels with mid (100 to 299) or high (≥ 300) AS.
CONCLUSION: Coronary calcification morphology and severity did not influence diagnostic performance of CT-FFR in ischemia detection, and CT-FFR showed marked improved discrimination of ischemia compared with CCTA alone in the setting of calcification.
KEY POINTS: • CT-FFR provides superior diagnostic performance than CCTA alone regardless of coronary calcification. • No significant differences in the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR were observed in coronary arteries with different coronary calcification arcs and calcified remodeling indexes. • No significant differences in the diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR were observed in coronary arteries with different coronary calcification score levels.
