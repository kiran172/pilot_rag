Title: Submucosal hemorrhage of the esophagus: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Submucosal hemorrhage of the esophagus is relatively rare and the course of this disease remains unclear. We report a case of this disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 68-year-old man who visited a clinic complaining of sudden-onset epigastric and back pain. He had been taking warfarin and a statin due to non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, right subclavian artery stenosis, and chronic atrial fibrillation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed esophageal submucosal hemorrhage. Detailed endoscopic examination was difficult because of the massive hemorrhage and progressive esophageal mucosal edema. He was transferred to our hospital due to progression of anemia. Fortunately, hemorrhagic anemia showed no progression with conservative fasting therapy after admission to our hospital. Esophageal mucosa over the submucosal hemorrhage detached and regenerative tissue was observed on endoscopic examination 1Â week later.
CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal submucosal hemorrhage should be included among the differential diagnoses for patients presenting with chest and back pain.
