Title: Multidisciplinary Approach to Indeterminate Biliary Strictures.

Abstract: Biliary strictures that remain unclassified after cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-based tissue sampling are defined as indeterminate biliary strictures (IDBS). A substantial proportion of biliary strictures fall into this category due to low sensitivity of brush cytology and intraductal biopsy. Over last few decades, several modalities have emerged for the evaluation of IDBS. Of these, cholangioscopy and endosonography are the frontrunners and have cemented their place for the evaluation of IDBS. Both of these modalities are widely available, and therefore, biliary strictures that remain uncharacterized after their utilization represent IDBS in the current era.
