Title: What Is the Impact of Liver Function to Predict Mortality in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis and Reduced Ejection Fraction?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Liver is one of the target organs in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and reduced ejection fraction. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of liver function reserve as assessed by albumin-bilirubin score on 30-day and 1-year mortality and rehospitalization at 1 year in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and reduced ejection fraction undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
METHODS: The patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and reduced ejection fraction who were hospitalized between 2013 and 2021 were included in this single-center retrospective study. Preoperative bilirubin and albumin levels were used for albumin-bilirubin score calculation as in the original report. The total primary outcomes were deﬁned as 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and hospitalization for decompensated heart failure within 1 year. Two groups were generated based on albumin-bilirubin score scores: high (>-2.25) and low (≤-2.25) albumin-bilirubin score groups.
RESULTS: A total of 77 patients (49 male) were included in the study. and 29 (37.7%) patients died within 1 year of follow-up with 17 corresponding to 30-day mortality. There was no diﬀerence between high and low albumin-bilirubin score groups in terms of length of hospital stay, postprocedural complications, and re-hospitalization within 1 year, while 30-day mortality (50.0% vs. 4.3%, P < 0.0001) and 1-year mortality (80.0% vs. 10.6%, P < 0.0001) were signiﬁcantly higher in the high albumin-bilirubin score group. Hence, total primary outcomes (86.7% vs. 44.7%, P < 0.0001) were signiﬁcantly higher in the high albumin-bilirubin score group.
CONCLUSION: High albumin-bilirubin score (> -2.25) was found as an independent risk factor associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality and total primary outcomes. The results of this study suggest that preprocedural assessment of the albumin-bilirubin score gives additional information to stratify of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis with reduced ejection fraction.
