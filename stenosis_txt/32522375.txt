Title: Evolution of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement | Review of Literature.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis is the most common primary valvular heart disease leading to either surgical or transcatheter valve replacement in the United States with its prevalence on the rise due to the elderly population. Over the recent years, the rise of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been exponential due to technologic developments and randomized control trials. In this review article, we aim to review current literature on transcatheter aortic valve replacements.
