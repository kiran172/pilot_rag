Title: Endovascular Treatment for Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis: 10 Years' Experience from a Single Center.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is a common post-renal transplant complication. Although endovascular treatment is widely used to treat TRAS, previous research has been limited by small sample sizes. This article aimed to present the clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment for TRAS in a large sample.
METHODS: Between January 2010 and December 2019, this study included patients with TRAS who were admitted to our center. All patients' clinical symptoms, comorbidities, imaging data, treatment, and follow-up results were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Seventy two patients participated in this study. The median time between renal transplantation and TRAS was 5.25 months. Out of 72 patients, 55 (76.4%) received balloon dilatation in conjunction with stent deployment, 10 (13.9%) received drug-coated balloon dilatation alone, and 7 (9.7%) received balloon dilatation alone. The median follow-up period was 27 months. Primary patency rates were 100%, 81.8%, 74.5%, 64.6%, and 61.8% at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. A total of 23 patients were found to have restenosis during follow-up, with 6 (26.1%) requiring reintervention and none remaining restenosis after the second treatment. In the subgroup analysis of the three types of stenosis, patients with transplant renal stenosis at the anastomosis had a significantly higher rate of primary patency. Between endovascular treatments, the primary patency rate, postoperative creatinine clearance, and mean systolic blood pressure did not differ significantly.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment resulted in favorable short-term patency as well as effective relief of renal dysfunction and renal hypertension in TRAS patients.
