Title: [Clinical application of complete laparoscopic gastrectomy with function preservation of cardia in gastric carcinoma].

Abstract: To investigate the feasibility and safety of total laparoscopic cardia function preserving gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma. Clinical data of 10 patients undergoing total laparoscopic cardia function preserving gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma from November 2020 to December 2021 were retrospectively collected. There were 7 males and 3 females. The mean age was (66.1±12.9) years (ranged from 38 to 86 years). All of the 10 patients were successfully performed total laparoscopic cardia function preserving gastrectomy without conversion to laparotomy. The time of digestive tract reconstruction was (24.8±3.3) min (20-30 min), and the intraoperative blood loss was (35±24) ml(20-100 ml). The time of postoperative exhaust was (2.5±0.9) days(2-3 d), the time of postoperative liquid diet was (2.25±0.87) days(2-3 d), postoperative hospital stay was (9.5±2.1) days(6-13 d). No surgical complications such as bleeding, anastomotic fistula or anastomotic stenosis occurred. Postoperative pathology showed that the proximal and distal margins of resected specimens were negative. Patients were followed up for 2 to 15 months, respectively. No death or tumor recurrence and metastasis occurred during the follow-up period. There were no symptoms of reflux after operation. Compared with total gastrectomy and proximal gastrectomy, total laparoscopic cardia function preserving gastrectomy can theoretically reduce the incidence of reflux esophagitis. We used manual suture method for digestive tract reconstruction, which can reduce the application of 2-3 stapling studs and reduce the cost of surgical materials. Compared with subtotal gastrectomy, total laparoscopic cardia function preserving gastrectomy has the advantages of more thorough lymph node dissection, with little residual gastric tissue; therefore, the blood supply is relatively better. The incidence of reflux esophagitis of total laparoscopic cardia function preserving gastrectomy for gastric cancer may was lower than total gastrectomy.
