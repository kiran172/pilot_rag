Title: Incidence, Current Guidelines and Management of Gastrointestinal Bleeding after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a significant increase in morbidity and mortality in patients complicated by major bleeding following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). It has become more challenging to manage such complications when the patient needs to be on anticoagulation or antiplatelet agent post-procedure to prevent thrombotic/embolic complications.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed all available randomized controlled trials and observational studies to identify incidence rates of gastrointestinal bleeding post-procedure. After performing a systematic search, a total of 8731 patients from 15 studies (5 RCTs and 10 non-RCTs) were included in this review.
RESULTS: The average rate of gastrointestinal bleeding during follow-up was 3.0% in randomized controlled trials and 1.9% among observational studies.
CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal bleeding has been noted to be higher in the RCTs as compared to observational studies. This review expands knowledge of current guidelines and possible management of patients undergoing TAVR.
