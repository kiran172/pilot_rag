Title: Asymptomatic Takayasu Arteritis With Critical Multivessel Stenosis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis is characterized by blood vessel inflammation involving the aorta and its branches. We describe a patient with Takayasu arteritis with severe multivessel involvement and classic physical examination findings but virtually no symptoms because of the presence of extensive collateral circulation seen on computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography imaging.
