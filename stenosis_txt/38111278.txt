Title: Nationwide Long-Term Growth and Developmental Outcomes of Infants for Congenital Anomalies in the Digestive System and Abdominal Wall Defects With Surgery in Korea.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Infants with congenital anomalies of the digestive system and abdominal wall defects requiring surgery are at risk of growth and developmental delays. The aim of this study was to analyze long-term growth and developmental outcomes for infants with congenital anomalies of the digestive system and abdominal wall defects who underwent surgery in Korea.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database for the years 2013-2019. Major congenital anomalies were defined according to the International Classification of Diseases-10 and surgery insurance claim codes. The χ² test and the Cochran-Armitage trend test were performed for data analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 4,574 infants with major congenital anomalies in the digestive system and abodminal wall defects, who had undergone surgey, were reviewed. Anorectal obstruction/stenosis was the most prevalent anomaly (4.9 per 10,000 live births). The prevalence of congenital anomalies of the digestive system was 15.5 per 10,000 live births, and that of abdominal wall defects was 1.5 per 10,000 live births. Seven percent of infants with congenital anomalies in the digestive system died, of which those with diaphragmatic hernia had the highest mortality rate (18.8%). Among 12,336 examinations at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months of age, 16.7% showed a weight below the 10th percentile, 15.8% had a height below the 10th percentile, and 13.2% had a head circumference below the 10th percentile. Abnormal developmental screening results were observed in 23.0% of infants. Infants with esophageal atresia with/without tracheoesophageal fistula most often had poor growth and development. Delayed development and cerebral palsy were observed in 490 (10.7%) and 130 (2.8%) infants respectively. Comparing the results of infants born in 2013 between their 24- and 72-month health examinations, the proportions of infants with poor height and head circumference growth increased by 6.5% and 5.3%, respectively, whereas those with poor weight growth and abnormal developmental results did not markedly change between the two examinations.
CONCLUSION: Infants with congenital anomalies of the digestive system and abdominal wall defects exhibit poor growth and developmental outcomes until 72 months of age. Close monitoring and careful consideration of their growth and development after discharge are required.
