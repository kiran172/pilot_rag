Title: An In-Vitro Study of the Flow Past a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Using Time-Resolved 3D Particle Tracking.

Abstract: The performance of a transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) can be evaluated by analyzing the flow field downstream of the valve. However, three dimensional flow and pressure fields, and particle residence time, a quantity closely related to thrombosis risk, are challenging to obtain. This experimental study aims to provide a comprehensive 3D measurement of the flow field downstream of an Edwards SAPIEN 3 using time-resolved 3D particle tracking velocimetry (3D PTV) with Shake-the-Box (STB) algorithm. The valve was deployed in an idealized aorta model and tested in a left heart simulator under physiological conditions. Detailed 3D vortical structures, pressure distributions, and particle residence time were obtained by analyzing the 3D particle tracks. Results have shown large-scale retrograde flow entering the sinuses of the TAV at systole, reducing flow stasis there. However, the 3D particle tracks reveal that the retrograde flow has a high residence time and might have already experienced high shear stress near the main jet. Thus by only focusing on the flow in the sinus region is not sufficient to evaluate the leaflet thrombosis risk, and the flow downstream of the valve should be taken into consideration. The unique perspectives offered by 3D PTV are important when evaluating the performance of the TAVs.
