Title: Combined Anticoagulation and Antiaggregation in Acute Cervical Artery Dissection.

Abstract: Cervical artery dissection (CAD) is a frequent cause of stroke in young adults. Previous studies investigating the efficiency of anticoagulation (AC) versus antiplatelet therapy (AT) found an insignificant difference. We therefore retrospectively evaluated a combination of AC plus AT in patients with acute CAD regarding safety and efficacy. Twenty-eight patients with CAD and minor neurological symptoms/no major infarction received either single (n = 14) or dual AT (n = 14) combined with AC. Angiographic follow-up during hospitalization, 4-8 weeks and 3-6 months after CAD focused on occlusion, residual stenosis, and functional recanalization. Possible adverse events were surveyed. We compared the AC plus AT group to 22 patients with acute CAD treated with AC or AT. Compared to preceding AC-/AT-only studies, AC plus single or dual AT resulted in more frequent, faster recanalization. Frequency and severity of adverse events was comparable. No major adverse events or death occurred. Preceding works on conservative treatment of CAD are discussed and compared to this study. Considerations are given to pathophysiology and the dynamic of CAD. Combining AC plus AT in CAD may result in more reliable recanalization in a shorter time. The risk for adverse events appears similar to treatment with only AC or AT.
