Title: Fully Covered Self-expandable Metallic Stents for Refractory Benign Pancreatic Duct Strictures: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic treatment of refractory pancreatic duct (PD) strictures includes the placement of multiple plastic stents. Recent studies have shown the benefit of fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS). This systematic review analyzes the efficacy and safety of FCSEMS in PD strictures.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of all suitable studies was conducted using the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus from inception to November 2022. The outcomes assessed were efficacy and safety of FCSEMS in PD strictures. Using a random-effects inverse-variance model, the pooled proportions were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 22 studies with 439 patients were included in the analysis. The pooled stricture resolution rate was 91.6% (95% CI: 87.4-95.7), while the pooled pain resolution rate was 84.9% (95% CI: 77.7-92.1). The pooled incidences of stent-related adverse events, including acute pancreatitis, pain requiring stent removal, and de novo stricture, were 3.9% (95% CI: 1.2-6.7), 0.8% (95% CI: 0.0-2.1), and 3.3% (95% CI: 0.7-5.8). The pooled incidence of stent migration, stricture recurrence, and the need for restenting were 12.9% (95% CI: 6.7-19.1), 9.3% (95% CI: 4.7-13.8), and 12.3% (95% CI: 6.9-17.8), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: FCSEMSs can be considered in carefully selected patients with benign PD strictures with high resolution rate and acceptable adverse event rate. De-novo structure formation appears to be a significant problem. Further studies may help to decide the role of FCSEMS in the algorithm.
