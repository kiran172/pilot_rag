Title: Coronary-to-coronary bypass grafting in aortoarteritis: a case report.

Abstract: Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is an idiopathic vasculitis affecting the aorta and its major branches. In TA, coronary artery involvement is rare and it mainly consists of stenosis or occlusion of the coronary ostia. In TA, as the arterial tree is diseased, often, arterial grafts are unsuitable for grafting so the saphenous vein grafts (SVG) are commonly used. We present a case of a young female with TA with an ostial left main stenosis who has undergone a right coronary-to-left anterior descending artery SVG and put on immunosuppression and steroids. She was asymptomatic with a patent graft during 7Â years follow-up.
