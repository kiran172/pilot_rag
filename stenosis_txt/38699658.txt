Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Improves Quality of Life and Ventricular Function With Low-Flow/Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: D2 aortic stenosis (AS) is the highest risk AS subtype with worse operative and mortality outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with classic (D2 subtype) low-flow/low-gradient AS who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: In total, 634 patients with severe AS underwent TAVR at our institution from 2014 to 2020, of whom 76 met criteria for classic D2 AS with reduced LVEF. Echocardiographic and clinical outcomes including mortality, stroke, pacemaker placement (PPM), and readmission at baseline were compared with those at 30 days and 1 year. QoL data were extracted from the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12).
RESULTS: The average baseline Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score for patients with D2 AS was 7.66 ± 6.76. Patients with D2 AS reported improved QoL post-TAVR. The average baseline KCCQ-12 score was 39.5 ± 20, with improvement to 68.9 ± 20.6 at 30 days (P &lt; .01) and 74.9 ± 17.5 at 1 year (P &lt; .01). Mortality was 0% at 30 days and 18.4% at 1 year. The average baseline LVEF was 36.1 ± 9.4. Left ventricular function improved to 43.5 ± 12.9 (P &lt;.001) at 30 days and 46.3 ± 11.2 (P = .03) at 1 year. Complications post-TAVR at 30 days included stroke (1.3%) and PPM (11.8%). Patients with D2 AS exhibited higher baseline conduction defects including atrial fibrillation and higher postoperative PPM than those with other subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with D2 AS had significantly improved LVEF and QoL following TAVR at 30 days and 1 year. Postoperative rates of new PPM were higher than other subtypes, while stroke, dialysis, and mortality were lower than expected, supporting the benefit of TAVR in this high-risk group.
