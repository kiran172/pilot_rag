Title: [Undistinguishable Cryptococcus-related granulomatous lesion from carcinoma in the tail of the pancreas: a case report].

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography revealed a 19Ã—13mm delayed enhancing mass and dilation of the distal pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed pancreatic duct stenosis in the tail of the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography revealed an abrupt interruption of the main pancreatic duct at the tail of the pancreas. We could not assess the distal side of the pancreatic stenosis due to the large extent of obstruction. The pancreatic head mass was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma using endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration biopsy. However, we could not determine whether the pancreatic duct stenosis in the tail of the pancreas was malignant. Nevertheless, we performed a total pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Histological examination showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the pancreatic head mass but the pancreatic duct stenosis in the tail of the pancreas was diagnosed as pancreatic granuloma caused by Cryptococcus. Fungal infections may reportedly promote the development of pancreatic cancer, as further suggested by this case of cryptococcal infection.
