Title: Surpass Intracranial Aneurysm Embolization System Pivotal Trial to Treat Large or Giant Wide-Neck Aneurysms - SCENT: 3-year outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To report the 3-year safety and effectiveness of the Surpass Streamline flow diverter in the SCENT trial (Surpass Intracranial Aneurysm Embolization System Pivotal Trial to Treat Large or Giant Wide-Neck Aneurysms).
METHODS: The Surpass Streamline flow diverter device was evaluated in a multicenter, prospective, single-arm, non-randomized interventional trial including patients with uncoilable or previously treated but failed aneurysms of the intracranial internal carotid artery. 3-year outcomes were tabulated with descriptive statistics and compared with 1-year outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 180 patients in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) cohort, 36-month clinical and angiographic follow-up was available in 134 and 117 cases, respectively. Effectiveness endpoint of complete aneurysm occlusion without clinically significant stenosis or retreatment was met in 71.8% (79/110, 95%â€‰CI 62.4% to 80.0%) of cases. Safety composite endpoint was 12.2% (22/180) over the 3-year period, with two major safety events (ipsilateral ischemic strokes) occurring between 12-36 months. Complete aneurysm occlusion was noted in 77.8% (91/117), and 99.1% (116/117) of the patients demonstrated adequate aneurysm occlusion (complete occlusion or neck residual). There were four cases (2.2%) of aneurysm rupture, all occurring within the first month of the index procedure. Target aneurysm retreatment rate was 2.8% (5/180).
CONCLUSION: The present findings support the long-term safety and effectiveness of the Surpass Streamline flow diverter device.
