Title: Comparison of left ventricular pacing performance among pre-shaped guidewires designed for transfemoral-approach transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: TAVI is an established therapy for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Rapid or control pacing is necessary for TAVI, and most centers are familiar with right ventricular (RV) pacing. Although there are several reports on the efficacy and safety of LV pacing, they are still few. In addition, LV pacing has not been studied for different LV guidewires. Our aim is to study the effectiveness of left ventricular (LV) pacing and the thresholds of LV guidewires in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We retrospectively analyzed 252 consecutive patients who underwent trans-femoral TAVI (TF-TAVI) with LV pacing in our institute between December 2017 and November 2020. We excluded 48 patients from the total cohort due to TAVI with RV pacing, and the remaining 204 patients were analyzed (52 males, mean age 85 ± 5 years). Among them, 202 patients (99.0%) had successful LV pacing. In the two patients with failed LV pacing, SAFARI2™ Small was used. The CONFIDA™ group (n = 34) showed a significantly lower threshold than the SAFARI2™ group (n = 163) (median 3.0 vs. 5.0 V; P = 1.1 × 10-7). LV pacing with Lunderquist® was successful in all patients (n = 7). LV pacing in TAVI was an effective and safe strategy. CONFIDA™ wire may be particularly well suited for LV pacing in TAVI.
