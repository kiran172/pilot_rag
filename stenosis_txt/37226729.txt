Title: Less Is More: Developments in Nanotechnology for Antirestenosis Therapies.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in vascular disease treatments, thrombosis and poor long-term vessel patency remain significant barriers to effective endovascular intervention. Current balloon angioplasty and stenting techniques effectively restore acute blood flow in occluded vessels but have persistent limitations. Damage to the arterial endothelium caused by injury during catheter tracking triggers neointimal hyperplasia and the release of proinflammatory factors leading to increased risk of thrombosis and restenosis. Antirestenotic agents commonly delivered on angioplasty balloons and stents have lowered arterial restenosis rates, but the absence of cell type selectivity significantly delays critical endothelium repair. Targeted delivery of biomolecular therapeutics, coupled with engineered nanoscale excipients, has the potential to redefine cardiovascular interventions by improving long-term efficacy, limiting off-target effects, and reducing costs compared with conventional clinical standards of care. This review analyzes current forms of localized vascular drug delivery, emerging nanoscale therapeutic and excipient strategies, and provides recommendations for future areas of study to advance the treatment of vascular disease through innovations in nanotechnology.
