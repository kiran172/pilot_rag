Title: Myocardial Tissue Characterization in Patients with Hypertensive Crisis, Positive Troponin, and Unobstructed Coronary Arteries: A Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance-Based Study.

Abstract: Hypertensive crisis can present with cardiac troponin elevation and unobstructed coronary arteries. We used cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to characterize the myocardial tissue in patients with hypertensive crisis, elevated cardiac troponin, and unobstructed coronary arteries. Patients with hypertensive crisis and elevated cardiac troponin with coronary artery stenosis &lt;50% were enrolled. Patients with troponin-negative hypertensive crisis served as controls. All participants underwent CMR imaging at 1.5 Tesla. Imaging biomarkers and tissue characteristics were compared between the groups. There were 19 patients (63% male) with elevated troponin and 24 (33% male) troponin-negative controls. The troponin-positive group was older (57 ± 11 years vs. 47 ± 14 years, p = 0.015). The groups had similar T2-weighted signal intensity ratios and native T1 times. T2 relaxation times were longer in the troponin-positive group, and the difference remained significant after excluding infarct-pattern late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) from the analysis. Extracellular volume (ECV) was higher in the troponin-positive group (25 ± 4 ms vs. 22 ± 3 ms, p = 0.008) and correlated strongly with T2 relaxation time (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.701, p = 0.022). Late gadolinium enhancement was 32% more prevalent in the troponin-positive group (82% vs. 50%, p = 0.050), with 29% having infarct-pattern LGE. T2 relaxation time was independently associated with troponin positivity (OR 2.1, p = 0.043), and both T2 relaxation time and ECV predicted troponin positivity (C-statistics: 0.71, p = 0.009; and 0.77, p = 0.006). Left ventricular end-diastolic and left atrial volumes were the strongest predictors of troponin positivity (C-statistics: 0.80, p = 0.001; and 0.82, p &lt; 0.001). The increased T2 relaxation time and ECV and their significant correlation in the troponin-positive group suggest myocardial injury with oedema, while the non-ischaemic LGE could be due to myocardial fibrosis or acute necrosis. These CMR imaging biomarkers provide important clinical indices for risk stratification and prognostication in patients with hypertensive crisis.
