Title: Assessment of the Level of Matrix Metalloproteinases, VEGF and MicroRNA-34a in Patients With Non-obstructive and Obstructive Lesions of the Coronary Arteries.

Abstract: AIM: To assess the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and miRNA-34a expression in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and obstructive and nonobstructive coronary artery (CA) disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study included 64 patients with IHD (diagnosis verified by coronary angiography or multislice computed tomography coronary angiography), of which 33 (51.6%) were men aged 64.9±8.1 years. 20 patients had nonobstructive CA disease (stenosis &lt;50%), and 44 had hemodynamically significant stenoses. The control group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers. MMP-1, -9, -13, and -14, miRNA-34a, and VEGF were measured in all patients.
RESULTS: The concentration of MMP-1 was significantly higher in patients with ischemia and nonobstructive CA disease (INOCAD) (p=0.016), and the concentration of MMP-9 was the highest in the group with obstructive CA disease (p&lt;0.001). The concentrations of MMP-13 and MMP-14 did not differ significantly between the groups. The highest VEGF concentrations were observed in the INOCAD group (p&lt;0.001). The expression of miRNA-34a significantly differed between the IHD groups with different types of CA disease and controls (p &lt;0.001). Patients with hemodynamically significant stenosis showed moderate relationships between the concentrations of MMP-14 and VEGF (ρ=0.418; p=0.024), as well as between VEGF and miRNA-34a (ρ=0.425; p=0.022). Patients with INOCAD had a significant negative correlation between the concentrations of MMP-13 and VEGF (ρ= -0.659; p=0.003). Correlation analysis showed in all IHD patients a moderate relationship of the concentrations of MMP-1 and MMP-14 with VEGF (ρ=0.449; p=0.002 and p=0.341; p=0.019, respectively). According to ROC analysis, a MMP-9 concentration above 4.83 ng/ml can be a predictor for the presence of hemodynamically significant CA obstruction in IHD patients; a VEGF concentration higher than 27.23 pg/ml suggests the absence of hemodynamically significant CA stenosis.
CONCLUSION: IHD patients with INOCAD had the greatest increase in MMP-1, whereas patients with obstructive CA disease had the highest level of MMP-9. According to our data, concentrations of MMP-9 and VEGF can be used to predict the degree of CA obstruction. The expression of miRNA-34a was significantly higher in IHD patients with INOCAD and CA obstruction than in the control group, which suggested a miRNA-34a contribution to the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. In the future, it may be possible to use this miRNA as a diagnostic marker for IHD.
