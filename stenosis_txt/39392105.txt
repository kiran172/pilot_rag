Title: Involved-field high-dose chemoradiotherapy with respiratory motion management for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We investigated the clinical outcomes of involved-field high-dose (≥66 Gy) chemoradiotherapy (CRT) combined with respiratory motion management for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
METHODS: Patients who underwent definitive CRT for histologically confirmed ESCC in our department between 2012 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Respiratory motion management strategies included breath-holding (63%) and mask immobilization (29%) based on individual measurements of respiratory tumor motion using radiographic fluoroscopy with endoscopically placed clip markers as landmarks. We evaluated patient characteristics, treatment efficacy, failure patterns, and toxicities.
RESULTS: We enrolled 35 patients with a prescribed dose of 66-70 Gy in 33-35 fractions. The overall response rate within 6 months post-CRT was 94.3%; the median follow-up period for survivors was 43 months. The 2-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and locoregional failure-free survival rates were 51.4%, 42.9%, and 42.9%, respectively. A significant difference in OS was observed between patients with and without esophageal fistulas after CRT (p = 0.002, log-rank test). Disease failure occurred in 16 patients (45.7%), including one (2.9%) with out-of-field regional nodal failure. Major grade 3 or higher toxicities included decreased white blood cell count (48.6%), neutrophil count (34.3%), and esophageal stenosis (31.4%). No grade 3 or higher cardiopulmonary toxicities were observed. Bronchial/tracheal tumor compression and a higher radiotherapy dose (70 Gy) were significantly correlated with esophageal fistulas.
CONCLUSION: Involved-field high-dose CRT with respiratory motion management may be a feasible treatment option for ESCC. However, a comprehensive assessment of esophageal fistula risk is required to identify suitable candidates.
