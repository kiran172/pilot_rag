Title: Case report: Aortic valve endocarditis and recurrent pulmonary valve stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We discuss a rare case of an adult patient with different pathologies involving the aortic and pulmonary valves in need of surgery.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient had a history of congenital PV stenosis and surgical valvuloplasty. Almost 50 years later the patient underwent a complex second heart surgery due to infective endocarditis of the aortic valve and high-grade restenosis of the pulmonary valve. Replacement of the aortic and pulmonary valve, as well as reconstruction of the RVOT and closure of a persistent foramen ovale, followed. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home a week after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Simultaneous surgery of pulmonary and aortic valves due to different pathologies is rare but can be performed successfully even in advanced age and can improve quality of life.
