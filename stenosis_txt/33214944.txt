Title: Novel Application of Erector Spinae Plane Block to Interspinous Spacer Placement.

Abstract: Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a fascial plane block that targets the dorsal and ventral branches of the primary dorsal root ganglion. We report a case of a 76-year-old woman who presented for percutaneous posterior interspinous decompression spacer at the L3-L4 level in the setting of neurogenic claudication from severe spinal stenosis. We describe the novel performance of bilateral ESPBs under ultrasound guidance for postprocedural analgesia. Throughout the recovery period, the patient experienced sustained pain relief. ESPB may be a useful adjunct for periprocedural analgesia and recovery in patients undergoing interspinous spacer placements.
