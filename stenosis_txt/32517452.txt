Title: [Use of Hybrid Stent in Management of Complex Malignant Airway Stenosisand Fistulas].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Airway stents has been widely used in airway stenosis and fistula, yet clinical date of airway stents in reestablishment a complex airway is insufficient. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety to combine the silicon stent and the metal stent in reestablishment a complex malignant airway.
METHODS: Patients with non-operable complex malignant airway stenosis and fistula were recruited in this study. Silicon Y stent combined with covered metal stent (Hybrid stent) were inserted to reestablishment the airway. Clinical outcomes and complications were observed over six months.
RESULTS: A total of 23 silicon Y stents and 25 covered metal stents were inserted in 23 patients. Nineteen of 23 (19/23, 82.6%) patients felt a immediately relieving of current symptoms. The mean duration of stents placement in patients was (153.43Â±9.14) days. The modified British Medical Research Council, Karnofsky Performance Status and Performance Status scale were improved significantly after stenting. A total of 12 patients living with stent at 6 months. Others dead of tumor progression. There were no death or immediate complications related to hybrid stenting implication.
CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid stenting proved to be useful and was well-tolerated in the management of complex malignant airway stenosis and fistula.
