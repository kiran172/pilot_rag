Title: Venous sinus stenting improves cerebral autoregulation in a patient with venous sinus stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Venous sinus stenosis (VSS) is a type of cerebral venous vascular disease. Cerebral autoregulation is an indicator of cerebral arterial function. The cerebral circulatory system is composed of the venous system and arterial system. Impaired venous function may affect arterial function. Thus, cerebral venous stenosis may influence cerebral autoregulation.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this case, a 50-year-old woman with transient blindness and headache was admitted to the hospital. The patient was diagnosed with VSS. A stent was placed at the stenosis. The stent released the intravenous pressure and remitted the patient's symptoms. Measurements of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) were performed at 3 time points: before stenting, after stenting, and 3â€‰months later. The dCA gradually improved after stenting.
CONCLUSION: VSS may have an influence on cerebral autoregulation, and effective treatment improves cerebral autoregulation in patients with VSS.
