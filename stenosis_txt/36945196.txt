Title: Prevalence and predictors of non-rheumatic valvular heart disease in patients with sickle cell disease: insights from the National In-Patient Database in 2016 and 2017.

Abstract: Sickle cell disease (SCD) life expectancy has increased in high-income countries, approaching the fifth decade in the United States. Aging in SCD has raised concerns about chronic organ damage due to adaptative and maladaptive cardiac remodeling. This study aims to assess the prevalence and predictors of non-rheumatic valvular heart disease (NRVHD) in SCD patients using the United States National Inpatient Sample database from 2016 and 2017. We conducted a weighted analysis on SCD patients during their index hospitalization. We obtained the prevalence of NRVHD and calculated adjusted odds ratios to identify the associated demographic, social, and clinical characteristics using multivariable logistic regression. We identified 192,460 SCD admissions during 2016 and 2017. Of them, 2450 (1.3%) had NRVHD. Mitral insufficiency (MI) was the most common NRVHD present in 52% of the cases. Mitral valve prolapse represented 12.4%, while aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency in 10.8% and 12.7%, respectively. Right-sided NRVHD had a lower prevalence, with 17.1% of patients having tricuspid insufficiency (TI) and 6.3% pulmonary insufficiency. There were no cases of mitral, tricuspid, or pulmonary stenosis. Characteristics associated with the presence of NRVHD in SCD were secondary pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and female sex. NRVHDs, especially MI and TI, are comorbidities in SCD. Literature is scarce on this topic. The predictors found for its occurrence could help address modifiable factors that can positively affect patients with SCD who, due to the natural history of the disease, are at risk of developing NRVHD.
