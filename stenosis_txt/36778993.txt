Title: Perioperative Concerns and Complaints of Patients Undergoing Total Hip Arthroplasty.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Preoperative concerns of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) and their complaints during the initial postoperative period are not well investigated. We evaluated preoperative concerns of patients and patient-perceived problems during the operation and initial 5 days after the operation.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-two patients, who underwent primary THA at a tertiary referral hospital, were surveyed using a questionnaire and a face-to-face interview 1 day before the operation, operation day, and postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 4. The severity of pain was assessed daily using a visual analog scale.
RESULTS: The most common preoperative concern was the severity of pain after the surgery (65.2%), followed by the need of transfusion (34.8%) and postoperative rehabilitation (32.6%). Among 29 patients who could recall the experience during the operation, 12 (41.4%) suffered from shoulder pain on the contralateral side, and 6 (20.7%) answered that hammering sound had been annoying. After returning to the ward, 29 patients (22.0%) suffered from nausea, 8 (6.1%) complained of back pain, and 7 (5.3%) had ipsilateral knee pain. On postoperative day 1, 7 patients (5.3%) had persistent back pain, 8 (6.1%) had headache, and 5 (3.8%) suffered from nausea. On postoperative day 2, nine patients (6.8%) complained of radiating pain due to aggravation of pre-existing spinal stenosis, 7 (5.3%) complained of weakness of the hip flexor due to periarticular injection of ropivacaine during the operation, and 5 (3.8%) had dressing-related skin problem at the wound. On postoperative days 3 and 4, patients had no problem other than hip pain. The mean pain score was the highest (3.1 Â± 1.0) on postoperative day 1.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study might provide information needed to solve problems and improve satisfaction of patients undergoing THA.
