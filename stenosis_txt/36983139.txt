Title: Commissural Alignment and Coronary Access after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) is the first therapeutic option for elderly patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, and indications are steadily expanding to younger patients and subjects with lower surgical risk and longer life expectancy. Commissural alignment between native and transcatheter valves facilitates coronary access after TAVR and is thus considered a procedural goal, allowing long-term management of coronary artery disease. Moreover, commissural alignment may potentially have a positive impact on transvalvular hemodynamic and valve durability. This review focus on technical hints to achieve commissural alignment and current evidence for different transcatheter aortic valves.
