Title: Lipoprotein (a) and lipid-lowering treatment from the perspective of a cardiac surgeon. An impact on the prognosis in patients with aortic valve replacement and after heart transplantation.

Abstract: Lipoprotein(a) is a recognized risk factor for ASCVD. There is still no targeted therapy for Lp(a), however, drugs such as pelacarsen, olpasiran, zerlasiran, lepodisiran and muvalaplin are in clinical trials and have been shown to be effective in significantly reducing Lp(a) levels. Moreover, elevated Lp(a) levels significantly affect the prognosis of patients after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and heart transplantation (HTx). Therefore, the assessment of Lp(a) concentration in these patients will allow for a more accurate stratification of their cardiovascular risk, and the possibility of lowering Lp(a) will allow for the optimization of this risk. In this article, we summarized the most important information regarding the role of Lp(a) and lipid-lowering treatment in patients after AVR and HTx.
