Title: Carotid endarterectomy restores decreased vision due to chronic ocular ischemia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The therapeutic effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on visual disturbance caused by chronic ocular ischemia due to carotid artery stenosis has not been validated. This prospective observational study aims to investigate whether CEA is associated with an increase in ocular blood flow (OBF) and postoperative visual improvement.
METHODS: In total, 41 patients with carotid artery stenosis treated by CEA between March 2015 and September 2018 were enrolled in this study. OBF was evaluated by laser speckle flowgraphy, which can measure the mean blur ratio (MBR) which is well correlated to the absolute retinal blood flow. Visual acuity was assessed before and after CEA by subjective improvement and objective visual assessment using CSV-1000, an instrument used to test contrast sensitivity.
RESULTS: OBF increased after CEA on the operated side (mean MBR 33.5 vs 38.2, p < 0.001) but not on the non-operated side (mean MBR 37.8 vs 37.5, p = 0.50). After CEA, 23 patients (56.1%) reported subjective visual improvement on the operated side. The mean CSV-1000 score among the patients with increased OBF after CEA (5.44 vs 5.88, p = 0.04) but not among those without increased OBF (5.48 vs 5.95, p = 0.09). The mean CSV-1000 scores increased significantly after CEA in 18 patients with decreased vision and decreased OBF (4.51 vs 5.37, p < 0.001), but not in the 23 patients without those (6.19 vs 6.31, p = 0.6).
CONCLUSION: CEA may successfully reverse visual dysfunction caused by chronic ocular ischemia due to carotid artery stenosis by increasing OBF.
