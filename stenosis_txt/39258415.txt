Title: Third sternotomy with modified Bentall/Konno procedure for recurrent multilevel left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in a 15-year-old.

Abstract: This is a 15-year-old, 73.5 kg male who was born with congenital aortic valve stenosis. He underwent a transcatheter balloon aortic valvuloplasty in the neonatal period, followed by an open aortic valvotomy at 2 months of age. When he was 3 years old, he underwent aortic root replacement with a 15 mm aortic homograft. Recently, he presented with recurrent left ventricular outflow tract obstruction that appeared valvular and subvalvular in nature. We present our technique of repeat aortic root replacement and left ventricular outflow tract enlargement using modified Bentall combined with Konno-Rastan aortoventriculoplasty.
