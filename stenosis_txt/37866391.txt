Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in a Patient With Anomalous Left Main Coronary Artery from Right Coronary Artery.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now a well-established modality of treating severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis in patients deemed at great surgical risk. In patients with coexisting anomalous coronary arteries, however, TAVI presents technical challenges, and coronary obstruction is a feared complication. In this study, we present the case of successful TAVI in a 78-year-old patient with anomalous left main coronary artery originating from the right coronary artery.
