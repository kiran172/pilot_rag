Title: Replacement of long-segment ureteral defect with tapered demucosalized ileum: medium-term outcomes of 4 patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Repair of long-segment ureteral defect (LSUD) is challenging. Currently available procedures carry some potential complications. We modified the ileal graft by tapering the wall and stripping the mucosa to combat associated pitfalls and first reported the medium-term outcomes of 4 patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: From September 2019 to October 2020, tapered demucosalized ileum (TDI) was used for LSUD reconstruction in 4 patients on the right (2 males and 2 females). Two patients were with panureteral avulsion and 2 with high-risk urothelial carcinoma in the distal ureter. TDI was made by tapering 1/2-2/3 of the antimesenteric ileal wall and stripping the mucosa with a blunt/blunt operating scissor. Follow-up modalities included serum creatinine, electrolytes, ultrasonography, CT urogram, renal scintigraphy, and ureteroscopy.
RESULTS: Mean operation time was 443 min (range 360-550) and blood loss was negligible. The mean follow-up period was 29 months (range 23-36). Vesicoureteral reflux and related pyelonephritis occurred in 1 patient, necessitating a repair operation (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb). No strictures, obstructions, metabolic disorders, or electrolyte imbalances were observed in the remaining patients. In carcinoma patients, ureteroscopy in month 18 post-operation revealed ileal mucosal regrowth in the form of dwarf isolated islands. All renal units maintained adequate drainage and function during the follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Ileal wall tapering and mucosa stripping confined to the muscularis mucosae level will not result in shrinkage, fibrosis, or stricture formation of the ileal ureter. The present work provides evidence for further application of TDI in the replacement of LSUD in patients.
