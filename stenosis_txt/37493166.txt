Title: Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio and Red Blood Cell Distribution Width in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Rheumatic Valve Disease.

Abstract: The lifetime risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) is 1 in 3 adults, resulting in a prevalence of 2-4%. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a frequent aetiology of valvular heart disease in lowand middle-income countries. Between 21% and 80% of patients with mitral valve disease, especially with stenosis, may have AF. Both these conditions, AF and RHD, present a state of persistent inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a frequent cause of anisocytosis, which can be evidenced through the parameter RDW (red bold cell distribution width). Factors associated with increased RDW are also known as risk factors associated with a higher incidence of AF. RDW may have an independent role in the pathogenesis of AF and the increased propensity of both thromboembolic and bleeding events. Another marker involved in the incidence of AF is the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. This is also a marker of oxidative stress and inflammation and is associated with a higher rate of AF recurrence. This review will evaluate these biomarkers and their association with cardiovascular events in patients with AF and RHD. The hypotheses and current debates about the relationship of biomarkers with the severity of chronic valve dysfunction, with acute rheumatic carditis in the paediatric population, and with the presence of thrombus in the left atrium will be discussed.
