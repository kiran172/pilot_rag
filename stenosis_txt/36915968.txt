Title: Oxidative stress in intervertebral disc degeneration: Molecular mechanisms, pathogenesis and treatment.

Abstract: Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of labour loss and disability worldwide, and it also imposes a severe economic burden on patients and society. Among symptomatic LBP, approximately 40% is caused by intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). IDD is the pathological basis of many spinal degenerative diseases such as disc herniation and spinal stenosis. Currently, the therapeutic approaches for IDD mainly include conservative treatment and surgical treatment, neither of which can solve the problem from the root by terminating the degenerative process of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Therefore, further exploring the pathogenic mechanisms of IDD and adopting targeted therapeutic strategies is one of the current research hotspots. Among the complex pathophysiological processes and pathogenic mechanisms of IDD, oxidative stress is considered as the main pathogenic factor. The delicate balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants is essential for maintaining the normal function and survival of IVD cells. Excessive ROS levels can cause damage to macromolecules such as nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins of cells, affect normal cellular activities and functions, and ultimately lead to cell senescence or death. This review discusses the potential role of oxidative stress in IDD to further understand the pathophysiological processes and pathogenic mechanisms of IDD and provides potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of IDD.
