Title: [Risk factors for pulmonary atelectasis in adults with tracheobronchial tuberculosis].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the risk factors for pulmonary atelectasis in adults with tracheobronchial tuberculosis(TBTB). Methods: Clinical data of adult patients (≥18 years old) with TBTB from February 2018 to December 2021 in Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 258 patients were included, with a male to female ratio of 1∶1.43. The median age was 31(24, 48) years. Clinical data including clinical characteristics, previous misdiagnoses/missed diagnoses before admission, pulmonary atelectasis, the time from symptom onset to atelectasis and bronchoscopy, bronchoscopy and interventional treatment were collected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had pulmonary atelectasis. Differences between the two groups were compared. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for pulmonary atelectasis. Results: The prevalence of pulmonary atelectasis was 14.7%, which was most common in the left upper lobe (26.3%). The median time from symptom onset to atelectasis was 130.50(29.75,358.50)d, and the median time from atelectasis to bronchoscopy was 5(3,7)d. The median age, the proportion of misdiagnosis of TBTB before admission, and the time from symptom onset to bronchoscopy in the atelectasis group were higher than those without atelectasis, and the proportion of receiving bronchoscopy examination and interventional therapy previously, and the proportion of pulmonary cavities were lower than those without atelectasis (all P&lt;0.05). The proportions of cicatrices stricture type and lumen occlusion type in the atelectasis group were higher than those without atelectasis, while the proportions of inflammatory infiltration type and ulceration necrosis type were lower than those without atelectasis (all P&lt;0.05). Older age (OR=1.036, 95%CI: 1.012-1.061), previous misdiagnosis(OR=2.759, 95%CI: 1.100-6.922), longer time from symptom onset to bronchoscopy examination (OR=1.002, 95%CI: 1.000-1.005) and cicatrices stricture type (OR=2.989, 95%CI: 1.279-6.985) were independent risk factors for pulmonary atelectasis in adults with TBTB (all P&lt;0.05). Of the patients with atelectasis who underwent bronchoscopy interventional therapy, 86.7% had lung reexpansion or partial reexpansion. Conclusions: The prevalence of pulmonary atelectasis is 14.7% in adult patients with TBTB. The most common site of atelectasis is left upper lobe. The TBTB type of lumen occlusion is complicated by pulmonary atelectasis in 100% of cases. Being older, misdiagnosed as other diseases, longer time from onset of symptoms to bronchoscopy examination, and being the cicatrices stricture type are factors for developing pulmonary atelectasis. Early diagnosis and treatment are needed to reduce the incidence of pulmonary atelectasis and increase the rate of pulmonary reexpansion.
