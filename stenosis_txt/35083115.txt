Title: Simultaneous Bicarotid and Microscope-assisted Coronary Revascularization as an Individual Surgical Strategy.

Abstract: A 59-year-old man presented with complaints of giddiness caused by changes in body position, unsteady gait, daily episodes of vision loss, breathlessness, and chest pain flowing minor physical exertion. Computed tomography revealed occlusion of the right common carotid artery, critical stenosis of the left common carotid artery, and significant stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. A coronarography detected stenosis of the left main coronary artery plus 3-vessel disease. Simultaneous aortic-bicarotid bifurcation prosthesis and coronary artery bypass grafting were performed. The patient showed a satisfactory postoperative outcome.
