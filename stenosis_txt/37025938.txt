Title: Prognostic Impacts of CHADS<sub>2</sub>, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc, and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-HS Scores on Clinical Outcomes After Elective Drug-Eluting Stent Placement for De Novo Coronary Stenosis.

Abstract: Background: The prognostic impact of CHADS<sub>2</sub>, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc, and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-HS scores on clinical outcomes after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement has not been fully elucidated. Methods and Results: The present study was a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center, and lesion-based study. Target lesion failure (TLF), comprising cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization, occurred in 7.1% of 872 consecutive de novo coronary lesions in 586 patients. These patients were electively and exclusively treated by DESs from January 2016 to January 2022 until July 2022 with a mean (±SD) observational interval of 411±438 days. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-HS scores ≥7 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.800; 95% CI 1.06-3.05; P=0.029) was a significant predictor of cumulative TLF among 24 variables evaluated. CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores ≥2 (HR 3.213; 95% CI 1.32-7.80; P=0.010) and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores ≥5 (HR 1.980; 95% CI 1.10-3.55; P=0.022) were also significant in the multivariate analysis. Pairwise comparisons of receiver operating characteristic curves for CHADS<sub>2</sub> score ≥2, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score ≥5, and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc-HS score ≥7 showed they were equivalent in terms of predicting the incidence of TLF, with areas under the curve of 0.568, 0.575, and 0.573, respectively. Conclusions: All 3 cardiocerebrovascular thromboembolism risk scores were strong predictors of the incidence of cumulative mid-term TLF after elective DES placement, with cut-off values of 2, 5, and 7, respectively, and equivalent prognostic impacts.
