Title: [Bioprosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombosis in Patient with Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome;Report of a Case].

Abstract: A 66-year-old woman with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) was admitted due to severe dyspnea. Eight months prior to admission, she underwent bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement for mitral valve stenosis and regurgitation. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed thickening bioprosthetic valve leaflets and severe valve stenosis. Emergency reoperation for artificial valve failure was performed. The explanted bioprosthetic valve showed massive thrombus formation. After the operation, she started strict anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies and was discharged without recurrence of valve thrombosis.
