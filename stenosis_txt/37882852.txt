Title: Evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in distinguishing strictures in Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to assess the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in distinguishing fibrotic from inflammatory strictures in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.
METHODS: A rigorous and systematic exploration of five key databases yielded studies that met predefined criteria. Data were extracted for a comprehensive meta-analysis using MetaDiSC and MetaDTA software, providing diagnostic accuracy measures. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool was utilized for evaluating the methodological quality and potential bias within the studies.
RESULTS: The systematic review involved the evaluation of 7437 records, culminating in the inclusion of 22 studies. In detecting fibrotic strictures in CD patients, MRI exhibited a pooled sensitivity of 85.20% (95% CI: 76.10-91.20%) and specificity of 96.00% (95% CI: 87.80-98.70%). For differentiating fibrotic strictures from inflammatory stenosis, the sensitivity was 81.5% (95% CI: 70.2-89.20%), and the specificity was 97.2% (95% CI: 90.0-99.3%). In terms of assessing the severity of strictures, sensitivity stood at 90.4% (95% CI: 78.1-96.1%) and specificity at 89.4% (95% CI: 57.4-98.2%). The consistency of the diagnostic accuracy was observed across different geographical locations and the various reference tests applied in the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis underscore the robust diagnostic accuracy of MRI in detecting fibrotic strictures, distinguishing between fibrotic and inflammatory strictures, and evaluating stricture severity in CD patients. These findings support the integration of MRI into standard diagnostic protocols for patients with CD. Further large-scale, multicenter trials are warranted to confirm these results and to identify any potential limitations associated with the application of MRI in this clinical setting.
