Title: Navigating Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges of Pulmonary Hypertension in Infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.

Abstract: Advances in perinatal intensive care have significantly enhanced the survival rates of extremely low gestation-al-age neonates but with continued high rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Nevertheless, as the survival of these infants improves, there is a growing awareness of associated abnormalities in pulmonary vascular development and hemodynamics within the pulmonary circulation. Premature infants, now born as early as 22 weeks, face heightened risks of adverse development in both pulmonary arterial and venous systems. This risk is compounded by parenchymal and airway abnormalities, as well as factors such as inflammation, fibrosis, and adverse growth trajectory. The presence of pulmonary hypertension in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD-PH) has been linked to an increased mortality and substantial morbidities, including a greater susceptibility to later neurodevelopmental challenges. BPD-PH is now recognized to be a spectrum of disease, with a multifactorial pathophysiology. This review discusses the challenges associated with the identification and management of BPD-PH, both of which are important in minimizing further disease progression and improving cardiopulmonary morbidity in the BPD infant.
