Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis Hospitalized With Acute Heart Failure.

Abstract: Optimal timing and outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients presenting with acute heart failure (AHF) remain unclear. In this consecutive cohort of 1,547 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI, the AHF status at admission was collected, and patients were classified into AHF and elective TAVI groups. In the AHF group, early TAVI was defined as TAVI performed ≤60 hours after emergency room arrival. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30-day and 2-year after TAVI. There were 139 (9%) patients who underwent TAVI while hospitalized with AHF. At baseline, this group had higher rates of chronic kidney disease, higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. After adjusting for baseline differences, the AHF group had significantly higher all-cause mortality at 30-day and 2-year than the elective TAVI group (8% vs 2%; p = 0.002, and 33% vs 18%; p = 0.002, respectively). In the AHF group, 43 (31%) patients underwent early treatment with TAVI. No significant difference in all-cause mortality at 30-day was observed between early and non-early TAVI groups (5% vs 10%; p = 0.617). All-cause mortality at 2-year was lower in the early TAVI groups (16% vs 40%, log-rank p = 0.022); however, after multivariable adjustment, the difference was barely statistically significant (p = 0.053). In conclusion, TAVI in patients with AHF was associated with worse short and long-term outcomes. In AHF setting, early TAVI did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality at 30-day; however, it showed a strong trend for lower all-cause mortality at 2-year.
