Title: [Percutaneous Resolution for Tricuspid Stenosis: Positive Outcomes Despite High Surgical Risk].

Abstract: We report a 31-year-old woman who was previously subjected to aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve replacement in three different surgical episodes. She was admitted to our cardiology section with acute right heart failure symptoms. She was studied by echocardiography, right/left heart catheterization, cardiac CT scan and cardiac magnetic resonance. A severe tricuspid stenosis due to biological prosthesis dysfunction was diagnosed. Due to high operative risk and risk of postoperative right ventricular failure, the patient was rejected for cardiovascular surgery. We decided on a percutaneous tricuspid "valve in valve replacement". The procedure was done successfully by venous femoral approach, with a balloon expandable prosthesis. Tricuspid stenosis was corrected and the patient evolved with remission of heart failure symptoms.
