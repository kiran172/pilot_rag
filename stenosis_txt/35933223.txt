Title: Ultrasound-Guided Versus Conventional MANTA Vascular Closure Device Deployment After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Despite the development of device technology and operators' experience, access site vascular complications (VCs) remain one of the major concerns after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). MANTA (Teleflex, Wayne, Pennsylvania) is a large-bore vascular closure device (VCD) with promising incidence of VC. Previously, we demonstrated that the ultrasound-guided MANTA (US-MANTA) technique further improved the outcomes compared with conventional MANTA (C-MANTA) without ultrasound guidance. The present study was established to prove the effectiveness of the technique in a larger population. In this study, we included 1,150 patients (335 patients with C-MANTA and 815 with US-MANTA) who received MANTA after TAVI from April 2017 to September 2021. The primary endpoint was MANTA-related VC. Overall VC, VCD failure, and bleeding complications were also assessed based on the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 criteria. MANTA-related VC occurred in 12.5% in the C-MANTA group and 6.8% in the US-MANTA group (p = 0.001). VCD failure rate were 7.5% and 3.9%, respectively (p = 0.012). Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 major and minor VC were more frequent in C-MANTA group (major: 7.8% vs 4.4%, p = 0.023; minor: 8.1% vs 4.4%, p = 0.022). Multivariate analysis revealed US-MANTA as the negative predictor of MANTA-related VC (odds ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89, p = 0.013). However, subgroup analysis showed the efficacy of the US-MANTA technique was limited to the patients without severely calcified puncture site (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.048). In conclusion, the US-MANTA technique was an effective strategy to reduce VC after transfemoral TAVI compared with C-MANTA.
