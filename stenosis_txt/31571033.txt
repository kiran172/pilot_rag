Title: Early prediction of complex benign anastomotic stricture after esophagectomy using early postoperative endoscopic findings.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Benign anastomotic stricture after esophagectomy and reconstruction adversely affects oral intake and can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Some patients experience relapse that requires frequent endoscopic dilatations. This study aimed to investigate whether the endoscopic appearance of anastomosis during the early postoperative period is associated with the complexity of subsequent anastomotic strictures.
METHODS: Data of 213 patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction and early postoperative endoscopy between July 2008 and September 2018 were prospectively collected. Relationships among various risk factors, including the severity of mucosal degeneration of the anastomosis and complexity of anastomotic stricture, were studied using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (25%) developed anastomotic strictures at a median of 55 days after surgery, requiring a median of 5 endoscopic dilations. In multivariate analysis, severe mucosal degeneration was the only significant risk factor for any type of anastomotic stricture (P < 0.001). Twenty-seven patients (51%) developed refractory anastomotic strictures. In multivariate analysis, younger age (< 65 years) (P = 0.01), lack of neoadjuvant therapy (P = 0.02), severe mucosal degeneration (P = 0.03), and stricture development within 55 days (P = 0.01) were the risk factors for refractory stricture. The analysis of the risk factors for severe mucosal degeneration revealed that comorbidities and anastomotic techniques were independently correlated (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative severe mucosal degeneration of esophagogastrostomy was the only predictor of strictures, regardless of their type. Mucosal degeneration, early postoperative stricture, younger age, and front surgery were associated with refractory anastomotic strictures.
