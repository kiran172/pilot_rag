Title: Bilateral persistent sciatic arteries presenting with lower extremity claudication.

Abstract: This is a case report of a woman in her 60s with Rutherford class 3 bilateral calf claudication and a resting right Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) 0.49 and left ABI 0.57. The arteriogram of lower extremities demonstrates bilateral persistent sciatic arteries (PSAs). The patient had severe stenosis of left common iliac artery, and thus underwent successful stenting resulting in normalisation of flow and filling of PSA with symptom resolution.
