Title: Cardiomegaly secondary to patent ductus arteriosus causing extrinsic compression of left pulmonary vein.

Abstract: Primary pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis is a challenging condition to manage. Recently, extrinsic compression of the PV is being detected has cause of narrowing and subsequent turbulence. This can be managed without direct intervention on the PV, reducing the risk of recurrence. We report a case of extrinsic compression of the PV due to cardiomegaly, relieved after patent ductus arteriosus ligation.
