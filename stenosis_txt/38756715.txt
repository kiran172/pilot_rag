Title: Navigating Diagnostic Challenges in Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Case of Bezold-Jarisch Reflex and Wellens Pattern.

Abstract: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presents significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in cases with atypical presentations and complex clinical scenarios. Here, we describe the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with presyncope, bradycardia, hypotension, and later syncope, attributed to the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Electrocardiographic findings suggested both inferior and anterior wall infarction, with dynamic changes in T-wave morphology further complicating the diagnostic process. Despite a type A Wellens' pattern indicating critical stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery, coronary angiography revealed a complete thrombotic lesion in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA), necessitating urgent intervention. Despite the Wellens pattern indicating LAD involvement, RCA revascularization took precedence due to immediate thrombotic risk. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges associated with conflicting clinical manifestations in ACS and highlights the importance of individualized management strategies integrating advanced diagnostic modalities to optimize outcomes. Understanding the interplay of complex clinical presentations and employing a nuanced approach to management are crucial in effectively navigating ACS scenarios.
