Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with anomalous origin of a coronary artery.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a well-established treatment option for elderly patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Coronary artery anomalies are an infrequent finding and there have only been few anecdotal reports of patients with coronary anomalies treated with TAVI. We here present a comprehensive overview of existing reports in addition to an own case series to facilitate better understanding of this potentially challenging clinical scenario.
