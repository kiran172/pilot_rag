Title: Spondylolysis of the Thoracic Spine with Instability: A Rare Cause for Myelopathy.

Abstract: CASE: A 51-year-old lady with multiple comorbidities presented with T11 spondylolysis in association with thoracic stenosis and myelopathy. Our patient underwent T11-T12 laminectomy, T10-L1 posterior instrumented stabilization, and T11-T12 transforaminal interbody fusion. She had a good neurological recovery, and the radiographs at 1-year follow-up showed good fusion and implant position.
CONCLUSION: Spondylolysis is an anatomical defect or stress fracture of the pars interarticularis and usually reported in the lumbar region. This case of T11 spondylolysis in association with thoracic stenosis, spinal instability, and myelopathy is highlighted for its rarity and to reiterate the need for high index of suspicion among surgeons for the timely diagnosis.
