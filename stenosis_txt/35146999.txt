Title: [Surgical prevention of progressive cerebral ischemia after ischemic stroke].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy after ischemic stroke and to analyze postoperative neurological status.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 120 patients with carotid artery stenosis complicated by chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency (CVI). Patients with CVI grade I-III were included in the first group (n=70), 50 patients had previous ischemic stroke (the second group). Age of patients was 61-89 years. All patients underwent unilateral carotid endarterectomy.
RESULTS: Over 36-month follow-up period, postoperative stroke occurred in 5 (7.2%) and 9 (18.3%) patients in both groups, respectively. The combined end-point (stroke + mortality) was significantly less common in group I compared to group II (10 (14.5%) and 15 (30%) cases, p&gt;0.05). Positive changes in neurological status were found in the 2nd group (relief of focal neurological deficit, symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency, no progression of vascular dementia). Barthel score increased from 74.3 to 92.8 after carotid endarterectomy in the 2nd group. Baseline FAB score &lt;11 was observed in 9% of patients in the 1st group and 22% in the 2nd group. No progression of dementia was observed in long-term period.
CONCLUSION: Carotid endarterectomy is effective in prevention of primary and recurrent stroke. Moreover, this procedure slows down progression of chronic cerebral ischemia and cognitive impairment.
