Title: Innominate artery patency after direct cannulation in neonates.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to determine the short-term incidence of innominate artery stenosis for neonates who underwent direct innominate artery cannulation during the Norwood procedure.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-institution review of 92 patients who underwent the Norwood procedure with direct innominate artery cannulation from 2006 to 2017. The primary outcome was angiographic evidence of patency at pre-Glenn cardiac catheterization. Patient characteristics, intraoperative surgical and hemodynamic measurements, and postoperative neurologic findings were recorded.
RESULTS: At a median age of 5.0 days, 92 neonates underwent the Norwood procedure with direct innominate artery cannulation. These patients underwent cardiac catheterization at a median of 3.0 months after the index operation. In 5 of 92 patients with catheterization images available for review, there was angiographic evidence of mild innominate artery stenosis, and none had moderate or severe stenosis. Review of follow-up records did not reveal evidence of clinically significant stenosis or innominate artery reintervention.
CONCLUSIONS: In neonates undergoing the Norwood procedure with direct innominate cannulation, innominate artery stenosis was uncommon and clinically significant stenosis did not occur.
