Title: Minimally invasive autologous pericardial patch reconstruction of the pulmonary artery for locally advanced lung cancer following neoadjuvant treatment.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterioplasty with an autologous pericardial patch helps avoid having to perform pneumonectomy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, a minimally invasive procedure for this technique has rarely been reported because the patch usually shrinks and recoils after retrieval, complicating the suturing procedure. We describe our experience with performing autologous pericardial patch arterioplasty without glutaraldehyde fixation using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in a patient who received neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The pulmonary bloodstream was temporarily controlled by an endoscopic tourniquet placed at the pulmonary artery proximal to the ligamentum arteriosum as well as at the inferior pulmonary vein. A pericardial patch harvested anterior to the phrenic nerve was used to repair the hemi-circumferential pulmonary artery defect. Patch angioplasty was performed using a running suture with a 5-0 nonabsorbable monofilament thread, with the epicardial layer facing inside. No graft-related complications including stenosis occurred during the follow-up period.
