Title: Recurrent hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening after TAVR: Clinical implications.

Abstract: Subclinical bioprosthetic valve thrombosis (BPVT) is a relatively common finding in asymptomatic patients during follow-up imaging. However, its clinical significance is unclear. Data from registries associate BPVT with elevated valve gradients, thromboembolic complications, recurrence, and valve degeneration. Given the dynamic nature of the disease process, management is challenging. The duration of anticoagulation is unpredictable, and the need for frequent monitoring of BPVT, even in subclinical scenarios, is unclear. Our report is shedding the light on the clinical implications BPVT.
