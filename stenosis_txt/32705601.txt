Title: Preβ1-High-Density Lipoprotein in Cardiovascular Diseases.

Abstract: Serum preβ1-high-density lipoprotein (preβ1-HDL) was defined by two-dimensional non-denaturing linear gel electrophoresis and apolipoprotein A-I immunoblotting. However, there are still debatable questions for its quantification and coronary artery disease (CAD) relevance. We have established a novel and simple method for human serum preβ1-HDL quantification. We found that human lower preβ1-HDL is an independent predictor for severer coronary artery stenosis. In this chapter, we will discuss all these.
