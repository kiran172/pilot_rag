Title: Coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Feasibility in clinical practice.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent among patients with severe aortic stenosis who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). As indications for TAVR are now expanding to younger and lower-risk patients, the need for coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during their lifetime is expected to increase. The objective of our study was to assess the need for CA and the feasibility of re-engaging the coronary ostia after TAVR.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 853 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR between August 2007 and December 2020. Patients who needed CA after TAVR were selected. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful coronary ostia cannulation after TAVR.
RESULTS: Of a total of 31 CAs in 28 patients (3.5% of 810 patients analyzed: 57% male, age 77.8Â±7.0 years) performed after TAVR, 28 (90%) met the primary endpoint and in three cannulation was semi-selective. All failed selective coronary ostia cannulations occurred in patients with a self-expanding valve. Sixteen (52%) also had indication for PCI, which was successfully performed in all. The main indication for CA was non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (35%, n=11). Two cases of primary PCI occurred without delay. There were no complications reported during or after the procedure.
CONCLUSION: Although CA was rarely needed in patients after TAVR, selective diagnostic CA was possible in the overwhelming majority of patients. PCI was performed successfully in all cases, without complications.
