Title: Surgical management of pediatric renovascular hypertension and midaortic syndrome at a single-center multidisciplinary program.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of various surgical approaches in the treatment of renovascular hypertension and midaortic syndrome (MAS) in children.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective medical record review of patients who had undergone surgery for renovascular hypertension from 2010 to 2018 at our center under the care of a multidisciplinary team. The operative interventions included mesenteric artery growth improves circulation (MAGIC), tissue expander-stimulated lengthening of arteries (TESLA), aortic bypass using polytetrafluorethylene, renal artery reimplantation, and autotransplantation. The MAGIC procedure uses the meandering mesenteric artery as a free conduit for aortic bypass. The TESLA procedure is based on lengthening the normal distal aorta and iliac arteries by gradual filling of a retroaortic tissue expander for several weeks, followed by resection of the stenotic aorta and subsequent primary reconstruction.
RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were identified, 10 with isolated renal artery stenosis, 26 with MAS, and 3 with systemic inflammatory vasculitis. The median age at presentation and surgery was 6.4 years (range, 0-16.3 years) and 9.3 years (range, 0-9.2 years), respectively. The MAS-associated syndromes included neurofibromatosis type 1 (15.4%) and Williams syndrome (5.1%), although most cases were idiopathic. At surgery, 33.3% had had stage 1 hypertension (HTN), 53.8% stage 2 HTN, and 12.8% normal blood pressure with a median of three antihypertensive medications. Follow-up of 37 patients at a median of 2.5 years demonstrated normal blood pressure in 86.1%, stage 1 HTN in 8.3%, and stage 2 HTN in 5.6%, with a median of one antihypertensive medication for the entire cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of vascular involvement leading to renovascular hypertension in children are variable and complex, requiring thoughtful multidisciplinary planning and surgical decision-making. The MAGIC and TESLA procedures provide feasible approaches for aortic bypass and reconstruction using autologous tissues and will result in normalization of blood pressure in 85% of children 2.5 years after surgery.
