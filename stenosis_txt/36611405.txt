Title: Small Bowel Endoscopic Features of Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis.

Abstract: Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EoGE) is a rare digestive disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the stomach and intestines. In the diagnosis of EoE, it is extremely important to recognize distinctive endoscopic findings and accurately detect increased eosinophilia in gastrointestinal tissues. However, endoscopic findings of EoGE in the small intestine remain poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a literature review of 16 eligible papers. Redness or erythema was the most common endoscopic finding in the small bowel, followed by villous atrophy, erosion, ulceration, and edema. In some cases, stenosis due to circumferential ulceration was observed, which led to retention of the capsule during small bowel capsule endoscopy. Although many aspects of small bowel endoscopic findings in EoGE remain elusive, the findings presented in this review are expected to contribute to the further development of EoGE practice.
