Title: Preoperative TAVR Planning: How to Do It.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a well-established treatment option for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) whose procedural efficacy and safety have been continuously improving. Appropriate preprocedural planning, including aortic valve annulus measurements, transcatheter heart valve choice, and possible procedural complication anticipation is mandatory to a successful procedure. The gold standard for preoperative planning is still to perform a multi-detector computed angiotomography (MDCT), which provides all the information required. Nonetheless, 3D echocardiography and magnet resonance imaging (MRI) are great alternatives for some patients. In this article, we provide an updated comprehensive review, focusing on preoperative TAVR planning and the standard steps required to do it properly.
