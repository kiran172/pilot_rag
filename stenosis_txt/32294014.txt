Title: Unusual Ventriculo-Arterial Alignments and Connections.

Abstract: In this issue of World Journal for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery, Kari and colleagues present a case of anatomically corrected malposition {S, L, L} with ventricular septal defect and complex subaortic stenosis managed by staged biventricular repair. This rare case with interesting management strategy provides an opportunity to clarify this and related unusual ventriculo-arterial alignments.
