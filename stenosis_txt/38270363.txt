Title: [Lipoprotein(a): relationships with atherosclerosis and valvular heart disease, and emerging therapies].

Abstract: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a well-established cardiovascular risk factor, whose relationship with atherosclerotic disease has been confirmed by epidemiological, genome-wide association, Mendelian randomization, and meta-analysis studies. This association is determined by its pro-atherogenic, pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory properties. Lp(a) is the most common monogenic risk factor for atherosclerosis, with a prevalence of about 1 in 5 people. Recently, its etiopathogenetic relationship with calcific and degenerative valvular heart diseases, particularly with aortic and mitral stenosis, has been suspected. It has not yet been demonstrated whether its reduction translates into a lower risk of cardiovascular events. Up to now, Lp(a) has been considered a non-modifiable risk factor, as current lipid-lowering drugs have limited effects on its levels. New specific lipid-lowering therapies with high efficacy in reducing circulating Lp(a) levels are being investigated in randomized trials; however, the effects of this reduction on cardiovascular outcomes are still being studied.
