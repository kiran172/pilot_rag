Title: [A Case of Squamous Cell Lung Cancer in an Elderly Patient with Low PD-L1 Expression Effectively Treated with Nab-Paclitaxel(Nab-PTX)plus Carboplatin (CBDCA)plus Pembrolizumab for a Recurrence after Operation].

Abstract: An 81-year-old man was admitted to our medical center for dyspnea. He underwent right upper lobectomy due to squamous cell lung cancer 5 years ago. Chest computed tomography(CT)revealed stenosis ofthe right main bronchus, and pathological diagnosis ofthe lesion was squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 expression was low(tumor proportion score [TPS]: 1%). Because his performance status(PS)was 1, he underwent 4 courses ofnab -paclitaxel(nab-PTX)plus carboplatin( CBDCA)plus pembrolizumab chemotherapy and pembrolizumab maintenance chemotherapy. The stenosis ofthe right main bronchus was clear after chemotherapy, and his dyspnea was improved. Chemotherapy using nab-PTX plus CBDCA plus pembrolizumab may become one of the therapeutic choices for the recurrence after operation of an elderly person with squamous cell lung carcinoma and low PD-L1 expression.
