Title: Total reversal of internal carotid blood flow in a patient with severe stenosis of the brachiocephalic trunk.

Abstract: Occlusions and severe stenoses of the innominate artery (brachiocephalic trunk) are rare and present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations, with hemispheric, vertebrobasilar and right upper limb ischemic symptoms. The most common cause is atherosclerosis. Duplex scanning may show right vertebral artery flow reversal, diminished subclavian flow, and several patterns of right carotid flow disturbance, including slow flow, partial flow reversal during the cardiac cycle and even complete reversal of flow in the internal carotid artery, which is a very uncommon finding. Herein, the authors describe the case of a female patient who was a heavy smoker, had severe stenosis of the brachiocephalic trunk, and had episodes of collapse. Besides the subclavian steal and partial flow reversal in the common carotid artery, duplex scanning also showed high-velocity reversed flow in the internal carotid artery during the entire cardiac cycle, a finding that is not reported in the literature at this magnitude.
