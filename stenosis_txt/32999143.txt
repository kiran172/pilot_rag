Title: New-Generation Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With Small Aortic Annuli　- Comparison of Balloon- and Self-Expandable Valves in Asian Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Asian patients have smaller aortic annuli. Although 20-mm balloon-expandable (BE) transcatheter heart valves (THV) are manufactured for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in these cases, the supra-annular design of self-expandable (SE) THV is considered more suitable; however, real-world comparative data are scarce.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive TAVI cases (n=330) in a single Japanese center were reviewed. Based on the cutoff for the new-generation 20-/23-mm BE-THV, a small aortic annulus was defined as &lt;330 mm2. A considerable number of patients had small annuli: 49/302 (16%). Of these, 33 BE-THV and 13 SE-THV using new-generation valves were compared. Although the SE-THV group had smaller annulus area (median 297 (interquartile range, 280-313) vs. 309 (303-323) mm2(P=0.022)), it had more favorable post-procedural parameters; for SE-THV and BE-THV, respectively, effective orifice area (EOA), 1.5 (1.3-1.6) vs. 1.1 cm2(0.9-1.3) (P=0.002); mean pressure gradient, 7.6 (5.6-11.0) vs. 14.2 mmHg (11.2-18.8) (P=0.001); and peak velocity, 1.8 (1.6-2.4) vs. 2.7 m/s (2.3-3.1) (P=0.001). Although new left bundle branch block was higher with SE-THV (24% and 62%, P=0.02), patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) ≥ moderate (indexed EOA &lt;0.85 cm2/m2) was significantly less with SE-THV than with BE-THV (8% vs. 55%; P=0.04). Hemodynamic findings were consistent up to 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Small annuli are often seen in Asian patients, for whom SE-THV implantation results in favorable hemodynamics with less PPM.
