Title: Aortic Stenosis with Other Concomitant Valvular Disease: Aortic Regurgitation, Mitral Regurgitation, Mitral Stenosis, or Tricuspid Regurgitation.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis presenting as part of a multiple valve disease scenario or as mixed valve disease is frequent. These scenarios induce hemodynamic interactions that may result in diagnostic pitfalls. Echocardiography is the cornerstone technique for diagnosis of valve disorders, but other modalities may be useful. In addition to assessment of each individual lesion, the heart valve team must integrate numerous parameters into the management strategy, including global assessment of clinical and hemodynamic effects, operative risk, life expectancy, natural history of untreated valve disease, valve reparability, and/or suitability for single or multiple transcatheter valve procedures.
