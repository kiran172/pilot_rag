Title: Efficacy of Infliximab in Experimental Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of infliximab, a TNF-α inhibitor, on epithelial damage, inflammation, and fibrosis in experimental tracheal stenosis.
METHODS: Rats were divided into 3 groups. In group 1 (the control group), no procedure was applied. Tracheotomy was opened in the other groups. The laryngotracheal mucosa of the rats was traumatized with a brush through the tracheostoma to create a stenosis model. After surgery, group 2 (the infliximab group) received 5 mg/kg infliximab intraperitoneally. In group 3 (the sham group) only 0.5 ml of saline (0.9% NaCl) was administered intraperitoneally. After 14 days, the rats were sacrificed. Tracheal rings were excised, and epithelial damage, inflammation, and fibrosis were evaluated histopathologically.
RESULTS: Infliximab reduced the formation of epithelial damage (P=0.002), fibrosis (P=0.001), and inflammation (P=0.003) compared with the sham and control group.
CONCLUSION: This was the first investigation displaying the effects of infliximab on tracheal stenosis. The authors' experimental results may offer guidance for further studies. Their experience presents novel sights into optimizing outcomes in tracheal stenosis surgery, and so paves the way for further clinical examinations.
