Title: Surgical Treatment Outcomes of Tetralogy of Fallot: Experience of the Cardiovascular Department of the Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech.

Abstract: Background Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. The surgical approach to TOF continues to evolve, with many centers now favoring early repair for TOF. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of postsurgical complications such as pulmonary insufficiency, residual pulmonary stenosis, and interventricular communication. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study with a descriptive and analytic focus involving 61 patients who were operated on for TOF. Results In total, 39 (63.9%) patients had a regular TOF and 22 (36.1%) had an irregular TOF. In our study, 32 (56.14%) patients had a pulmonary insufficiency, of whom 20 had a minimal pulmonary insufficiency (62.5% of pulmonary insufficiency cases), and 79.4% of patients with right ventricular outflow tract enlargement had pulmonary insufficiency (p < 0.005). Among patients who did not have a right ventricular outflow tract enlargement, three cases of pulmonary insufficiency were identified with a prevalence of 16.6%. Six (10.52%) patients had residual pulmonary stenosis. In addition, two (3.2%) cases of minimal residual ventricular septal defects were identified in this study. Conclusions Postoperative complications of TOF treatment are frequent and require medical care throughout the lifetime of patients.
