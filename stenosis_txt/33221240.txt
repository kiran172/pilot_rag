Title: Structural and Functional Correlates of Gradient-Area Patterns in Severe Aortic Stenosis and Normal Ejection Fraction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to characterize the functional and structural myocardial phenotypes of patients with moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS) and to determine whether severe paradoxical low-gradient AS (LG-AS) is specifically associated with left ventricular (LV) remodeling and fibrosis.
BACKGROUND: Recently, it was suggested that severe paradoxical LG-AS is a more advanced form of AS, with greater reduction of longitudinal deformation, adverse LV remodeling, and more interstitial fibrosis.
METHODS: The study population includes 147 patients with moderate-to-severe AS and a normal LV ejection fraction, and 75 normal control subjects. They prospectively underwent 2-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance to evaluate myocardial deformation, LV remodeling, and age- and sex-adjusted extravascular volume fraction (ECV, %). Among AS patients, 18 had moderate AS, 74 had severe high-gradient AS (HG-AS), and 55 had severe paradoxical LG-AS.
RESULTS: Reduced longitudinal and circumferential deformation was observed in 21% and 6% of the AS patients, respectively. Multivariate analyses identified increased ECV (ß = 1.99; p = 0.001) and the absence of normal LV geometry (ß = -1.37; p = 0.007) and as independent predictors of reduced longitudinal deformation. Increased ECV was an independent predictor of reduced circumferential deformation (ß = 2.19; p = 0.001). Over a median follow-up of 29 months, reduced longitudinal deformation (hazard ratio: 0.82; p = 0.023) and higher transvalvular gradients (hazard ratio: 1.05; p < 0.001) increased the risk of death or need for aortic valve replacement. LV hypertrophy was more frequently observed among patients with severe HG-AS (65%) than among the other AS patients (14%; p < 0.001). On average, ECV was within normal limits and did not differ among gradient-area subgroups. When present, increased ECV was associated with reduced longitudinal deformation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's data show that patients with severe paradoxical LG-AS less frequently display reduced longitudinal deformation, LV hypertrophy, or myocardial fibrosis than patients with HG-AS. Also, interstitial fibrosis only occurs when reduced longitudinal deformation and severe HG-AS are present together. Finally, this study suggests that reduced longitudinal deformation and higher transvalvular gradients adversely affect patients' outcomes.
