Title: Cervical Vagal Schwannoma Causing Asymptomatic Internal Carotid Artery Compression.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Schwannoma originating from the cervical vagus nerve is a rare neoplasm. Vagal nerve schwannoma (VNS) usually occurs between the third and fifth decades of life.
METHODS: We operated one patient for cervical schwannoma causing internal carotid artery (ICA) compression.
RESULTS: The patient underwent en bloc excision via transcervical approach under general anesthesia. Pathological examination demonstrated the diagnosis of schwannoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case shows that VNS can cause ICA compression and therefore brain ischemia.
