Title: Fractal dimension of the aortic annulus: a novel predictor of paravalvular leak after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: To evaluate the prognostic relevance of aortic annulus (AA) and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) Fractal dimension (FD). FD is a mathematical concept that describes geometric complexity of a structure and has been shown to predict adverse outcomes in several contexts. Computed tomography (CT) scans from the SOLVE-TAVI trial, which, in a 2 × 2 factorial design, randomized 447 patients to TAVI with the balloon-expandable Edwards Sapien 3 or the self-expanding Medtronic Evolut R, and conscious sedation or general anesthesia, were analyzed semi-automatically with a custom-built software to determine border of AA and LVOT. FD was measured by box counting using grid calibers between 0.8 and 6.75 mm and was compared between patients with none/trivial and mild/moderate paravalvular regurgitation (PVR). Overall, 122 patients had CT scans sufficient for semi-automatic PVR in 30-day echocardiography. PVR was none in 65(53.3%) patients, trace in 9(7.4%), mild in 46(37.7%), moderate in 2(1.6%) and severe in 0 patients. FD determined in diastolic images was significantly higher in patients with mild/moderate PVR (1.0558 ± 0.0289 vs. 1.0401 ± 0.0284, p = 0.017). Annulus eccentricity was the only conventional measure of AA and LVOT geometry significantly correlated to FD (R = 0.337, p < 0.01). Area under the curve (AUC) of diastolic annular FD for prediction of mild/moderate PVR in ROC analysis was 0.661 (0.542-0.779, p = 0.014). FD shows promise in prediction of PVR after TAVI. Further evaluation using larger patient numbers and refined algorithms to better understand its predictive performance is warranted.Trial Registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov , identifier: NCT02737150, date of registration: 13.04.2016.
