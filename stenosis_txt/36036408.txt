Title: [Therapy of moderate cognitive impairment and asthenia in patients with cerebrovascular pathology: results of a prospective observational study].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Obtaining additional data on the efficacy and safety of the drug Prospekta in the treatment of moderate cognitive impairment (MCI) and asthenia in patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective observational study in more than 40 Russian cities enrolled 232 patients (mean age 61.5Â±10.0 years) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), asthenia on ongoing basic nootropic therapy. The presence of MCI was confirmed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), asthenia - by 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS). All patients were prescribed the nootropic medication Prospekta 2 tablets 2 times a day for 8 weeks in addition to the therapy they received. Ultrasound Doppler sonography of the main arteries of the head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were also assessed. At the end of treatment, the Clinical Global Impression Efficacy Index (CGI-EI) was assessed and the safety of the treatment was evaluated.
RESULTS: The baseline severity of cognitive impairment according to the MoCA scale was 21.6 points, severity of asthenia according to the VAS was 6.3 points. According to Doppler flowmetry findings, hemodynamically significant stenosis was revealed in 105 (49.3%) patients, and narrowing of the main vessels without changes in hemodynamic parameters was revealed in 108 (50.7%) patients. According to MRI results, single vascular lesions in the brain matter were detected in 102 (44.0%) patients. The medications with nootropic effect were administered to 144 (62.1%) patients. A positive therapeutic response as improvement of cognitive functions was seen in 93.3% of patients after 8 weeks of taking Prospekta, including 39.4% of patients who had cognitive functions restored to the normal level. No side effects were registered during the observational study.
CONCLUSIONS: The nootropic medication Prospekta is effective and safe in treatment of MCI in patients with asthenia with CVD, and improves cognitive function in patients with asthenia with CVD, both in monotherapy and in combination with other nootropic agents.
