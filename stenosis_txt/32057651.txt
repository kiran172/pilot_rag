Title: Identification of the Distal End of Carotid Plaque Using 3-Dimensional Fast Spin Echo T1-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Plaque Imaging.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complete removal of the distal end of the plaque is an important requirement in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) to avoid postoperative complication. Preoperative identification of the distal end of plaque contributes to complete plaque removal. Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) plaque imaging has been widely used to evaluate carotid plaque characterization. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether preoperative 3D fast spin echo (FSE) T1-weighted MR plaque imaging could identify the distal end of carotid plaque.
METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective cohort study. We examined 50 patients with cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis who underwent CEA. 3D-FSE T1-weighted MR plaque imaging of the affected carotid bifurcation was preoperatively performed using a 1.5-T scanner. Identification of the distal end of plaque (DE<sub>MRI</sub>) on MR plaque imaging was performed and the distance from the baseline (Distance<sub>MRI</sub>) was measured. Intraoperatively, the superimposed distal end of carotid plaque (E<sub>sim</sub>) was marked on the ICA according to the measurement on MR plaque imaging. The actual distal end of plaque (DE<sub>CEA</sub>) was then identified after arteriotomy and the difference (Difference<sub>CEA-MRI</sub>) between E<sub>sim</sub> and DE<sub>CEA</sub> was measured. Contrast ratio of carotid plaque and tortuosity of the ICA were calculated using MR plaque imaging.
RESULTS: Interobserver agreements in measurement of Distance<sub>MRI</sub> were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient, .955; 95% confidence interval, .922-.974). In 28 patients (56%), E<sub>sim</sub> was identical to DE<sub>CEA</sub>. Mean Difference<sub>CEA-MRI</sub> was 1.32 ± 1.77 mm. Difference<sub>CEA-MRI</sub> was significantly greater with fibrotic plaque (4.14 ± 1.21 mm) than with lipid-rich or necrotic plaque (.43 ± .87 mm; P &lt; .05) or hemorrhagic plaque (1.27 ± 1.64 mm; P &lt; .05). Mean Difference<sub>CEA-MRI</sub> was significantly greater in the group with tortuosity of the ICA less than 120° (3.86 ± 1.77 mm) than in the group with greater than or equal to 120° but less than or equal to 150° (1.15 ± 1.51 mm; P &lt; .05) or greater than150° (0.50 ± 1.10 mm; P &lt; .05). No patients showed residual stenosis after surgery on postoperative MR angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: Using 3D-FSE T1-weighted MR plaque imaging allowed identification of the distal end of carotid plaque and contributed to complete removal of the plaque, although it may be reduced for cases with low-signal-intensity plaque or severe tortuosity of the ICA.
