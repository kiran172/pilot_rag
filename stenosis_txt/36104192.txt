Title: Pyometra and Pyogenic Spondylitis with Suspected Involvement of Diverticulitis of the Sigmoid Colon.

Abstract: Pyometra is a rare disease in which pus accumulates in the uterus and is typically caused by stenosis of the cervix. Only a few case reports have indicated that diverticular disease causes pyometra. We herein report an 83-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a fever, loss of appetite, general fatigue and back pain. After some inspections, she was diagnosed with pyometra and lumbar pyogenic spondylitis secondary to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon. We performed transvaginal drainage and continued antibiotic administration for about three months. The pyometra and pyogenic spondylitis successfully resolved, and she did not experience any recurrence.
