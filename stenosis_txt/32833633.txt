Title: Carotid Plaque Fibrous Cap Thickness Measurement by ARFI Variance of Acceleration: In Vivo Human Results.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of an acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)-based outcome parameter, the decadic logarithm of the variance of acceleration, or log(VoA), for measuring carotid fibrous cap thickness. Carotid plaque fibrous cap thickness measurement by log(VoA) was compared to that by ARFI peak displacement (PD) in patients undergoing clinically indicated carotid endarterectomy using a spatially-matched histological validation standard. Fibrous caps in parametric log(VoA) and PD images were automatically segmented using a custom clustering algorithm, and a pathologist with expertise in atherosclerosis hand-delineated fibrous caps in histology. Over 10 fibrous caps, log(VoA)-derived thickness was more strongly correlated to histological thickness than PD-derived thickness, with Pearson correlation values of 0.98 for log(VoA) compared to 0.89 for PD. The log(VoA)-derived cap thickness also had better agreement with histology-measured thickness, as assessed by the concordance correlation coefficient (0.95 versus 0.62), and, by Bland-Altman analysis, was more consistent than PD-derived fibrous cap thickness. These results suggest that ARFI log(VoA) enables improved discrimination of fibrous cap thickness relative to ARFI PD and further contributes to the growing body of evidence demonstrating ARFI's overall relevance to delineating the structure and composition of carotid atherosclerotic plaque for stroke risk prediction.
