Title: Anesthetic management in a patient with severe tracheal stenosis by monitoring oxygen reserve index.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: General anesthesia for tracheal stenting is challenging because of difficult ventilation and accompanying hypoxia. We report the use of oxygen reserve index (ORi™) during tracheal stenting.
CASE PRESENTATION: Cauterization of an intratracheal tumor and tracheal stenting was scheduled in a patient. ORi decreased from 0.3 to 0.2 after starting cauterization using a flexible bronchoscope through a tracheal tube with 28% oxygen, while SpO<sub>2</sub> was maintained at 100%. ORi further decreased to 0, followed by a decrease of SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 90%, and surgery was interrupted. SpO<sub>2</sub> was increased shortly after increasing FiO<sub>2</sub> to 1.0, but ORi remained 0 when surgery was resumed; it was increased after completion of cauterization. Both ORi and SpO<sub>2</sub> were maintained above 0.4 and 98%, respectively, during tracheal stenting through a rigid bronchoscope under intrapulmonary percussive ventilation.
CONCLUSION: ORi was useful for predicting a decrease of SpO<sub>2</sub> under general anesthesia for tracheal stenting.
