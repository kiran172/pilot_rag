Title: Prevalence and clinical characteristics of renovascular hypertension associated with fibromuscular dysplasia in China.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in patients in China and identify the cure rate of hypertension after angioplasty.
METHODS: Consecutive hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis caused by FMD who underwent catheter-based angiography, and were followed at two Chinese referral centres, were retrospectively analysed. All patients underwent a detailed investigation, including demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, biochemical sampling, Doppler ultrasonography of carotid arteries, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intracranial artery, and CTA or MRA of the abdominal artery and catheter-based renal angiography. Patients were routinely followed up at 1 month, 6 months and every year after the procedure.
RESULTS: Among 245 study participants, with a mean diagnosed age of 26.9 ± 9.9 years, 137 (55.9%) were women, and 38 (15.5%) were children. All patients were diagnosed with hypertension at a mean age of 23.4 ± 8.4 years. There were 73.5% focal and 15.2% multivessel cases. Aneurysms, arterial dissections and total occlusions were found in 21.6, 4.1 and 12.2% of patients, respectively. Patients with multifocal FMD were older (26.0 vs. 23.7 years, P  = 0.021) and more often female (70.8 vs. 50.6%, P  = 0.004). Among children with renal FMD, 55.2% were men, and 86.8% were focal. After a median follow-up of 7.0 years, multifocal FMD had a higher cure rate of hypertension than focal FMD after revascularization (71.7 vs. 55.8%, P  = 0.032).
CONCLUSION: In a cohort of mostly young Chinese patients, the prevalence of hypertension associated with renal FMD is similar in both sexes. Focal FMDs were more frequent than the multifocal ones and, after angioplasty, were associated with a worse blood pressure outcome.
