Title: Myocardical Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA): pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: The term MINOCA (Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries) refers to myocardial infarction cases where coronary arteries exhibit less than 50 % stenosis. MINOCA encompasses a diverse range of pathologies with varying etiologies. Diagnosis involves meeting acute myocardial infarction criteria and excluding other causes (myocarditis, takotsubo syndrome). Clinical features often resemble those of traditional myocardial infarction, but MINOCA patients tend to be younger and more frequently female. Etiological investigations include coronary angiography, intracoronary imaging, and vasomotor function tests. Causes include plaque rupture, coronary dissection, vasospasm, microvascular dysfunction, thromboembolism. Prognosis varies, with some subsets at higher risk. Management involves a tailored approach addressing underlying causes, with emphasis on cardioprotective therapy, risk factor modification, and lifestyle interventions. Further research is needed to refine diagnostic strategies and optimize therapeutic approaches in MINOCA patients.
