Title: Diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of central nervous system vasculitis: an evaluation of vessel-wall MRI findings.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To approach the clinical value of MRI with vessel wall imaging (VWI) in patients with central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV), we analyzed patterns of VWI findings both at the time of initial presentation and during follow-up.
METHODS: Stenoocclusive lesions, vessel-wall contrast enhancement (VW-CE) and diffusion-restricted lesions were analyzed in patients with a diagnosis of CNSV. On available VWI follow-up, progression, regression or stability of VW-CE were evaluated and correlated with the clinical status.
RESULTS: Of the 45 patients included, 28 exhibited stenoses visible on MR angiography (MRA-positive) while 17 had no stenosis (MRA-negative). VW-CE was found in 2/17 MRA-negative and all MRA-positive patients (p < 0.05). 79.1% (53/67) of stenoses showed VW-CE. VW-CE was concentric in 88.3% and eccentric in 11.7% of cases. Diffusion-restricted lesions were found more frequently in relation to stenoses with VW-CE than without VW-CE (p < 0.05). 48 VW-CE lesions in 23 patients were followed over a median time of 239.5 days. 13 VW-CE lesions (27.1%) resolved completely, 14 (29.2%) showed partial regression, 17 (35.4%) remained stable and 4 (8.3%) progressed. 22/23 patients received immunosuppressive therapy for the duration of follow-up. Patients with stable or progressive VW-CE were more likely (p < 0.05) to have a relapse (14/30 cases) than patients with partial or complete regression of VW-CE (5/25 cases).
CONCLUSION: Concentric VW-CE is a common finding in medium/large-sized vessel CNSV. VW-CE might represent active inflammation in certain situations. However, follow-up VWI findings proved ambiguous as persisting VW-CE despite immunosuppressive therapy and clinical remission was a frequent finding.
