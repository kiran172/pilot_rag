Title: Evaluation of myocardial perfusion and systolic function in patients with different degree of coronary artery stenosis by MCE and 2D-STI.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To study myocardial perfusion and systolic function in patients with different coronary artery stenosis by myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) and two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging (2D-STI).
METHODS: MCE, 2D-STI and coronary angiography were conducted in patients with coronary heart disease in our hospital. Myocardial segments were divided into 4 groups according to the degree of coronary artery stenosis: group A (normal group), group B (mild stenosis, 50%-75%), group C (moderate stenosis, 76%-90%) and group D (severe stenosis, 91%-100%). Blood volume, blood flow velocity, blood flow and longitudinal myocardial strain value (SL) in each group were measured by analysis software for MCE and 2D-STI. The differences in blood volume, blood flow velocity, blood flow and SL were evaluated.
RESULTS: The blood flow velocity and blood flow in B, C and D groups were decreased gradually, with significant difference (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in blood volume, blood flow velocity, blood flow between group A and group B (P&gt;0.05). There were significant differences in SL among the 4 groups (P&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There is a good correlation between coronary stenosis degree and myocardial perfusion or systolic function. The ability of 2D-STI to detect mild stenosis of coronary artery is better than MCE.
