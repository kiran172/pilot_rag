Title: Assessment of perioperative cardiac risk using preoperative quantitative flow ratio in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing noncardiac surgery: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a novel diagnostic modality for the functional testing of coronary artery stenosis, but evidence concerning the postoperative prognostic implication of QFR in noncardiac surgery (NCS) of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of QFR in perioperative risk prediction in patients with coronary heart disease.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University between 2013 and 2022, and consecutively included patients with CAD who had undergone NCS <1 year after coronary angiography. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), which were defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, cardiopulmonary arrest, malignant ventricular arrhythmia (MVA), congestive heart failure, and revascularization. Univariate and multifactorial Cox regression was used to identify the independent risk factors for perioperative cardiovascular events and to construct new models. The area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to compare the newly constructed model with existing traditional models.
RESULTS: Among the 929 participants enrolled (median age 68 years; 72.0% male), the primary endpoint was met in 67 (7.2%) patients within 30 days of follow-up. There was no significant difference in the incidence of the primary endpoint between patients with QFR &lt;0.75 and those with "gray zone" lesions (0.75≤ QFR ≤0.8) (log-rank P=0.325). Patients with QFR &lt;0.75 and those with "gray zone" lesions (0.75≤ QFR ≤0.8) had a higher incidence of primary endpoint events compared to patients with QFR &gt;0.8. [QFR &lt;0.75 vs. QFR &gt;0.8: adjusted hazard ratio (HR) =20.70, P&lt;0.001; 0.75≤ QFR ≤0.8 vs. QFR &gt;0.8: HR =15.99, P&lt;0.001]. The independent predictors of MACEs events within 30 days after NCS were albumin level [HR =0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87-0.98; P=0.008], emergency surgery (HR =4.12, 95% CI: 1.66-10.23; P=0.002), and QFR ≤0.8 (HR =15.92, 95% CI: 5.96-42.51; P&lt;0.001). In addition, adjusting the original Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) with QFR ≤0.8 as a risk factor significantly improved the risk stratification of postoperative adverse events, with the adjusted AUC rising from 0.574 to 0.740 (P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: QFR ≤0.8 could independently predict perioperative cardiovascular adverse events in patients with CAD undergoing NCS and improve the predictive value of original predictive index. Gray-zone lesions (0.75≤ QFR ≤0.8) should be actively treated.
