Title: Rat Model of External Auditory Canal Stenosis.

Abstract: HYPOTHESIS: Circumferential electrocautery injury of the rat external auditory canal (EAC) can induce a reproducible animal model of acquired stenosis.
BACKGROUND: Acquired EAC stenosis may occur as a result of chronic inflammation or trauma to the EAC skin and is characterized by narrowing of the EAC, retention of debris, and hearing loss. Treatment is surgery but it is often complicated by restenosis. A reliable and inexpensive animal model of EAC stenosis has not been described. There have been no studies correlating the extent of EAC injury with the extent of stenosis.
METHODS: Rats received a 25, 50, or 75% circumferential EAC injury with electrocautery. The extent of resulting stenosis was quantified 21 days following injury. The nature of the injury and healing response was assessed with histology.
RESULTS: A 25% circumferential injury led to 4 to 34% stenosis (mean, 13%), 50% injury resulted in 43 to 100% stenosis (mean, 73%), and 75% injury resulted in 94 to 100% stenosis (mean=99%, p < 0.0001). The 50% circumferential injury produced 30 to 75% stenosis in five of eight ears, the remainder had >75% stenosis. Wounded ears showed evidence of intact cartilage and epithelium, with increased thickness of the subepithelial layer and localized fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Electrocautery injury in the ventral aspect of the rat EAC resulted in reproducible EAC stenosis. This rat model may be useful in studying therapy to prevent acquired EAC stenosis due to acute injury. The correlation of the extent of injury (circumference) with resulting stenosis may inform clinical management of EAC injuries.
