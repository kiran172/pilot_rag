Title: Ross procedure in neonates and infants: A valuable operation with defined limits.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The Ross procedure is an important tool that offers autologous tissue repair for severe left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) pathology. Previous reports show that risk of mortality is highest among neonates and infants. We analyzed our institutional experience within this patient cohort to identify factors that most affect clinical outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified all Ross operations in neonates and infants at our institution over 27 years. The entire study population was analyzed to determine risk factors for mortality and define outcomes for survival and reintervention.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients underwent a Ross operation at a median age of 63 (range, 9-156) days. Eighteen (31%) were neonates. Eleven (19%) patients died before hospital discharge. Multiple regression analysis of the entire cohort identified young age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.037; P = .0045), Shone complex (HR, 17.637; P = .009), and interrupted aortic arch with ventricular septal defect (HR, 16.01; P = .031) as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic analysis (area under the curve, 0.752) indicated age younger than 84 days to be the inflection point at which mortality risk increases. Of the 47 survivors, there were 2 late deaths with a mean follow-up of 6.7 (range, 2.1-13.1) years. Three patients (6%) required LVOT reintervention at 3, 8, and 17.5 years, respectively, and 26 (55%) underwent right ventricular outflow tract reintervention at a median of 6 (range, 2.5-10.3) years.
CONCLUSIONS: Ross procedure is effective in children less than one year of age with left sided obstructive disease isolated to the aortic valve and/or aortic arch. Patients less than 3 months of age with Shone or IAA/VSD are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality. Survivors experience excellent intermediate-term freedom from LVOT reintervention.
