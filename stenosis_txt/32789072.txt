Title: An Unusual Presentation of Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome.

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare benign condition typically affecting young females. It usually presents with abdominal symptoms of pain, nausea, and unintentional weight loss. They are usually diagnosed incidentally on CT of the abdomen done for abdominal pain. Here we present a rare case of MALS which presented with an anginal type of chest pain without any abdominal symptoms leading to an extensive workup and incidental diagnosis.
