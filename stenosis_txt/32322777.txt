Title: Concomitant transcarotid artery revascularization and transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Concomitant carotid artery disease and aortic valve disease is common. Whereas carotid stenosis does not appear to have an effect on outcomes of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, the management of a patient with symptomatic carotid disease and severe aortic stenosis is challenging. The advent of minimally invasive endovascular techniques has provided less invasive and effective treatment options for these respective conditions. In this report, we describe two cases of patients successfully treated with concomitant transcatheter aortic valve replacement and transcarotid artery revascularization.
