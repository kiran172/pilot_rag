Title: Prevalence and Outcomes of Concomitant Aortic Stenosis and Cardiac Amyloidosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Older patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) are increasingly identified as having cardiac amyloidosis (CA). It is unknown whether concomitant AS-CA has worse outcomes or results in futility of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVES: This study identified clinical characteristics and outcomes of AS-CA compared with lone AS.
METHODS: Patients who were referred for TAVR at 3 international sites underwent blinded research core laboratory 99mtechnetium-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) bone scintigraphy (Perugini grade 0: negative; grades 1 to 3: increasingly positive) before intervention. Transthyretin-CA (ATTR) was diagnosed by DPD and absence of a clonal immunoglobulin, and light-chain CA (AL) was diagnosed via tissue biopsy. National registries captured all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 407 patients (age 83.4 ± 6.5 years; 49.8% men) were recruited. DPD was positive in 48 patients (11.8%; grade 1: 3.9% [n = 16]; grade 2/3: 7.9% [n = 32]). AL was diagnosed in 1 patient with grade 1. Patients with grade 2/3 had worse functional capacity, biomarkers (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and/or high-sensitivity troponin T), and biventricular remodeling. A clinical score (RAISE) that used left ventricular remodeling (hypertrophy/diastolic dysfunction), age, injury (high-sensitivity troponin T), systemic involvement, and electrical abnormalities (right bundle branch block/low voltages) was developed to predict the presence of AS-CA (area under the curve: 0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.78 to 0.94; p < 0.001). Decisions by the heart team (DPD-blinded) resulted in TAVR (333 [81.6%]), surgical AVR (10 [2.5%]), or medical management (65 [15.9%]). After a median of 1.7 years, 23% of patients died. One-year mortality was worse in all patients with AS-CA (grade: 1 to 3) than those with lone AS (24.5% vs. 13.9%; p = 0.05). TAVR improved survival versus medical management; AS-CA survival post-TAVR did not differ from lone AS (p = 0.36).
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant pathology of AS-CA is common in older patients with AS and can be predicted clinically. AS-CA has worse clinical presentation and a trend toward worse prognosis, unless treated. Therefore, TAVR should not be withheld in AS-CA.
