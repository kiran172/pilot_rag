Title: Synchronous Type 3 EVAR Endoleaks at Multiple Sites Following Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: We describe a complication following transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a patient who underwent remote endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. This report highlights technical complications to be vigilant of when using intravascular catheterization in patients with previous aneurysm repair while also showcasing synchronous type 3 endoleaks at multiple sites. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
