Title: Endovascular treatment of re-stenotic iliac artery stents with drug-eluting balloons.

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the results of revascularization of stenotic iliac stents using drug-eluting balloons (DEBs).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with various levels of iliac stent restenosis were enrolled to study. All restenotic stents were treated using paclitaxel-coated balloons.
RESULTS: Through a follow-up median period of 24 months (4-24 months), there were no in-stent re-restenosis in 55 patients (74.3%) and there was one in class 1 (1.4%), four in class 2 (5.4%), and fourteen in class 3 (18.9%).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that; DEBs can be used for restenotic iliac artery stents for some Type C and D lesions, in addition to Types A and B with satisfacting results.
