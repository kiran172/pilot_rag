Title: [Therapeutic revolution in the treatment of aortic stenosis : transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI )].

Abstract: Eighteen years after the birth of the concept, TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) has established itself as the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients with severe aortic valve stenosis at high surgical risk. Unlike surgical prosthesis, the benefit of which has been validated in observational studies, indications for TAVI are now based on the results of large randomized trials. The TAVI revolution continues today with the miniaturization of the equipment, the development of new closure systems, the availability of a wider range of prosthesis sizes and the growing experience of operators, all contributing to the widening of indications to lower risk patients.
