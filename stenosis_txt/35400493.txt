Title: Outcomes of the arterial switch operation in patients with inverted coronary artery anatomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Patients undergoing the arterial switch operation (ASO) with inverted coronary anatomy represent a technical challenge. We sought to determine the long-term outcomes of patients with inverted coronary anatomy who underwent an ASO.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent an ASO with inverted coronary anatomy at a single institution was performed and comparison was made between patients with inverted and normal coronary anatomy.
RESULTS: There were 43 (5.1% [43 out of 844]) patients with inverted coronary anatomy. Twenty patients (46.5% [20 out of 43]) had a right coronary artery that arises from sinus 1 and the left anterior descending and circumflex coronaries arise from sinus 2 anatomy and 23 (53.5% [23 out of 43]) patients with right coronary artery that arises from sinus 1 and gives rise to the left anterior descending with the circumflex coronaries arising from sinus 2. Median follow-up was 17 years (interquartile range, 12-21 years). Overall early mortality was 7.0% (3 out of 43) compared with 3.1% (17 out of 556) in patients with normal coronary anatomy undergoing operation over the same time period (P = .17). There were 2 (10% [2 out of 20]) early deaths in the right coronary artery that arises from sinus 1 and gives rise to the left anterior descending with the circumflex coronaries arising from sinus 2 group and 1 (4.3% [1 out of 23]) early death in the right coronary artery that arises from sinus 1 and the left anterior descending and circumflex coronaries arise from sinus 2 group. There was 1 late death occurring at 40 days after ASO. Nine (23% [9 out of 39]) patients had 15 reinterventions occurring at median 3.6 years (interquartile range, 1.1-8.2 years). The most common cause of reintervention was main or branch pulmonary artery stenosis (15% [6 out of 39]). Freedom from reintervention was 78% (95% CI, 68%-93%) and 75% (95% CI, 56%-86%) at 10 and 15 years, respectively. At final follow-up, all surviving local patients except 1 was in New York Heart Association functional class I.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with inverted coronary anatomy who underwent an ASO had a higher mortality but this was not statistically significant. However, there were no coronary reinterventions in survivors.
