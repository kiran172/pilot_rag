Title: Changes in aortic valve replacement procedures in Denmark from 2008 to 2020.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Since 2007, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has emerged as another treatment strategy for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The objectives were to compare annual rates of aortic valve replacement (AVR) procedures performed in Denmark in the era of TAVI and to assess proportion of AVRs stratified by age with use of age recommendations presented in current guidelines.
METHODS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified first-time AVRs between 2008 and 2020. Patients who were not diagnosed with AS prior to AVR were excluded RESULTS: The rate of AVRs increased by 39% per million inhabitants from 2008 to 2020. TAVI has steadily increased since 2008, accounting for 64.2% of all AVRs and 72.5% of isolated AVRs by 2020. Number of isolated SAVRs decreased from 2014 and onwards. The proportion of TAVI increased significantly across age groups (&lt;75 and ≥75 years of age, p<sub>trend</sub>&lt;0.001), and TAVI accounted for 91.5% of isolated AVR procedures in elderly patients (aged ≥75 years). Length of hospital stay were significantly reduced for all AVRs during the study period (p<sub>trend</sub> all&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The number of AVRs increased from 2008 to 2020 due to adaptation of TAVI, which represented 2/3 of AVRs and more than 70% of isolated AVRs. In elderly patients, the increased use of AVR procedures was driven by TAVI, in agreement with the age recommendations in current guidelines; however, TAVI was used more frequently in patients aged <75 years, accompanied by a flattening use of SAVR.
