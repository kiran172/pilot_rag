Title: Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Valve Stenosis: The Role of Non-Invasive Imaging.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is the most common heart valve disease necessitating surgical or percutaneous intervention. Imaging has a central role for the initial diagnostic work-up, the follow-up and the selection of the optimal timing and type of intervention. Referral for aortic valve replacement is currently driven by the severity and by the presence of aortic stenosis-related symptoms or signs of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. This review aims to provide an update of the imaging techniques and seeks to highlight a practical approach to help clinical decision making.
