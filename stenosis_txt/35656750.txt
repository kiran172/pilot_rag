Title: Pulsatile tinnitus due to stenosis of the supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid artery: Management with a low-profile self-expanding stent.

Abstract: Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery is a rare cause of pulsatile tinnitus. Stenosis responsible for tinnitus is usually located in the petrous segment of the vessel or, even more uncommonly, in the extracranial segment. However, to the best of our knowledge, a stenosis of the intradural supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid had never been reported as a source of pulsatile tinnitus. We describe the case of a man with a history of previous ischaemic stroke and invalidating pulsatile tinnitus, caused by a high grade, diaphragm-like shaped, stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery. The stenosis was treated with angioplasty and stenting with a low-profile self-expanding high radial force stent (Acclino flex HRF, Acandis). Tinnitus disappeared immediately after the procedure. At the two-year follow-up no recurrence of the tinnitus and the stenosis occurred. Intradural internal carotid artery stenosis should be considered as a very rare cause of pulsatile tinnitus.
