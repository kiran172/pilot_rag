Title: Carotid Web as an Embolic Source of Acute Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid webs are shelf-like projections of the carotid bulb lumen associated with ipsilateral ischemic stroke in young patients. Given its rarity, a limited number of studies have evaluated the optimal management of symptomatic carotid webs to prevent further ischemic stroke.
CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old Caucasian man presented with a sudden onset of left-sided facial droop, hemiparesis, and dysarthria. Computed tomography angiography revealed occlusion of the distal M1 and proximal M2 segments of the right middle cerebral artery and a small intimal flap at the right internal carotid artery origin. Intravenous alteplase was administered without clinical improvement. The patient underwent successful mechanical thrombectomy with complete revascularization of the middle cerebral artery and no residual neurologic deficits. Magnetic resonance angiography confirmed a curvilinear, shelf-like projection from the right carotid bulb posterior wall, consistent with a carotid web. The patient underwent carotid endarterectomy with no complications and was discharged home with no residual deficits or recurrence of stroke.
CONCLUSION: No randomized, controlled prospective studies have compared the efficacy of endarterectomy to carotid artery stenting in patients with symptomatic carotid web. This case emphasizes the importance of considering carotid web as an embolic source of stroke in the young and provides support for revascularization as a safe and effective mean of secondary stroke prevention.
