Title: Atherosclerosis in patients with cervical artery dissection.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is considered a non-atherosclerotic arteriopathy, but atherosclerosis of the cervical arteries may co-exist. We explored the frequency and clinical importance of co-existent atherosclerosis in patients with CeAD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single-center exploratory study from the Stroke Center Basel, Switzerland. We re-reviewed duplex ultrasound images at (i) baseline and (ii) last follow-up visit for the presence versus absence of the following atherosclerotic manifestations in the carotid arteries: (i) abnormal carotid intima-media thickness, (ii) plaques, and (iii) atherosclerotic stenosis. We investigated whether CeAD patients with versus without co-existing atherosclerosis differ regarding (a) recurrence of CeAD and (b) occurrence of vascular events (myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or ischemic stroke) using logistic regression with adjustment for age and follow-up time.
RESULTS: Among 294 CeAD patients (median age 46 [IQR 37-53], 41.8% women), 35 (12%) had any atherosclerotic signs at baseline. Among 196 patients with available follow-up, another 21/196 (11%) patients developed atherosclerosis during a median follow-up of 55.7 months. Patients with atherosclerosis had decreased odds of recurrent CeADs when compared to patients without atherosclerosis (OR 0.03, 95% CI = 0.00-0.30). During follow-up, 6 (15%) vascular events occurred among 40 CeAD patients with atherosclerosis and 13 (8.5%) among 153 patients without atherosclerosis (OR 1.38, 95% CI = 0.39-4.55, data for 3 patients were missing).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Signs of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery were detectable in 12% of CeAD patient at baseline. Additionally, 11% of CeAD patients developed new signs of atherosclerosis within the following 5 years. The presence of atherosclerosis may suggest a lower risk for recurrent CeAD. Whether it might indicate an increased risk for late clinical vascular events deserves further studies.
