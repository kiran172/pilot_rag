Title: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Feature Tracking in Aortic Stenosis: Exploration of Strain Parameters and Prognostic Value in Asymptomatic Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the most valuable cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) parameters for evaluating aortic stenosis (AS) and determine whether they can predict the prognosis in asymptomatic AS patients with preserved ejection fraction (pEF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of 123 moderate to severe AS patients (60 males, 68.6 ± 9.2 years) and 32 control subjects (14 males, 67.9 ± 4.4 years) underwent echocardiography and 3T CMR imaging from 2011-2015. CMR cine images were analyzed using CMR-FT to assess the left ventricular radial, circumferential, and longitudinal peak strain (PS) in 2- and 3-dimensions. The primary endpoints were clinical cardiac events (CCEs), including cardiac death, heart failure, and AS-associated symptom development. For statistical analysis, logistic regression and log-rank tests were used.
RESULTS: Global PSs differed between AS patients and controls and between severe and moderate AS patients (p &lt; 0.05). Two-dimensional (2D) global radial and longitudinal PSs changed gradually with the severity of AS groups (p &lt; 0.001). Twenty-two of 67 asymptomatic AS patients with pEF experienced CCEs during the follow-up (median: 31.1 months). 2D global longitudinal PS (GLPS) was the single risk factor for CCE (p = 0.017). The relative risk for CCE was 3.9 (p = 0.016, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-11.9) based on 2D GLPS with a cutoff of -17.9% according to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Survival analysis demonstrated that asymptomatic AS patients with pEF having impaired 2D GLPS experienced worse event-free survival than the others (p = 0.041).
CONCLUSION: 2D global longitudinal and radial PSs may reflect cardiac dysfunction according to the degree of AS. 2D GLPS might be a prognostic predictor of CCEs in asymptomatic AS patients with pEF.
