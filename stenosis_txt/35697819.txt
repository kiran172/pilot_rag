Title: The Glasgow Prognostic Score and stricture site can predict prognosis after endoscopic duodenal stent placement for malignant gastric outlet obstruction.

Abstract: Endoscopic duodenal stent (DS) placement for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is rapidly increasing in clinical practice; however, the most suitable patient candidates for DS placement have not been determined. One hundred and thirty-five patients with GOO who underwent DS placement in three Japanese referral centers between January 2010 and October 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Overall survival (OS) after DS placement, technical/clinical success rates, adverse events, and predictive factors affecting OS after DS placement were also analyzed. The median OS after DS placement of all patients was 81 (7-901) days. Technical and clinical success rates were 99.3% and 83.7%, respectively. The GOO Scoring System score significantly increased before and after DS placement (0.9 vs. 2.7, P < 0.001). The procedure-related complication rate was 6.0%. All 19 patients (14.1%) with stent occlusion underwent endoscopic re-intervention successfully. Multivariate analyses revealed chemotherapy after DS placement (P = 0.01), stricture site in D3 (distal part of the papilla) (P = 0.01), and a Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) of 0-1 before duodenal stent placement (P < 0.001) were factors significantly associated with prolonged OS. In conclusion, patients with a GPS of 0-1 and D3 stricture who are tolerant of chemotherapy are suitable candidates for DS placement.
