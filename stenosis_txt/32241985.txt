Title: [Congenital laryngeal paralysis in children].

Abstract: AIM: To optimize the current algorithms of diagnosis and treatment of children with congenital laryngeal paralysis.
METHOD: A retrospective study of case histories of patients with congenital laryngeal paralysis who were examined and treated at St. Petersburg State Pediatric Medical University.
RESULTS: For the period from 1995 to 2015, 30 children with various forms of congenital laryngeal paralysis were under medical supervision at the Clinic for Otorhinolaryngology at St. Petersburg State Medical University.
CONCLUSION: In cases of stage 1-2 laryngeal stenosis in children older than 3 years 6 months, the chordarythenoidotomy may be the procedure of choice. In cases of stage 2 laryngeal stenosis, in children with tracheostomy, we consider laryngotracheoplasty with the insertion of costal autograft in the back wall of the larynx at the age of 4 years as the optimal choice.
