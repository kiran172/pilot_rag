Title: Mirror Image Dextrocardia with Severe Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis Undergone Successful Percutaneous Transvenous Commissurotomy: The First Case in East Africa.

Abstract: Percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy is an established treatment for rheumatic mitral stenosis. Dextrocardic heart can be affected by rheumatic pathology just like the normal heart. However, it is technically demanding to percutaneous interventions especially the septal puncture which should be done in a mirror image of the normal. Here we are reporting a 45 year old woman with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis with dextrocardia with situs inversus totalis. She has undergone a successful percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy.
