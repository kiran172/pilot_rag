Title: Long-term outcomes following the Ross procedure in neonates and infants: A multi-institutional analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: For neonates and infants with aortic valve pathology, the Ross procedure historically has been associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Data regarding long-term durability are lacking.
METHODS: The international, multi-institutional Ross Collaborative included 6 tertiary care centers. Infants who underwent a Ross operation between 1996 and 2016 (allowing a minimum 5 years of follow-up) were retrospectively identified. Serial echocardiograms were examined to study evolution in neoaortic size and function.
RESULTS: Primary diagnoses for the 133 patients (n = 30 neonates) included isolated aortic stenosis (14%, n = 19), Shone complex (14%, n = 19), and aortic stenosis plus other (excluding Shone complex; n = 95, 71%), including arch obstruction (n = 55), left ventricular hypoplasia (n = 9), and mitral disease (moderate or greater stenosis or regurgitation, n = 31). At the time of the Ross procedure, median age was 96 days (interquartile range, 36-186), and median weight was 4.4 kg (3.6-6.5). In-hospital mortality occurred in 13 of 133 patients (10%) (4/30 [13%] neonates). Postdischarge mortality occurred in 10 of 120 patients (8%) at a median of 298 days post-Ross. Post-Ross neoaortic dilatation occurred, peaking at 4 to 5 SDs above normal at 2 to 3 years before returning to near-baseline z-score at a median follow-up of 11.5 [6.4-17.4] years. Autograft/left ventricular outflow tract reintervention was required in 5 of 120 patients (4%) at a median of 10.3 [4.1-12.8] years. Freedom from moderate or greater neoaortic regurgitation was 86% at 15 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Neonates and infants experience excellent postdischarge survival and long-term freedom from autograft reintervention and aortic regurgitation after the Ross. Neoaortic dilatation normalizes in this population in the long-term. Increased consideration should be given to Ross in neonates and infants with aortic valve disease.
