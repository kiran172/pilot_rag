Title: Iron deficiency does not impair the outcome after elective coronary artery bypass and aortic valve procedures.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Iron deficiency (ID), a common malnutrition, has been linked to impaired prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure. It remains unclear whether ID also affects the outcome after elective cardiac surgery.
METHODS: A total of 378 consecutive patients undergoing either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) were prospectively enrolled, and blood samples were taken before surgery for analysis of iron metabolism. Incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was defined as the primary endpoint of the study.
RESULTS: ID (ferritin < 100 ng/ml or ferritin = 100-299 ng/ml and transferrin saturation < 20%) was common in cardiac surgery patients (ID, n = 265, 70%) and related to significant decreased preoperative hemoglobin values (ID: 13.6 ± 1.6 g/dl, Non-ID: 14.3 ± 1.5 g/dl, p < 0.01). We did not observe any differences in the postoperative outcome of the two groups. The incidence of MACCE was 4.9% in patients with ID and 8.8% in Non-ID (p = 0.16). In-hospital mortality (ID: 1.9%, Non-ID: 4.4%, p = 0.17) and stroke (ID: 1.1%, Non-ID: 1.8%, p = 0.64) were also not altered by ID. In addition, intensive care unit and hospital stay, perioperative blood transfusions as well as perioperative morbidities, such as acute kidney injury, low cardiac output syndrome, major bleeding complication, and sternal wound infections were comparable in patients with and without ID.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients undergoing elective CABG or SAVR suffer from ID; however, we found no significant differences in regard to MACCE and postoperative morbidity between ID and non-ID patients.
