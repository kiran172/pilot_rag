Title: Isolated pulmonary artery involvement in Takayasu arteritis: case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a chronic inflammatory arteritis. It most often affects non-specific large vessel progressively, such as the aorta and its branches. The diagnosis in TAK is typically delayed. Isolated pulmonary artery involvement in Takayasu arteritis is uncommon. Owing to its rarity, the diagnosis is challenging and requires an integrated approach comprising clinical and imaging findings. In order to facilitate early diagnosis of TAK for clinicians, wider use of non-invasive imaging is impacting this.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present the imaging characteristics of a rare isolated pulmonary artery involvement in Takayasu arteritis. Pulmonary computed tomography angiography revealed only limited thick walls of both proximal pulmonary artery and stenosis of pulmonary artery lumen, and the other large blood vessels were not involved. The patient undergone pulmonary endarterectomy and pulmonary angioplasty. Then, approximately one month afterward, she passed away due to heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Imaging examination is the main basis for diagnosing this disease. This impression might improve disease awareness among doctors and progress in diagnosis.
