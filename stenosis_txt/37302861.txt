Title: [Analysis of safety and factors influencing the surgical efficacy of benign biliary stenosis treated with autologous gastric flap repair with the vascular tip].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the complication rate and risk factors associated with using autologous gastric flap tissue with a vascular tip to treat benign biliary strictures. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data of 92 patients with benign biliary stenosis who applied autologous gastric flap tissue to repair the stenosis at the PLA General Hospital from January 2006 to May 2022. Among them, there were 40 males and 52 females, aged from 25 to 79 (50.5±12.9) years. The perioperative clinical data of the patients were recorded(Body Mass Index、preoperative platelets et.), and a multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors influencing postoperative complications. Long-term follow-up was conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy of autologous gastric flap tissue with vascular tissues for benign biliary stenosis surgery. Results: The incidence of recent postoperative complications in patients was 26.1%, and univariate analysis showed that preoperative bile-intestinal anastomosis, positive intraoperative bile bacterial culture, low preoperative hemoglobin, and low preoperative platelet count were significantly associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications after biliary stenosis repair with a vascularized gastric flap (P&lt;0.05). Multifactorial analysis showed that low preoperative platelets (OR=0.990, 95%CI: 0.982-0.998, P=0.015), low preoperative hemoglobin (OR=4.953, 95%CI: 1.405-15.010, P=0.012) and positive intraoperative bile bacterial culture (OR=19.338, 95%CI: 3.618-103.360, P&lt;0.001) were independent risk factors for the development of postoperative complications. The excellent long-term follow-up rate of patients was 92.0%. Conclusions: The procedure of repairing benign biliary stenosis with a vascularized gastric flap preserves the function of the sphincter of Oddi and reconstructs the normal physiological passage of the bile duct. This procedure is safe and feasible and provides a reliable option for the surgical treatment of bile duct injury and bile duct stenosis.
