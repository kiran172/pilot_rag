Title: Current evidence for transcarotid artery stenting with flow reversal as the preferred carotid artery stenting approach.

Abstract: Although the transfemoral approach to carotid artery stenting offers a minimally invasive method for treatment of carotid atherosclerotic disease, this technique for carotid revascularization has unfortunately not led to equivalent overall outcomes of stroke or death compared with endarterectomy in symptomatic or high-risk patients. Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) with a flow reversal neuroprotection system was designed to reduce the embolic risk associated with the transfemoral approach, but randomized trials have yet to be published comparing transfemoral carotid artery stenting with TCAR. Regardless, many surgeons and interventionalists have already adopted TCAR as the preferred modality for carotid artery stenting, given the accumulating evidence supporting the reduced stroke or death benefits of TCAR over the transfemoral approach.
