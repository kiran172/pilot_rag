Title: MR vessel wall imaging in cerebral bacterial and fungal infections.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Central nervous system (CNS) bacterial and fungal infections can cause secondary vasculitis which worsens the prognosis due to development of complications like infarctions or hemorrhages. In this prospective study, we aim to study intracranial vessel wall imaging findings in bacterial and fungal infections.
METHODS: We included 12 cases of nontubercular bacterial and fungal CNS infections each, in whom definitive microbiological diagnosis could be made. High-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) and time of flight MR angiography (TOF MRA) were incorporated in the routine imaging protocol. All cases were evaluated for the presence of vascular enhancement, pattern of enhancement, and stenosis on VWI. Statistical analysis was done to evaluate association between findings of vessel wall imaging and infarctions.
RESULTS: We found infarctions in 5 out of 12 cases (41.7%) of the bacterial group and 7 out of 12 cases (58.3%) of the fungal group. Vessel wall enhancement was seen in 5 cases (41.7%) of the bacterial group and 9 cases (75%) of the fungal group. There was a significant association between infarctions and vessel wall enhancement in the fungal group. However, pattern of enhancement or stenosis on VWI was not significantly associated with presence of infarction. VWI detected more cases of vascular involvement than TOF MRA.
CONCLUSION: Secondary infectious vasculitis in bacterial and fungal infections can be detected by VWI, which can play an important role in better patient management as detection of vascular involvement can prompt early treatment to prevent complications like infarctions or hemorrhages.
