Title: Simultaneous versus staged approach in transcatheter aortic valve implantation for severe stenosis and endovascular aortic repair for thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Thoracic/abdominal aortic aneurysms and aortic stenosis may be concomitant diseases requiring both transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and endovascular aneurysm repair (T/EVAR) in high-risk patients for surgical approaches, but temporal management is not clearly defined yet. The aim of the study was to analyse outcomes of simultaneous versus staged TAVI and T/EVAR.
METHODS: Retrospective observational multicentre study was performed on patients requiring TAVI and T/EVAR from 2016 to 2022. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 'Simultaneous group' if T/EVAR + TAVI were performed in the same procedure and 'Staged group' if T/EVAR and TAVI were performed in 2 steps, but within 3â€‰months. Primary outcomes were technical success, 30-day mortality/major adverse events and follow-up survival. Secondary outcomes were procedural metrics and length of stay.
RESULTS: Forty-four cases were collected; 8 (18%) had T/EVAR and 36 (82%) had EVAR, respectively. Upon temporal determination, 25 (57%) and 19 (43%) were clustered in Simultaneous and Staged groups, respectively. In Staged group, median time between procedures was 72 (interquartile range-IQR: 57-87) days. Preoperative and intraoperative figures were similar. There was no difference in 30-day mortality (Simultaneous: 0/25 versus Staged: 1/19; P = 0.43). Pulmonary events (Simultaneous: 0/25 versus Staged: 5/19; P = 0.01) and need of postoperative cardiac pacemaker (Simultaneous: 2/25 versus Staged: 7/19; P = 0.02) were more frequent in Staged patients. The overall length of stay was lower in the Simultaneous group [Simultaneous: 7 (IQR: 6-8) versus Staged: 19 (IQR: 15-23) days; P = 0.001]. The median follow-up was 25 (IQR: 8-42) months and estimated 3-year survival was 73% with no difference between groups (Simultaneous: 82% versus Staged: 74%; P = 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Both Simultaneous or Staged T/EVAR and TAVI procedures are effective with satisfactory outcomes. Despite the small numbers, simultaneous repair seems to reduce length of stay and pulmonary complications, maintaining similar follow-up survival.
