Title: Is T9-11 the true thoracolumbar transition zone?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Degenerative thoracic stenosis has been shown to most frequently involve the lower thoracic segments (T9-T12) where there is greater mobility and vulnerability due to flexion, extension and rotation of the spine. The thoracolumbar junction is considered anatomically to be T12-L1; the anatomical transition between the relatively immobile thoracic spine and relatively mobile lumbar spine. From anecdotal experience at our institution, we hypothesise that the true thoracolumbar junction is higher, at T10-11; the point of transition from floating to false ribs resulting in increased mobility at T10-11.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed of MRI lumbar and whole spine performed on patients aged 10-40 years in our institution over a 5-year period. Patients with previous surgery, chronic spinal disorders and congenital abnormalities were excluded from the study. Intervertebral discs from T8-9 to L1-2 were assessed for evidence of degeneration using the Pfirrmann grading system. Data obtained from a study using computer-based models to assess mean resultant loads in flexion, sitting and standing from T8-9 to L1-2 on patients aged 18-35 years was also analysed. The mean load gradients between two consecutive discs from T8 to L2 were analysed. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant).
RESULTS: Three-hundred and twenty-two MRI studies were reviewed. Mean Pfirrmann grade was highest at T8-9 and T9-10 (1.35 ± 0.99 and 1.32 ± 0.93 respectively).Pfirrmann grade differed significantly at each level (χ2 = 45.137 p = 0.001). Difference in mean load gradient from T9 to T11 was significantly higher than mean load gradient across T11 to L1 in both sitting and standing (0.095 ± 0.062 vs 0.050 ± 0.044 kN; p = 0.007, and 0.101 ± 0.061 kN vs 0.040 ± 0.054 kN; p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: The changes in segmental loads and more severe disc degeneration at T9-11 compared to T11-L1 support our hypothesis that the true thoracolumbar transition is higher than expected, at T10-11; where the rib cage transitions from floating to false ribs.
