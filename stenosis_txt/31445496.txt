Title: Aqueous Extract of Whitmania Pigra Whitman Alleviates Thrombus Burden Via Sirtuin 1/NF-κB Pathway.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Whitmania pigra Whitman (W pigra), a traditional Chinese medicine, has functions of breaking stagnant and eliminating blood stasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism of W pigra against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
METHODS: A rat model of DVT induced by inferior vena cava stenosis was successfully established. Rats were administered vehicle (saline solution, p.o.), three doses of W pigra aqueous extract (34.7, 104.2, or 312.5 mg crude W pigra/kg, p.o.), heparin (200 U/kg, i.v.), or clopidogrel (25 mg/kg, p.o.) once daily for 2 d. Thrombus weight and histopathological changes were examined. Blood samples were collected to determine blood cell counts, blood viscosity, blood coagulation, blood fibrinolysis, serum levels of interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Protein expressions of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), acetylated p65 (Ace-p65), and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) were determined by Western blot. Furthermore, SIRT1-specific inhibitor EX527 was applied to confirm the role of SIRT1 in the antithrombotic effect of W pigra.
RESULTS: W pigra significantly decreased thrombus weight. W pigra had no effects on blood cell counts, whole blood viscosity, blood coagulation, blood fibrinolysis. However, it reduced tissue factor protein expression in the vein wall and thrombus. Moreover, it sharply increased SIRT1 protein expression and decreased leukocytes recruitment in the thrombus and vein wall, serum levels of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and protein expressions of Ace-p65 and p-p65. Furthermore, the antithrombotic effect of W pigra was significantly abolished by EX527.
CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous extract of W pigra effectively reduced DVT burden by inhibiting inflammation via SIRT1/nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway.
