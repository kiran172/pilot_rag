Title: Central airway squamous metaplasia following radiation therapy mimicking local tumour recurrence.

Abstract: Radiation therapy can result in injury to the lung parenchyma and central airways; the latter is less well documented in the literature. Here, we describe a 65-year-old Caucasian male, who developed focal endobronchial nodules and right main bronchial stenosis suggesting tumour recurrence, 32 months following curative intent concurrent chemoradiation therapy for Stage 3B squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography results are detailed. Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchial biopsies revealed squamous metaplasia rather than malignant tumour recurrence, with ongoing observation planned.
