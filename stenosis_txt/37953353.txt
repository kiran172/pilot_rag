Title: Plaque features of the middle cerebral artery are associated with periprocedural complications of intracranial angioplasty and stenting.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The identification of plaque features in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) may help minimize periprocedural complications and select patients suitable for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS). However, relevant research is lacking.
METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with symptomatic MCA stenosis who received PTAS. All patients underwent intracranial vessel wall MRI (VWMRI) before surgery. Periprocedural complications (PC) included ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke within 30 days. Stenosis location, MCA shape, plaque eccentricity and distribution, plaque thickness and length, and enhancement ratio were compared between patients with and without PC.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were included in the study, of which 12.1% (8/66) had PC. Of the eight patients with PC, seven (87.5%) had superior wall plaques. In the non-PC group (n = 58), nine (17%) patients had superior wall plaques. Compared with patients without PC, those with PC had more frequent superior wall plaques (17% vs 87.5%, p < 0.001) and s-shaped MCAs (19% vs 50%, p = 0.071), different stenosis locations (p = 0.012), thicker plaques (1.58 [1.35, 2.00] vs 1.98 [1.73, 2.43], p = 0.038), and less frequent inferior wall plaques (79.2% vs 12.5%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that only the presence of superior wall plaques (OR = 41.54 [2.31, 747.54]) was independently associated with PC.
CONCLUSION: MCA plaque features were highly correlated with PC in patients with symptomatic MCA stenosis who underwent PTAS.
