Title: Dynamic Volume Computed Tomography for Characterizing Pulsatile Tinnitus Caused by Sigmoid Sinus Diverticulum with Bone Defects: Clinical Implications.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the diagnosis of dynamic volume computed tomography (CT) for pulsatile tinnitus caused by sigmoid sinus diverticulum (SSD) and bone defects.
METHODS: Data obtained by dynamic volume CT from 35 patients with SSD were retrospectively collected. Then the ear morphological parameters, including bone defect, transverse sinus stenosis, position of the jugular bulb, jugular bulb diverticulum, defect of the jugular bulb wall, gross venous sinus thrombosis and SSD, and blood perfusion parameters, including cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT), were evaluated and compared between the tinnitus side and the asymptomatic side of the ear.
RESULTS: The maximum diameters of the bone defects on the tinnitus side were greater than those on the asymptomatic side (Horizontal 6.36±2.35mm vs. 1.12±0.78mm; Longitudinal 4.87±1.25 vs. 0.88±0.06mm). Dynamic volume CT visually displayed the SSD herniated into the adjacent mastoid via the bone defect. Transverse sinus stenosis, high position of the jugular bulb, jugular bulb diverticulum, defect of the jugular bulb wall, and gross venous sinus thrombosis were present more frequently on the tinnitus side than on the asymptomatic side (P < 0.05). Moreover, CBF, CBV, and MTT were significantly greater on the tinnitus side than on the asymptomatic side (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Dynamic volume CT examination is an effective method for the diagnosis of pulsatile tinnitus caused by SSD with bone defects.
