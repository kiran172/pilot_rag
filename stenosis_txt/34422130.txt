Title: Incidental Detection of Ischemic Myocardium on 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT.

Abstract: Recent studies using Ga-68-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) PET have shown strong association between focal uptake of FAPI in myocardium and presence of coronary artery disease. We present an interesting case of a 76-year-old female with breast cancer with incidental uptake on FAPI PET in apex and septal wall of left ventricle myocardium correlating with findings of ischemia on dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion imaging and anatomical stenosis on coronary angiography.
