Title: Effects of wasp venom on venous thrombosis in rats.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of wasp venom (WV) from Vespa magnifica on antithrombosis in rats with inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The thrombosis rat model was established by improving the IVC stenosis, in which rats were subjected to IVC ligation for 75 min. Rats were administered argatroban (IP) or WV (s.c.) for 4 hr after IVC thrombosis. The weight, inhibition rate, and pathological morphology of the thrombosis induced by IVC ligation and the variation in four coagulation parameters, coagulation factors, and CD61+CD62P+ were simultaneously determined in IVC rats.
RESULTS: The thrombus formed as a result of IVC ligation was stable. Compared with the control group, the weight of the thrombus was significantly reduced in the argatroban group. Thrombus weight was reduced by treatment with 0.6, 0.2, and 0.05 mg/kg WV, with inhibition rates of 52.19%, 35.32%, and 28.98%, respectively. Inflammatory cells adhered to and infiltrated the vessel wall in the IVC group more than in the sham group. However, the pathological morphology and CD61+CD62P+ of the WV treatment groups tended to be normal.
CONCLUSION: We improved the model of IVC thrombosis to be suitable for evaluation of antithrombotic drugs. Our findings demonstrated that WV could inhibit IVC thrombosis associated with reducing coagulation factors V and CD61+CD62p expression in rats.
