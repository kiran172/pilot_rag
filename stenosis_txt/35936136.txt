Title: Successful Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment of Foot Drop.

Abstract: This case report presents a 63-year-old male patient with chronic left foot drop. The etiology for his condition most likely involved lateral lumbar stenosis and/or sacroiliac joint dysfunction resulting in radiculopathy and subsequent symptoms. The patient was previously recommended a surgical approach for his condition. After an extensive osteopathic examination and application of a high-amplitude low-velocity technique, the patient reported a significant improvement in his pain and resolution of his foot drop. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first reported case of the use of osteopathic medicine in the successful treatment and management of left foot drop most likely secondary lumbar stenosis and/or sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The aim of this case report is to discuss the possible mechanisms by which the condition may have been resolvedÂ and the role that osteopathic treatment played in it.
