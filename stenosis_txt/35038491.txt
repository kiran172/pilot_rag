Title: The Outcomes of Glansectomy and Split Thickness Skin Graft Reconstruction for Invasive Penile Cancer Confined to Glans.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report surgical, functional and patient reported outcomes(PROs) of glansectomy(GS), and split-thickness skin graft(STSG) reconstruction in case of locally invasive penile cancer(PC) MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis from May 2015 to August 2019 was conducted. Inclusion criteria were age<80, a "de novo" malignancy, clinically confined PC (â‰¤T2) with histologic confirmation. Complications, recurrence-free(RFS), cancer-free(CFS) and overall survival(OS) were described. Functional outcomes and PROs were explored using validated questionnaires and "ad hoc" created questionnaire respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis, t-Student and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to estimate survival and postsurgical functional changes respectively.
RESULTS: 34 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 12(IQR:12-41) months. Positive surgical margins were detected in 2.9% of cases, requiring salvage surgery. Postoperative complications occurred in 29.4%, most commonly being a graft partial loss (17.6%), meatal stenosis (5.8%) or genital wound infection (5.8%). Disease recurrence occurred in 17.6% of cases with a median elapsed time of 16 months (12-41). 12-month RFS was 88.2%, whilst CSS and OS were 91% at the same time point. Glans sensation was preserved in 91.2% of cases. 88.2% of patients reported to be fully satisfied with the postoperative aesthetic appearance of the penis, 91.2% of patients would recommend the same procedure to someone else. Limitations include retrospective design and the lack of a control group CONCLUSION: GS with STSG minimizes the impact on urinary and sexual functions without jeopardizing oncological control in locally advanced PC.
