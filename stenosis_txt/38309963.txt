Title: [Rigid bronchoscopy combined with flexible bronchoscopy for treatment of central airway stenosis caused by tuberculous tracheobronchial fistula: report of 2 cases].

Abstract: Tuberculous tracheobronchial fistulas are caused by mediastinal or hilar tuberculous lymph nodes ulcerating into the trachea or bronchus. Patients usually require flexible bronchoscopic interventional procedures in addition to systemic anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy in the ulceration phase. In this paper, we reported 2 cases of central airway stenosis caused by tuberculous tracheobronchial fistula, which had poor treatment results after flexible bronchoscopy. According to the patients' condition, the airway lesions were treated by rigid bronchoscopy combined with flexible bronchoscopy, cryotherapy, argon plasma coagulation, and so on. The central airway stenosis was resolved quickly, and the caseating lymph node tissue was removed as much as possible under the premise of ensuring safety, which shortened the recovery time of tuberculous fistula.
