Title: [Airway stenting in patients with complex benign tracheobronchial stenosis].

Abstract: Tracheal and bronchial stenting is actively used for cancer and benign airway stenosis. This procedure is common in patients with advanced cancer. Stenting ensures breathing and availability of early chemo- and radiotherapy without the need for tracheostomy. This procedure is less common in patients with benign tracheal stenosis. In this case, isolated tracheal or bronchial stenting is performed. Complex tracheobronchial stenosis is extremely rare and creates significant difficulties. We present 3 cases of tracheobronchial stenting for cicatricial stenosis. In each case, stenosis was dilated with a rigid bronchoscope or balloon dilatation. Then, a silicone stent was installed. Resection with an appropriate anastomosis was contraindicated due to advanced pathological process. Thus stenting was regarded as a palliative operation. The follow-up periods were 9 months, 3 and 10 years. Each patient underwent inhalation therapy, endoscopy and repeated stenting if necessary.
