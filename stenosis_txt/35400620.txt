Title: Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation by Three-Dimensional Computed Tomography/Fluoroscopy Fusion Imaging Guidance in a Patient With Right-Sided Aortic Arch and Chronic Aortic Dissection.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) represents the standard of care for relieving aortic stenosis in high-risk patients for surgery. The transfemoral approach is preferable with respect to invasiveness, but is often difficult in patients with complex vascular structures. Recently, the clinical application of advanced visualization and guidance technology with three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) during TAVI has received considerable attention. Herein we report successful transfemoral TAVI in a patient with a right-sided aortic arch and chronic aortic dissection without vascular complications by 3D-CT/fluoroscopy fusion imaging guidance.
