Title: Prevalence, diagnosis, and surgical management of complex ileocolic-duodenal fistulas in Crohn's disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to review the prevalence and surgical management of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) complicated by ileocolic-duodenal fistulas (ICDF).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of CD patients who underwent surgical takedown and repair of ICDF during January 2011-December 2021 at two inflammatory bowel disease referral centers.
RESULTS: We identified 17 patients with ICDF (1.3%) out of 1283 CD patients who underwent abdominal surgery. Median age was 42 (20-71) years, 13 patients were male (76%) and median body mass index was 22.7 (18.4-30.3) kg/m2. Four patients (24%) were diagnosed preoperatively and only 2 (12%) were operated on for ICDF-related symptoms. The most common procedure was ileocolic resection (13 patients, 76%) including 4 repeat ileocolic resections (24%). The duodenal defect was primarily repaired in all patients with no re-fistulization or duodenal stenosis, regardless of the repair technique. A laparoscopic approach was attempted in the majority of patients (14 patients, 82%); however, only 5 (30%) were laparoscopically completed. The overall postoperative complication rate was 65% including major complications in 3 patients (18%) and 2 patients (12%) who required surgical re-intervention for abdominal wall dehiscence and postoperative bleeding. Preoperative nutritional optimization was performed in 9 patients (53%) due to malnutrition. These patients had significantly less intra-operative blood loss (485 vs 183 ml, p = 0.05), and a significantly reduced length of stay (18 vs 8 days, p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: ICDF is a rare manifestation of CD which may go unrecognized despite the implementation of a comprehensive preoperative evaluation. Although laparoscopic management of ICDF may be technically feasible, it is associated with a high conversion rate. Preoperative nutritional optimization may be beneficial in improving surgical outcomes in this select group of patients.
