Title: Impact of serum haemoglobin-to-creatinine ratio after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The association between a combined anaemia and renal failure index and 1-year prognosis of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is unexplored. We aimed to investigate a simple risk score in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 469 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI between 2015 and 2021 were enrolled. After excluding patients undergoing dialysis, the remaining 458 patients were classified according to three tertiles of the serum haemoglobin-to-creatinine (Hgb/Cr) ratio 1 day before TAVI. The primary clinical outcome measure was all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisation 1 year after TAVI.
RESULTS: In the first, second and third tertiles, the 1-year cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 16.9% versus 7.2% versus 2.0%, respectively (p<0.01), and that of heart failure hospitalisation was 10.7% versus 3.4% versus 0.7%, respectively (p<0.01). The indexes of the area under the curve of the Hgb/Cr ratio for all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisation 1 year after TAVI were both 0.73. Cut-off values were 10.1 for all-cause mortality 1 year after TAVI (OR, 4.78; 95% CI 2.43 to 9.74; p<0.01) and 10.4 for heart failure hospitalisation 1 year after TAVI (OR, 5.3; 95% CI 2.21 to 14.1; p<0.01). In the multivariate analysis, the Hgb/Cr ratio was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisation 1 year after TAVI.
CONCLUSIONS: Hgb/Cr ratio calculation 1 day before TAVI may help predict midterm all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisation in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis undergoing TAVI.
