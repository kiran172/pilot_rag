Title: One-year initial efficacy and safety outcomes of the premounted dry-pericardium Vienna self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve system: A first-in-human VIVA feasibility study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The dry-pericardium Vienna transcatheter aortic valve system is repositionable and retrievable, already premounted on the delivery system, eliminating the need for assembly and crimping of the device before valve implantation.
METHODS: The VIVA first-in-human feasibility study, a prospective, nonrandomized, single-center trial, evaluated the Vienna aortic valve in 10 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, who were at intermediate or high surgical risk. This study, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04861805), focused on the safety, feasibility, clinical and hemodynamic performance of the Vienna system up to 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 79 ± 5 years, 60% male. Valve sizes used: 26 mm (10%), 29 mm (30%), 31 mm (60%). Key hemodynamic improvements were significant: mean aortic valve pressure gradient (mmHg) decreased from 48.7 to 8.1, aortic valve area (cm2) increased from 0.75 to 1.91, and maximum jet velocity through the aortic valve (m/s) decreased from 4.41 to 1.95 (p &lt; 0.0001). No moderate/severe paravalvular leakage was observed, and computed tomography scans revealed no evidence of hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening. The study recorded one life-threatening bleeding event, two cases requiring postprocedural pacemaker implantation, and three ischemic events, with only one causing lasting neurological impairment. Importantly, there were no cases of cardiovascular mortality and only one noncardiovascular death, which was confirmed as unrelated to the device.
CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates the Vienna valve as a potential option for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, designed to streamline the procedure and potentially lower healthcare costs by reducing resource and equipment needs, also procedural errors. Further research is essential to thoroughly evaluate its safety and efficacy.
