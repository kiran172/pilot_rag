Title: Right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with the Labcor® stentless valved pulmonary conduit.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction is a common necessity in congenital cardiac surgery. As homograft availability is limited, alternatives need to be evaluated. The Labcor® conduit consists of a porcine tricomposite valve assembled inside a bovine pericardium tube. This study presents intermediate-term results for its utilization for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction.
METHODS: Labcor conduits were implanted in 53 patients (February 2009-July 2016). We analysed perioperative data, freedom from conduit failure and risk factors for conduit dysfunction.
RESULTS: The most common diagnosis was Tetralogy of Fallot (n = 20, 37.7%). The median age at surgery was 10.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 4.9-14.3] years. Pulmonary artery plasty (n = 37, 69.8%) and augmentation of the right ventricular outflow tract (n = 16, 30.2%) were often part of the procedure. The median conduit size was 21 (range 11-25) mm. There was no in-hospital death. The median follow-up after surgery was 4.6 (IQR 3.4-5.6) years. Fourteen patients (27.5%) developed conduit failure with stenosis being the main cause. Freedom from conduit failure was 98.0% at 2 and 80.5% at 5 years. The median longevity of the conduit was 7.4 years (95% confidence interval 5.1-9.8 years). Younger age and smaller conduit size were related to conduit failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of the Labcor conduit revealed acceptable intermediate-term results. The conduit appeared to be functioning sufficiently well within the first 5 years in the majority of patients. The higher rate of failure concerning smaller conduits might be associated with somatic outgrowth; however, conduit degeneration as common and long-term outcome still needs to be evaluated.
