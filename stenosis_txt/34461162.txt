Title: Comparative effectiveness of endovascular treatment modalities for de novo femoropopliteal lesions in intermittent claudication: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the most effective endovascular treatment modalities for de novo femoropopliteal lesions in intermittent claudication (IC) in terms of technical success, primary patency, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and all-cause mortality through network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
METHODS: Medical databases were searched on December 3, 2020. 16 studies (3265 patients) and 7 treatments were selected. Outcomes were technical success, primary patency, TLR and mortality at 6 and/or 12Â months.
RESULTS: Regarding 6-month primary patency, drug-eluting stents (DES) was better than balloon angioplasty (BA; odds ratio [OR], 23.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.57-43.06), drug-coated balloons (DCB; OR, 5.63; 95% CI, 2.26-14.03) and directional atherectomy (DA; OR, 31.52; 95% CI, 7.81-127.28), and bare nitinol stents (BNS) was better than BA (OR, 17.91; 95% CI, 7.22-44.48), DCB (OR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.40-13.45) and DA (OR, 24.27; 95% CI, 5.16-114.11). Regarding 12-month primary patency, DES was better than BA (OR, 10.05; 95% CI, 4.56-22.16), DCB (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.54-8.89) and DA (OR, 29.54; 95% CI, 7.26-120.26). DCB and combination of balloon and atherectomy were the most effective treatment regarding 12-month TLR and technical success (residual stenosis <30%), respectively. DES, BNS and DA with DCB (DA-DCB) were included in the best cluster in the clustered ranking plot combining 12-month primary patency and TLR.
CONCLUSIONS: Balloon and atherectomy may confer advantages over other treatments for technical success; DCB may for TLR. Stent technologies confer substantial advantages regarding primary patency. Stent technologies and DA-DCB should be given priority in treating femoropopliteal lesions in IC.
