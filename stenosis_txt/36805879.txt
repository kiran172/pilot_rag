Title: Iatrogenic or predetermined aortic dysplasia?

Abstract: Coarctation of aorta post-transcatheter occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus is rare. We report a special case of infant with patent ductus arteriosus complicated by bicuspid aortic valve, who presented severe coarctation of aorta and aortic valve dysfunction post-patent ductus arteriosus occlusion during follow-up, eventually receiving surgical operations. A genetic rather than iatrogenic predisposition towards post-procedural complications has been discussed.
