Title: Noninvasive Coronary Physiological Assessment Derived From Computed Tomography.

Abstract: Identifying functional significance using physiological indexes is a standard approach in decision-making for treatment strategies in patients with coronary artery disease. Recently, coronary computed tomography angiography-based physiological assessments, such as computed tomography perfusion and fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (FFR-CT), have emerged. These methods have provided incremental diagnostic values for ischemia-causing lesions over anatomical stenosis defined solely by coronary computed tomography angiography. Clinical data have demonstrated their prognostic value in the prediction of adverse cardiovascular events. Several randomized controlled studies have shown that clinical use of FFR-CT can reduce unnecessary invasive procedures compared to usual care. Recent studies have also expanded the role of FFR-CT in defining target lesions for revascularization by acquiring noninvasive lesion-specific hemodynamic indexes like Î”FFR-CT. This review encompasses the current evidence of the diagnostic and prognostic performance of computed tomography-based physiological assessment in defining ischemia-causing lesions and adverse cardiac events, its clinical impact on treatment decision-making, and implications for revascularization.
