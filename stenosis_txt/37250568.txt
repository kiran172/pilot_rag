Title: Relations between antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anticardiolipin antibodies and degree of neurological deficit, cerebrovascular stenosis in cerebral infarction patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) and anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) with the degree of the neurological defect and cerebrovascular stenosis in patients with cerebral infarction.
METHODS: Clinical data of 99 patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) admitted to the Department of Neurology of Baoding First Central Hospital from June 2020 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed, and their ANA, ACA, ANCA, neurological deficit (NIHSS) scores as well as cerebrovascular stenosis were detected and assessed. Moreover, the correlation between the positive expression rates of ANA, ANCA, ACA and the degree of the neurological deficit, as well as the location and degree of cerebrovascular stenosis, were analyzed.
RESULTS: All patients had ANA, ACA, ANCA antibodies with positive rates of 68.69%, 70.71%, 69.70%, and mild, moderate, and severe cerebrovascular stenosis with incidence rates of 28.28%, 32.32%, and 39.39% respectively; Moreover, their incidence of mild, moderate, and severe neurological deficits were 15.15%, 44.44%, and 40.40%, respectively. Statistically significant differences could be observed in the degree of cerebrovascular stenosis and neurological deficit between the ANA, ACA and ANCA antibody positive group and the negative group (p&lt;0.05). ANA, ACA, ANCA antibody positive was moderately positively correlated with cerebrovascular stenosis rate and NIHSS score (0.40&lt;r&lt;0.60, p&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The positive rates of ANA, ACA and ANCA antibodies were higher in patients with ACI, which was closely correlated with the degree of cerebrovascular stenosis and neurological deficit.
