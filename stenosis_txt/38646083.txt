Title: Ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries in a patient with a history of Kawasaki disease.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: A 34-year-old man with a history of Kawasaki disease had been experiencing chest pain at rest since middle school. Multidetector-row computed tomography showed no aneurysm formation; however, the right coronary artery had an anomalous origin with moderate stenosis. Invasive coronary angiography revealed moderate right coronary artery stenosis with a fractional flow reserve of 0.97. Finally, with a positive acetylcholine provocation test and elevated index of microvascular resistance, the patient was diagnosed with microvascular and epicardial vasospastic angina in the endotypes of ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries. This is the first reported case of both microvascular and epicardial vasospastic angina after Kawasaki disease. In patients with a history of Kawasaki disease, even those without cardiac sequelae, coronary endothelial and microvascular dysfunctions should be taken into consideration.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: We report the first case of both microvascular and epicardial vasospastic angina in the endotypes of ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries after Kawasaki disease.Coronary endothelial and microvascular dysfunctions should be taken into consideration in patients with a history of Kawasaki disease, even those without cardiac sequelae.
