Title: Left Ventricular Outflow Obstruction After Transcatheter Heart Valve Migration and Stent Infolding.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a guideline-recommended treatment for elderly patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. Procedural safety is high, yet accidental valve malpositioning can occur. We report on a migrated transcatheter heart valve that convoluted on release from its delivery catheter. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
