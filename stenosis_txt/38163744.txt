Title: Advantages of Urethroplasty Terminating at the Corona for Severe Hypospadias: Complications, Uroflowmetry, and Esthetics.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Mid-shaft/proximal (msp) and penoscrotal/scrotal/perineal (pssp) hypospadias treated by urethroplasty (UP) terminating at the corona (UPC) or UP terminating at the tip of the glans (UPG) were compared.
METHODS: UP performed at a single institute (n = 234) between 2003 and 2020 were grouped as: msp-UPC (n = 23), msp-UPG (n = 75), pssp-UPC (n = 81), and pssp-UPG (n = 55) to compare data obtained from medical records for post-UP complications (PUC; urethral stenosis, urethrocutaneous fistula, diverticulum formation, and bleeding; n = 234), post-UP uroflowmetry (PUF; average flow rate (Qave), maximum flow rate (Qmax), voiding time (VT), voided volume (VV) and urine flow curves) in 57 UP patients [msp-UPC (n = 5), msp-UPG (n = 12), pssp-UPC (n = 32), pssp-UPG (n = 8)] and 9 controls, and post-UPC esthetics (EST; n = 104). P < 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Mean ages at UP (years) were: msp-UPC (3.1 ± 3.0), msp-UPG (3.3 ± 1.4), pssp-UPC (4.6 ± 2.4), and pssp-UPG (3.4 ± 1.4); p < 0.0001 by ANOVA test. Overall, there were significantly more PUC in pssp-UPG compared with pssp-UPC except for bleeding. Ages at PUF assessment were similar. Mean Qave (mL/s) for pssp-UPG (4.0 ± 1.0) was significantly less than pssp-UPC (5.9 ± 2.5; p < 0.05) and both were significantly less than controls (6.9 ± 1.8; p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). Mean Qmax (mL/s) for pssp-UPC (11.4 ± 4.8) was significantly better than pssp-UPG (7.8 ± 2.3; p < 0.05) and for controls (14.9 ± 4.4) was significantly better than pssp-UPG (7.8 ± 2.3; p < 0.01). All VT (seconds) were similar to controls; all urine flow curves were normal. For EST in UPC (n = 104), 3 cases requested meatal advancement.
CONCLUSIONS: UPC may be a valid option for treating pssp hypospadias because of significant differences in PUC/PUF and minimal EST issues compared with UPG.
