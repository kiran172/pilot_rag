Title: Combined Endovascular and Surgical Treatment of Chronic Carotid Artery Occlusion: Hybrid Operation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The optimal treatment choice of chronic carotid artery occlusion (CAO) remains inconclusive. This study was aimed at exploring the safety and effectiveness of hybrid surgery in the treatment of CAO and at determining predictors for successful recanalization.
METHODS: In this study, we enrolled 37 patients with CAO who underwent hybrid surgical treatment during the period 2016-2018. We extracted and analyzed patients' demographic data, disease characteristics, surgical success rates, perioperative complications, and prognosis.
RESULTS: A total of 37 patients with symptomatic CAO underwent hybrid surgical treatment. Thirty cases (81.1%) were successfully recanalized, while seven were not. Blood reflux after carotid endarterectomy occurred in 18 patients (60%) of the success group and 1 (14.3%) of the failure group (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 0.95-54.5; P = 0.042). The rate of distal ICA reconstruction below the clinoid segment was 20 (66.7%) in the success group and 1 (14.3%) in the failure group (OR, 12.0; 95% CI, 1.3-113.7; P = 0.029). In patients with successful recanalization, no ischemic events occurred after surgery and during follow-up, but restenosis of &gt;50% was found in one case. In the failure group, two patients experienced recurrent ischemic events during follow-up. Perfusion imaging in successful recanalization cases is significantly improved, preoperative I/C ratio was 1.44 (IQR 1.27-1.55), and postoperative 1.12 (IQR 1.05-1.23). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of successful recanalization cases was 5.35 (2.26) before surgery and 2.03 (1.40) at 6 months (P &lt; 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Hybrid surgery might be a safe and effective way to treat CAO. Distal internal carotid artery reconstruction to below the clinoid segment and blood reflux after carotid endarterectomy are predictors of successful recanalization.
