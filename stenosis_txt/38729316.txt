Title: Endoscopic treatment of bile duct stones with benign choledochojejunal anastomotic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic interventions for bile duct stones (BDSs) with benign choledochojejunal anastomotic stenosis (bCJS) are challenging. Therefore, we investigated endoscopic interventions for BDSs with bCJS.
METHODS: Seventeen patients with BDSs with bCJS were retrospectively analyzed. Patient characteristics, technical success, adverse events (AEs), and recurrence were evaluated.
RESULTS: In 17 patients, the median diameters of the bile duct and BDSs were both 8 mm. The median number of BDSs was 3. The technical success rate was 94% (16/17). Ten patients underwent balloon dilation at the choledochojejunal anastomotic site (CAS), the median diameter of balloon dilation was 10.5 mm, and waist disappearance was achieved in 2. Six patients had fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMSs) with a diameter of 10 mm placed at the CAS. BDSs were removed after balloon dilation or FCSEMS removal, and 6 of 16 patients were treated with a combination of lithotripsy and 5 with peroral direct cholangioscopy (PDCS). Regarding AEs, perforation at the CAS by balloon dilation occurred in 1 patient. The median follow-up was 3701 days. Nine of 16 patients (56%) had recurrence. The patients treated with a combination of PDCS at BDS removal (P = .022) and waist disappearance at the CAS by balloon dilation (P = .035) had significantly fewer recurrences.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic interventions for BDSs with bCJS are useful and relatively safe; however, long-term follow-up showed frequent recurrences. Recurrence was common in patients not treated with the combination of PDCS at BDS removal and those without waist disappearance at the CAS by balloon dilation.
