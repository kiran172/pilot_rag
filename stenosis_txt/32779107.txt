Title: The use of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as a predictor of the severity of acute coronary syndrome among diabetic patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction in patients with type two diabetes mellitus is usually present with multiple vessel lesions during coronary angiography. The underlying mechanism remains unexplored, and there is a deficiency of serum predictive markers. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which is a critical measure of glycemic control, could be used as a reliable predictor of the severity of ACS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective descriptive comparative hospital-based study measured the correlation between levels of HbA1c and the severity of ACS using the modified Gensini score (MGS). A total of 85 patients were enrolled in this study in the period between September and November 2019. The MGS depends on the number of vessels which are stenosed with the degree of stenosis more than 50% of their lumen. Data was analyzed using SPSS V. 2018. Chi-square test was used.
RESULTS: The total number of enrolled patients was 85. Dyslipidemia was found among 63 (74.1%) patients, and 52 (69.4%) of the patients were noted to have hypertension. A total of 19 (22.4%) patients were smokers. About 59 (69.4%) patients had a family history of IHD, and 22 patients (25.9%) had a history of IHD. STEMI was the main ECG finding 54 (63.5%). Modified Gensini score depicted that 32 (35.29%) had mild acute coronary syndrome, 23(27.06%) had moderate, and 30 (37.65%) had severe acute coronary syndrome. HbA1c was significantly positively correlated with the severity of ACS among diabetic patients (P value = 0.000).
CONCLUSION: In diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome, HbA1c levels can be used as a predictor for the severity of CAD.
