Title: Topical cyclosporin A 0.05% eye drops for management of symptomatic acquired punctal stenosis: a prospective, controlled clinical study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of cyclosporin 0.05% eye drops in the management of grade 1 and 2 acquired punctal stenosis and to compare the results with the clinical outcomes of mini-Monoka insertion.
METHODS: A prospective, controlled, interventional clinical study includes all patients (16 years and older) with symptomatic epiphora and diagnosed with grade 1 or grade 2 acquired punctal stenosis. All patients undergo punctal dilatation, canalicular probing, and nasolacrimal duct irrigation. Afterwards, patients are divided into two groups: Group A: patients receive only medical treatment in the form of topical 0.05% cyclosporin (Restasis®, Allergan Inc.) twice daily for 6 months. Group B: patients receive mini-Monoka stent insertion in the lower canaliculus for 6 weeks. Outcome measures are changes in Munk scoring, grading of the punctum, and functional and anatomical success. Functional success is defined as Munk score 0 to 1 and FDDT grade 0-2. Anatomical success is defined as grade 3 punctum.
RESULTS: Forty-two patients are included in the study, with 21 patients in each group. There were no significant differences in the Munk score between the two groups before treatment; however, group B had a significantly higher mean rank at 6 months after treatment. After treatment, the punctal size was significantly larger in group B at 4 weeks and 3 months. However, no significant difference in punctal size was detected at 6 months after treatment between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Application of cyclosporin 0.05% eye drops is a simple and efficient non-interventional method in the management of grade 1 and 2 acquired punctal stenosis.
