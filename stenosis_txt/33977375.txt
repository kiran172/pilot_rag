Title: Three-months duration of fully-covered metal stent for refractory dominant extra-hepatic biliary stricture among primary sclerosing cholangitis patients: efficacy and safety.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Dominant stricture (DS) is a main cause of complication among patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). Endoscopic treatment options include dilation and plastic stenting, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.
AIMS: The aim of the current study is to assess the safety and efficacy of fully-covered metal stent (FCMS) in these patients.
METHODS: A retrospective study of PSC patients with refractory DS, defined as strictures resistance to conventional therapy (balloon dilatation, plastic biliary stent insertion or both) and who underwent FCMS insertion for 3 months were included. The primary outcome was defined as clinical and laboratory improvement, while secondary outcomes were DS resolution upon stent removal and cholangiographic DS recurrence at 12-months after FCMS extraction.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled from January 2016 through January 2020. Improvement in weakness and pruritus were seen in 80% and 35%, 75% and 65%, 75% and 35% of patients at 1-3 and 6 months following FCMS removal, respectively. Similarly, consistent improvement in all liver enzymes and total bilirubin were seen in up to 6 month following stent removal. Only one patient (5%) needed premature FCMS removal due to cholangitis 1 week after stent placement and 2 cases (10%) of stent related pancreatitis were encountered. At 3-months all remaining stents were softly removed. Cholangiographic DS resolution was demonstrated in 13 patients (65%) after stent removal at 3-months, and DS recurred in 4 patients (4/13 = 30.7%) at 12-months following stent removal. Notably, only proximal biliary DS location showed a trend for DS recurrence (OR 28.6, P = 0.06).
CONCLUSION: Temporary 3 months duration FCMS was feasible, safe and effective treatment option among patients with PSC related refractory DS.
