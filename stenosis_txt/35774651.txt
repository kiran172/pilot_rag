Title: A Rare Symptomatic Case of Congenital Origin of Right Coronary Artery From Left Coronary Sinus.

Abstract: An anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus is a rare congenital disorder, characterized by an asymptomatic presentation and an increased risk of myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. This disorder with an inter arterial course of the right coronary artery is subject to mechanical compression leading to various symptoms. Only a handful of studies are published related to the atypical origin of coronary arteries. Therefore, we present a case of a hospitalized adult diagnosed with an atypical origin of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus. A 51-year-old femaleÂ presented with mid-sternal heaviness, pressure, and burning sensation, not accompanied by sweating, dizziness, or light-headedness. Biochemical studies revealed an elevated troponin 1 level of 0.12 ng/mL. A coronary arteriogram showed proximal stenosis of the right coronary artery. CT cardiac angiography revealed a large right coronary artery arising from the left cusp anterior to the left main coronary artery. The patient was treated with surgical revascularization therapy.
