Title: Computed tomography angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) for the detection of myocardial ischemia with invasive fractional flow reserve as reference: systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: A method named computed tomography angiography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) is an alternative method for detecting hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis. We carried out a meta-analysis to derive reliable assessment of the diagnostic performances of FFR<sub>CT</sub> and compare the diagnostic accuracy with CCTA using FFR as reference.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and Web of science for relevant articles published from January 2008 until May 2019 using the following search terms: FFR<sub>CT</sub>, noninvasive FFR, non-invasive FFR, noninvasive fractional flow reserve, non-invasive fractional flow reserve, and CCTA. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC) were determined.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies published between 2011 and 2019 were included with a total of 1852 patients and 2731 vessels. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for FFR<sub>CT</sub> at the per-patient level was 89% (95% CI, 85-92%) and 71% (95% CI, 61-80%), respectively, while on the per-vessel basis was 85% (95% CI, 82-88%) and 82% (95% CI, 75-87%), respectively. No apparent difference in the sensitivity at per-patient and per-vessel level between FFR<sub>CT</sub> and CCTA was observed (0.89 versus 0.93 at per-patient; 0.85 versus 0.88 at per-vessel). However, the specificity of FFR<sub>CT</sub> was higher than CCTA (0.71 versus 0.32 at per-patient analysis; 0.82 versus 0.46 at per-vessel analysis).
CONCLUSIONS: FFR<sub>CT</sub> obtained a high diagnostic performance and is a viable alternative to FFR for detecting coronary ischemic lesions.
KEY POINTS: • Noninvasive FFR<sub>CT</sub>has higher specificity for anatomical and physiological assessment of coronary artery stenosis compared with CCTA. • Noninvasive FFR<sub>CT</sub>is a viable alternative to invasive FFR for the detection and exclusion of coronary lesions that cause ischemia.
