Title: Long-term outcomes of percutaneous transluminal renal artery intervention: a retrospective study at a single center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The indications, benefits, and outcomes of percutaneous transluminal renal artery intervention (PTRI) remain controversial. The study purpose was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of PTRI in clinical practice.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 217 subjects (254 renal arteries; mean age, 59.8 years) who underwent PTRI based on medical database.
RESULTS: The most common cause of renal artery stenosis was atherosclerosis in 217 (85.4%), followed by Takayasu arteritis (TA) in 23 (9.1%), fibromuscular dysplasia in five (2.0%) and others in nine (3.5%). Mean follow-up duration was 5.7 ± 3.7 years. The first restenosis rate was 7.5% (n = 19; highest in TA: n = 9, 47.4%) and second restenosis occurred in six arteries (five TAs, one fibromuscular dysplasia). Follow-up blood pressure improved from 142.0/83.5 to 122.8/73.5 mmHg (P < 0.001). There was no change within 5 years' follow-up in estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.44), whereas TA changed from 69.8 ± 20.5 to 84.2 ± 17.9 mL/min/1.73 m² (P = 0.008). Progressive renal dysfunction was related to diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral artery obstructive disease on multivariate analysis with hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 2.24 (1.21-4.17), 2.54 (1.33-4.84), and 3.93 (1.97-7.82), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: PTRI was associated with a blood pressure reduction. Despite a higher rate of restenosis, patients with TA showed significant improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral artery obstructive disease were related with progressive renal dysfunction after PTRI.
