Title: Role of Integrated Intracoronary Imaging to Identify Surgical Clip as a Trigger for ACS-NSTE.

Abstract: An 80-year-old post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patient had an acute coronary syndrome with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (ACS-NSTE) with saphenous vein graft (SVG)-obtuse marginal stenosis. High-definition intravascular ultrasound revealed an underexpanded SVG stent with a hyperechoic structure. Optical coherence tomography confirmed surgical clip causing compression, resolved by post-dilation. This case underscores ACS-NSTE complexity post-CABG and the critical role of coronary imaging in optimizing interventions by addressing surgical clip-induced compression.
