Title: Colonic varices: a rare complication of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: A 55-year-old man was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer of the uncus and received chemotherapy (modified FOLFIRINOX). Ten months later, he was admitted to our hospital with massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Contrast-enhanced CT showed ascending colon varices caused by the occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) due to pancreatic cancer invasion. Colonoscopy revealed tortuous varices with red spots in the ascending colon. The patient received blood transfusions and was discharged; however, he was hospitalized for recurrent massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding 3 months later. During this readmission, we performed the transileocolic vein obliteration method due to SMV stenosis and the absence of an obvious shunt. He experienced an uneventful post-operative recovery, and contrast-enhanced CT after 2Â months revealed no recurrence of colonic varices. Ectopic varices are portosystemic venous collaterals resulting from portal hypertension occurring in any locations other than the esophagogastric region. Colonic varices have rarely been reported before. Patients with pancreatic cancer may present with gastrointestinal bleeding caused by tumor bleeding or esophagogastric varices; however, ectopic varices such as colon varices, a rare complication of pancreatic cancer, should be considered in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.
