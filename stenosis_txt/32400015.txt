Title: Direct right ventricular Impella LD implantation enables postoperative ambulation and may avoid sternal re-entry.

Abstract: Right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) typically require groin cannulation or sternal re-entry which can be avoided by direct pulmonary artery implantation with an Impella. We report the first use of the Impella LD as a directly implanted RVAD.
