Title: The role of venous pressure variability during hemodialysis in the prediction of impending arteriovenous graft occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Elevated venous pressure during hemodialysis (VP<sub>HD</sub>) is associated with arteriovenous graft (AVG) stenosis. This study investigated the role of VP<sub>HD</sub> variations in the prediction of impending AVG occlusion.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from 118 operations to treat AVG occlusion (occlusion group) and 149 operations to treat significant AVG stenosis (stenosis group). In addition to analyzing the VP<sub>HD</sub> values for the three hemodialysis (HD) sessions prior to the intervention, VP<sub>HD</sub> values were normalized to mean blood pressure (MBP), blood flow rate (BFR), BFR × MBP, and BFR2 × MBP to yield ratios for analysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) was used to measure relative variations.
RESULTS: The within-group comparisons for both groups revealed no significant differences in the VP<sub>HD</sub> mean and CV values among the three HD sessions prior to intervention. However, the CVs for VP<sub>HD</sub>/MBP, VP<sub>HD</sub>/(BFR × MBP), and VP<sub>HD</sub>/(BFR2 × MBP) exhibited significant elevation in the occlusion group during the last HD session prior to intervention compared with both the penultimate and antepenultimate within-group HD data (p &lt; 0.05). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the CV for VP<sub>HD</sub>/(BFR2 × MBP) was the only parameter able to discriminate between the last and the penultimate HD outcomes (p &lt; 0.001). According to a multivariate analysis, after controlling for covariates, CV for VP<sub>HD</sub>/(BFR2 × MBP) &gt;8.76% was associated with a higher risk of AVG thrombosis (odds ratio: 3.17, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the variation in VP<sub>HD</sub>/(BFR2 × MBP) may increase the probability of AVG occlusion.
