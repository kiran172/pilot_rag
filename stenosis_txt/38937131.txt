Title: [Spinal endoscopic technique in the surgical treatment of thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum].

Abstract: Thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF) is a pathological heterotopic ossification disease in which the fibrous tissue of the ligamentum flavum of the thoracic spine converts into bony tissue, often leading to thoracic spinal stenosis and compression of the thoracic spinal cord nerve. When TOLF patients present with symptoms of spinal cord nerve compression, surgical treatment is usually required, and traditional open surgery is more invasive and carries a higher risk of spinal cord nerve injury. In recent years, domestic and foreign researchers have tried to apply spinal endoscopic techniques such as microendoscopy, percutaneous foraminoscopy, and unilateral biportal endoscopy for the treatment of TOLF, which can maximize the preservation of normal bone while achieving adequate decompression of the spinal cord nerve, with less damage to spinal stability, and have the advantages of less surgical trauma, less bleeding, and faster postoperative recovery. Due to the special anatomical structure of the thoracic vertebra, spinal endoscopic techniques should focus on safety and it is recommended that they are performed in experienced centers, and surgical indications should be strictly controlled.
