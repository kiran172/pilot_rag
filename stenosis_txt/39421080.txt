Title: Application of Echocardiography in Anaesthesia: From Preoperative Risk Assessment to Postoperative Care.

Abstract: Echocardiography has carved out a fundamental niche in anaesthesiology, revolutionizing the monitoring and management of cardiac function during surgery. Clinical practice has changed from simple 2D and 3D echocardiography to more sophisticated applications such as incorporating artificial intelligence. Echocardiography provides detailed real-time information about cardiac anatomy and function, helping anaesthesiologists make better decisions regarding tailoring anesthetic interventions and optimizing patient outcomes. From optimizing hemodynamic management in patients with severe aortic stenosis to fine-tuning fluid and vasopressor therapy in patients with right heart dysfunction, echocardiography has improved the care provided in the perioperative period. These applications permit the demonstration of not only technical advantages that could accrue from echocardiography but are also a part of individualized care to improve the outcomes of patients. The challenges in integrating echocardiography with anaesthesia include operator dependency, a steep learning curve in acquiring echocardiographic skills, and limitations due to patient factors and technological limitations, which lead to poor echocardiographic performance. Additionally, transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an invasive procedure with several potential risks that must be considered cautiously. Continuing education, certification recommendations, and skill development are prerequisites for this echocardiography tool to remain robust and reliable in anaesthesiology. Technological innovation, especially in improving 3D imaging and integration with artificial intelligence, is where a very bright future lies ahead for echocardiography. It would further accelerate the process of echocardiographic evaluation and improve diagnostic accuracy. All these would turn out to be more person-centered for each patient. Anaesthesiologists must, therefore, pace themselves with such developments so these can be appropriately applied in the clinics. In summary, echocardiography became so integrally ingrained into anaesthesia that it propelled the specialty with essential tools anaesthesiologists use to manage patients for optimum outcomes. Its application has difficulties and limitations, but continued professional development and development of echocardiographic technology will make sure that its benefits are maximized. Quickly, echocardiography is becoming central to anaesthesiology's role in optimizing patient care and surgical success as we move into the application of evermore sophisticated echocardiographic techniques.
