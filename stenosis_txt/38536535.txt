Title: Association of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease with quantitative muscle features from computed tomography angiography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To explore the association between lower extremity muscle features from CTA and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) severity using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as reference standard.
METHODS: Informed consent was waived for this Institutional Review Board approved retrospective study. PAD patients were recruited from July 2016 to September 2020. Two radiologists evaluated PAD severity on DSA and CTA using runoff score. The patients were divided into two groups: mild PAD (DSA score ≤ 7) vs. severe PAD (DSA score > 7). After segmenting lower extremity muscles from CTA, 95 features were extracted for univariable analysis, logistic regression model (LRM) analysis, and sub-dataset analysis (PAD prediction based on only part of the images). AUC of CTA score and LRMs for PAD prediction were calculated. Features were analyzed using Student's t test and chi-squared test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A total of 56 patients (69 ± 11 years; 38 men) with 56 lower legs were enrolled in this study. The lower leg muscles of mild PAD group (36 patients) showed higher CT values (44.6 vs. 39.5, p < 0.001) with smaller dispersion (35.6 vs. 41.0, p < 0.001) than the severe group (20 patients). The AUC of CTA score, LRM-I (constructed with muscle features), and LRM-II (constructed with muscle features and CTA score) for PAD severity prediction were 0.81, 0.84, and 0.89, respectively. The highest predictive performance was observed in the image subset of the middle and inferior segments of lower extremity (LRM-I, 0.83; LRM-II, 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Lower extremity muscle features are associated with PAD severity and can be used for PAD prediction.
CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Quantitative image features of lower extremity muscles are associated with the degree of lower leg arterial stenosis/occlusion and can be a beneficial supplement to the current imaging methods of vascular stenosis evaluation for the prediction of peripheral arterial disease severity.
KEY POINTS: • Compared with severe PAD, lower leg muscles of mild PAD showed higher CT values (39.5 vs. 44.6, p < 0.001). • Models developed with muscle CT features had AUC = 0.89 for predicting PAD. • PAD severity prediction can be realized through the middle and inferior segment of images (AUC = 0.90).
