Title: Decoding supraglottic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Supraglottic stenosis (SPGS) is a rare condition and little is known about its optimal management. Its etiologies are varied and depend on the age group. Here, we review our institution's series of patients and propose treatment strategies for SPGS.
METHODS: SPGS patients between 2013 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. We recorded their demography, clinical data and endoscopy. The patients were treated with either an endoscopic, open or a combined approach. Subsequently, we reviewed photo and video documents, medical sheets and long-term follow-up charts.
RESULTS: The report includes 14 children having a mean age of 5.7 years (range 2 months-13 years). Seven children had undergone prior supraglottoplasty for laryngomalacia, three children had blunt neck trauma and four had iatrogenic plus post-intubation etiology. Five children received endoscopic treatment and are currently symptom free. Four patients received a combined repair with satisfactory results. Five children received an open repair, four of which are decannulated and feed orally without aspiration. Most children in this group required additional endoscopic interventions.
CONCLUSION: Post supraglottoplasty stenosis can be treated optimally by an endoscopic approach. More severe supraglottic cicatrical sequelae with posterior glottic involvement may require a combined endoscopic and open approach. Transglottic stenoses with severe grades of multi-level stenoses require an extended cricotracheal resection.
