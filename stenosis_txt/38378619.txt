Title: Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation has become an attractive method of dysfunctional right ventricle outflow tract treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a unique case of a 20-year-old Caucasian male patient with a complex cyanotic heart defect, namely pulmonary atresia, with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect after Rastelli-like surgery at the age of 5 years with homograft use. At the age of 20 years, the patient needed percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation owing to homograft dysfunction. Despite unusual course of the coronary arteries, balloon testing in the landing zone of the right ventricle outflow tract excluded potential coronary artery compression. Then, after presentation, a Melody valve was implanted successfully in the pulmonary valve position. The 8-year follow-up was uneventful.
CONCLUSION: This is likely the first description of a percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation in such anatomy. Such a procedure is feasible; however, it requires exceptional caution owing to the anomalous coronary arteries course, which can be the reason for their compression.
