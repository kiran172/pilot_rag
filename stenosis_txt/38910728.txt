Title: Maternal Preeclampsia and a Preterm Neonate With Small Bowel Stenosis, Volvulus, and Severe Intrauterine Growth Restriction.

Abstract: Preeclampsia is a human-specific hypertensive disorder of gestation. It is associated with short-term adverse effects in the fetus and long-term complications in the neonate, mainly due to disrupted blood flow during critical periods of intrauterine development. An ischemic event in the uterus can affect many systems of the fetus, including a small bowel involvement. We present a case of a preterm, small for gestational age neonate with severe intrauterine growth restriction, small bowel stenosis, and volvulus without malrotation, born to a mother with severe preeclampsia.
