Title: High-Gradient Aortic Stenosis With Valve Area &gt;1.0 cm2: The "Forgotten" Discordant Hemodynamic Phenotype.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical features and outcomes in severe aortic stenosis (AS) have been described according to the hemodynamic phenotypes.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and prognosis of patients with high-gradient (HG) AS with aortic valve area (AVA) &gt;1.0 cm2.
METHODS: A total of 3,209 patients were identified according to AVA (cm2), peak velocity (m/s), systolic mean pressure gradient (MG) (mm Hg): HG-AVA &gt;1 = &gt;1.0, ≥4, and ≥40, HG-AVA ≤1 = ≤1.0, ≥4, and ≥40; LG-AVA ≤1 (low-gradient) = ≤1.0, &lt;4, and &lt;40; moderate AS = 1.0 &lt;AVA ≤1.5, 3 ≤peak velocity &lt;4, and 20 ≤MG &lt;40.
RESULTS: HG-AVA >1 accounted for 230 individuals (7.2%). Compared with others, patients with HG-AVA >1 were younger (70.2 ± 12.0 years), more frequently male (85.7%), had fewer comorbidities, larger body surface area and stroke volume (115 ± 19.3 mL), and had higher prevalence of bicuspid valve (39.6%). After a follow-up of 944 days (Q1-Q3: 27-2,212 days), 1,523 deaths occurred. Compared with the HG-AVA >1 group, all-cause mortality was higher in HG-AVA ≤1 (HR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7), LG-AVA ≤1 (HR: 2.8; 95% CI: 2.2-3.6), and moderate AS (HR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7). These differences were no longer significant after adjustment for age, comorbidities, bicuspid valve, and cardiac function. In the HG-AVA >1 group, patients with aortic valve replacement had better survival outcomes than those without aortic valve replacement (P < 0.001) after balancing the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The underlying relative high-flow status is responsible for HG in patients with HG-AVA >1. This profile has better prognosis than others, being related to underlying younger age and better general and cardiac conditions, but aortic valve replacement may still benefit these patients.
