Title: Sleeve gastrectomy in class 1 obesity: Assessment of operative outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The risk/benefit ratio of sleeve gastrectomy (SG), especially in patients without type 2 diabetes (T2D), is unknown for patients with class 1 obesity.
OBJECTIVES: Assessment of operative outcomes of SG in class 1 obesity.
SETTING: Private practice.
METHODS: Candidates for a primary SG with body mass index 30-35 kg/m2 after 5 years of unsuccessful dieting were included after informed consent was obtained. Participants who did not complete 3-month follow-up and those who underwent modified SGs were excluded. Data and complications were recorded prospectively. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Definition of presence and remission of T2D and insulin resistance were set according to guidelines. Effects on weight loss parameters were evaluated with Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2020, 143 consecutive SGs were performed in patients with class 1 obesity without conversion, leak, mortality, or a venous event. Two were lost to follow-up. In 141 participants, 2 bleedings and 1 colon perforation occurred (2.1% rate for acute life-threatening events). During a mean follow-up of 25.9 months; 1 case of functional stenosis and 4 cases of de novo symptomatic cholelithiasis clinically became evident in different patients, all requiring reoperation. Therefore a 5.6% rate of major complications were identified at 2 years. The benefit on weight loss was immediate and permanent (P < .001). T2D and insulin resistance were in remission in 100% and 98.1% of participants at 1 year, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The 5.6% major complication rate reflects a minimum because more de novo symptomatic gallstones and stenosis are yet to occur or overlooked. Additionally, this excludes patients with de novo reflux and malnutrition, dissatisfaction issues, or recidivism. Caution is required to freely operate on patients with class 1 obesity with no co-morbidity. Evidence-based outcome data are lacking to balance the reported risks.
