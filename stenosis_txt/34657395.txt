Title: Endoscopic removal of biliary uncovered self-expandable metal stents in one patient placed 15 years ago.

Abstract: Before: 51 W: We removed two biliary uncovered SEMSs from one patient using stent-in-stent technique with a fully covered biliary stent, one of which was placed for up to 15 years. That is rare and also meaningful. Maybe,we should have a new understanding of uncovered SEMS in management of benign biliary strictures. After: 50 W: Yu and colleagues removed two biliary uncovered self-expandable metal stents, one of which had been in place for 15 years, from one patient using the stent-in-stent technique with a fully covered biliary stent. A new understanding of uncovered self-expandable metal stents in the management of benign biliary strictures is needed.
