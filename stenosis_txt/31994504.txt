Title: [Surgical treatment of extensive posttracheostomy tracheal stenosis using a new technique].

Abstract: We report one-stage radical surgical treatment of a 54-year-old patient with extensive cicatricial posttracheostomy tracheal stenosis complicated by tracheomalacia of anterior tracheal wall and previous numerous unsuccessful endoscopic attempts of tracheal recanalization. A new method of prevention of tracheal anastomosis failure was applied.
