Title: Predictors of Ascending Aorta Enlargement and Valvular Dysfunction Progression in Patients with Bicuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) patients are at high risk of developing progressive aortic valve dysfunction and ascending aorta dilation. However, the progression of the disease is not well defined. We aimed to assess mid-long-term aorta dilation and valve dysfunction progression and their predictors. Patients were referred from cardiac outpatient clinics to the echocardiographic laboratories of 10 tertiary hospitals and followed clinically and by echocardiography for >5 years. Seven hundred and eighteen patients with BAV (median age 47.8 years [IQR 33-62], 69.2% male) were recruited. BAV without raphe was observed in 11.3%. After a median follow-up of 7.2 years [IQR5-8], mean aortic root growth rate was 0.23 ± 0.15 mm/year. On multivariate analysis, rapid aortic root dilation (>0.35 mm/year) was associated with male sex, hypertension, presence of raphe and aortic regurgitation. Annual ascending aorta growth rate was 0.43 ± 0.32 mm/year. Rapid ascending aorta dilation was related only to hypertension. Variables associated with aortic stenosis and regurgitation progression, adjusted by follow-up time, were presence of raphe, hypertension and dyslipidemia and basal valvular dysfunction, respectively. Intrinsic BAV characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors were associated with aorta dilation and valvular dysfunction progression, taking into account the inherent limitations of our study-design. Strict and early control of cardiovascular risk factors is mandatory in BAV patients.
