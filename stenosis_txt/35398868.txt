Title: An Infant With Hereditary Fructose Intolerance and a Novel Presentation of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulopathy Following Pyloromyotomy.

Abstract: Hereditary fructose intolerance is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by liver failure, renal tubulopathy, growth retardation, and occasionally death upon exposure to fructose. We present a 2-month-old male infant diagnosed with pyloric stenosis who developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy following pyloromyotomy. Unexplained persistent coagulopathy, acute liver failure, and metabolic dysfunction led to whole-exome sequencing, which revealed compound heterozygous variants in ALDOB (p.Arg60Ter and p.Ala150Pro), diagnostic of hereditary fructose intolerance. Shortly after initiating a fructose-free diet, our patient had resolution of his coagulopathy, hepatic, and metabolic dysfunction.
