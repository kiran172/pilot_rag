Title: [Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Severe Aortic Stenosis with Preexisting Mitral Prosthesis;Report of a Case].

Abstract: An 81-year-old woman presented with progressive congestive heart failure. Seventeen years before, she had undergone mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic stenosis with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%.At first, rescue balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) was performed. After transient improvement of symptoms, she was readmitted 2 months later with recurrence of severe congestive heart failure. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with an Edwards Sapien valve was performed. During the procedure, BAV was performed to confirm that the balloon did not interfere the movement of the mechanical valve. Moreover, supported by a veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we could prevent myocardial ischemia during rapid pacing and slowly deploy the valve in a precise position. TAVI can be safely and successfully performed in patients with a preexisting mechanical mitral prosthesis.
