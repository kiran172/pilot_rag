Title: Congenital Fusion of Dens to T3 Vertebra in Klippel-Feil Syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome may present with neurologic complaints such as neck pain, radiculopathy and gait instability. Here we describe surgical management of a patient with congenital fusion of the occipital-cervical region and also block circumferential fusion of dens to T3 with spinal cord compression. This report is the first of its kind with such extensive fusion.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient was a 56 year-old female, who presented with neck pain and tingling in all extremities. On exam, she had a short neck, prominent jaw with extremely limited range of motion in neck and features of myelopathy. CT showed fusion of the dens to T3 vertebrae. Patient underwent sub-occipital craniectomy, C1 laminectomy and Occiput to T5 posterior fixation and fusion with neurologic improvement.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of Klippel-Feil syndrome with fusion of all cervical vertebrae down to T3. We recommend surgery for advanced cases of myelopathy or radiculopathy due to stenosis and spinal instability.
