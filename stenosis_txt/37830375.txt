Title: The QRS frontal plane axis changes during left bundle branch block after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is common after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and associated with a left or normal QRS axis. We aim to assess the QRS frontal plane axis shift changes during LBBB after TAVR and determine if the risk of procedure-related high degree atrioventricular block (AVB) is affected by QRS axis shift changes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a retrospective single-center study of 720 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR, 141 (19.6%) with normal baseline QRS duration developed a new LBBB after TAVR and constituted the study group. Most patients (59.6%) were females and the mean age of the cohort was 81.2 ± 6 years.
RESULTS: As compared with the baseline QRS axis before TAVR, the occurrence of LBBB was associated with a leftward QRS axis shift (by 40 ± 28.3°) in 73% of the study patients and a rightward (by 18.6 ± 19.4°) or no change in QRS axis in 25.6% and 1.4% of the study patients, respectively. A left QRS axis (-30°) was observed in 14.9% and 38.3% of the study patients before and after TAVR, respectively. The group of patients exhibiting a rightward or no QRS axis shift had a greater incidence of high degree AVB than the group of patients exhibiting a leftward QRS axis shift (18.4% vs. 6.8%, p = .056).
CONCLUSION: Although post TAVR-LBBB is associated with a leftward QRS axis shift in most patients, a non-negligible proportion of patients (27%) exhibited a rightward or no QRS axis shift. The latter group tend to have a higher risk of developing high degree AVB.
