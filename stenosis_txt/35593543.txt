Title: Long-term Results of Perfusion-Balloon Valvuloplasty, Without Rapid Pacing, in High-Risk Elderly Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis: A New Space Oddity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is actually recommended as a bridge to surgery or transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) in particular clinical settings. In this pilot study, for the first time, we report our experience utilizing a nonocclusive balloon for BAV, which does not require rapid ventricular pacing (RVP), in high-risk symptomatic elderly patients with severe AS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2018 to 2020, a total of 30 high-risk elderly patients with heart failure due to severe AS were treated with BAV and were all prospectively included in the study. We used a perfusion-balloon valvuloplasty without RVP (True Flow; BD/Bard). Hemodynamic parameters were invasively evaluated during catheterization, before and immediately after BAV. All patients were regularly followed to detect the rate of mortality. The patients were 87.56 Â± 4.10 years old and 23% were males. In the catheterization laboratory, the peak left ventricular to aortic pressure gradient significantly decreased from 55 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR], 48.75-66.25) to 26 mm Hg (IQR, 15.7-30) immediately after balloon inflation (P<.001). The median value of percentage decrease of transaortic gradient was 56% (IQR, 50-74). At a median of 12 months (IQR, 5-27) follow-up, 12 patients (40%) died. The median time between BAV and mortality was 10.5 months (IQR, 1.75-15.5). At multivariable analysis, the only predictor of mortality was the New York Heart Association class at admission (odds ratio, 3.29; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-298.4; P<.01).
CONCLUSION: This single-center pilot study represents the first evidence that perfusion-balloon valvuloplasty without RVP is a safe, valid, and durable option in high-risk, symptomatic, elderly patients with severe AS.
