Title: Challenges in Primary PCI: How to Treat a Large Intracoronary Thrombus With TIMI 3 Flow?

Abstract: This case highlights 2 important issues: the immediate management of large intracoronary thrombus in the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction setting with TIMI 3 flow, and the risks/benefits associated with sealing a plaque in an unobstructed artery by stenting. Potent antithrombotic therapy with a view to subsequent intracoronary imaging to define etiology and plaque morphology appears to be a reasonable initial strategy in this specific population. Furthermore, for patients with acute coronary syndromes diagnosed with plaque erosion by optical coherence tomography and residual diameter stenosis <70%, deferred stenting appears a viable option.
