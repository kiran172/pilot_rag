Title: Dual-Energy CT Angiography in Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease: Diagnostic Accuracy of Different Image Reconstruction Approaches.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of five DE-CTA image reconstruction approaches for detection of lower extremity arterial stenosis using digital subtraction angiography as reference standard.
METHODS: One hundred and eleven patients (63 males; mean age, 75.0 ± 9.7 years) who underwent clinically indicated lower extremity DE-CTA were included in this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study. Routine multiplanar reconstructions (MPR), curved MPR (cMPR), DE-bone-and-calcified-plaque-subtraction (DE-CS), maximum-intensity projections (MIP), and DE-CS MPR were visually assessed for stenoses > 50%. Automatic objective stenosis grading was implemented on cMPRs. The effect of vessel calcification and luminal contrast on diagnostic performance was evaluated.
RESULTS: Sensitivity for stenosis detection was high (96.4%-98.6%) with no significant differences among reconstruction approaches. Specificity (74.9%-92.2%) and accuracy (86.9%-94.5%) varied significantly. Pronounced vessel wall calcification and inferior intraluminal contrast attenuation had no significant effect on sensitivity (calcification: p = 0.167 for MPR; 0.567 DE-CS MPR; 0.057 DE-CS MIP; 0.272 cMPR; 0.185 automatic grading; contrast attenuation: p = 1.000 for all reconstructions), but lead to reduced specificity in visual assessment (calcification: p = 0.002 for MPR; <0.001 DE-CS MPR, DE-CS MIP, and cMPR; contrast attenuation: p = 0.844 for MPR; 0.001 DE-CS MPR and DE-CS MIP; 0.420 cMPR). Routine MPR showed highest overall diagnostic performance.
CONCLUSION: Regardless of image reconstruction approach, vessel calcification and intraluminal contrast attenuation, lower extremity DE-CTA possesses high sensitivity for detection of significant stenoses. Specificity and accuracy vary between reconstruction approaches, indicating the need for additional verification of potential stenotic lesions by use of MPR to reduce the number of unnecessary invasive DSAs due to false-positive CTA findings.
