Title: Chondromyxoid fibroma of the lumbar facet joint: A case report.

Abstract: Chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) is a rarely documented benign osseous neoplasm, particularly with respect to its incidence in the lumbar spinal region. CMF predominantly manifests in vertebral bodies, exhibiting atypical emergence in ancillary anatomical sites. The present report describes, to the best of our knowledge, the second documented instance of CMF originating from the lumbar facet joint. The present case provides an example of CMF in the lumbar facet joint precipitating spinal canal stenosis, thereby engendering neurological manifestations in the lower extremities due to neoplastic proliferation through the intervertebral foramen. The present therapeutic intervention entailed surgical excision of the neoplasm concomitant with facet joint arthrodesis, with the objective of achieving comprehensive neoplasm eradication, ameliorating the symptomatology and safeguarding the spinal structural integrity of the patient. The present study aimed to illustrate the clinical implications of this rare neoplasm, thereby elucidating the diagnostic quandaries and therapeutic complexities associated with CMF in the lumbar facet joint. In addition, the present study aimed to augment the existing knowledge for the diagnosis and clinical management of CMF.
