Title: Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction Predicts Global Longitudinal Strain Recovery after Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), left ventricular systolic dysfunction is one of the main predictors of adverse events after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, more patients undergo surgery earlier, often with preserved systolic function. In these cases, global longitudinal strain (GLS) has been proposed as a marker of ventricular remodeling post-surgery. This study aims to evaluate GLS variation in patients undergoing SAVR and explore differences across the diastolic dysfunction classes.
METHODS: From June 2020 to March 2023, patients with AS and preserved ejection fraction (EF) requiring SAVR were enrolled. Echocardiographic evaluations were conducted preoperatively, seven days post-surgery, and twelve months after surgery. Patients were divided into two groups based on the severity of diastolic dysfunction: Group A (grade I) and Group B (grades II-III).
RESULTS: The final analysis included 108 patients (mean age 71.3 ± 7.2 years). Twenty-two patients (20.4%) also underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The preoperative EF averaged 61.6 ± 6.03%, with no significant differences between groups. Preoperative GLS was 16 ± 4.3%, decreasing to 12.8 ± 3.4% postoperatively (p &lt; 0.0001). GLS was comparable between the groups preoperatively (p = 0.185) and postoperatively (0.854). After twelve months, GLS improved in both groups (Group A: 17.7 ± 3.4%, Group B: 15.7 ± 3.2%, p &lt; 0.0001), but only Group A showed significant improvement from preoperative values (p = 0.018). SAVR improved GLS regardless of CABG intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: SAVR in patients with preserved LVEF results in an early reduction in GLS, regardless of diastolic dysfunction. After twelve months, GLS improved significantly, with significant recovery only in patients with mild dysfunction.
