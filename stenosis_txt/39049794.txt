Title: Invasive Therapeutic Strategies for Stricturing Crohn's Disease in Childhood: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Current drugs are not effective for treating the primary fibrotic component of CD. Recommended invasive treatments include endoscopic balloon dilation, surgery with resection, or strictureplasty. This meta-analysis compared invasive treatment techniques for CD-related strictures in the pediatric population.
METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS databases were searched from inception to December 2023. This meta-analysis was performed as per the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The outcome was measured by the rate of stenosis recurrence and the adverse events of the techniques. Eligibility criteria were studies that involved the analysis of the recurrence rate of stenosis in pediatric patients with CD requiring surgical intervention after undergoing any of the previously proposed therapies. Additionally, adverse events were analyzed.
RESULTS: Three studies comprising a total of 106 endoscopic balloon dilations demonstrated a combined rate of stricture recurrence in patients with CD requiring surgical intervention of 0.171 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.110-0.255). Three studies comprising a total of 49 surgical resections demonstrated a pooled event rate of 0.100 (95% CI, 0.038-0.240). Finally, 2 studies comprising a total of 38 strictureplasties demonstrated a pooled event rate of 0.347 (95% CI, 0.070-0.789). Concerning adverse events, the most common occurrences were found after surgical resection.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection is the best option for treating strictures in pediatric CD patients in terms of recurrence rate, compared with endoscopic balloon dilation and strictureplasty. Nevertheless, surgical resection is associated with more adverse events.
