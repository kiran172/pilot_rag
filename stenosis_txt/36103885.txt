Title: Degenerative Lumbar Spine Disease: Imaging and Biomechanics.

Abstract: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most common diagnoses encountered when considering years lived with disability. The degenerative changes of the lumbar spine include a wide spectrum of morphological modifications visible on imaging, some of them often asymptomatic or not consistent with symptoms. Phenotyping by considering both clinical and imaging biomarkers can improve the management of CLBP. Depending on the clinical presentation, imaging helps determine the most likely anatomical nociceptive source, thereby enhancing the therapeutic approach by targeting a specific lesion. Three pathologic conditions with an approach based on our experience can be described: (1) pure painful syndromes related to single nociceptive sources (e.g., disk pain, active disk pain, and facet joint osteoarthritis pain), (2) multifactorial painful syndromes, representing a combination of several nociceptive sources (such as lumbar spinal stenosis pain, foraminal stenosis pain, and instability pain), and (3) nonspecific CLBP, often explained by postural (muscular) syndromes.
