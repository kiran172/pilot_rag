Title: Vaginal Reconstruction in Patients with vaginal agenesis: Options and Outcome: A single-center experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the postoperative functional, anatomical outcome and complications of various surgical procedures of vaginoplasty performed for patients with vaginal agenesis at our institution.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 14 patients (age range 17-40 years), who underwent vaginoplasty at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan between January 2008 to December 2018. We aimed to assess the anatomical outcomes in terms of vaginal depth, axis and functional outcome as painless and satisfactory vaginal intercourse.
RESULTS: The mean age and mean body mass index (BMI) of the cases were 26.8 ± 8.1 years and 27.7143 ± 4.6 respectively. All were phenotypically female, with only two cases of XY genotype. Two patients were married on presentation. On evaluation, four cases had Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, three had androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), one case had congenital adrenal hyperplasia and six cases did not fit into any diagnosis. Associated renal anomalies were diagnosed in 14.3% of cases. The performed procedures were; Singaporean flap vaginoplasty (in four patients), Lee's, modified McIndoe and pull-through vaginoplasty (in three each patients), and Davydov vaginoplasty (in one patient). One patient was complicated by intraoperative bladder injury (p<0.63) and two cases by vaginal stenosis (p<0.43). The mean operative time was 120 minutes and the mean estimated blood loss was 200mls. Postoperatively, the vaginal length varied from 6-10 cm with a normal vaginal axis and satisfactory sexual activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal agenesis is associated with several sexual disorders and despite the various surgical options available, the best procedure in terms of fewer complications and best surgical outcome is yet to be determined.
