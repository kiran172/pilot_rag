Title: Effects of mesenchymal stem cells in renovascular disease of preclinical and clinical studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) causes severe renovascular hypertension, worsening kidney function, and increased cardiovascular morbidity. According to recent studies, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) administration is a promising therapy for the improvement of RAS outcomes. The meta-analysis aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of MSC therapy on RAS. We performed a search in MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to 5, October 2022. We included 16 preclinical and 3 clinical studies in this meta-analysis. In preclinical studies, the pooled results indicated that animals treated with MSCs had lower levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP) (SMD = - 1.019, 95% CI - 1.434 to - 0.604, I2 = 37.2%, P = 0.000), serum creatinine (Scr) (SMD = - 1.112, 95% CI - 1.932 to - 0.293, I2 = 72.0%, P = 0.008), and plasma renin activity (PRA) (SMD = - 0.477, 95% CI - 0.913 to 0.042, I2 = 43.4%, P = 0.032). The studies also revealed increased levels of renal blood flow (RBF) in stenotic kidney (STK) (SMD = 0.774, 95% CI - 0.351 to 1.197, I2 = 0%, P = 0.000) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of STK (SMD = 1.825, 95% CI 0.963 to 2.688, I2 = 72.6%, P = 0.000). In clinical studies, the cortical perfusion and fractional hypoxia of the contralateral kidney (CLK) were alleviated by MSC therapy. Taken together, this meta-analysis revealed that MSCs therapy might be a promising treatment for RAS. However, due to the discrepancy between preclinical studies and early clinical trials outcomes, MSC therapy couldn't be recommended in clinical care for the moment, more high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to validate our conclusions and standardize MSCs protocols.
