Title: Lacrimal drainage system involvement in Peters anomaly: clinical features and outcomes.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To present first of its kind series on the clinical features and outcomes of lacrimal drainage disorders in Peters anomaly and Peters plus syndrome.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all consecutive patients who were known cases of Peters anomaly or Peters plus anomaly and were diagnosed with associated congenital lacrimal drainage disorders. The study period was from June 2016 to Dec 2020. All these patients underwent examination under anaesthesia for a detailed assessment of lacrimal drainage anomalies. Where indicated, they were treated with probing, intubation, or in refractory patients with a dacryocystorhinostomy. The anatomical and functional outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 282 patients with Peters anomaly, 4 (1.4%) patients had associated lacrimal drainage system anomalies while of the 16 Peters plus anomaly children, 3 (18.75%) had associated lacrimal drainage system anomalies. A total of 12 lacrimal drainage systems of 12 eyes of 7 patients of Peters anomaly were found to be involved. Upper or lower punctal agenesis were noted in 3 eyes. Three eyes had complex congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO), two of which had a bony NLD block and one had a misdirected nasolacrimal duct through the inferior turbinate. One eye had a diffuse NLD stenosis without a CNLDO. Following appropriate management, at a mean follow-up of 25.7 months (range: 3-48 months), all the eyes except one (91%, 10/11) demonstrated anatomical and functional success.
CONCLUSION: Lacrimal drainage involvement was more common in Peters plus syndrome. Multiple proximal and distal lacrimal drainage segment anomalies were noted in all the variants of Peters anomaly; however, Peters plus syndrome was noted to usually involve both the segments.
