Title: [Examination of the Relationship between Worse Symptom and Differences Route during Administration of Argatroban in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients].

Abstract: The treatment of acute ischemic stroke usually involves argatroban administration by continuous infusion for 2 d and by intravenous infusion twice a day for 5 d after that. However, the appropriate dose of argatroban to be administered is not clear. Therefore, no studies have been reported a comparison of intravenous and continuous argatroban infusion after day 3 for acute ischemic stroke patients. We aimed to identify the connection between differences in argatroban administration and worsening of symptoms after day 3 in ischemic stroke patients. We retrospectively evaluated the data of 107 ischemic stroke patients who received treatment with argatroban. The study endpoint was defined as the worsening of symptoms from days 3 to 7. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors that were significantly associated with worsening of symptoms. Patients were administered argatroban, with rates of 72.0%, and 28.0% for continuous, and intravenous infusion, respectively. A total of 10 (9.3%) patients experienced worsening of symptoms. In the single logistic regression analysis, carotid stenosis [non-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.775, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.486-22.442, p=0.011] was only significantly associated with worsening of symptoms. Worsening of symptoms was not related to either intravenous or continuous infusion group (16.7% vs. 6.5%, p=0.104). Bleeding was also not associated with either group (6.7% vs. 3.9%, p=0.618). We suggest that the differences in the mode of argatroban administration were not related to the worsening of symptoms in ischemic stroke patients. We also found that safety was equivalent regardless of the administration route.
