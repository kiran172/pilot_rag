Title: Acute Glaucoma Following Internal Carotid Artery Stenting: A Rare But Serious Complication of Ocular Ischemic Syndrome.

Abstract: Acute glaucoma following carotid artery recanalization is a rare but severe complication of underlying ocular ischemic syndrome. We present a case of a 71-year-old woman with ocular ischemic syndrome and severe stenosis of the right internal and external carotid artery undergoing carotid artery stenting. Immediate postprocedural angiography showed pronounced reperfusion of the ophthalmic artery. Subsequently, the patient developed vision-threatening acute glaucoma despite treatment with acetazolamide. Monitoring of intraocular pressure is important in patients who are at risk of developing ocular ischemic syndrome because of internal carotid artery stenosis. Interventionalists should also assess the degree of vascular collateralization from the external carotid artery.
