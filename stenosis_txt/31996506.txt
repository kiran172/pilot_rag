Title: Tracheoplasty for Congenital Tracheal Stenosis with Bilateral Tracheal Bronchus.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) with a bilateral tracheal bronchus (TB) has not been reported as a subtype of CTS. A novel technique to manage CTS in patients with a bilateral TB is described.
CASE REPORT: An infant with tetralogy of Fallot underwent repair of cardiac anomaly at age 1 month. He experienced numerous cyanosis and episodes of transient respiratory arrest. Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an aberrant bilateral upper lobe bronchus arising directly from the trachea and a stenotic trachea connecting the pseudo- carina to the true carina between the common right lower and left lower bronchus. On bronchoscopy, the diameter of the lumen of the narrowed segment was estimated to be less than 2 mm. Tracheal reconstruction was undertaken when he was 2 years of age. The surgical technique using a modified slide tracheoplasty for the correction of this anomaly are described. After surgery, the patient was extubated and has had no respiratory symptoms.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The patient had unique anatomic considerations that made reconstruction challenging. Our technique of covering a stenotic section by normal trachea is a modification of the slide tracheoplasty technique and is useful for CTS with a unilateral and a bilateral TB.
