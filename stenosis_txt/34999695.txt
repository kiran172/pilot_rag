Title: Echocardiographic Assessment of Valvular Involvement in Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease in BSMMU, Bangladesh.

Abstract: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a disease of poverty, is almost entirely preventable, and is the most common cardiovascular disease worldwide in those under 25 years especially in the developing county like Bangladesh. RHD is caused by acute rheumatic fever (ARF) which typically results in cumulative valvular lesions that may present clinically after a number of years of sub-clinical disease. It has a progressive course and patients usually may require valve repair/replacement in future. Echocardiography is an easily available, non-invasive, widely used, standard tool for diagnosis and evaluation of RHD. But there is scarcity of echocardiographic study of Valvular Involvement in Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease (CHRD) in Bangladesh. This study was aimed to utilize echocardiography as a tool to evaluate patients of CRHD in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. This observational study was conducted in the Department of Cardiology, BSMMU from September 2018 to August 2019. Echocardiography was done in each patient only once with VividE9®machine. Among 1350 echocardiography, 101 patients (7.5%) were diagnosed as RHD including post valve replacement patients. The mean age of the patients was 40±14 years and 64.34% were female. Mitral stenosis (MS) was the commonest lesion in 84.15% followed by mitral regurgitation (MR) in 66.33%, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in 57.43%, aortic regurgitation (AR) in 49.51%, aortic stenosis (AS) in 26.74% and pulmonary regurgitation in 10.89%. The frequency of complications like pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), LA thrombus, stroke and infective endocarditis was 67.33%, 61.05%, 18.81%, 6.93%, 3.96% and 0.99% respectively. History of Rheumatic fever was present only in 10.89% patient. Mitral stenosis was the commonest lesion seen mostly in female and most common complication was pulmonary hypertension. Mean age of patients in this study was higher than other contemporary studies and frequency as well as severity of complications was also more in female.
