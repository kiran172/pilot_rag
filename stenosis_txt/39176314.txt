Title: Laparoscopic Median Arcuate Ligament Release During Gastric Tube Reconstruction in Subtotal Esophagectomy for a Patient With Esophageal Cancer Complicated by Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lower thoracic esophagus following an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy during a health check-up, which revealed a type 0-IIc tumor. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, with suspicion of submucosal invasion. The patient was referred to our department. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest and abdomen showed no apparent lymph node or distant metastasis. Severe stenosis at the origin of the celiac artery, likely due to the median arcuate ligament, was observed. No abdominal symptoms were noted at rest or after meals, leading to the diagnosis of thoracic esophageal cancer with asymptomatic median arcuate ligament syndrome. Subsequently, laparoscopic median arcuate ligament release was performed during gastric tube reconstruction in subtotal esophagectomy.
