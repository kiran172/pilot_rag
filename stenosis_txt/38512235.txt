Title: [Implications of total laryngectomy].

Abstract: This clinical lesson describes three patients with problems after a total laryngectomy. Patient A suffered from acute tracheitis and narrowing of the tracheostoma. Patient B experienced acute dyspnea due to thick mucus plugs. Patient C had progressive symptoms of deteriorating speech and dysphagia, which resolved after dilatation of a pharyngeal stenosis. A total laryngectomy leads to definitive changes in anatomy and physiology. In case of respiratory symptoms, it is important to recognize the tracheostoma is the only entrance to the airway. Speech is generally well rehabilitated with a speech valve in a tracheoesophageal fistula.
