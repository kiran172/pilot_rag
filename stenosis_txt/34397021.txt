Title: Risk Factors for Maternal and Perinatal Complications during Pregnancy among Women with Tetralogy of Fallot.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease during pregnancy. Studies of risk factors are of great significance to maternal and fetal outcomes in patients with TOF.
AIMS: To identify predictive risk factors for maternal and perinatal complications in women with TOF.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 78 patients with TOF who delivered at Shanghai Obstetrical Cardiology Intensive Care Center between January 1993 and December 2017 were retrospective reviewed. A logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors for maternal and perinatal complications.
RESULTS: There was no maternal death, five patients developed cardiac failure, sustained arrhythmias requiring treatments were recorded among 2 patients. Factors identified for maternal complications included previous cardiac events and oxygen saturation <90%. Oxygen saturation <90% was found to be independent predictor of maternal cardiac complications (RR = 21.455, 95%CI 2.186-210.572, P = 0.009). The perinatal survival rate was 87.18%, there were 52 term deliveries (66.67%). Perinatal poor outcomes include 9 therapeutic abortions (11.54%), 1 neonatal death (1.28%), 16 premature births (20.51%), 18 small for gestational age children (23.08%), 3 neonatal asphyxia (3.85%), and 3 neonatal cardiac malformations (3.85%). Factors identified for perinatal complications included without cardiac surgery, higher hemoglobin values, higher hematocrit values, oxygen saturation <90%, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary hypertension. Oxygen saturation <90% was found to be independent predictor of perinatal complications (RR = 8.270, 95%CI 1.374-49.790, P = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Oxygen saturation <90% is associated with maternal and perinatal risks. Women with TOF whose oxygen saturation <90% are not recommended for pregnancy because of high maternal and perinatal complications.
