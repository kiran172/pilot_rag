Title: Incidentally detected Vieussens' arterial ring-to-pulmonary trunk fistula in a patient with aortic stenosis.

Abstract: We report a case of a 45-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis where computed tomography angiography incidentally revealed a fistulous communication between the conal branches of the right coronary artery and anterior interventricular artery and the left anterolateral aspect of the pulmonary trunk with a conglomerate of nondilated tortuous vessels along the anterior surface of right ventricular outflow tract.
