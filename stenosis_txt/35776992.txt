Title: The role of polyglycolic acid sheets in the management of post-endoscopic submucosal dissection gastrointestinal bleeding and esophageal stricture: A PRISMA compliant systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: As a relatively minimally invasive technique, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal lesions. However, it is associated with complications, such as postoperative bleeding, stricture, and perforation. A covering method using polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets for ESD-induced ulcers has been reported to be effective in reducing the risk of post-ESD bleeding and esophageal stricture. Herein, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the role of PGA sheets in the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding and esophageal stricture after ESD.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases on October 15, 2019. All eligible articles were selected based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main outcomes were the rates of post-ESD gastrointestinal bleeding and esophageal stricture. Cochrane's Q statistic and I2 test were used to identify heterogeneity between the studies. When there was no obvious heterogeneity (I2 < 50%, P > .1), a fixed-effect model was used. When there was obvious heterogeneity (I2 > 50%, P < .1), a random effect model was used. Funnel plots and the Egger regression test were used to assess publication bias.
RESULTS: Fifteen articles were included in the meta-analysis, of which 7 were exclusively about the use of PGA sheets to prevent postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding, and the remaining reported the use of PGA sheets to prevent postoperative esophageal stenosis. Our analysis showed that preventive therapy with PGA sheets decreased the rates of post-ESD gastrointestinal bleeding (risk ratio [RR] = 0.35, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 0.19-0.64, P < .001) and esophageal stricture (RR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.79, P = .005), and the gastrointestinal bleeding and esophageal stricture rates after preventive treatment with PGA sheets were 5.7% (95% CI: 3.6%-8.8%) and 20.6% (95% CI: 14.5%-28.4%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The utilization of PGA sheets after ESD has an excellent outcome in reducing the risk of postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding and esophageal stricture.
