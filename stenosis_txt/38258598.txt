Title: Carotid Revascularization is Associated with Improved Mood in Patients with Advanced Carotid Disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of carotid interventions on patients' mental condition in patients with carotid stenosis.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Ongoing research highlights the impact of carotid interventions on neurocognitive function in patients with advanced carotid atherosclerosis. However, data regarding the impact of carotid revascularization on mood is scarce.
METHODS: A total of 157 patients undergoing carotid revascularization were prospectively recruited. The primary outcome was depression, evaluated pre-operatively, and at 1-,6- and 12-month post-intervention using the long form of the geriatric depression scale (GDS-30) questionnaire. Other tests were also used to assess cognition at the respective timepoints. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the postoperative outcomes compared to baseline.
RESULTS: Baseline depression (GDS>9) was observed in 49(31%) subjects, whereas 108(69%) patients were not depressed (GDS≤9). The average pre-operative GDS score was 15.42 ± 4.40(14.2-16.7) and 4.28 ±2.9(3.7-4.8) in the depressed and non-depressed groups, respectively. We observed a significant improvement in GDS scores within the depressed group at 1-month (P=0.002), 6-months (P=0.027), and 1-year (P<0.001) post-intervention compared to preop, whereas the non-depressed group had similar post-op GDS scores at all time points compared to baseline. Significant improvement in measures of executive function was seen in non-depressed patients at all three timepoints whereas depressed patients showed an improvement at 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights improvement in mood among patients with advanced carotid disease who screened positive for depression at baseline. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to investigate the association between depression, carotid disease, and carotid intervention.
