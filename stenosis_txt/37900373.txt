Title: A Case Report of Necrotizing Fasciitis Managed With the Application of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy to Achieve Better Wound Closure.

Abstract: Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe and potentially life-threatening infection of the soft tissues that involves the skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia, and muscle. It can rapidly spread and lead to tissue death, sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, cardiopulmonary failure, and even death, especially in patients with chronic diseases, immunocompromised status, or immobility. To control the spread of necrosis, prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical intervention with radical debridement of the affected tissues are essential, along with the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive care support, when required. The application of negative pressure wound therapy has been utilized in the management of acute and complicated wounds with good outcomes. Here, we present a case of an 82-year-old female who presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension with underlying comorbid conditions of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and spinal stenosis. On further exploration, she was found to have necrotizing fasciitis involving the left gluteal region. The present article describes the use of a vacuum-assisted closure dressing as an adjunct to serial debridement in the treatment of severe necrotizing fasciitis.
