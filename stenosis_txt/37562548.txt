Title: Long-term outcomes after EUS-guided antegrade intervention for benign bilioenteric anastomotic stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bilioenteric anastomotic stricture (BES) is a well-known adverse event after bilioenterostomy. Recently, EUS-guided antegrade intervention (EUS-AI) has been developed for cases that are difficult to treat by balloon enteroscopy-assisted ERCP. However, no data are available on the long-term outcomes after EUS-AI. The main goal of the present study was to clarify the long-term outcomes of EUS-AI in such patients.
METHODS: Between November 2013 and November 2021, 34 patients who were followed for more than 1 year after EUS-AI for BES were identified. The primary endpoint was the rate of stricture resolution. Secondary endpoints were factors associated with stricture resolution, rate of BES recurrence, rate of conversion to surgery, and rate of hepatic fibrosis progression during follow-up.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 56.7 months. Stricture resolution was achieved in 17 of 34 patients (50%). A multivariate analysis confirmed that the presence of bile duct stones (odds ratio, 9.473; 95% confidence interval, 1.66-53.98; PÂ = .01) was significantly associated with stricture resolution. The stricture recurrence rate was 33%, and the median time from stent removal to recurrence was 31.2 months. Four patients underwent surgery because of recurrent cholangitis. During the median follow-up period of 56.7 months, 25% progressed to hepatic fibrosis based on the Fibrosis-4 index grade. Interestingly, patients without cholangitis during follow-up did not show progression of hepatic fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: EUS-AI has achieved acceptable long-term clinical outcomes. EUS-AI can be a viable alternative treatment of choice before surgical treatment in patients who are difficult to treat by conventional approaches.
