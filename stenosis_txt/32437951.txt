Title: Outcome benefit of arterial duplex stent imaging after superficial femoral artery stent implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In-stent stenosis is a frequent complication of superficial femoral artery (SFA) endovascular intervention and can lead to stent occlusion or symptom recurrence. Arterial duplex stent imaging (ADSI) can be used in the surveillance for recurrent stenosis; however, its uniform application is controversial. In this study, we aimed to determine, in patients undergoing SFA stent implantation, whether surveillance with ADSI yielded a better outcome than in those with only ankle-brachial index (ABI) follow-up.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing SFA stent implantation for occlusive disease at a tertiary care referral center between 2009 and 2016. The patients were divided into those with ADSI and those with ABI follow-up only. Life-table analysis comparing stent patency, major adverse limb events (MALEs), limb salvage, and mortality between groups was performed.
RESULTS: There were 248 patients with SFA stent implantation included, 160 in the ADSI group and 88 in the ABI group. Groups were homogeneous in clinical indications of claudication and critical limb-threatening ischemia (for ADSI, 39% and 61%; for ABI, 38% and 62%; P = .982) and TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus class A, B, C, and D lesions (for ADSI, 17%, 45%, 16%, and 22%; for ABI, 21%, 43%, 16%, and 20%; P = .874). Primary patency was similar between groups at 12, 36, and 56 months (ADSI, 65%, 43%, and 32%; ABI, 69%, 34%, and 34%; P = .770), whereas ADSI patients showed an improved assisted primary patency (84%, 68%, and 54%) vs ABI patients (76%, 38%, and 38%; P = .008) and secondary patency. There was greater freedom from MALEs in the ADSI group (91%, 76%, and 64%) vs the ABI group (79%, 46%, and 46%; P < .001) at 12, 36, and 56 months of follow-up. ADSI patients were more likely to undergo an endovascular procedure as their initial post-SFA stent implantation intervention (P = .001), whereas ABI patients were more likely to undergo an amputation (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In SFA stent implantation, patients with ADSI follow-up demonstrate an advantage in assisted primary patency and secondary patency and are more likely to undergo an endovascular reintervention. These factors are likely to have effected a decrease in MALEs, indicating the benefit of a more universal adoption of post-SFA stent implantation follow-up ADSI.
