Title: Association of systemic inflammatory response index and plaque characteristics with the severity and recurrence of cerebral ischemic events.

Abstract: AIM: We aimed to investigate the relationship between systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) and intracranial plaque features, as well as the risk factors related to the severity and recurrence of cerebral ischemic events.
METHODS: We enrolled 170 patients with cerebral ischemic events. Baseline demographic characteristics and laboratory indicators were collected from all participants. All patients were assessed by high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging for culprit plaque characteristics and intracranial atherosclerotic burden. Outpatient or telephone follow-up were conducted at 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge.
RESULTS: SIRI levels were significantly associated with the enhanced plaque number (r = 0.205, p = 0.007), total plaque stenosis score (r = 0.178, p = 0.020), total plaque enhancement score (r = 0.222, p = 0.004), intraplaque hemorrhage (F = 5.630, p = 0.004), and plaque surface irregularity (F = 3.986, p = 0.021). Higher SIRI levels (OR = 1.892), total plaque enhancement score (OR = 1.392), intraplaque hemorrhage (OR = 3.370) and plaque surface irregularity (OR = 2.846) were independent risk factors for moderate-severe stroke, and these variables were significantly positively correlated with NIHSS (P < 0.05 for all). In addition, higher age (HR = 1.063, P = 0.015), higher SIRI levels (HR = 2.003, P < 0.001), and intraplaque hemorrhage (HR = 4.482, P = 0.008) were independently associated with recurrent stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher SIRI levels may have adverse effects on the vulnerability and burden of intracranial plaques, and links to the severity and recurrence of ischemic events. Therefore, SIRI may provide important supplementary information for evaluating intracranial plaque stability and risk stratification of patients.
