Title: Current Prostheses for Transcatheter Heart Valve Replacement: A Technical and Clinical Review.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a cornerstone in today's treatment of aortic stenosis. Modern transcatheter prostheses are continuously evolving and each one features different design traits. In this review, the authors provide insight in the technical differences of current prostheses and TAVR related clinical decision pathways, preferably useful for the beginners but also for advanced operators. Additionally, procedural considerations and comparative outcomes of the prostheses are discussed. In doing so, the authors aim to facilitate the choice of the ideal transcatheter valve procedure for each individual.
