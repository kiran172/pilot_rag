Title: Percutaneous Ureteral Stent Insertion in Patients with Benign Uretero-Ileal Anastomosis Strictures Who Underwent Radical Cystectomy: Assessing Risk Factors for Stent Patency.

Abstract: We aimed to investigate the risk factors of early double-J ureteral stent (DJUS) dysfunction rates and the long-term patency of DJUSs inserted via a percutaneous approach in patients with benign uretero-ileal anastomosis stricture (UIAS) who had undergone radical cystectomy. In this retrospective study, 63 DJUS placements were placed via a percutaneous nephrostomy tract in 42 consecutive patients between May 2020 and March 2023. The technical success rate was 100% in all patients without major complications. The early dysfunction rate and long-term patency rate were 38.1% (24/63) and 84.2% (32/38), respectively. The blood clot retention grade, balloon dilatation, and length of the ureteral stricture exhibited a significant correlation with early DJUS dysfunction (blood clot retention grade: odds ratio (OR) 6.922 in grade two, p = 0.009; balloon dilatation: OR 0.186, p = 0.017; length of ureteral stricture: OR 8.715, p = 0.035 in moderate stenosis, and 7.646, p = 0.028 in severe stenosis). A multivariate Cox's proportional hazard analysis revealed that blood clot retention grade and length of ureteral stricture were independent predictors of long-term DJUS patency. Percutaneous insertion of the DJUSs was safe and effective in patients with benign UIAS.
