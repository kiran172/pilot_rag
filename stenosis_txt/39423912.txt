Title: Long-term follow-up for the treatment of symptomatic pelvic venous insufficiency secondary to combined iliac vein stenosis and ovarian vein reflux treated with iliac vein stenting alone.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We previously reported that in women with symptomatic pelvic venous insufficiency secondary to combined iliac vein stenosis (IVS) and ovarian vein reflux (OVR), treated with iliac vein stenting alone that 78% reported complete symptom resolution up to 6 months. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the long-term effectiveness of this treatment strategy, the poststent reintervention rate and the incidence of poststent ovarian vein embolization (OVE) for residual symptoms.
METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data at the Center for Vascular Medicine was performed. We investigated women with pelvic pain or dyspareunia secondary to combined IVS and OVR who were treated with stenting alone. Patients whose primary complaint was dysmenorrhea and/or leg symptoms were excluded from the analysis. Assessments and interventions consisted of an evaluation for other causes of pelvic venous disorder by a gynecologist, documentation of preintervention and 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month visual analog scale pain scores; transabdominal duplex ultrasound examination; stent type, diameter, and length; vein territory covered; and reintervention rates. All patients underwent diagnostic venography of their pelvic, left ovarian veins, and pelvic reservoirs, and intravascular ultrasound examination of their iliac veins.
RESULTS: From February 2018 to January 2023, 141 women with a pelvic venous disorder secondary to IVS and OVR were identified. The average age was 44.7 ± 10.5 years with 3.18 ± 1.82 pregnancies. The average follow-up time for the entire cohort was 12.0 ± 12.1 months (median, 10.65 months). Types of stents were Venovo 48 (34%), Wallstent 14 (10%), and Abre 79 (56%). The most common diameter and stent lengths used were 14 and 16 mm and 140 and 150 mm, respectively. The most common vein territories covered were the inferior vena cava to the left external iliac vein in 83% and inferior vena cava to right external iliac vein in 13%. Pelvic and dyspareunia VAS scores before the intervention and at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the intervention were as follows: 6.4 ± 73 (n = 141), 2.6 ± 3.3 (n = 98), 1.71 ± 2.83 (n = 77), 2.04 ± 3.5 (n = 76), 2.4 ± 3.7 (n = 30), and 1.15 ± 3 (n = 13) (P ≤ .001). Of the entire cohort no patients required OVE and pelvic reservoir embolization. Pelvic reservoirs were present in 113 of 141 patients (83%). Stent reinterventions were required in 19 of 141 patients (13%).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women with pelvic pain secondary to combined IVS and OVR achieved near complete symptom resolution with iliac vein stenting alone, despite the presence of a pelvic reservoir in 83% of patients. Although most women complained of some minimal residual pelvic pain or dyspareunia, the majority were satisfied with their outcomes and did not require further intervention. In this patient population, iliac vein stenting should be considered the primary treatment modality. OVE should be reserved for patients with persistent or recurrent pelvic pain unresolved with stenting.
