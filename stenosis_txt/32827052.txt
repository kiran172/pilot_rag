Title: Outcome analysis and risk factors for postoperative colonic ischaemia after aortic surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Colonic ischaemia (CI) represents a serious complication after aortic surgery. This study aimed to analyse risk factors and outcome of patients suffering from postoperative CI.
METHODS: Data of 1404 patients who underwent aortic surgery were retrospectively analysed regarding CI occurrence. Co-morbidities, procedural parameters, colon blood supply, procedure-related morbidity and mortality as well as survival during follow-up (FU) were compared with patients without CI using matched-pair analysis (1:3).
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (2.4%) with CI were identified. Cardiovascular, pulmonary and renal comorbidity were more common in CI patients. Operation time was longer (283 ± 22 vs. 188 ± 7 min, p < 0.0001) and blood loss was higher (2174 ± 396 vs. 1319 ± 108 ml, p = 0.0049) in the CI group. Patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) showed a higher rate of CI compared to patients with intact AAA (5.4 vs. 1.9%, p = 0.0177). CI was predominantly diagnosed by endoscopy (26/35), generally within the first 4 postoperative days (20/35). Twenty-eight patients underwent surgery, all finalised with stoma creation. Postoperative bilateral occlusion and/or relevant stenosis of hypogastric arteries were more frequent in CI patients (57.8 vs. 20.8%, p = 0.0273). In-hospital mortality was increased in the CI group (26.7 vs. 2.9%, p < 0.0001). Survival was significantly reduced in CI patients (median: 28.2 months vs. 104.1 months, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: CI after aortic surgery is associated with considerable perioperative sequelae and reduced survival. Especially in patients at risk, such as those with rAAA, complicated intraoperative course, severe cardiovascular morbidity and/or perioperative deterioration of the hypogastric perfusion, vigilant postoperative multimodal monitoring is required in order to initiate diagnosis and treatment.
