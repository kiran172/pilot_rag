Title: Comparison of Delta Spinal Endoscopy and Bilateral Laminotomy for Short-term Patient Outcomes in Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: This prospective randomised controlled trial aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of Delta spinal endoscopy with bilateral laminotomy for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS). Eighty patients with DLSS were randomly assigned to two groups: 40 treatments by Delta spinal endoscopy named (A) and 40 treatments by bilateral laminotomy named (A). Patients were followed up for one year. The incision length, intraoperative bleeding, and hospitalisation time were lower in group A than in B (p <0.01); however, the operation time in group B was lower than in A (p <0.05). The VAS and ODI in both groups improved significantly after surgery, compared with the results before the surgery. The VAS and ODI in group A after surgery were lower than in B, but only for one week after the surgery, (p <0.05). The excellent rate of modified MacNab criteria was not statistically significant between groups A and B (p >0.05). Overall, Delta spinal endoscopy can effectively manage DLSS with faster patient recovery. Key Words: Delta spinal endoscopy, Spinal stenosis, Minimally invasive, Bilateral laminotomy.
