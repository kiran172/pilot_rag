Title: Congenital heart defects and postoperative follow-up of patients with Williams syndrome as a single center experience and review of the cases from Türkiye.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular system involvement is quite common and the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Williams syndrome (WS), most of whom need surgery. The present study aimed to provide a detailed evaluation of the features of surgical procedures and outcomes of patients with WS given as single-center experience, and additionally to make a detailed review from Türkiye.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five children with WS diagnosed between the years 1992 and 2021 were evaluated retrospectively including cardiovascular data, surgical treatment features, and outcomes. A total of six articles from Türkiye were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 35 patients with Williams Syndrome (24 male) with a median age of cardiologic diagnosis of 6 months (range, 2 days-6 years) were evaluated. The cardiac defects of the patients with WS were found as supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) (n=30, 85%) and peripheral pulmonary stenosis (PPS) (n=21, 65%). Additional cardiac anomalies were seen in 71% patients. The rate of SVAS and PPS surgery in all patients with WS was 77.1%. The median surgical age of the patients was 2.5 years (range, 7 months-15.5 years). No patients died due to surgery. But one patient died because of ventricular tachycardia due to anesthesia at the beginning of angiography. A total of 138 (63% male) patients with WS were evaluated from the articles published in Türkiye. Of 138 patients, 64.4% had SVAS, 52.1% had PPS, and 39.8% had additional cardiac anomaly. The median follow-up period ranged from 17 months to 18 years, and six (4.3%) patients died in the early postoperative period.
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular system involvement is extremely common and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with WS, often requiring surgical intervention. As seen in our study including 35 patients with WS and in publications from Türkiye, SVAS in patients with WS generally requires surgery, especially in the first year of life. PPS, on the other hand, requires surgery less frequently than SVAS, and pulmonary stenosis appears to decrease over time.
