Title: Improvement in Vascular Endothelial Function following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Background and objectives: Endothelial dysfunction is associated with exercise intolerance and adverse cardiovascular events. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is applied to treat elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis, but less is known about the impact of TAVI on endothelial dysfunction, which can be assessed by measuring flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). In this parameter, a low value indicates impaired endothelial function. Materials and Methods: Vascular endothelial function was evaluated by FMD of the brachial artery just before and one week after TAVI. Factors associated with the normalization of FMD and their prognostic impact were investigated. Results: Fifty-one patients who underwent TAVI procedure (median 86 years old, 12 men) were included. FMD improved significantly from baseline to one week following TAVI (from 5.3% [3.7%, 6.7%] to 6.3% [4.7%, 8.1%], p &lt; 0.001). Among 33 patients with baseline low FMD (â‰¤6.0%), FMD normalized up to &gt;6.0% following TAVI in 15 patients. Baseline higher cardiac index was independently associated with normalization of FMD following TAVI (odds ratio 11.8, 95% confidence interval 1.12-124; p &lt; 0.04). Conclusions: Endothelial dysfunction improved following TAVI in many patients with severe aortic stenosis. The implication of this finding is the next concern.
