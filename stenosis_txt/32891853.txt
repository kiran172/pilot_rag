Title: Comparison of Navigated versus Fluoroscopic-Guided Pedicle Screw Placement Accuracy and Complication Rate.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Accurate placement of the pedicle screw is requisite for any successful spinal instrumentation procedure. Screw insertion can be achieved using free-hand and fluoroscopic- or navigation-guided techniques. We sought to assess the variation in accuracy between fluoroscopic- and navigation-guided techniques, which are both used in Sheffield Teaching Hospitals National Health Service Trust, a tertiary spine referral center.
METHODS: Using a retrospective study design, we assessed all the pedicle screws placed between 2013 and 2018. Radiographic and clinical assessment of all cases was performed.
RESULTS: We studied 176 spinal instrumented cases, with a total of 831 screws implanted, out of which 296 (35.6%) were navigated and 535 (64.4%) were fluoroscopic guided. Pathology treated included spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, tumors, and trauma. Suboptimal screw position was identified in 2.03% (n = 6) of the navigation-guided series and 4.11% (n = 22) of the fluoroscopic-guided series with an overall screw misplacement rate of 3.4%. Evaluating surgeons' individual accuracy rates revealed that suboptimal screw placement registered a higher variation for the fluoroscopy-guided technique, and the misplacement rate was higher for surgeons with a lower volume of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of navigation during spinal instrumentation helps lower the rate of screw misplacement for spinal surgeons who are at the beginning of their learning curve or do not frequently perform this kind of procedure. Navigation-guided spinal instrumentation is more accurate compared with fluoroscopic-guided techniques and appears to have a lower complication rate.
