Title: Temporal Trends in Patient Characteristics and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement: A Nationwide Study.

Abstract: With increased use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in treatment of aortic stenosis, it is important to evaluate real life data trends in outcomes. This nationwide register-based study aimed to present an outlook on temporal trends in characteristics and outcomes, including mortality. First-time consecutive Danish patients who underwent TAVI from 2010 to 2019 were included in this study. The chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to assess the differences in the characteristics over time and Cochrane-Armitage trend tests were used to examine changes in complications and mortality. Between 2010 and 2019, 4,847 patients (54.6% men, median age 82 [quartile 1 to quartile 3: 77 to 85] years) underwent first-time TAVI. A statistically significant decrease over time was observed for preprocedural hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure, whereas preexisting chronic obstructive lung disease and preprocedural pacemaker remained stable. We observed a significant decrease in 30- and 90-day postoperative preprocedural pacemaker implantation from 2011 to 2017, with 15.1% and 15.9% in 2011 and 8.6% and 8.9% in 2017, respectively. The incidence of for 30- and 90-day heart failure significantly decreased from 19.3% and 20.3% to 8.5% and 9.1%, respectively. We observed significant changes for 30-day atrial fibrillation, whereas the changes over time for 90-day atrial fibrillation and 30- and 90-day stroke/transient ischemic attack remained insignificant. The all-cause mortality within 30- and 90 days significantly decreased over time from 6.7% and 9.2% in 2011 to 1.5% and 2.7% in 2019 and 2016, respectively. In conclusion, this national study provides general insight on the trends of complications and mortality of TAVI, demonstrating significant reductions over time.
