Title: Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients Receiving Chronic Systemic Corticosteroid Treatment.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of chronic systemic corticosteroid treatment (SCT) on early and late outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). From October 2006 to November 2018, 1,299 patients underwent TAVI in our institution. Among them, 48 (3.7%) received chronic SCT at the time of procedure (SCT group). They were more frequently women (p = 0.08) and needed more often dialysis (p = 0.002). All other baseline characteristics were similar between both groups. At 30 days, there was no difference on mortality. However, after adjustment, the SCT group had more major vascular complications: 16.7% versus 7.4%, hazard ratio (HR) 2.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 5.9, p = 0.023), major or life-threatening bleedings: 22.9% versus 12.4%, HR 2.02 (95% CI 1.00 to 4.08, p = 0.05), and tamponades: 8.3% versus 2.4%, HR 4.05 (95% CI 1.35 to 12.15, p <0.001) than the non-SCT group. One-year all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the SCT than in the non-SCT group (37.5% vs 12.5%, p <0.0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that SCT use was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.16 to 4.50, p = 0.017). In conclusion, chronic use of SCT significantly increases the rates of early vascular complications, major or life-threatening bleedings and tamponade and is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality after TAVI.
