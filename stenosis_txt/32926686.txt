Title: A Case Report on Paget-Schroetter Syndrome Presenting as Acute Localized Rhabdomyolysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The life- or limb-threatening differential diagnosis for upper extremity swelling can include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), infectious processes, and compartment syndrome. Chronic anatomic abnormalities such as axillary vein stenosis are rarely a consideration in the emergency department.
CASE REPORT: We present a 26-year-old female with history of Chiari type 1 malformation who presented with acute left arm swelling. Initial workup, including point-of-care ultrasound, revealed the presence of significant soft tissue swelling without evidence of DVT.
CONCLUSION: Further workup revealed an early, localized rhabdomyolysis secondary to axillary vein stenosis or venous thoracic outlet syndrome, also known as Paget-Schroetter syndrome.
