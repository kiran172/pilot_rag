Title: Association between dietary fiber intake and risk of incident aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease requiring intervention in Europe, the role that diet plays in development of the disease is largely unknown. The pathophysiology of aortic stenosis is however similar to other cardiovascular diseases that fiber intake has been associated with. The aim of this study was consequently to investigate the association between dietary fiber intake as well as the main food sources of fiber, i.e. fruit and vegetables and whole grains, and risk of incident aortic stenosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Malm√∂ Diet and Cancer Study is a Swedish prospective population-based cohort study with baseline data collection performed between year 1991-1996. Dietary habits were recorded through seven-day food diaries, 168-item diet questionnaires, and interviews, and data on incident aortic stenosis was collected through national registers. Among the 26,063 participants, 672 cases were ascertained during a mean follow-up period of 20 years. Cox regression was used to estimate the association between dietary intakes and incident aortic stenosis. No associations were found between incident aortic stenosis and intake of dietary fiber (HR for the highest vs lowest quintile: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.72-1.24), fruit and vegetables (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.76-1.28), or whole grains (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.79-1.26) in the main model.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study do not indicate that consumption of dietary fiber or fiber rich foods are associated with incident aortic stenosis.
