Title: A Case of Occlusive Radiation Vasculopathy Presenting as Bilateral Internal Carotid Artery, Left Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Literature Review.

Abstract: Radiation vasculopathy is one of the rare causes of ischemic stroke. Carotid stenosis with large volume infarction may occur years after radiation therapy for head or neck cancer. We report a case of a patient with bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion presenting with left middle cerebral artery infarct 10 years after receiving treatment for tongue cancer. A literature review and discussion of treatment for such patients are presented.
