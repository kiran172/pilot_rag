Title: Cervicovaginal reconstruction with small intestinal submucosa graft in congenital cervicovaginal atresia: A report of 38 cases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of life and surgical outcomes in patients with congenital cervicovaginal malformation after cervicovaginal reconstruction.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with congenital cervicovaginal aplasia and underwent cervicovaginal reconstruction using acellular porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) grafts were included in the study from January 2012 to December 2019. Of these, twenty-one patients underwent conventional laparoscopy, nine underwent robotic surgery, and eight underwent laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. Clinical characteristics, perioperative data, condition of the neovagina and neocevix, post-operation complications, body image, resumption of menstruation, sexual function, and quality of life were assessed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 16.4 ± 5.78 years. The operative procedure lasted 182.29 ± 70.85 min, with a hemoglobin decrease of 12.53 ± 7.55 g/dl. All surgery was completed successfully without complications. The total cost was highest in the robotic surgery group (P < 0.001). The cosmetic scores were significantly higher in the LESS group (P < 0.001). At a median follow-up of 49.79 ± 31.02 months, all patients resumed menstruation, except one patient who underwent hysterectomy due to vaginal obstruction. The average length of neovagina was 8.11 ± 0.75 cm, and the length of the cervix was 1.73 ± 1.00 cm. There were one patient with vaginal stenosis, two patients with cervical occlusion, two patients with cervical stenosis, and six patients with intrauterine device loss. Fourteen patients experienced sexual activity, with the total female sexual function index scores of 26.83 ± 3.49. Six patients had a desire of pregnancy, and one patient had pregnant via assisted-reproduction techniques. No differences in the mean physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) were identified among three different groups at baseline and all post-surgery time points (P > 0.05), but with the extension of follow-up, both PCS and MCS increased significantly in all groups (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Cervicovaginal reconstruction using an SIS graft is safe and efficient to the management of congenital cervicovaginal atresia whatever by the conventional laparoscopy, robotic surgery or LESS, with good surgical outcomes and high of quality of life.
