Title: Atypical femoral fracture mimicking lumbar radiculopathy in two patients taking bisphosphonate long-term: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atypical femoral fracture (AFF) is a rare complication in patients with osteoporosis undergoing long-term bisphosphonate therapy. The most common symptom of incomplete AFF is nonspecific thigh pain, which is often difficult to distinguish from other causes.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present two cases of AFF misdiagnosed as lumbar radiculopathy. Both patients visited our hospital for thigh pain, and in both cases the findings of lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging showed substantial nerve compression. These patients had been treated for lumbar radiculopathy, but localized symptoms became conspicuous and femoral radiographs revealed complete AFF. The initial radiographs were reviewed retrospectively and revealed slight lateral cortical thickening in the affected femur, denoting a missed incomplete AFF. Internal fixation with intramedullary nails was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: AFF may mimic lumbar radiculopathy. Therefore, clinicians should consider AFF as a differential diagnosis in older patients with lumbar canal stenosis who are undergoing long-term bisphosphonate therapy and present with thigh pain.
