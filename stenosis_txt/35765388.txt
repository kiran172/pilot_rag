Title: ST-Segment Elevation Secondary to Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum in the Setting of COVID-19 Infection: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: A 45-year-old male presented with shortness of breath, cough,and chest discomfort. He reported positive test results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) four days prior; this was confirmed by a second test administered at the hospital. Results of a chest CT, consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia, also revealed pneumomediastinum (PM). EKG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads with no reciprocal changes. Emergent cardiac catheterization showed that he had no stenosis in his major coronary arteries. His symptoms resolved after 25 days of hospitalization and the patient was ultimately discharged. This case highlights the importance of recognizing spontaneous PM as a complication of COVID-19 along with its uncommon presentation of ST elevation in order to prevent unnecessary invasive procedures.
