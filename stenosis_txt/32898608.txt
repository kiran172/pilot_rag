Title: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis pathway is involved in coronary artery stenosis and restenosis.

Abstract: The inflammatory events related to prostaglandins may play an important role in the progression of vessel stenosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the monocyte PTGES and 15-PGDH gene expression levels and the serum 13,14-dihyro-15-keto-PGF2α value involved in PGE2 metabolism in patients with coronary artery stenosis and restenosis. Moreover, the effects of miR-520, miR-1297 and miR-34 were studied on the gene expression levels. A total of sixty subjects referred for coronary angiography including healthy controls (stenosis <5%), subjects with stent no restenosis) SNR, stenosis <5%) and subjects in stent restenosis (ISR, restenosis >70%) were participated in the study. The gene expression levels and the serum 13,14-dihyro-15-keto- PGF2α value were measured by RT-qPCR and ELISA techniques, respectively. Moreover, the effects of miRNAs on the gene expression levels were investigated by the monocyte transfection of miR/PEI complexes. The PTGES and 15-PGDH gene expression levels and serum 13,14-dihyro-15-keto- PGF2α value increased significantly (P <0.05). Based on the miR-520 and miR-34 expression levels, the miR/PEI transfection studies were confirmed significantly the gene expression changes. The monocyte PGE2 synthesis pathway is actively considered in the SNR and ISR patients and might be related to miR-34 and miR-520 functions.
