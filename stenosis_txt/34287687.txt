Title: Usefulness of optical coherence tomography with angiographic coregistration in the guidance of coronary stent implantation.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT)-angiography coregistration during stent implantation may be useful to avoid geographical mismatch and incomplete lesion coverage. Untreated lipid-rich plaque at stent edge is associated with subsequent stent edge restenosis. The present study sought to compare the frequency of untreated lipid-rich plaque at the stent edge between OCT-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with and without OCT-angiography coregistration. We investigated 398 patients who underwent OCT-guided stent implantation (n = 198 in the coregistration group, and n = 200 in the no coregistration group). In OCT after PCI, untreated lipid-lich plaque was identified by the maximum lipid arc > 180˚ in the 5-mm stent edge segment. The PCI-targeted lesion characteristics and stent length were not different between the coregistration group and the no coregistration group. The frequency of untreated lipid-rich plaque in either proximal or distal stent edge segment was significantly lower in the coregistration group than in the no coregistration group (16% vs. 26%, P = 0.015). The frequency of stent-edge dissection (5% vs. 6%, P = 0.516) and untreated stenosis (2% vs. 3%, P = 0.724) was low and without significant differences between the two groups. In OCT-guided PCI, the use of OCT-angiography coregistration was associated with a reduced frequency of untreated lipid-rich plaque at stent edges. OCT-angiography coregistration has a positive impact on PCI results.
