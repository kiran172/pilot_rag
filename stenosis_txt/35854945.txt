Title: Aplastic or twig-like middle cerebral artery harboring unruptured cerebral aneurysms treated by clipping and bypass surgery: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aplastic or twig-like middle cerebral artery (Ap/T-MCA) is a congenital MCA anomaly. It may present with symptoms of both hemorrhage and ischemia, similar to moyamoya disease, and hemodynamic stress may play an essential role in the development of symptoms in both clinical entities. The optimal treatment remains controversial in symptomatic patients with Ap/T-MCA. This report discussed the treatment method for a patient with Ap/T-MCA with unruptured aneurysms who presented with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) treated by aneurysm clipping and bypass surgery.
OBSERVATIONS: In a 46-year-old woman with a sudden headache, computed tomography showed left IVH. Magnetic resonance angiography showed a left MCA aneurysm and MCA trunk stenosis. Three-dimensional angiography demonstrated a plexiform arterial network and multiple aneurysms arising from the MCA and in the plexiform network, leading to the diagnosis of Ap/T-MCA harboring unruptured aneurysms. The patient was successfully treated by craniotomy with aneurysm clipping and bypass surgery to prevent further intracranial hemorrhages and/or aneurysm rupture.
LESSONS: Especially in cases such as Ap/T-MCA, in which hemodynamic stress has a significant effect, the optimal treatment method should be based on vascular morphology and the impact of hemodynamic stress.
