Title: Apico-aortic conduit: a readily available technical modification.

Abstract: When neither surgical valve replacement nor transcatheter aortic valve implantation is possible, performing an apico-aortic conduit remains a therapeutic option. This procedure has become rare and the rigid angled apical connectors usually used to facilitate ventricular anastomosis are no longer commercially available. We described the technique that we performed on a 60-year-old patient with readily available material.
