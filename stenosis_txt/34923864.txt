Title: Carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic octogenarians: Outcomes at 30 days and 5 years.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The following study investigated the 30-day and 5-year relative survival rate and freedom from neurological events in asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) octogenarians who had undergone elective carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: Between January 2008 and June 2014, a retrospective review was conducted on ACS patients who had undergone elective CEA. The patients' sample was divided into two groups: Group A (GA) included octogenarians and Group B (GB) included younger patients. The GA patients were subjected to a risk-scoring system and follow-up. The two groups were compared analysing the following primary endpoints: 30-day mortality, stroke, stroke/death and acute myocardial infarction (AMI); GA patients' survival rate and freedom from neurological events at 5 years. The 30-day secondary endpoints included carotid shunting, redo surgical, need for general anaesthesia with preserved consciousness (GAPC) conversion and length of hospital stay.
RESULTS: We identified 620 patients with ACS, of them 144 (23.2%) belonged to the GA and 476 (76.8%) belonged to the GB. No statistical difference between the two groups was found regarding the primary and secondary endpoints. One hundred nineteen of 144 GA patients (82.6%) underwent the follow-up; the median follow-up was 78.3 months. The GA patients' 5-year survival rate was 62%, while freedom from cerebral events was 94.9%. Analysis regarding GA patients' 5-year survival rate revealed a significantly lower percentage among the patients with a severe risk score compared with those with a moderate risk score (respectively, 29.5% vs 67.7%; p = .005). The multivariate analysis showed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were independently associated with lower survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day outcomes of CEA in octogenarians are comparable to those in younger patients. Comprehensive life expectancy and preoperative score, rather than age alone, should be taken into account before performing CEA on octogenarian patients, considering the short- and long-term efficacy in stroke prevention.
