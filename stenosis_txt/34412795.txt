Title: Physiological Distribution and Local Severity of Coronary Artery Disease and Outcomes After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic implications of physiological 2-dimensional disease patterns on the basis of distribution and local severity of coronary atherosclerosis determined by quantitative flow ratio (QFR) virtual pull back.
BACKGROUND: The beneficial effect of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is determined by physiological distribution and local severity of coronary atherosclerosis.
METHODS: The study population included 341 patients who underwent angiographically successful PCI and post-PCI fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement. Using pre-PCI virtual pull backs of QFR, physiological distribution was determined by pull back pressure gradient index, with a cutoff value of 0.78 to define predominant focal versus diffuse disease. Physiological local severity was assessed by instantaneous QFR gradient per unit length, with a cutoff value of ≥0.025/mm to define a major gradient. Suboptimal post-PCI physiological results were defined as both post-PCI FFR ≤0.85 and percentage FFR increase ≤15%. Clinical outcome was assessed by target vessel failure (TVF) at 2 years.
RESULTS: QFR pull back pressure gradient index was correlated with post-PCI FFR (R = 0.423; P < 0.001), and instantaneous QFR gradient per unit length was correlated with percentage FFR increase (R = 0.370; P < 0.001). Using the 2 QFR-derived indexes, disease patterns were classified into 4 categories: predominant focal disease with and without major gradient (group 1 [n = 150] and group 2 [n = 21], respectively) and predominant diffuse disease with and without major gradient (group 3 [n = 115] and group 4 [n = 55], respectively). Proportions of suboptimal post-PCI physiological results were significantly different according to the 4 disease patterns (18.7%, 23.8%, 22.6%, and 56.4% from group 1 to group 4, respectively; P < 0.001). Cumulative incidence of TVF after PCI was significantly higher in patients with predominant diffuse disease (8.1% in group 3 and 9.9% in group 4 vs 1.4% in group 1 and 0.0% in group 2; overall P = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Both physiological distribution and local severity of coronary atherosclerosis could be characterized without pressure-wire pull backs, which determined post-PCI physiological results. After successful PCI, TVF risk was determined mainly by the physiological distribution of coronary atherosclerosis.
