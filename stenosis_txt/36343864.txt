Title: Prospective Assessment of Genital Pain in Patients With Urethral Stricture: Incidence, Associations, and Impact of Urethroplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of genital pain in patients with urethral stricture and examine the impact of urethroplasty. Genital pain is a common and challenging urological condition and potentially associated with urethral stricture.
METHODS: From 2011-2019, patients were offered enrollment in a prospective single-center study assessing patient-reported genital pain pre- and 6-months posturethroplasty. Genital pain was assessed with the question, "Do you experience genital (scrotum or penis) pain?" answered on a five-point scale ["Never" (1), "Occasionally" (2), "Sometimes" (3), "Most of the Time" (4) or "All of the Time" (5)]. Responses of 3, 4, or 5 were considered clinically significant. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre- and postoperative states and logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between genital pain and clinical variables.
RESULTS: Of the 387 patients completing enrollment, 36.4% (141/387) reported genital pain preoperatively. Patients with panurethral stricture reported higher rates (57.1%) of pain (Odds Ratio 2.93, 95%CI 1.32-6.50; P = .008). Posturethroplasty, pain scores improved with an incidence of 14.2% (P < .0001). In patients reporting preoperative pain, 88.7% (125/141) experienced improvement, 8.5% were unchanged and 2.8% reported worsening pain. On logistic regression, patients with penile strictures (O.R. 0.24, 95%CI 0.06-0.91; P = .04), hypospadias (O.R. 0.14, 95%CI 0.02-0.88; P = .04), and staged reconstruction (O.R. 0.22, 95%CI 0.05-0.90; P = .04) were less likely to report improvement.
CONCLUSION: Genital pain is common in patients with urethral stricture and improves in the majority of patients undergoing urethroplasty but less so in patients with penile strictures, hypospadias and staged reconstruction.
