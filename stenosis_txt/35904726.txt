Title: Surgical aortic valve replacement provides better left ventricular mass regression than transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with small aortic annulus.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) and degree of left ventricular (LV) mass regression after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with small aortic annulus (defined as annular diameter of ≤ 21 mm).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed echocardiographic findings in total of 277 patients with aortic stenosis and small aortic annulus (63 underwent SAVR and 214 underwent TAVR) between October 2013 and March 2019. PPM was defined as an effective orifice area index (EOAI) ≤ 0.85 cm2/m2. LV mass regression was evaluated as percentage change in LV mass index (LVMI) from baseline to the 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The median EOAI before discharge was slightly larger in the TAVR group than in the SAVR group (1.09 vs. 1.07 cm2/m2; P = 0.030). However, the incidence of PPM before discharge (9.4 vs. 12.7%; P = 0.438) and at the 1-year follow-up (11.7 vs. 11.1%; P = 0.901) was similar between groups. Mild or greater paravalvular leakage (PVL) after the procedure was more frequent in the TAVR group (11.7 vs. 0%; P = 0.002). Reduction in LVMI was significantly higher in the SAVR group (19.3 vs. 6.4%; P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that reduction in LVMI was positively associated with higher baseline transaortic pressure gradient (P &lt; 0.001) and higher baseline LVMI (P &lt; 0.001) and negatively associated with older age (P &lt; 0.001) and mild or greater PVL (P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: SAVR provides better LV mass regression than TAVR with a comparable rate of PPM in patients with small aortic annulus.
