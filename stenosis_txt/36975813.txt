Title: New Diffusion Abnormalities Following Endovascular Treatment for Intracranial Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Background There are limited data on new ischemic brain lesions after endovascular treatment for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). Purpose To investigate the (a) characteristics of new ischemic brain lesions at diffusion-weighted MRI (new diffusion abnormalities) after endovascular treatment, (b) characteristics between those treated with balloon angioplasty and stent placement procedures, and (c) predictors of new ischemic brain lesions. Materials and Methods Patients with symptomatic ICAS in whom maximum medical therapy failed were prospectively enrolled between April 2020 and July 2021 from a national stroke center and underwent endovascular treatment. All study participants underwent thin-section diffusion-weighted MRI (voxel size, 1.4 × 1.4 × 2 mm3 with no section gap) before and after treatment. The characteristics of new ischemic brain lesions were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine potential predictors of new ischemic brain lesions. Results A total of 119 study participants (mean age, 59 years ± 11 [SD]; 81 men; 70 treated with balloon angioplasty and 49 with stent placement) were enrolled. Of the 119 participants, 77 (65%) had new ischemic brain lesions. Five of the 119 participants (4%) had symptomatic ischemic stroke. New ischemic brain lesions were located in (61%, 72 of 119) and/or beyond (35%, 41 of 119) the territory of the treated artery. Of the 77 participants with new ischemic brain lesions, 58 (75%) had lesions located in peripheral brain areas. There was no evidence of a difference in the frequency of new ischemic brain lesions between the balloon angioplasty and stent groups (60% vs 71%, P = .20). In adjusted models, cigarette smoking (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 9.7) and more than one operative attempt (OR, 2.9; 95% CI: 1.2, 7.0) were independent predictors of new ischemic brain lesions. Conclusion New ischemic brain lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI scans were common after endovascular treatment for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, and occurrence may be associated with cigarette smoking and the number of operative attempts.
