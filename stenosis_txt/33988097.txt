Title: Near-Occlusion is a Common Variant of Carotid Stenosis: Study and Systematic Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Symptomatic carotid near-occlusion is often described as rare. Recent studies have shown that near-occlusions are overlooked, especially near-occlusion without full collapse (with a small but normal-appearing distal internal carotid artery).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of near-occlusion among symptomatic ≥50% carotid stenosis, incidence of symptomatic near-occlusion, and review the literature.
METHODS: Prospective controlled single-center cross-sectional study. Consecutive cases with symptomatic ≥50% carotid stenosis were examined with computed tomography angiography (CTA). The CTAs were assessed for near-occlusion by two observers. A systematic literature review was performed with emphasis on how study design affects prevalence estimate.
RESULTS: Totally, 186 patients with symptomatic ≥50% carotid stenosis were included, 34% (n = 63, 95% CI 27, 41) had near-occlusion. The incidence of symptomatic near-occlusion was 3.4 (95% CI 2.5, 4.2) per 100,000 person-years. Inter-rater κ was 0.71. The average prevalence of near-occlusion among symptomatic ≥50% carotid stenosis was higher in studies with good design (30%, range 27%-34%) than studies without good design (9%, range 2%-10%).
CONCLUSIONS: Near-occlusion is common variant of symptomatic ≥50% carotid stenosis, both in the current study and in all previous studies of good design. Studies that suggest that near-occlusion is rare have had methodological issues.
