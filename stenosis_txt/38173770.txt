Title: Recent progress in functional modification and crosslinking of bioprosthetic heart valves.

Abstract: Valvular heart disease (VHD), clinically manifested as stenosis and regurgitation of native heart valve, is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases with high mortality. Heart valve replacement surgery has been recognized as golden standard for the treatment of VHD. Owing to the clinical application of transcatheter heart valve replacement technic and the excellent hemodynamic performance of bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs), implantation of BHVs has been increasing over recent years and gradually became the preferred choice for the treatment of VHD. However, BHVs might fail within 10-15â€‰years due to structural valvular degeneration (SVD), which was greatly associated with drawbacks of glutaraldehyde crosslinked BHVs, including cytotoxicity, calcification, component degradation, mechanical failure, thrombosis and immune response. To prolong the service life of BHVs, much effort has been devoted to overcoming the drawbacks of BHVs and reducing the risk of SVD. In this review, we summarized and analyzed the research and progress on: (i) modification strategies based on glutaraldehyde crosslinked BHVs and (ii) nonglutaraldehyde crosslinking strategies for BHVs.
