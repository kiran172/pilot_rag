Title: [TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM WITH THE APPLICATION OF MODERN BRONCHOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES IN THE TREATMENT OF A PATIENT WITH INCREASING RESPIRATORY OBSTRUCTION OF UNKNOWN ETHIOLOGY].

Abstract: More and more often, medical workers have to provide assistance to patients with HIV infection with acute disorders of vital functions who require intensive care and resuscitation. The main task of clinicians is to quickly stop the symptoms of secondary diseases that have led to the complications (specific and nonspecific) so that the patient can start or continue antiviral therapy. The aim of this work was to present the first experience of successfully treatment of a patient with progressive HIV infection using stenting of the main bronchi with their critical tumor stenosis in complex treatment. Conducting temporary endoscopic recanalization of the lumen of the large airways made it possible to avoid transferring the patient to artificial ventilation of the lungs, to carry out the necessary complex of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, to restore ventilation and aeration of the lungs, which led to an increase in blood oxygenation and some improvement in the patient's general well-being.
