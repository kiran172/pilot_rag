Title: Self-expandable valve-in-valve treatment for failing sutureless aortic bioprosthesis.

Abstract: Aortic valve replacement still represents the gold standard treatment for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Sutureless bioprostheses have been so far developed to enhance the minimally invasive approach, resulting in a reduction of cross-clamp time. Even if the first implantation was carried out more than 10 years ago, some cases of valve degeneration treated with balloon-expandable valve-in-valve procedures have been previously described in the literature. Here, we present a case of early sutureless valve degeneration resulting in severe aortic regurgitation. After careful evaluation of the patient's comorbidities, a successful valve-in-valve was finally performed using a self-expandable transcatheter prosthesis. A wide discussion of the Heart Team decision-making process and of the technical aspects has been addressed.
