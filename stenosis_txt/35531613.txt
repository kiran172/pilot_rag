Title: Long non-coding RNA RMST serves as a diagnostic biomarker in patients with carotid artery stenosis and predicts the occurrence of cerebral ischemic event: A retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this retrospective study is to explore the diagnostic and prognostic roles of serum RMST in carotid artery stenosis (CAS).
METHODS: Serum levels of RMST were detected in CAS patients, and the relationship between degree of carotid stenosis and RMST levels was analyzed. The ROC curve was drawn to evaluate RMST value in predicting the risk of CAS. Then, all CAS patients received a 5-year follow-up. K-M curve was used to analyze the significance of RMST on prognosis of CAS patients. Multi-factor cox logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate independent factors for outcome of CAS patients.
RESULTS: An increased RMST expression was certified in CAS patients when compared with healthy controls. The increase of serum RMST expression was related to high degree of carotid stenosis. In addition, serum RMST was a possible diagnosis and an independent influencing factor of prognosis in patients with CAS.
CONCLUSIONS: Raised serum RMST level was found in patients with CAS. Detecting RMST expression levels was of high value for predicting the occurrence and outcomes in CAS.
