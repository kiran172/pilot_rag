Title: Timing of Intervention in Symptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is defined as an acute neurologic deficit (transient ischemic attack or stroke) occurring in the last 6 months, that is, ipsilateral to an extracranial carotid artery with at least 50% stenosis. Previous studies have identified the benefit of surgical intervention on symptomatic carotid stenosis, but the ideal timing is less clear. The timing of intervention must balance the risk of perioperative stroke and death (higher during the hyperacute period within 48 hr) and the risk of recurrent stroke while waiting to intervene, particularly if delayed beyond 14 days. Several factors such as acuity of neurologic deficit, degree of stenosis, or contralateral occlusion, and other comorbidities, may contribute to the risk of perioperative stroke or death when intervening within the acute period. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends carotid endarterectomy as the intervention for symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, but recent studies have shown that transcarotid revascularization may also have similar outcomes.
