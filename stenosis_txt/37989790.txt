Title: [Diagnosis and treatment of Dunbar syndrome].

Abstract: The rare Dunbar syndrome or medial arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is defined as compression of the celiac trunk and/or ganglion by the medial arcuate ligament. It is often diagnosed after patients have suffered for a long time and is characterized by intermittent food-related pain, nausea, and unexplained weight loss. After exclusion of other causes of the above symptoms by gastroscopy, colonoscopy, CT, or MRI, the gold standard for diagnosis is dynamic color-coded duplex sonography, which may be supplemented by CT or MR angiography. The treatment of choice is a laparoscopic division of the arcuate ligament at the celiac trunk, although percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stent implantation may be performed in cases of postoperative persistence of symptoms or recurrent stenosis. Since symptoms persist postoperatively in up to 50% of cases, strict indication and complete diagnosis in designated centers are of great importance for successful treatment.
