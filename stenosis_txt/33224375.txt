Title: Associations Between High Levels of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and the Presence and Severity of Coronary Artery Disease in Patients Who Have Undergone Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although a recent study in a Japanese cohort indicated that extremely high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, ≥ 90 mg/dL) had an adverse effect on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease mortality, we could not conclude that high levels of HDL-C were associated with the presence or severity of coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: We enrolled 1,016 patients who were clinically suspected to have CAD and who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). The number of significantly stenosed coronary vessels (vessel disease (VD), ≥ 50% coronary stenosis is diagnosed as CAD) and the Gensini score were quantified using CCTA, and the lipid profile was measured. The patients were divided into four groups according to the HDL-C level: < 40 mg/dL (n = 115, low), 40 - 59 mg/dL (n = 530, normal), 60 - 89 mg/dL (n = 335, high) and ≥ 90 mg/dL (n = 36, very-high).
RESULTS: The percentage (%) of CAD in the low, normal, high and very-high groups was 69%, 55%, 42% and 25%, respectively (P for trend < 0.01). The Gensini score in the low, normal, high and very-high groups was 20 ± 25, 12 ± 16, 8 ± 12 and 4 ± 6, respectively (P for trend < 0.01). The very-high group showed the lowest triglyceride (TG) levels among the four groups. There were no significant differences in the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or % use of statin among the four groups. Finally, the presence of CAD was independently associated with a low level of HDL-C, in addition to age, male, high systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c, but not TG, by a multivariate logistic regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: High levels of HDL-C at the time of CCTA for screening were associated with a reduced presence and severity of CAD.
