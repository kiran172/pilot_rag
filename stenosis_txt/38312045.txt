Title: Radiation-induced coronary artery disease during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: a case report.

Abstract: Radiation-induced coronary artery disease (RICAD) poses a serious concern for cancer patients post radiotherapy, typically emerging after over a decade. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), known for cardiotoxicity, are increasingly recognized for causing cardiovascular complications. Here we report the case of a 63-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer who developed coronary artery disease during his third-line therapy with an ICI (nivolumab) and an antiangiogenic agent (bevacizumab), 3 years post chest radiotherapy. Angiography revealed relatively isolated stenosis in the left main coronary artery ostium, consistent with the radiotherapy site, with no other risk factors, suggesting RICAD. The potential for ICIs to accelerate RICAD development should be considered and necessitates careful surveillance in patients receiving both radiotherapy and ICIs.
