Title: Mitro-aortic fibrosa pseudoaneurysm and concomitant aortic stenosis: How to kill two birds with a stone.

Abstract: Pseudoaneurysm of mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa (P-MAIVF) is a rare acquired malformation of the mitral-aortic intervalvular area. It appears as a pulsatile cavity in the mitral-aortic junction communicating with the left ventricular outflow tract. P-MAIVF has been reported as a complication of aortic and mitral valve surgery, infective endocarditis, and thoracic trauma. It is associated with life-threatening complications. The recommended treatment is surgery, however, conservative therapy is an alternative approach for high-risk patients or when surgical treatment is refused. We describe a successfully exclusion of a P-MAIVF by transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a patient with concomitant severe aortic stenosis.
