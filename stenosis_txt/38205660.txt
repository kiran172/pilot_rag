Title: Robot-Assisted Ureteroplasty with Labial Mucosal Onlay Grafting for Long Left-Sided Proximal Ureteral Stenosis in Children and Adolescents: Technical Tips and Functional Outcomes.

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate functional outcomes of robot-assisted ureteroplasty with labial mucosa grafting for long proximal ureteral stenosis (LPUS) in children and adolescents. Methods: Included in this study were 15 patients who underwent robot-assisted ureteroplasty with labial mucosal grafting in our center between July 2017 and September 2021. The left affected stenotic ureter was repaired using labial mucosal grafting. If the ureter was simply strictured but not obliterated, the ureter was spatulated longitudinally along the ventral side and the labial mucosa graft was interposed and anastomosed in a continuous manner. Faced with the obliterated segment, it was excised and the spatulated portion re-anastomosed with a pelvic flap as the dorsal wall. The labial mucosa graft was placed as the ventral wall. The preoperative clinical data and follow-up outcomes were collected and evaluated. Results: Labial mucosa graft onlay ureteroplasty was well performed in all the 15 patients with no occurrence of intraoperative complications or surgical conversion. Five patients underwent an onlay ureteroplasty, and 10 patients underwent a dorsally augmented pelvic flap anastomotic ureteroplasty. The mean (range) stricture length was 7.1 (3-10) cm. The mean operative time was 371.2 (216-480) minutes, and the median blood loss was 40â€‰mL. At the median follow-up of 35 months (range 12-58 months), the overall success rate was 93.3%. Conclusions: Labial mucosa grafting appears to be safe and feasible for repairing long ureteral strictures in pediatric and adolescent patients. Our experience may provide beneficial references and conveniences to solve complex problems in LPUS. This study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant (ethics number: 2017-30).
