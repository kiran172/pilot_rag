Title: Successful Off-Label Use of Rotational Atherectomy in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: A Case Report.

Abstract: Rotational atherectomy (RA) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is uncommon and its use in a thrombotic lesion is labelled a contraindication by its manufacturer due to the concern for further increase in platelet activation and aggregation by the spinning burr or distal embolization of the thrombotic material promoting no-reflow (NR). However, thrombus burden varies significantly in the STEMI setting and can be classified according to the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) thrombus grade (TG). This case demonstrates the successful off-label use of RA-assisted primary percutaneous coronary intervention to facilitate treatment of a heavily calcified ostial right coronary artery lesion with low thrombotic burden (TIMI TG 0) in an octogenarian STEMI patient. Atherectomy drug cocktails, intracoronary vasodilators, short burr runs and avoidance of rotating the burr at slower than minimum approved rotational speed contribute to atherectomy success and decrease the chances of NR.
