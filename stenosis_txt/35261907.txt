Title: A rare case of permanent pacemaker-induced takotsubo cardiomyopathy in a male patient.

Abstract: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy that usually appears after a stressful event or in a woman and is rarely seen after pacemaker implantation (PMI). Herein, we present the case of a 65-year-old man with PMI because of a 2:1 atrioventricular nodal block who had a syncopal episode later in the day of the procedure. Echocardiography showed septal and apical hypokinesis with reduced ejection fraction suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Before PMI, echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with no wall-motion abnormality. Coronary angiography showed no coronary artery stenosis. The patient was seen again in the clinic 1 month later, and repeat echocardiography showed improvement of ejection fraction to 55% with no wall-motion abnormality. Generally, the complication rate after PMI is very low and includes infection, hematoma, lead dislocation, or allergic reaction at the site. The clinicians must be aware of potentially rare complications that can occur after PMI, such as takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
