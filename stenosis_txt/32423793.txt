Title: First-in-Man Lithoplasty of a LIMA Bypass With ECMO Support in a Last-Remaining Vessel.

Abstract: We report the case of a 70-year-old patient with history of chronic heart disease who underwent bypass surgery twice beforehand and was admitted due to non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Angiography showed degeneration of all bypass grafts except the LIMA bypass, which showed significant ostial stenosis with severe calcification. Peri-operative risk was computed to be as high as 12.3% (STS Score). An interventional strategy was chosen: the very high-risk procedure was performed safely under the protection afforded by venoarterial ECMO and cardiac surgeons on standby using a coronary intravascular lithoplasty (IVL) balloon. After implantation of a drug eluting stent, the primary angiogram showed a satisfactory result. The patient was discharged without further complications short after the procedure and is closely followed-up.
