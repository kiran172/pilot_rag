Title: Presurgical Magnetic Resonance Imaging Indicators of Revascularization Response in Adults With Moyamoya Vasculopathy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Moyamoya is a progressive intracranial vasculopathy, primarily affecting distal segments of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries. Treatment may comprise angiogenesis-inducing surgical revascularization; however, lack of randomized trials often results in subjective treatment decisions.
HYPOTHESIS: Compensatory presurgical posterior vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) flow-territory reactivity, including greater cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and reduced vascular delay time, portends greater neoangiogenic response verified on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) at 1-year follow-up.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective intervention cohort.
SUBJECTS: Thirty-one patients with moyamoya (26 females; age = 45 ± 13 years; 41 revascularized hemispheres).
METHODS: Anatomical MRI, hypercapnic CVR MRI, and DSA acquired presurgically in adult moyamoya participants scheduled for clinically indicated surgical revascularization. One-year postsurgery, DSA was repeated to evaluate collateralization.
FIELD STRENGTH: 3 T.
SEQUENCE: Hypercapnic T 2 *  -weighted gradient-echo blood-oxygenation-level-dependent, T<sub>2</sub> -weighted turbo-spin-echo fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery, T<sub>1</sub> -weighted magnetization-prepared-rapid-gradient-echo, and T<sub>2</sub> -weighted diffusion-weighted-imaging.
ASSESSMENT: Presurgical maximum CVR and response times were evaluated in VBA flow-territories. Revascularization success was determined using an ordinal scoring system of neoangiogenic collateralization from postsurgical DSA by two cerebrovascular neurosurgeons (R.V.C. with 8 years of experience; M.R.F. with 9 years of experience) and one neuroradiologist (L.T.D. with 8 years of experience). Stroke risk factors (age, sex, race, vasculopathy, and diabetes) were recorded.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied to compare presurgical variables between cohorts with angiographically confirmed good (>1/3 middle cerebral artery [MCA] territory revascularized) vs. poor (<1/3 MCA territory revascularized) outcomes.
SIGNIFICANCE: two-sided P < 0.05. Normalized odds ratios (ORs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Criteria for good collateralization were met in 25 of the 41 revascularized hemispheres. Presurgical normalized VBA flow-territory CVR was significantly higher in those with good (1.12 ± 0.13 unitless) vs. poor (1.04 ± 0.05 unitless) outcomes. Younger (OR = -0.60 ± 0.67) and White (OR = -1.81 ± 1.40) participants had highest revascularization success (good outcomes: age = 42 ± 14 years, race = 84% White; poor outcomes: age = 49 ± 11 years, race = 44% White).
DATA CONCLUSION: Presurgical MRI-measures of VBA flow-territory CVR are highest in moyamoya participants with better angiographic responses to surgical revascularization.
