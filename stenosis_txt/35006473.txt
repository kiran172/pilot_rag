Title: Prognostic implications of impaired longitudinal left ventricular systolic function assessed by tissue Doppler imaging prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation for severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Change in longitudinal left ventricular (LV) systolic function serves as an early marker of the deleterious effect of aortic stenosis (AS) and other cardiac comorbidities on cardiac function. We explored the prognostic value of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI)-derived longitudinal LV systolic function, defined by the peak systolic average of lateral and septal mitral annular velocities (average S') among symptomatic patients with severe AS undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). 297 consecutive patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI at three european centers with available average S' at preprocedural echocardiography were retrospectively included. The primary endpoint was the Kaplan Meier estimate of all-cause mortality. After a median 18 months (IQR 12-18) follow-up, 36 (12.1%) patients had died. Average S' was associated with all-cause mortality (per 1 cm/sec decrease: HR 1.29, 95%CI 1.03-1.60, p = 0.025), the cut-off of 6.5 cm/sec being the most accurate. Patients with average S' < 6.5 cm/sec (55.2%) presented characteristics of more advanced LV remodeling and functional impairment along with higher burden of cardiac comorbidities, and experienced higher all-cause mortality (17.6% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.007), also when adjusted for in-study outcome predictors (adj-HR: 2.69, 95%CI 1.22-5.93, p = 0.014). Results were consistent among patients with preserved ejection fraction, normal-flow AS, high-gradient AS and in those without LV hypertrophy. Longitudinal LV systolic function assessed by average S' is independently associated with long-term all-cause mortality among TAVI patients. An average S' below 6.5 cm/sec best defines clinically meaningful reduced longitudinal systolic function and may aid clinical risk stratification in these patients.
