Title: DEL-1 suppression attenuates atherosclerosis by modulating macrophagic GSK-3β/CEBP-β signaling pathway.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the effect of developmental endothelial locus-1(DEL-1) expression in atherosclerotic plaque formation and its mechanism.
METHODS: Human left coronary arteries were collected to detect the DEL-1 expression. The ApoE-/- mice were used to establish the atherosclerosis mice model. The left coronary artery and mouse aorta were stained with HE, Oil Red O, and Movat staining. The DEL-1 levels, chemokines CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1α), pathway protein glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), CCAAT enhanced binding protein β (C/EBPβ), and downstream inflammatory factors (C-X-C motif chemokine 2 (MIP-2or CXCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1α or CCL3),Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) were detected by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between DEL-1 gene expression and inflammatory factors in the lesion group and the correlation between DEL-1 gene expression and structure-related indexes.
RESULTS: Compared with Control group(CON), the intravascular plaque area was widened, accompanied by narrowed lumens. The number of plaque foam cells was significantly increased in the high fat and high cholesterol (AS group) or AAV9-eGFP group (P < 0.05). Compared to CON, the enhanced fluorescence intensity of DEL-1 with CD68 in the AS or AAV9-eGFP groups. Diminished fluorescence of DEL-1 with CD68 expression in AAV9-CXCR4 group compared to AS group or AAV9-eGFP group. The DEL-1 and its downstream proteins in AS group or AAV9-eGFP group were mainly accumulated in the macrophage cytoplasm. The DEL-1 expression level was significantly and positively correlated with plaque area, lumen stenosis, plaque foam cell count, TNFα, CXCL2, and CCL3 levels.
CONCLUSION: DEL-1 inhibition decreases macrophagic inflammatory factors involved in atherosclerotic plaque formation.
