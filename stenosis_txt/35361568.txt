Title: Durability of Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Bioprostheses: A Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Over the last two decades there has been a significant shift towards the use of bioprostheses in the context of surgical aortic valve replacement, despite the well-known process of structural valve deterioration (SVD). This process has been extensively evaluated even though with many different definitions and methods, thus, the true long-term durability of surgical bioprostheses is not yet fully elucidated. Following the increasing implementation of the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) technology, a better understanding of the long-term durability of transcatheter bioprostheses has become increasingly important as well, despite the limited availability of such data compared to the surgical experience. This lack of knowledge is a major barrier to the use of TAVI platforms to treat relatively younger patients. We thus aimed at providing an overview on long-term actual data concerning the durability of bioprostheses focusing on definition, incidence, and subsequent management of SVD of both surgical and transcatheter bioprosthetic aortic valves.
