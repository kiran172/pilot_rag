Title: TRIACCESS Study: Randomized Comparison Between Radial, Femoral, and Pedal Access for Percutaneous Femoro-popliteal Artery Angioplasty.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this randomized study was to compare the success and complication rates of different access sites for the treatment of superficial artery stenosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 180 consecutive patients were randomized in a prospective study to treat symptomatic superficial femoral artery stenosis via radial (RA), femoral (FA), or pedal artery (PA) access. Technical success was achieved in 96.7%, 100%, and 100% of the patients in the RA, FA, and PA groups, respectively (p=0.33). Secondary access sites were used in 30%, 3.3%, and 30% of the patients in the RA, FA, and PA access groups, respectively (p=0.0002). Recanalization for chronic total occlusion was performed in 34/36 (94.4%), 30/30 (100%), and 46/46 (100%) patients in the RA, FA, and PA groups, respectively (p=0.17). The X-ray dose was significantly lower in the PA group than that in the RA and FA access groups (63.1 vs 162 vs 153 Dyn, p=0.0004). The cumulative rates of access site complications in the RA, FA, and PA groups were 3.3% (0% major and 3.3% minor), 16.7% (3.3% major and 13.3% minor), and 3.3% (3.3% major and 0% minor) (p=0.0085), respectively. The cumulative incidence of MACEs at 6 months in the RA, FA, and PA groups was 5%, 6.7%, and 1.7%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of MALEs at 6 months in the RA, FA, and PA groups was 20%, 16.7%, and 9.2%, respectively (p=0.54).
CONCLUSION: Femoral artery intervention can be safely and effectively performed using radial, femoral, and pedal access, but radial and pedal access is associated with a lower access site complication rate and hospitalization. Pedal access is associated with a lower X-ray dose than that with radial and femoral access.
