Title: Catheter-induced Vasospasm of the Anatomically Normal Right Coronary Artery in a Patient With Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction and Obstructive Disease in the Left Anterior Descending Artery; A Challenging Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: This case report illustrates the clinical course and management strategy of severe catheter-induced vasospasm of the right coronary artery (RCA) resulting in brief cardiac arrest in a male patient in his 60s presenting with Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and obstructive disease in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient was successfully resuscitated and further stay was uneventful. Optical coherence tomography imaging following administration of intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate confirmed normal coronary anatomy and flow restoration in the RCA, suggesting that the index episode was probably a vasospasm of the RCA. After establishing coronary flow in the RCA, the stenosis in the LAD was treated with a drug-eluting stent. Invasive cardiologists should be aware of the catheter-induced coronary artery spasm, which may have important clinical implications particularly in the presence of concomitant atherosclerotic disease in other coronary arteries (in our case the LAD). This approach helps to avoid unnecessary coronary stenting.
