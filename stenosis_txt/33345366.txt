Title: Asymptomatic giant circumflex aneurysm in patient with a cisplatin treatment history.

Abstract: We report a case of 62-years-old man with a previous history of squamocellular tumour at the jaw treated with cisplatin chemotherapy. Six years after the chemotherapy, a transthoracic echocardiography showed a large left atrial lateral wall mass causing mitral stenosis. The thoracic computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan confirmed the mass (66x88mm) with contrast enhancement and the coronary angiography defined it as a giant left circumflex aneurysm. The aneurysm was resected and bypass graft performed. The aetiology and the technique used to treat this aneurysm are worthy to be described.
