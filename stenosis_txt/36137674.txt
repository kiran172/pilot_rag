Title: Determinants of Drug-Coated Balloon Failure in Patients Undergoing Femoropopliteal Arterial Intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons (DCB) are frequently used to treat femoropopliteal artery disease. However, patency loss occurs in ≥10% of patients within 12 months posttreatment with poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to investigate the determinants of DCB failure in femoropopliteal disease.
METHODS: Data from randomized clinical trials (IN.PACT SFA, MDT-2113 SFA Japan) and 2 prespecified imaging cohorts of the IN.PACT Global Clinical Study were included. Influential procedural characteristics were evaluated by an independent angiographic core laboratory. The primary endpoint was DCB failure (patency loss during follow-up). Additional endpoints were binary restenosis and clinically driven target lesion revascularization. Multivariable analyses evaluated the clinical, anatomical, and procedural predictors of DCB failure.
RESULTS: Included were 557 participants with single lesions and 12-month core laboratory-adjudicated duplex ultrasonography. Key clinical characteristics were as follows: mean age 68.8 years, 67.5% male, 87.6% with hypertension, 76.9% with hyperlipidemia, 40.5% with diabetes mellitus, 90.5% in Rutherford Classification Category (RCC) 2 to 3, and 9.5% in RCC 4 to 5. Average length and reference vessel diameter (RVD) were 16.37 cm and 4.66 mm, respectively; 49.7% of lesions were totally occluded. In multivariable analysis, only residual stenosis >30% was associated with patency loss, whereas residual stenosis >30% and smaller preprocedure RVD were associated with increased binary restenosis risk. RCC >3 and residual stenosis >30% were associated with increased 12-month clinically driven target lesion revascularization risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Patency loss after DCB treatment was influenced by procedural and clinical factors. Residual stenosis >30%, smaller preprocedure RVD, and higher RCC may be considered predictors of increased risk of DCB failure and its components in femoropopliteal artery disease.
