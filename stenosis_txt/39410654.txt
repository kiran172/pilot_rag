Title: Impact of a New Preoperative Stratification Based on Cardiac Structural Compromise in Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Valve Replacement Surgery.

Abstract: Introduction and objectives: Aortic valve replacement surgery (SAVR) remains a recommended indication, though its pre-surgical stratification is an ongoing challenge. Despite the widespread use of scores like the STS and EuroSCORE II, they have a number of limitations, while often neglecting structural parameters like left ventricular hypertrophy or left atrium volume. This study aimed to evaluate whether a new adaptation of the Généreux classification in the preoperative risk stratification of severe aortic stenosis (AS) is associated with the primary outcome, and to compare it with the original classification versus the traditional scores in short- and long-term follow-up. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study involving patients with confirmed severe AS who underwent SAVR. The new stratification categorized patients into three stages. Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with mortality, with survival analysis performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 508 patients were included. Stage 3 patients had a lower median age (67 years). The median EuroSCORE II and STS scores were 2.75 and 2.62%, respectively (p ≤ 0.001). Over a median follow-up of 81 months, 56 deaths occurred (11%). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed significant differences in all-cause mortality among the three groups (HR 4.073, log-rank p ≤ 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified the three preoperative stages (HR 3.22, [95% CI 1.44-7.20], p = 0.004) and mean transaortic gradient (HR 0.96, [95% CI 0.92-0.99], p = 0.021) as independent variables of mortality. The original Généreux scale AUC was higher (AUC: 0.760, 95% CI: 0.692-0.829) compared to the modified Généreux scale (AUC: 0.758, 95% CI: 0.687-0.829). However, no statistical differences were found between the different scales. Conclusions: Preoperative three-stage classification and low transaortic gradient are factors associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients undergoing SAVR. The proposed staging system performed better in the mortality analysis than EuroSCORE II and STS and was similar to the original classification.
