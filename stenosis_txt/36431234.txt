Title: A New Removable Helical Metallic Stent for the Treatment of Tracheomalacia in Children: Study in Pathological Animal Model.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Congenital tracheomalacia is a pathology with no consensus of medical or surgical approach. The permanent nature and the major complications associated with metallic stents have limited their use over the years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a helical stent design removal.
METHODS: Ten dogs diagnosed with tracheal collapse and treated with the helical stent were involved in the study. Animals were classified into three groups depending on stent indwelling time. Prior to the removal, endoscopic evaluation was performed to assess endothelization grade, mucous accumulation, and the presence of stenosis. During the removal, bleeding, fracture, or impossibility of removal were noted. After the removal, all macroscopic mucosal changes were recorded.
RESULTS: Technical success was 100%, without any complications. Complete epithelization of the stent was visualized in 7/10 animals. The removal procedure duration ranged from 2-12 min. At post-removal endoscopy, bleeding or epithelial damage, was visualized in any case. Stent fracture during removal occurred in one animal.
CONCLUSIONS: The removal of a metallic stent with spiral geometry is feasible, simple, and without complications, regardless of the degree of neo-epithelialization.
