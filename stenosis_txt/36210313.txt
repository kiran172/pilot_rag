Title: Gastroduodenal artery disconnection during liver transplantation decreases non-anastomotic stricture incidence.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The hepatic artery is the only blood source nourishing the biliary duct and associated with biliary complication after liver transplantation (LT). Gastroduodenal artery (GDA) disconnection increased proper hepatic artery flow. Whether this procedure attenuates biliary non-anastomotic stricture (NAS) is not clear.
METHODS: A total of 241 patients with LT were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into the GDA disconnection (GDA-) and GDA preservation (GDA+) groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was administrated to reduce bias. Logistic regression was conducted to analyze risk factors for biliary NAS before and after PSM. Postoperative complications were compared. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests were performed to compare overall survival.
RESULTS: In all, 99 patients (41.1%) underwent GDA disconnection, and 49 (20.3%) developed NAS. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that GDA preservation (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.11-4.53; P = 0.025) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score > 15 (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.12-4.11; P = 0.022) were risk factors for biliary NAS. PSM provided 66 pairs using 1:2 matching method, including 66 GDA disconnection and 99 GDA preservation patients. Multivariate logistic regression after PSM also showed that GDA preservation (OR = 3.15, 95% CI: 1.26-7.89; P = 0.014) and MELD score > 15 (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.08-5.36; P = 0.031) were risk factors for NAS. When comparing complications between the two groups, GDA preservation was associated with a higher incidence of biliary NAS before and after PSM (P = 0.031 and 0.017, respectively). In contrast, other complications including early allograft dysfunction (P = 0.620), small-for-size graft syndrome (P = 0.441), abdominal hemorrhage (P = 1.000), major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ 3, P = 0.318), and overall survival (P = 0.088) were not significantly different between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: GDA disconnection during LT ameliorates biliary NAS incidence and may be recommended for application in clinical practice.
