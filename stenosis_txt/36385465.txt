Title: Bail out lithotripsy to treat delayed valve-in-valve TAVR-related coronary obstruction.

Abstract: Coronary access difficulty and stent compression by the juxtaposed aortic valve leaflet hamper percutaneous management of delayed coronary artery obstruction (CAO) after valve-in-valve (Edwards Sapien 3 in St. Jude Trifecta) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).Â Here, we present a case of delayed post-TAVR CAO treated with intravascular lithotripsy and multistenting to overcome stent compression by the adjacent calcified leaflet.
