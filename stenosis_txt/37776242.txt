Title: Sialendoscopy Findings Associated with Positive Minor Salivary Gland Biopsy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine the sialendoscopy findings associated with positive findings on minor salivary gland biopsy.
STUDY DESIGN: Single-center retrospective study.
METHODS: Patients ≥18 years old who underwent sialendoscopy from 2016 to 2022 and were evaluated for SS via labial minor salivary gland biopsy. Biopsy positive and negative patients were compared on the primary outcome measure of sialendoscopy findings. Data were abstracted from the sialendoscopy operative notes and included involved gland, location of ductal pathology, and the presence of scarring, stenosis, mucus plugs, webs, and dilations. Additional characteristics included demographics, presenting symptoms, caffeine or tobacco, use of drying medications, and need for additional treatments.
RESULTS: The final cohorts included 22 biopsy positive and 21 biopsy negative patients with a total of 42 glands in the biopsy positive and 37 glands in the biopsy negative groups. Biopsy positive patients were found to require dilation at the hilum and distal duct at significantly higher rates than biopsy negative patients (p < 0.0001). However, there was no statistical difference in scarring, stenosis severity, mucus, webs, or dilations between each group.
CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study suggest that there are no distinct sialendoscopy findings associated with biopsy positive patients. The presence of significant distal stenosis on sialendoscopy may be associated with positive minor salivary biopsy. Other endoscopic parameters are likely more consistent with non-specific chronic sialadenitis.
