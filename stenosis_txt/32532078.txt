Title: Time Course in Ocular Blood Flow and Pulse Waveform in a Case of Ocular Ischemic Syndrome with Intraocular Pressure Fluctuation.

Abstract: We report on a 70-year-old Japanese man with complaints of worsening left visual acuity who was diagnosed with ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) associated with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. A gonioscopy examination showed rubeosis iridis and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the left eye (50 mmHg) at the baseline visit. The optic nerve head (ONH) and choroidal blood flow measured by laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) was impaired in the left eye compared with that in the right eye. Additionally, the blowout score (BOS), which indicates the variation of the mean blur rate (MBR) during systolic and diastolic periods, was decreased in the left eye. After treatment with an injection of bevacizumab and administration of Rho-associated kinase-inhibitor ripasudil eye drops, both ocular blood flow and BOS in each vascular bed gradually increased along with IOP reduction. The visual acuity also improved. The current case demonstrated increased blood flow and decreased fluctuation of blood flow in the ONH and choroid before and after the treatment in OIS with rubeosis iridis. The LSFG technique is useful to non-invasively assess the ocular circulation and pulse waveform in OIS.
