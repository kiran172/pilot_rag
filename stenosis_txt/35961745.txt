Title: Tracheobronchial Surgery in Emerging Countries.

Abstract: Tracheobronchial surgery is widely performed in emerging countries mainly as a consequence of the high number of airway-related complications and poor management in intensive care units. This has led to great expertise in the surgical management of postintubation tracheal stenosis, and opportunity for advancing scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, tracheal stenosis has a severe impact on a patient's quality of life, is a major burden to the health system, and should be prevented. Incorporation of innovative techniques, technologies, and prospective databases should prompt earlier diagnosis and lead to fewer complications.
