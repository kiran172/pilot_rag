Title: Proteoglycan 4 is Increased in Human Calcified Aortic Valves and Enhances Valvular Interstitial Cell Calcification.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a consequence of increased fibrosis and calcification of the aortic valve leaflets, causes progressive narrowing of the aortic valve. Proteoglycans, structural components of the aortic valve, accumulate in regions with fibrosis and moderate calcification. Particularly, proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) has been identified in fibrotic parts of aortic valves. However, the role of PRG4 in the context of AVS and aortic valve calcification has not yet been determined. Here, transcriptomics, histology, and immunohistochemistry were performed in human aortic valves from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. Human valve interstitial cells (VICs) were used for calcification experiments and RNA expression analysis. PRG4 was significantly upregulated in thickened and calcified regions of aortic valves compared with healthy regions. In addition, mRNA levels of PRG4 positively associated with mRNA for proteins involved in cardiovascular calcification. Treatment of VICs with recombinant human PRG4 enhanced phosphate-induced calcification and increased the mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 and the runt-related transcription factor 2. In summary, PRG4 was upregulated in the development of AVS and promoted VIC osteogenic differentiation and calcification. These results suggest that an altered valve leaflet proteoglycan composition may play a role in the progression of AVS.
