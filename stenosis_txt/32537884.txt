Title: Multi-institutional retrospective analysis of adverse events following rigid tracheobronchoscopy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rigid tracheobronchoscopy (RTB) has seen an increasing interest over the last decades with the development of the field of IPM but no benchmark exists for complication rates in RTB. We aimed to establish benchmarks for complication rates in RTB.
METHODS: A multicentric retrospective analysis of RTB performed between 2009 and 2015 in eight participating centres was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 1546 RTB were performed over the study period. One hundred and thirty-one non-lethal complications occurred in 103 procedures (6.7%, 95% CI: 5.5-8.0%). The periprocedural mortality rate was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.6-1.8%). The 30-day mortality rate was 5.6% (95% CI: 4.5-6.8%). Complication rate increases further when procedures were performed in an emergency setting. Procedures in patients with MAO are associated with a higher 30-day mortality (8.1% vs 2.7%, P < 0.01) and a different complication profile when compared to procedures performed for BAS.
CONCLUSION: RTB is associated with a 6.7% non-lethal complication rate, a 1.2% periprocedural mortality rate and a 5.6% 30-day mortality in a large multicentre cohort of patients with benign and malignant airway disease.
