Title: Outcomes of Functional Testing Versus Invasive Cardiac Catheterization for the Evaluation of Intermediate Severity Coronary Stenosis Detected on Cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of functional testing in comparison to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) among acute chest pain patients whose first diagnostic modality was a coronary computed tomography angiogram (CCTA) and were found to have intermediate coronary stenosis, defined as 50%-70% luminal stenosis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 4763 acute chest pain patients â‰¥18 years old who received a CCTA as the initial diagnostic modality. Of these, 118 patients met enrollment criteria and proceeded to either stress test (80/118) or directly to ICA (38/118). The primary outcome was 30-day major adverse cardiac event, consisting of acute myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization, or death.
RESULTS: There was no difference in 30-day major adverse cardiac event among patients who underwent initial stress testing versus directly referred to ICA (0% vs. 2.6%, P = 0.322) following CCTA. The rate of revascularization without acute myocardial infarction was significantly higher among those who underwent ICA versus stress test [36.8% vs. 3.8%, P < 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio: 9.6, 95% confidence interval, 1.8-49.6]. Patients who underwent ICA had a higher rate of catheterization without revascularization within 30 days of the index admission in comparison to those who underwent initial stress testing (55.3% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio: 26.7, 95% confidence interval, 6.6-109.5).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with intermediate coronary stenosis on CCTA, a functional stress test compared with ICA may prevent unnecessary revascularization and improve cardiac catheterization yield without negatively affecting the 30-day patient safety profile.
