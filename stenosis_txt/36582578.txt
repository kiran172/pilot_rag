Title: Wellens Syndrome: A Possible Precursor.

Abstract: Wellens syndrome is a precursor of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary stenosis. It is characterized by biphasic T waves in V2-V3 (type A) or negative deep T waves in V2-V4 (type B). The ability of emergency physicians, hospitalists, or primary care providers to recognize these early ECG patterns is primordial because the definitive treatment is urgent cardiac catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention. However, failure to identify a type A or type B Wellens syndrome may lead to devastating outcomes, such as myocardial infarction or even death. We presented a clinical case of Wellens' syndrome with deep T waves in V2-V3 associated with COVID pneumonia, pleural effusions, and congestive heart failure that went to a rapid and massive myocardial infarction.
