Title: Analyzing the characteristics of respiratory microbiota after the placement of an airway stent for malignant central airway obstruction.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Malignant central airway stenosis is treated with airway stent placement, but post-placement microbial characteristics remain unclear. We studied microbial features in 60 patients post-stent placement, focusing on changes during granulation tissue proliferation. Samples were collected before stent (N = 29), after stent on day 3 (N = 20), and after granulation tissue formation (AS-GTF, N = 43). Metagenomic sequencing showed significant respiratory tract microbiota changes with granulation tissue. The microbiota composition, dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, was similar among the groups. At the species level, the AS-GTF group exhibited significant differences, with Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Achromobacter xylosoxidans enriched. Analysis based on tracheoesophageal fistula presence identified Tannerella forsythia and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia as the main differential species, enriched in the fistula subgroup. Viral and fungal detection showed Human gammaherpesvirus 4 and Candida albicans as the main species, respectively. These findings highlight microbiota changes after stent placement, potentially associated with granulation tissue proliferation, informing stent placement therapy and anti-infective treatment optimization.
IMPORTANCE: Malignant central airway stenosis is a life-threatening condition that can be effectively treated with airway stent placement. However, despite its clinical importance, the microbial characteristics of the respiratory tract following stent insertion remain poorly understood. This study addresses this gap by investigating the microbial features in patients with malignant central airway stenosis after stent placement, with a specific focus on microbial changes during granulation tissue proliferation. The findings reveal significant alterations in the diversity and structure of the respiratory tract microbiota following the placement of malignant central airway stents. Notably, certain bacterial species, including Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, exhibit distinct patterns in the after-stent granulation tissue formation group. Additionally, the presence of tracheoesophageal fistula further influences the microbial composition. These insights provide valuable references for optimizing stent placement therapy and enhancing clinical anti-infective strategies.
