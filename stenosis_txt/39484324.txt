Title: Pulsus Alternans in Critical Aortic Stenosis: When the Left Ventricle Is Failing.

Abstract: A 58-year-old man presented with worsening dyspnea. Electrocardiogram showed variation in T-wave amplitude occurring every other beat. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a severe aortic stenosis with beat-to-beat variation in stroke volume, suggestive of pulsus alternans. Recognition of pulsus alternans is important because it is considered a marker of poor prognosis.
