Title: Ranger™ paclitaxel-coated balloon versus conventional balloon angioplasty for treatment of failing arteriovenous fistulas and grafts in haemodialysis patients: A retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aim was to compare the safety and patency efficacy outcomes between Ranger™ paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB)- versus conventional balloon angioplasty (POBA) in the treatment of haemodialysis access-related conduit stenosis.
METHODS: Retrospective single-centre, multi-investigator, consecutive, double-arm comparative cohort study. About 130 end-stage renal failure Asian patients with dysfunctional arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft underwent PCB or POBA fistuloplasty between November 2018 and June 2020. All stenotic lesions were prepared with high pressure non-compliant balloon angioplasty prior to PCB angioplasty. All patients received at least one antiplatelet agent for 3 months duration post procedure.
RESULTS: Mean age was 66.0 ± 10 years and 79/130 (61%) were males. PCB arm (n = 65) versus POBA arm (n = 65). Majority were AVFs circuits (122/130, 94%). Main indication for intervention was dropping access flow (98/130, 76%). About 172 lesions were treated (56% POBA, 44% PCB), and the juxta-anastomosis (JAS) was the main target lesion (87/172, 51%). There were no significant differences in safety outcomes (30-day adverse events, access thrombosis, abandoned AVF and death) between treatment groups. Mean time to target lesion reintervention (TLR) was longer in PCB-treated lesions (7.1 ± 2.7 vs 5.8 ± 3.2 months, p = 0.03), especially amongst recurrent lesions (7.3 ± 2.4 vs 5.7 ± 3.2, p = 0.02). Mean time to circuit reintervention was also longer in PCB-treated circuits (6.9 ± 2.8 vs 5.8 ± 3.7months, p = 0.04). There were 16 deaths (12%), all attributed to patient's underlying comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Fistuloplasty with Ranger™ PCB for failing arteriovenous circuits in end-stage renal failure patients, is a safe and efficacious modality compared to POBA in terms of longer freedom from TLR.
