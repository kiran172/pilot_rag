Title: Segmentation of X-ray coronary angiography with an artificial intelligence deep learning model: Impact in operator visual assessment of coronary stenosis severity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Visual assessment of the percentage diameter stenosis (%DS<sub>VE</sub> ) of lesions is essential in coronary angiography (CAG) interpretation. We have previously developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of accurate CAG segmentation. We aim to compare operators' %DS<sub>VE</sub> in angiography versus AI-segmented images.
METHODS: Quantitative coronary analysis (QCA) %DS (%DS<sub>QCA</sub> ) was previously performed in our published validation dataset. Operators were asked to estimate %DS<sub>VE</sub> of lesions in angiography versus AI-segmented images in separate sessions and differences were assessed using angiography %DS<sub>QCA</sub> as reference.
RESULTS: A total of 123 lesions were included. %DS<sub>VE</sub> was significantly higher in both the angiography (77% ± 20% vs. 56% ± 13%, p &lt; 0.001) and segmentation groups (59% ± 20% vs. 56% ± 13%, p &lt; 0.001), with a much smaller absolute %DS difference in the latter. For lesions with %DS<sub>QCA</sub> of 50%-70% (60% ± 5%), an even higher discrepancy was found (angiography: 83% ± 13% vs. 60% ± 5%, p &lt; 0.001; segmentation: 63% ± 15% vs. 60% ± 5%, p &lt; 0.001). Similar, less pronounced, findings were observed for %DS<sub>QCA</sub>  &lt; 50% lesions, but not %DS<sub>QCA</sub>  &gt; 70% lesions. Agreement between %DS<sub>QCA</sub> /%DS<sub>VE</sub> across %DS<sub>QCA</sub> strata (&lt;50%, 50%-70%, &gt;70%) was approximately twice in the segmentation group (60.4% vs. 30.1%; p &lt; 0.001). %DS<sub>VE</sub> inter-operator differences were smaller with segmentation.
CONCLUSION: %DS<sub>VE</sub> was much less discrepant with segmentation versus angiography. Overestimation of %DS<sub>QCA</sub>  &lt; 70% lesions with angiography was especially common. Segmentation may reduce %DS<sub>VE</sub> overestimation and thus unwarranted revascularization.
