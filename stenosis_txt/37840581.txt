Title: Partial mixed neuropathy of the fourth lumbar spinal nerve misdiagnosed as "shin splints.".

Abstract: A case of anteromedial leg pain diagnosed and treated for 10 years as "shin splints" (medial tibial stress syndrome) is described. A history and examination was performed focused on anatomy, biomechanics, and peripheral nerves. Detailed sensory testing was performed in the painful area, and imaging was obtained to confirm the diagnosis. The clinical investigation was consistent with dynamic stenosis of the left L4-5 intervertebral foramen, causing a mixed partial mononeuropathy of the L4 spinal nerve that presented as pain and hypersensitivity in the anteromedial shin. Manual therapy maneuvers intended to open the intervertebral foramen led to resolution of the pain and sensory deficits. After three additional treatments performed within a month, resolution was maintained for >3 years. This case highlights how concepts from preclinical studies, coupled with basic anatomical, neurological, and biomechanical investigations, can be critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment for a case previously considered unresponsive to care.
