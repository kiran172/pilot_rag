Title: De novo formation of twig-like middle cerebral artery: An illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Twig-like middle cerebral artery (T-MCA) is a rare vascular abnormality characterized by the replacement of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) with a plexiform arterial network of small vessels. T-MCA is generally regarded as an embryological persistence. Conversely, T-MCA may also be a secondary sequela but no reports of cases of de novo formation exist. Here, we report the first case describing possible de novo T-MCA formation.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old woman was referred to our hospital from a nearby clinic because of transient left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed mild stenosis of the bilateral MCAs. The patient then underwent MR imaging follow-ups once a year. MR imaging at the age of 53 showed a right M1 occlusion. Cerebral angiography revealed a right M1 occlusion and formation of a plexiform network consistent with the occlusion site, leading to the diagnosis of de novo T-MCA.
CONCLUSION: This is the first case report describing possible de novo T-MCA formation. Although a detailed laboratory examination did not confirm the etiology, autoimmune disease was suspected to have precipitated this vascular lesion.
