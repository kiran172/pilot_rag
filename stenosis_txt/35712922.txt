Title: [Clinical study on real-time three-dimensional CT navigation-guided full-endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the technical notes, effectiveness, and current issues of real-time three-dimensional CT navigation-guided full-endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion.
METHODS: Between April 2020 and October 2021, a total of 27 patients received real-time three-dimensional CT navigation-guided full-endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion. There were 18 males and 9 females with an average age of 63.2 years (range, 48-84 years). There were 6 cases of lumbar spinal stenosis, 1 case of lumbar instability, 9 cases of lumbar spinal stenosis with instability, 3 cases of degenerative spondylolisthesis, 6 cases of isthmus spondylolisthesis, and 2 cases of recurrent lumbar disc herniation. All patients showed neurological symptoms before operation (ipsilateral symptom for 15 cases and bilateral symptom for 12 cases). The symptom duration was 1-300 months (median, 24 months). The operations were performed via transforaminal approach in 8 cases, trans-facet joint approach in 18 cases, and combined approaches in 1 case. A total of 32 levels were fused, including 23 single-level cases, 3 two-level cases, and 1 three-level case. Lumbar fusion segment was L <sub>2, 3</sub> in 1 case, L <sub>3, 4</sub> in 4 cases, L <sub>4, 5</sub> in 20 cases, and L <sub>5</sub>, S <sub>1</sub> in 7 cases. The operation time, intraoperative estimated blood loss (IEBL), and perioperative complications were recorded. The improvement of intervertebral space height at fusion level was measured, and the accuracy of percutaneous pedicle screw (PPS) and Cage placement was also evaluated based on CT images performed at 1 week postoperatively. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score for both low back pain and leg pain, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were evaluated before operation, at 1 week postoperatively, and at last follow-up. Satisfaction to effectivenss were assessed by patients using modified MacNab criteria at last follow-up.
RESULTS: The operation time was ranged from 255 to 805 minutes (mean, 424.9 minutes). IEBL was 150-290 mL (mean, 219.3 mL). All patients received follow-up with the duration from 4 to 22 months (mean, 12.4 months). At 1 week postoperatively and last follow-up, VAS scores of low back pain and leg pain, JOA score, and ODI were significantly improved when compared with those before operation ( P&lt;0.05). At last follow-up, the clinical indicators were similar in comparison with those at 1 week postoperatively ( P&gt;0.05). There were 26 patients and 1 patient who respectively ranked excellent and mild in terms of effectiveness according to the modified MacNab criteria, with the excellent and good rate of 96.3%. There was 1 patient who suffered from incomplete injury of L <sub>5</sub> nerve root and partial neurological function recovered after 3-month conservative treatments. There were 118 implanted PPSs, and 116 of them were implanted under navigation. There were 33 Cages that were implanted under navigation. The accuracy of PPS and Cage placement was 99.1% and 97.0% respectively based on CT performed at 1 week postoperatively. The postoperative intervertebral space height was significantly increased in comparison with that before operation ( P&lt;0.05). During follow-up, mild Cage subsidence was observed in 1 patient, whereas no fixation loosing was found.
CONCLUSION: Real-time three-dimensional CT navigation-guided full-endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion has great safety and effectiveness with satisfactory preliminary clinical results. Design and further improvement of surgical equipment and instruments are expected to resolve the current technical difficulties.
