Title: Coronary sinus stenosis: an underdiagnosed cause for paediatric exertional chest pain.

Abstract: Undiagnosed coronary sinus obstruction can be a source of paediatric exertional chest pain and death. We present a case series of three interesting children who developed only exertional angina from various degrees of coronary sinus stenosis or atresia. We discuss the diagnosis and management of each case and the potential pathophysiology involved with their symptoms.
