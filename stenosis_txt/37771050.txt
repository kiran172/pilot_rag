Title: Impact of stroke history on procedural cerebrovascular insult probability and long-term outcome after TAVI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In TAVI procedural stroke is one of the most feared complications and for this reason also extensively studied. But there is a lack of data concerning the impact of previous stroke on procedural stroke and on long-term survival. The aim of this registry-based cohort study is to evaluate the prevalence of previous stroke in TAVI patients and its impact on procedural stroke risk as well as long-term outcome.
METHODS: We included all patients treated with TAVI between January 2007 and December 2020 and investigated concerning previous stroke in their medical history. Among 958 patients, 55 patients had previous stroke and were included in the present analysis.
RESULTS: The salient finding of the present study is that previous stroke is significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality and has established itself as a predictor for poor outcome after TAVI. This is also observed after adjusting for confounders like EuroSCORE II (European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation) and AF (atrial fibrillation) as one of the main underlying diseases for cerebrovascular insult (CVI). However, previous stroke is not associated with higher rates of procedural CVI.
CONCLUSION: A history of stroke is significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality and has established itself as a predictor for poor outcome after TAVI without higher rates of procedural stroke.
