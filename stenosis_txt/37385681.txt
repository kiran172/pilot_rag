Title: MR Imaging of Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis: Updated Evidence on High-Risk Plaque Features and Emerging Trends.

Abstract: MR imaging is well-established as the criterion standard for carotid artery atherosclerosis imaging. The capability of MR imaging to differentiate numerous plaque components has been demonstrated, including those features that are associated with a high risk of sudden changes, thrombosis, or embolization. The field of carotid plaque MR imaging is constantly evolving, with continued insight into the imaging appearance and implications of various vulnerable plaque characteristics. This article will review the most up-to-date knowledge of these high-risk plaque features on MR imaging and will delve into 2 major emerging topics: the role of vulnerable plaques in cryptogenic strokes and the potential use of MR imaging to modify carotid endarterectomy treatment guidelines.
