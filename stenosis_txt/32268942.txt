Title: Comparison of the Ultrathin Strut, Biodegradable Polymer Sirolimus-eluting Stent With a Durable Polymer Everolimus-eluting Stent in a Chinese Population: The Randomized BIOFLOW VI Trial.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The BIOFLOW-VI (Biotronik-Safety and Clinical Performance of the Drug Eluting Orsiro Stent in the Treatment of Subjects With De Novo Coronary Artery Lesions-VI) study evaluates the angiographic efficacy, clinical safety, and effectiveness of the ultrathin strut, biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (BP-SES) compared with a durable polymer everolimus-eluting stent (DP-EES). This randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to enable approval of new drug-eluting stents in China.
METHODS: A total of 440 eligible patients from 11 sites with up to 2 de novo native coronary artery lesions were randomly assigned to receive either BP-SES (n = 220) or DP-EES (n = 220) from July 2014 to September 2016 in this prospective, multicenter, noninferiority trial.
FINDINGS: The primary end point of 9-month in-stent late lumen loss (LLL) was 0.05 (0.02) mm in the BP-SES group versus 0.07 (0.02) mm in the DP-EES group, with a mean difference of -0.02 mm (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.03; P = 0.44; P<sub>noninferiority</sub> &lt; 0.0001). At 1 year, the target lesion failure rate (cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization) was similar between the 2 groups (BP-SES 2.3% vs DP-EES 1.4%; P = 0.50). No definite or probable stent thrombosis had occurred in any of the 2 treatment arms.
IMPLICATIONS: The randomized BIOFLOW-VI trial showed that BP-SES was noninferior to DP-EES with regard to the primary end point of 9-month in-stent LLL in a Chinese population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02870985.
