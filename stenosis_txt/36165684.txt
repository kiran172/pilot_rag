Title: The Effect of Subglottic Steroid injection on Blood Glucose in a Cohort of Patients With Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to assess the effect of a single intralesional subglottic steroid injection on fasting blood glucose over 7 days in a cohort of patients with subglottic stenosis.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients undergoing intralesional steroid injections at a tertiary academic center. Patients had baseline bloodwork performed, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), and hemoglobin A1C levels. Demographic data and risk factors were collected. Fasting capillary glucose (FCG) was measured using a capillary glucometer and performed by patients daily from days 0 to 7 after a single injection of Triamcinolone into the subglottic airway. Data were analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistics.
RESULTS: Eleven patients were enrolled, and 10 completed data collection over 7 days. All were female, with a mean age of 52.6 years (SD 17.5). Two patients were diabetic (non-insulin dependent). There was a statistically significant increase in FCG on day 1 post-injection (mean = 122.4 mg/dl compared to 100.7 mg/dl) that normalized for all patients within 24-72 h. The mean increase in FCG was 21.5% (SD 22.5%) of the initial value for the cohort. The diabetic group had statistically significant higher glucose values on day 1 compared to the non-diabetic group (146.5 mg/dl compared to 117.0 mg/dl).
CONCLUSION: A single subglottic steroid injection appears to cause a transient increase in FCG 1 day post injection, which resolves after 24-72 h and can be more pronounced in diabetic patients.
