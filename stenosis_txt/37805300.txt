Title: The Safety and Efficacy of the 445-nm Blue Laser for Operative Management of Benign Nonvascular Laryngeal Lesions.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The 445-nm blue laser combines the features of photocoagulative vascular lasers and cutting lasers in one device. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 445-nm blue laser for the treatment of benign laryngeal pathologies, other than vascular lesions. Outcomes were compared to those when already-established therapies were used.
METHODS: Adult voice center patients who underwent surgical intervention for vocal fold (VF) mass, VF scar, laryngeal stenosis, laryngeal web, or Reinke's edema were included in this retrospective study. Outcomes were compared to those achieved when traditional treatment modalities were used, including cold steel, CO<sub>2</sub> laser, potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser, and coblator. Strobovideolaryngoscopy footage was evaluated using a previously described model at four time points: postoperative visit #1: 1-14 days, postoperative visit #2: 30-60 days, postoperative visit #3: 61-365 days, postoperative visit #4: &gt;365 days.
RESULTS: Eighty cases using the blue laser and 153 controls (n = 78 cold steel, n = 51 KTP laser, n = 22 CO<sub>2</sub> laser, n = 2 coblator) were included in this study. Procedures performed using blue laser included VF mass excision (n = 45), VF scar reduction (n = 16), laryngeal stenosis resection/repair (n = 25), laryngeal web excision (n = 7), and reduction of Reinke's edema (n = 1). On postoperative strobovideolaryngoscopy examination, the surgical objective score did not differ significantly between the blue laser cohort and all controls at any postoperative visit. VF edema did not differ significantly between the blue laser cohort and all controls at any postoperative visit. VF hemorrhage scores were significantly lower in the blue laser cohort compared to all controls at the first postoperative visit, but hemorrhage had resolved almost entirely by the second postoperative visit in all groups. Postoperative VF stiffness was worse in the blue laser group at the third postoperative visit compared to controls, but both groups had improved to similar levels by the fourth postoperative visit. The rate of lesion recurrence (24.29% versus 17.19%) did not differ significantly between the blue laser cohort and controls on multivariate analysis (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.081 [0.461-2.536]). The complication rate (12.50% versus 10.46%) did not differ significantly between the blue laser cohort and all controls on multivariate analysis (OR = 0.992 [0.375-2.624]). The blue laser was associated with a lower rate of revision surgery (30.00% versus 34.64%) on multivariate analysis (OR = 0.380 [0.168-0.859]).
CONCLUSION: The 445-nm blue laser is safe and effective for the management of benign laryngeal lesions. It has efficacy and safety similar to those of traditional treatment modalities (including cold steel, CO<sub>2</sub> laser, and KTP laser). Use of the blue laser may lead to lower rates of early postoperative hemorrhage and revision surgery. No adverse effects attributed directly to the use of the blue laser were observed in this study. Further research is encouraged to confirm or refute these findings.
