Title: A Rare Presentation of Type-III Takayasu's Arteritis in a 20-Year-Old Female.

Abstract: Takayasu's arteritis is a rare chronic granulomatous vasculitis that predominantly affects the aorta and its branches. It is estimated to affect 2.6/million/annum, predominantly women in the second or third decade of their lives. This case report describes the case of a 21-year-old female, who initially only had low-grade fever and acrodynia, which over a few months, progressed to arm and leg claudication, weight loss, nausea, headache, and dizziness. A year later, the patient experienced impalpable radial pulses bilaterally, and her CT angiogram revealed multi-level arterial stenosis. A diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis was made and the patient was started on steroids and methotrexate. A consult was made with vascular surgery but no intervention was deemed necessary and the patient responded well to the medical treatment given. Though Takayasu's arteritis is a very rare disease, a detailed history, clinical examination, and investigations can help with early diagnosis.
