Title: Spontaneous Resolution of Extensive Iatrogenic Type A Aortic Dissection After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: The management of type A aortic dissection (TAAD) during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is challenging because TAVR is often performed in elderly patients with significant surgical risk. We present a case of extensive TAAD that developed during the TAVR procedure, which resolved spontaneously with medical treatment. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate).
