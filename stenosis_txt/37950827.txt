Title: Aortic stenosis and right ventricular dysfunction.

Abstract: At the present time, right ventricular function in patients with aortic stenosis is insufficiently taken into account in the decision-making process of aortic valve replacement. The aim of our study was to evaluate significance of right ventricular dysfunction in patients with severe aortic stenosis by modern 3D echocardiographic methods. This is prospective analysis of 68 patients with severe high and low-gradient aortic stenosis. We evaluated function of left and right ventricle on the basis of 3D reconstruction. Enddiastolic, endsystolic volumes, ejection fraction and stroke volumes of both chambers were assessed. There were more patients with right ventricular dysfunction in low-gradient group (RVEF < 45%) than in the high-gradient group (63.6% vs 39%, p = 0.02). Low-gradient patients had worse right ventricular function than high-gradient patients (RVEF 36% vs 46%, p = 0.02). There wasn't any significant correlation between the right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension (r = - 0.25, p = 0.036). There was significant correlation between left and right ejection fraction (r = 0.78, p < 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the only predictor of right ventricular function is the left ventricular function. According to our results we can state that right ventricular dysfunction is more common in patients with low-gradient than in high-gradient aortic stenosis and the only predictor of right ventricular dysfunction is left ventricular dysfunction, probably based on ventriculo-ventricular interaction. Pulmonary hypertension in patients with severe AS does not predict right ventricular dysfunction.
