Title: Case report: Pulmonary artery thrombosis in cyanotic congenital heart disease.

Abstract: Cyanotic congenital cardiac anomalies increase the risk of thrombosis. In pediatric congenital heart disease, the diagnosis of pulmonary artery thrombosis is rare. We reported an 11-year-old male child who developed progressive shortness of breath over six months. He was subsequently referred to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan. The child was diagnosed as a case of double outlet left ventricle, levo-transposition of the great arteries, pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect and thrombus in the main pulmonary artery with extension into the branch pulmonary arteries. He underwent thromboendarterectomy with a Glenn shunt and made an uneventful postoperative recovery.
