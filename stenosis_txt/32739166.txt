Title: Autograft remodeling after the Ross procedure by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging: Aortic stenosis versus insufficiency.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that patients undergoing the Ross procedure for aortic insufficiency are at greater risk of autograft dilatation than those with aortic stenosis. By using a tailored Ross technique to mitigate autograft dilatation in patients with aortic insufficiency, we aimed to compare the biomechanical and morphologic remodeling of the autograft at 1 year between patients with aortic insufficiency and patients with aortic stenosis.
METHODS: A total of 210 patients underwent a Ross procedure (2011-2016). Of those, 86 patients (mean age 43 ± 13 years; 32% were female) completed preoperative and postoperative cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 71 studies were suitable for analysis: 41 patients with aortic stenosis and 30 patients with aortic insufficiency. Nine healthy adults were used as controls. Autograft root dimensions, individual sinus volumes, and distensibility were measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance.
RESULTS: At 1 year, there was no difference in autograft root dimensions between patients with aortic stenosis (mean annulus 25.1 ± 3.1 mm and sinus diameters 35 ± 4.1 mm) and patients with aortic insufficiency (26.6 ± 3 mm and 37.1 ± 3.5 mm; P = .12 and .06, respectively). Relative sinus of Valsalva volumes were symmetrical in the aortic stenosis (right 34.8% ± 4%, left 33.7% ± 3.5%, noncoronary 31.4% ± 3.2%) and aortic insufficiency groups (34.8% ± 3.9%, 33.8% ± 2.8%, 31.3% ± 3.7%, P = .85, .92, and .82), and similar to those of healthy adults. Aortic root distensibility was reduced in both groups compared with healthy adults (P = .003), but was similar between aortic stenosis (3.12 ± 1.58 × 10-3 mm Hg-1) and aortic insufficiency (3.04 ± 1.15 × 10-3 mm Hg-1; P = .9).
CONCLUSIONS: Using a tailored technique, there were no differences in the morphologic or biomechanical remodeling of the autograft root 1 year after the Ross procedure between patients with aortic stenosis and patients with aortic insufficiency. However, autograft roots are stiffer than native aortic roots.
