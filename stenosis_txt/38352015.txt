Title: A novel technique of voice-sparing cricotracheal resection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cricotracheal resection (CTR) is considered the standard of care for patients suffering from idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS). Although CTR results in permanent restoration of airway patency, it has a mild to moderate impact on voice quality. Here we propose modifications of the standard CTR technique to make it a voice-preserving procedure.
METHODS: Five women with iSGS underwent voice-sparing CTR between January 2022 and January 2023. In this procedure, through several technical adaptations, the function of the cricothyroid joint was preserved. Outcomes of these voice-sparing CTRs were compared to outcomes in patients who underwent standard CTR in our institution. All patients underwent full functional preoperative and postoperative workups, including spirometry, voice measurements, patient self-assessment, and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.
RESULTS: All 5 patients in the study group suffered from iSGS with high-grade Myer-Cotton III° stenosis (100%); 1 patient had previously undergone endoscopic laser resection. Voice evaluation demonstrated a nearly unchanged fundamental pitch (mean preoperative, 191 ± 73.1 Hz; postoperative, 182 ± 64.2 Hz) and dynamic voice range (preoperative, 24.4 semitones; postoperative, 20.4 semitones). This was in contrast to the control group, in which significantly reduced voice quality was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients suffering from iSGS, excellent functional results can be obtained with voice-sparing CTR.
