Title: Prognostic Value of Multiple Complete Blood Count-Derived Indices in Intermediate Coronary Lesions.

Abstract: Complete blood count (CBC)-derived indices have been proposed as reliable inflammatory biomarkers to predict outcomes in the context of coronary artery disease. These indices have yet to be thoroughly validated in patients with intermediate coronary stenosis. Our study included 1527 patients only with intermediate coronary stenosis. The examined variables were neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), system inflammation response index (SIRI), and aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI). The primary endpoint was the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and unplanned revascularization. Over a follow-up of 6.11 (5.73-6.55)Â years, MACEs occurred in 189 patients. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis showed that SIRI outperformed other indices with the most significant area under the curve. In the multivariable analysis, SIRI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.588, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.138-2.212) and AISI (HR 1.673, 95% CI 1.217-2.300) were the most important prognostic factors among all the indices. The discrimination ability of each index was strengthened in patients with less burden of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. SIRI also exhibited the best incremental value beyond the traditional cardiovascular risk model.
