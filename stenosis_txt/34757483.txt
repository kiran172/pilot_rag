Title: Recurrent Colorectal Liver Metastases in the Liver Remnant After Major Liver Surgery-IRE as a Salvage Local Treatment When Resection and Thermal Ablation are Unsuitable.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To examine the safety and short-term oncologic outcomes of computer-tomography-guided (CT-guided) irreversible electroporation (IRE) of recurrent, irresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) after major hepatectomy deemed unsuitable for thermal ablation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients undergoing CT-guided IRE of recurrent CRLM after major hepatectomy were included in this study. All tumors were located adjacent to sole remaining intrahepatic blood vessels and bile ducts, precluding thermal ablation. Patients underwent systematic clinical and imaging follow-up, including magnetic resonance imaging of the liver at 1-month and 3-month intervals thereafter. Time to local and intrahepatic tumor progression within 12 and 36 months and associated risk factors were assessed using Kaplan Meier and Cox regression analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: Complete ablation with a safety margin of at least 0.5 cm was achieved in 22/23 (95.6%) patients. No vessel injury or thrombosis occurred. Five patients developed moderate biliary stenosis after a median of 4 weeks, without requiring treatment. Local tumor-progression-free rates within 12/36 months were 64%/57.4%, respectively. Intrahepatic-progression-free rate within 12/36 months was 36.4%/19.5%, respectively. Five (23%) patients were tumor-free at the end of follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis did not show any association between local tumor-progression-free rates and patient age, target tumor size, primary tumor side or synchronicity of liver metastases.
CONCLUSION: In this highly selected patient population with local recurrences of CRLM after major surgery, IRE was shown to be a safe salvage treatment option when thermal ablation is unsuitable.
