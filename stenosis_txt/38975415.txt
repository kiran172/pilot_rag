Title: An Unusual Presentation of Moyamoya Disease in a Pediatric Patient.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic cerebro-vasculopathy that is extremely rare in the pediatric population. The main characteristic feature is the progressive stenosis in the internal carotid artery with or without the involvement of its main branches in the circle of Willis leading to ischemic stroke. Patients have clinical manifestations related to cerebral ischemia in the carotid branch territories, suchÂ as sensory impairment, hemiparesis, and aphasia/dysarthria. Herein, we report a case of MMD in a six-year-old Emirati female who presented with unusual manifestations of MMD in the form of headache, vomiting, and double vision and was diagnosed with MMD based on a brain MRI with angiography. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of MMD in the United Arab Emirates.
