Title: A Rare Encounter: Unstable Vasospastic Angina Induced by Thyrotoxicosis.

Abstract: Coronary artery vasospasm plays a crucial role in the prevalence of unstable angina. Despite common misdiagnosis, there is limited evidence on this topic. Here, we present a rare case of unstable vasospastic angina in a female with severe thyrotoxicosis. Case Report: A 62-year-old female patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit due to crushing chest pain at rest. The patient exhibited ischemic changes on the ECG with a normal troponin I level. Recurrent chest pain prompted urgent coronary angiography, revealing generalized vasospasm of all coronary artery branches including the left main coronary artery. Intracoronary nitroglycerin injection partially alleviated the vasospasm; however, there was a persistent stenosis in the left main artery. Subsequent intravascular ultrasound demonstrated an anatomically normal left main artery. Post-procedure, laboratory tests revealed undetectable levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones above the detectable level. The patient was initiated on methimazole and discharged symptom-free, expecting a good prognosis under conservative management. Conclusions: Clinically significant coronary vasospasm triggered by thyrotoxicosis remains a rarity in clinical practice, often posing diagnostic challenges. This case emphasizes the significance of intracoronary nitroglycerin and intravascular ultrasound in discerning the etiology of coronary lesions seen on angiography. We advocate for these techniques to optimize invasive coronary artery diagnostics, enabling the selection of the appropriate treatment strategies and improving long-term prognosis.
