Title: The short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy combining with different type of mesentericoportal vein resection and reconstruction for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma: a Chinese multicenter retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The results of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy combining with mesentericoportal vein resection and reconstruction (LPD-MPVRs) for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma are rarely reported. The aim of present study was to explore the short- and long-term outcomes of different type of LPD-MPVRs.
METHODS: Patients who underwent LPD-MPVRs in 14 Chinese high-volume pancreatic centers between June 2014 and December 2020 were selected and compared.
RESULTS: In total, 142 patients were included and were divided into primary closure (n = 56), end-end anastomosis (n = 43), or interposition graft (n = 43). Median overall survival (OS) and median progress-free survival (PFS) between primary closure and end-end anastomosis had no difference (both P > 0.05). As compared to primary closure and end-end anastomosis, interposition graft had the worst median OS (12 months versus 19 months versus 17 months, P = 0.001) and the worst median PFS (6 months versus 15 months versus 12 months, P < 0.000). As compared to primary closure, interposition graft had almost double risk in major morbidity (16.3 percent versus 8.9 percent) and about triple risk (10 percent versus 3.6 percent) in 90-day mortality, while End-end anastomosis had only one fourth major morbidity (2.3 percent versus 8.9 percent). Multivariate analysis revealed postoperation hospital stay, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, number of positive lymph nodes had negative impact on OS, while R0, R1 surgical margin had protective effect on OS. Postoperative hospital stay had negative impact on PFS, while primary closure, end-end anastomosis, short-term vascular patency, and short-term vascular stenosis positively related to PFS.
CONCLUSIONS: In LPD-MPVRs, interposition graft had the worst OS, the worst PFS, the highest rate of major morbidity, and the highest rate of 90-day mortality. While there were no differences in OS and PFS between primary closure and end-end anastomosis.
