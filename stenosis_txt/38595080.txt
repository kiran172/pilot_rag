Title: Using Patient-Specific Contrast Enhancement Optimizer Simulation Software During the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation-Computed Tomography Angiography in Patients With Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study assessed whether patient-specific contrast enhancement optimizer simulation software (p-COP) can reduce the contrast material (CM) dose compared with the conventional body weight (BW)-tailored scan protocol during transcatheter aortic valve implantation-computed tomography angiography (TAVI-CTA) in patients with aortic stenosis.
METHODS: We used the CM injection protocol selected by the p-COP in group A (n = 30). p-COP uses an algorithm that concerns data on an individual patient's cardiac output. Group B (n = 30) was assigned to the conventional BW-tailored CM injection protocol group. We compared the CM dose, CM amount, injection rate, and computed tomography (CT) values in the abdominal aorta between the 2 groups and classified them as acceptable (>280 Hounsfield units (HU)) or unacceptable (<279 HU) based on the optimal CT value and visualization scores for TAVI-CTA. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare patient characteristics and assess the interpatient variability of subjects in both groups.
RESULTS: Group A received 56.2 mL CM and 2.6 mL/s of injection, whereas group B received 76.9 mL CM and 3.4 mL/s of injection ( P < 0.01). The CT value for the abdominal aorta at the celiac level was 287.0 HU in group A and 301.7HU in group B ( P = 0.46). The acceptable (>280 HU) and unacceptable (<280 HU) CT value rates were 22 and 8 patients in group A and 24 and 6 patients in group B, respectively ( P = 0.76). We observed no significant differences in the visualization scores between groups A and B (visualization score = 3, P = 0.71).
CONCLUSION: The utilization of p-COP may decrease the CM dosage and injection rate by approximately 30% in individuals with aortic stenosis compared with the body-weight-tailored scan protocol during TAVI-CTA.
