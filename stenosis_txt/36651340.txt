Title: Ductus arteriosus morphology in duct-dependent pulmonary circulation: CT classification and pattern in different ventricular morphology.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The objective was to study the ductus arteriosus morphology in duct-dependent pulmonary circulation and its pattern in different ventricle morphology using CT angiography.
METHOD: From January 2013 to December 2015, patients aged 6 months and below with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation underwent CT angiography to delineate the ductus arteriosus origin, tortuosity, site of insertion, and pulmonary artery anatomy. The ductus arteriosus were classified into type I, IIa, IIb, and III based on its site of origin, either from descending aorta, distal arch, proximal arch, or subclavian artery, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients and 116 ductus arteriosus (two had bilateral ductus arteriosus) were analysed. Type I, IIa, IIb, and III ductus arteriosus were seen in 13 (11.2 %), 71 (61.2%), 21 (18.1%), and 11 (9.5%), respectively. Tortuous ductus arteriosus was found in 38 (32.7%), which was commonly seen in single ventricular lesions. Ipsilateral and bilateral branch pulmonary artery stenosis was seen in 68 (59.6%) and 6 (5.3%) patients, respectively. The majority of patients with pulmonary atresia intact ventricular septum had type I (54.4%) and non-tortuous ductus arteriosus, while those with single and biventricular lesions had type II ductus arteriosus (84.9% and 89.7%, respectively). Type III ductus arteriosus was more common in biventricular lesions (77.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Ductus arteriosus in duct-dependent pulmonary circulation has a diverse morphology with a distinct origin and tortuosity pattern in different types of ventricular morphology. CT may serve as an important tool in case selection and pre-procedural planning for ductal stenting.
