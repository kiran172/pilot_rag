Title: Outcomes and Predictors of Stroke After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Cerebral Protection Device Era.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies have shown inconclusive results on the effectiveness of cerebral protection devices (CPDs) with transcatheter aortic valve replacement. We aimed to analyze the national statistics on stroke and other outcomes with CPD use.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database (2017-2020) was queried to obtain data on patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Outcomes were compared between patients with a CPD and patients without a CPD. Of 271â€‰804 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, CPD was used in 7.3% of patients. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, CPD use was not associated with lower overall stroke rates (1.6% versus 1.9% without CPD; odds ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.84-1.07]; P=0.364), but it was significantly associated with lower major stroke rates (1.2% versus 1.5% without CPD; odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74-0.98]; P=0.02). Patients with a CPD also had a shorter length of stay, higher routine discharges to home/self-care (74.9% versus 70.6%), and lower mortality rates (0.7% versus 1.3%). The 30-day (9.6% versus 11.7%) and 180-day (24.6% versus 28.2%) readmission rates were significantly lower in the CPD cohort. Among patients who developed stroke, patients with a CPD had more frequent routine discharges. Prior valve surgery was associated with the highest risk of overall and major stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: CPD use during transcatheter aortic valve replacement was not independently associated with a lower risk of overall stroke but was associated with a lower risk of major stroke in a multivariable model. Data from future randomized trials that may offset any potential confounders in our study are required to help identify patients who would benefit from the use of these devices.
