Title: Successful Emergent Treatment of Limb-Threatening Amniotic Constriction Band in a Neonate with a 2-year Follow-up: A Case Report.

Abstract: CASE: A 29-week-old gestational age neonate born by emergent cesarean delivery was found to have a circumferential upper arm amniotic constriction band. Initial removal of the amniotic band at the time of delivery uncovered a circumferential skin band with profound venous obstruction but preserved Doppler arterial flow. Emergent excision of the constricted skin band with fasciotomies of the arm and forearm was performed shortly after birth to preserve the extremity.
CONCLUSION: This report outlines a visualized constriction band at the time of delivery causing neurovascular compromise to an extremity of a neonate. Prompt intervention ensued preserving both form and function with an excellent 2-year follow-up.
