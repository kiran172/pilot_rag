Title: Naples prognostic score as a predictor of mortality in surgical aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Aim: Investigating the impact of nutritional and inflammatory status, assessed by the Naples-Prognostic-Score (NPS), on postoperative mortality in 173 older adults undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement(SAVR) for aortic stenosis(AS).Methods: Retrospective study calculating NPS from neutrophils/lymphocytes, lymphocytes/monocytes, total cholesterol and serum albumin.Results: Mean age was 69.39 ± 6.153 with 45.1% females. The post-operative mortality was 23.7% over a follow-up period of 50 ± 31 months. The 1-month mortality rate is 2.89%. High NPS significantly associated with increased mortality; multivariate logistic regression confirmed its independence (odds-ratio:3.494, 95% confidence-interval:1.555-7.849, p = 0.002). NPS cutoff of 2 showed 73.2% sensitivity, 56.8% specificity and area-under-the-curve of 0.758 for predicting all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis supported lower NPS correlating with better survival.Conclusion: NPS independently predicts postoperative mortality in SAVR patients.
