Title: Point-of-care Ultrasound Diagnosis of Gastric Outlet Obstruction Syndrome.

Abstract: Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO) is a clinical syndrome characterized by postprandial vomiting, epigastric pain, and abdominal distension due to mechanical or motility disorders. The suspicion will mainly rely on abdominal radiological imaging (computed tomography, barium studies) that might not be widely available or even be contraindicated. We report a 65-year-old male who developed progressive epigastralgia, anorexia, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal distension and epigastric tenderness on deep palpation. With the presumptive diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction, an abdominal point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was performed and showed impaired gastric emptying and a "target sign." A gastroscopic exploration confirmed inflammatory pyloric stenosis due to coexisting antral and duodenal ulcers. POCUS could play an essential role in the easy ultrasonographic diagnosis of gastroparesis, helping to differentiate from other causes of obstruction and even raise suspicion in the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis as a consequence of a GGO. POCUS may serve as a first-line imaging test that can raise suspicion of this difficult to diagnose and probably underreported disease.
