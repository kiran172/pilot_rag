Title: A case of small bowel adenocarcinoma that caused intestinal obstruction after administration of patency capsule.

Abstract: An 80-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with iron deficiency anemia and exertional chest pain. Coronary artery angiography showed 90% stenosis in the middle left anterior descending branch; abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Although his past medical history and results of imaging studies did not suggest intestinal stenosis, assessment of intestinal patency with the PillCamÂ® patency capsule (tag-less PC) was performed. Thirty-three hours after administration, excretion of tag-less PC was not confirmed; an abdominal contrast-enhanced CT showed arrest of tag-less PC in the small bowel and thickening of the bowel wall, suggesting a small bowel tumor. Four days after administration of tag-less PC, he developed abdominal pain and vomiting. Intestinal obstruction was diagnosed by abdominal radiograph. A diagnosis of small bowel tumor with intestinal obstruction was made, and surgical resection was performed. The tumor was histologically an adenocarcinoma. It is necessary to carefully evaluate gastrointestinal patency before small intestine endoscopy especially in elderly people with reduced cardiopulmonary function and many underlying diseases.
