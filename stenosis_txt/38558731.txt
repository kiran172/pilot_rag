Title: Hereditary Anatomical Risk Factors for Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injuries.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION:  Genetic and anatomical factors have been reported as risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. This study aimed to investigate anatomical characteristics in family members sustaining ACL injuries, compared with age- and sex-matched patients with simple meniscus injuries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Medical records of 1548 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction were reviewed. Cases of ACL injury occurring in first-degree relatives were selected. Forty-one patients from 20 families were included in the study (F-ACL group). Fifty patients with meniscus injuries were included as controls. Anatomical factors comprising posterior-inferior tibial slope (PITS), notch width index (NWI), notch angle (NA), and intercondylar notch roof inclination angle (RA) were compared between groups. The correlation of these anatomical factors between parent and child or siblings was also investigated.
RESULTS:  The 41 patients (20 families) consisted of 12 parent-child pairs and 29 siblings (13 pairs and one trio). Injuries occurred during playing the same sport in 11 families (55%). PITS was significantly steeper in the F-ACL group (9.9 vs. 7.8 degrees). NWI and NA were significantly smaller in the F-ACL group (0.262 vs. 0.278 and 50.5 vs. 58.8 degrees). RA was significantly greater in the F-ACL group (130 vs. 126.9 degrees). A positive correlation in NA (r = 0.677) and a weak correlation in NWI and RA were observed between family members.
CONCLUSIONS:  Common anatomical risk factors of ACL injury exist within families, including intercondylar notch stenosis and steep posterior tibial slope. The findings suggest the potential for developing effective ACL injury prevention programs targeting these risk factors.
