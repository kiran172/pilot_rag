Title: A Novel Modified Hybrid Therapy for Pulmonary Atresia With Intact Ventricular Septum.

Abstract: This report describes the cases of 2 neonates who had a diagnosis of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and muscular right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction and who underwent modified hybrid therapy as initial palliation. This approach combined the traditional hybrid approach and off-pump RVOT reconstruction with a Foley balloon catheter. Both patients recovered well, with adequate pressure gradients over the RVOT and pulmonary valve. This modified hybrid therapy can serve as a feasible treatment approach for patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, especially patients with muscular RVOT stenosis.
