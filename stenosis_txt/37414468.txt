Title: MR Angiography of Extracranial Carotid Disease.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance angiography sequences, such as time-of-flight and contrast-enhanced angiography, provide clear depiction of vessel lumen, traditionally used to evaluate carotid pathologic conditions such as stenosis, dissection, and occlusion; however, atherosclerotic plaques with a similar degree of stenosis may vary tremendously from a histopathological standpoint. MR vessel wall imaging is a promising noninvasive method to evaluate the content of the vessel wall at high spatial resolution. This is particularly interesting in the case of atherosclerosis as vessel wall imaging can identify higher risk, vulnerable plaques as well as has potential applications in the evaluation of other carotid pathologic conditions.
