Title: Incidence of medical and surgical complications after elective lumbar spine surgery.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The demographic change results in an ever increasing number of older patients with pre-existing medical conditions who require spinal surgery, and recovery is often severely impaired by procedure-related complications. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine patients at risk of medical and surgical complications.
METHOD: Using our database, we reviewed 1244 patients with lumbar degenerative disk disease, spinal stenosis, and instability, who had undergone surgery at our department between 2009 and 2014. We screened for medical complications (thromboembolic and cardiac events, pneumonia, and sepsis) and surgical complications (hemorrhage, wound infection, and CSF fistula). Furthermore, a matched 1:1 control group consisted of 103 patients without any surgical and medical complications in the randomly selected period of May 2009 to October 2014.
RESULTS: 93 patients (46 women, 47 men), mean age 70 years (range 33-86 years, median 67.4 years), with complications were identified (overall morbidity 7.6 %): 22.6 % (n = 26) had medical complications and 77.4 % (n = 89) surgical complications. In 93 patients (46 females, 47 males), mean age 70 years (range 33-86 years, median 67.4 years), a total of 115 complications were noted (overall morbidity of the 93 patients 7.6 %): 22.6 % (n = 26) medical complications and 77.4 % (n = 89) surgical complications. Age and pre-existing conditions were independently associated with medical complications (p &lt; 0.001). Infections (pneumonia and sepsis) were correlated with multi-segmental interventions (p = 0.009), duration of surgery (p = 0.009), and pre-existing conditions (p = 0.014). Surgical complications were significantly correlated with age (p = 0.016) and duration of surgery (p = 0.014) and occurred significantly more often in patients with instability (p &lt; 0.001). Wound healing disorders were associated with coagulopathy (p = 0.013) and transfusion (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified predictors that help identify patients at risk of medical and surgical complications. These correlations should be taken into account when advising older patients with pre-existing conditions on lumbar spine surgery.
