Title: Aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting through a right thoracotomy for a patient with a left chest wall tumor.

Abstract: A 68-year-old man was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and right coronary artery occlusion on preoperative examination for total extirpation of a giant left breast liposarcoma. Prior to the intervention for the liposarcoma, he underwent successful aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting via a right anterolateral thoracotomy to avoid the tumor close to the sternum. On postoperative day 28, the patient underwent a successful wide excision of the left chest wall tumor.
