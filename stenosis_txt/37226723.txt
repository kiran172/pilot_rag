Title: Ostial Patency Measurements After Endoscopic Sphenoidotomies and Frontal Sinusotomies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sphenoid and frontal sinuses have narrow ostia and are prone to stenosis. However, their relative rates of patency are not well established, and descriptive rates of sphenoid stenosis have never been reported. The objective is to measure the patency of the sphenoid and frontal sinus ostia postoperatively.
METHODS: A prospective multi-institutional cohort study was performed. Ostial patency was measured at surgery and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Pertinent clinical history such as the presence of nasal polyps and prior history of ESS as well as the use of steroid eluting stents were recorded. Overall stenosis rates were calculated for both the sphenoid and frontal sinuses, and Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Test was used to compare intraoperative and postoperative ostial areas. Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine effects of 5 clinical factors.
RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. The mean sphenoid sinus ostial area decreased 42.2% in size from baseline to 3 months postoperatively (T0 55.2 ± 28.7 mm vs T3 m 31.8 ± 25.5 mm, P &lt; .001). The mean frontal sinus ostial area decreased 39.8% in size from baseline to 3 months postoperatively (T0 33.7 ± 17.2 mm vs T3 m 19.9 ± 15.1 mm, P &lt; .001). Neither the sphenoid nor the frontal sinus ostial patency demonstrated statistically significant change from 3 to 6 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSION: Both sphenoid and frontal sinus ostia routinely narrow postoperatively, predominately from baseline to 3 months. These findings can serve as a reference for both clinical outcomes and future studies of these surgeries.
