Title: Surgical and endovascular cerebral revascularization for cerebral vasculitis with inflammatory vessel stenosis: a case series.

Abstract: Autoimmune vasculitides affect the cerebral vasculature significantly in a considerable number of cases. When immunosuppressive treatments fail to prevent stenosis in cerebral vessels, treatment options for affected patients become limited. In this case series, we present four cases of pharmacoresistant vasculitis with recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or stroke successfully treated with either extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery or endovascular stenting. Both rescue treatments were effective and safe in the selected cases. Our experience suggests that cases of pharmacoresistant cerebral vasculitis with recurrent stroke may benefit from rescue revascularization in combination with maximum medical management.
