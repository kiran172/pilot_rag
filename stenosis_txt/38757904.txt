Title: Hyperglycemia-simulating environment attenuated experimentally induced calcification in cultured human aortic valve interstitial cells.

Abstract: Objectives: The role of diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for the development of calcific aortic valve disease has not been fully clarified. Aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) have been suggested to be crucial for calcification of the valve. Induced calcification in cultured VICs is a good in vitro model for aortic valve calcification. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether increased glucose levels increase experimentally induced calcification in cultured human VICs. Design: VICs were isolated from explanted calcified aortic valves after valve replacement. Osteogenic medium induced calcification of cultured VICs at different glucose levels (5, 15, and 25 mM). Calcium deposits were visualized using Alizarin Red staining and measured spectrophotometrically. Results: The higher the glucose concentration, the lower the level of calcification. High glucose (25 mM) reduced calcification by 52% compared with calcification at a physiological (5 mM) glucose concentration (correlation and regression analysis: r = -0.55, p = .025 with increased concentration of glucose). Conclusions: In vitro hyperglycemia-like conditions attenuated calcification in VICs. High glucose levels may trigger a series of events that secondarily stimulate calcification of VICs in vivo.
