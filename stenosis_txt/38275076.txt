Title: Astragaloside IV induces endothelial progenitor cell angiogenesis in deep venous thrombosis through inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), referred to as venous thromboembolism, is the third most frequent cardiovascular disease. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to the recanalization of DVT. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) has been suggested to have angiogenesis-enhancing effects. Here, we investigate the roles and mechanisms of AS-IV in EPCs and DVT.
METHODS: The experimental DVT model was established by inferior vena cava stenosis in rats. EPCs were collected from patients with DVT. Transwell assays were performed to detect cell migration. Tube formation was determined using Matrigel basement membrane matrix and ImageJ software. The thrombus weight and length were measured. Pathological changes were examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The production of proinflammatory cytokines was estimated by ELISA. The level of PI3K/AKT-related proteins was measured by western blotting.
RESULTS: AS-IV administration facilitated the migrative and angiogenic functions of human EPCs in vitro. Additionally, AS-IV inhibited thrombosis and repressed the infiltration of leukocytes into the thrombus and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in rats. Mechanistically, AS-IV inactivated PI3K/AKT signaling in rats.
CONCLUSION: AS-IV prevents thrombus in an experimental DVT model by facilitating EPC angiogenesis and decreasing inflammation through inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling.
