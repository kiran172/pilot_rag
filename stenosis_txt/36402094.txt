Title: Borderzone infarction and recurrent stroke in intracranial atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial stenosis (ICAS) is a common cause of stroke worldwide and patients with symptomatic ICAS exhibit a high rate of recurrence, particularly in the early period after the initial event. In this study, we aimed to study the association between borderzone infarct and recurrent ischemic stroke in patients hospitalized with symptomatic ICAS.
METHODS: This is a retrospective single center study that included patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke in the setting of intracranial stenosis (50% or more and an acute ischemic stroke in the territory supplied by the stenosed artery) over a 32-month period. We excluded patients who did not receive a brain MRI or did not have an infarct on brain imaging. The primary predictor is infarct pattern (any borderzone vs. no borderzone infarct) and the primary outcome was recurrent cerebrovascular events (RCVE) within 90 days. We used unadjusted, and age and sex adjusted logistic regression models to determine associations between infarct pattern and RCVE at 90-days.
RESULTS: Among 99 patients who met the inclusion criteria (4 tandem), the mean age was 70.1 ± 11.2 years and 41.4% were women; 43 had borderzone infarcts and 19 had RCVE. In adjusted binary logistic regression analysis, borderzone infarct was associated with increased risk of RCVE (adjusted OR 4.00 95% CI 1.33-11.99, p=0.013). The association between borderzone infarction and RCVE was not different among anterior circulation ICAD (adjusted HR 2.85 95% CI 0.64-12.76, p=0.172) vs. posterior circulation ICAD (adjusted HR 6.69 95% CI 1.06-42.11, p=0.043), p-value for interaction = 0.592.
CONCLUSION: In real world post-SAMMPRIS medically treated patients with ICAD, the borderzone infarct pattern was associated with 90-day RCVE. Borderzone infarcts are likely a surrogate marker of impaired distal blood flow, highlighting the importance of targeting stroke mechanisms and developing alternative treatment strategies for high-risk cohorts.
