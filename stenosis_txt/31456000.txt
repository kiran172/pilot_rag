Title: Four stay-sutures method: a simplified hand-sewn purse-string suture in laparoscopic circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy.

Abstract: Laparoscopic esophagojejunostomy is a challenging procedure because of its technical difficulty. We herein report a new method involving circular-stapled anastomosis using a hand-sewn suture with four stay-sutures and evaluate its outcomes. Esophagojejunostomy using this method was performed in 36 consecutive patients with clinical stage I gastric cancer at the authors' institutions. The key feature of our procedure was the placement of four full-thickness stay-sutures to anchor the esophageal stump prior to the hand-sewn purse-string suture. The median operation time and mean anvil fixation time were 315.5 and 21.9Â min, respectively. The mortality rate was 0%, although anastomotic leakage following esophagojejunostomy was observed in 1 patient (2.8%), and anastomotic stenosis was observed in another patient (2.8%). Intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy using the four stay-sutures method appears to be safe and feasible. We believe that this method enables hand-sewn purse-string suturing to be performed more easily.
