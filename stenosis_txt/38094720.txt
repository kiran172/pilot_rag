Title: Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement During Second Trimester of Pregnancy.

Abstract: Critical bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis is a rare finding in the second trimester of pregnancy. We present the case of a successful valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a 16-weeks-pregnant patient. We describe the significant role of the multidisciplinary heart team during preconception and pregnancy.
