Title: Left Main Bronchus Stenosis Lesion, Neutrophil Count, and Platelet Count Are Predictors of Post-Tuberculosis Bronchomalacia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Post-tuberculosis bronchomalacia (PTBM) is one of the main conditions occurring in patients after tracheobronchial tuberculosis (TBTB), and is also associated with the recurrence of symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate the predictors of PTBM in patients who had been undergoing appropriate TB treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical data of 104 patients with symptomatic airway stenosis after TBTB between January 01, 2019 and June 31, 2020 were recorded and analyzed. The association between baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and PTBM was calculated with logistical regression. The time from onset of bronchoscopic intervention was examined by Kaplan-Meier estimates; differences between the 2 groups were tested by the log-rank test. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (54.81%) had PTBM. In the multivariate logistical analysis, the left main bronchus stenosis lesion (odds ratio [OR]=3.763), neutrophil (NEUT) count (OR=1.527), and platelet (PLT) (OR=1.010) count were predictors of PTBM. During follow-up, patients with BM had a significantly longer duration from onset of bronchoscopic intervention than patients without BM (hazard ratio=2.412, P<0.0001). Further, all patients needing long-term bronchoscopic intervention therapy were subsequently identified as having PTBM. Additionally, blood PLT counts were significantly decreased to normal levels in the non-BM group (P<0.05), but not in the BM group (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS PTBM is most likely to occur in the left main bronchus. The inflammatory and immune responses associated with NEUT and PLT may represent therapeutic targets of PTBM. Our study is the first to report that decreased blood PLT count has the potential to monitor the treatment response.
