Title: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D deficiency is independently associated with cardiac valve calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: Cardiac valve calcification is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Low vitamin D levels are associated with vascular calcification in CKD. However, the association between vitamin D levels and cardiac valve calcification is unknown. A total of 513 patients with pre-dialysis CKD were included in this cross-sectional study. Aortic valve calcification (AVC) and mitral valve calcification (MVC) were assessed using two-dimensional echocardiography. The associations between AVC and MVC and baseline variables were investigated using logistic regression analyses. In multivariable analysis, serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D level was independently associated with AVC (odds ratio [OR], 0.87; P &lt; 0.001) and MVC (OR, 0.92; P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, age, diabetes, coronary heart disease, calcium × phosphate product, and intact parathyroid hormone levels were independently associated with AVC and MVC. Systolic blood pressure was independently associated with AVC. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the best cutoff values of serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels for predicting AVC and MVC were ≤ 12.5 and ≤ 11.9 pg/dl, respectively. Serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D deficiency is independently associated with AVC and MVC in patients with CKD, suggesting that serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D level may be a potential biomarker of AVC and MVC in these patients.
