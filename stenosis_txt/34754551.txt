Title: Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at the craniocervical junction presenting with Brown-Séquard syndrome: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several case reports about spinal cord compression due to hyperostosis at the craniocervical junction are available. However, compression at C1-C2 solely due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is rare.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-year-old Asian male, with a history of lumbar spinal canal stenosis, presented with a progressive quadriparesis within 3 months. Imaging showed central OPLL at the C1-C2 level contributing to severe spinal cord compression. The patient improved neurologically after a C1-C2 laminectomy.
CONCLUSION: A patient presented with a progressive Brown-Séquard syndrome due to OPLL at the craniocervical junction (C1-C2 level) and improved following a decompressive laminectomy.
