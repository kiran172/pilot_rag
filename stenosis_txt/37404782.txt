Title: Detection of Myocardial Ischemia Using Cardiovascular MRI Stress T1 Mapping: A Miniature-Swine Validation Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of cardiac MRI stress T1 mapping in detecting ischemic and infarcted myocardium in a miniature-swine model, using pathologic findings as the reference standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten adult male Chinese miniature swine, with coronary artery stenosis induced by an ameroid constrictor, and two healthy control swine were studied. Cardiac 3-T MRI rest and adenosine triphosphate stress T1 mapping and perfusion images, along with resting and late gadolinium enhancement images, were acquired at baseline and weekly up to 4 weeks after surgery or until humanely killed. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to analyze the performance of T1 mapping in the detection of myocardial ischemia.
RESULTS: In the experimental group, both the infarcted myocardium (ΔT1 = 10 msec ± 2 [SD]; ΔT1 percentage = 0.7% ± 0.1) and ischemic myocardium (ΔT1 = 10 msec ± 2; ΔT1 percentage = 0.9% ± 0.2) exhibited reduced T1 reactivity compared with the remote myocardium (ΔT1 = 53 msec ± 7; ΔT1 percentage = 4.7% ± 0.6) and normal myocardium (ΔT1 = 56 msec ± 11; ΔT1 percentage = 4.9% ± 1.1). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated high diagnostic performance of ΔT1 in detecting ischemic myocardium, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 (P &lt; .001). Rest T1 displayed high diagnostic performance in detecting infarcted myocardium (AUC = 0.95; P &lt; .001). When rest T1 and ΔT1 were combined, the diagnostic performance for both ischemic and infarcted myocardium were improved (AUCs, 0.89 and 0.97, respectively; all P &lt; .001). The collagen volume fraction correlated with ΔT1, ΔT1 percentage, and Δ extracellular volume percentage (r = -0.70, -0.70, and -0.50, respectively; P = .001, .001, and .03, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Using histopathologic validation in a swine model, noninvasive cardiac MRI stress T1 mapping demonstrated high performance in detecting ischemic and infarcted myocardium without the need for contrast agents.Keywords: Coronary Artery Disease, MRI, Myocardial Ischemia, Rest T1 Mapping, Stress T1 Mapping, Swine Model Supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2023See also commentary by Burrage and Ferreira in this issue.
