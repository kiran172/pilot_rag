Title: A case of spontaneous acute obstructive suppurative pancreatic ductitis associated with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.

Abstract: A 77-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to left upper abdominal pain, appetite loss and body weight loss for 1 month. Her past medical history was diabetes and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). She had no fever and physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the left upper abdomen. Blood tests showed elevated inflammatory response with normal serum pancreatic enzymes. Contrast-enhanced CT showed marked swelling of the pancreatic tail, increased peripancreatic fatty tissue density, multiple IPMNs and obscuration of the enlarged main pancreatic duct at the tail. EUS showed there was no obvious mass in the pancreas and protein plug was suspected in the main pancreatic duct. EUS-FNA was performed and pathology showed no malignancy. ERCP showed discharge of purulent pancreatic fluid from the major duodenal papilla and stenosis of the main pancreatic duct at the tail. The culture of the purulent pancreatic fluid revealed Streptococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to diagnosis of acute obstructive suppurative pancreatic ductitis (AOSPD). Endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage and antimicrobial treatment were started. The inflammatory response improved rapidly and the patient was discharged 30 days after admission. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of spontaneous AOSPD associated with IPMNs.
