Title: Onlay Pedicled Transverse Skin Flap versus One-Stage Inlay Buccal Mucosal Graft in Penile Urethroplasty: A Prospective Matched-Pair Analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare urethroplasty using onlay pedicled transverse skin flap (PSF) versus one-stage inlay buccal mucosa graft (BMG) in repair of penile urethral strictures.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective matched-pair analysis of 44 male patients receiving penile urethroplasty between June 2016 and June 2019. There were 22 patients who received PSF and 22 patients who received BMG. Matching was performed according to stricture length. Patients with strictures caused by lichen sclerosus, prior hypospadias repair, or failed prior urethroplasty were excluded. Treatment was considered successful if no recurrence was observed. Successful repair, complication rates, patients' satisfaction, and quality of life improvement were endpoints of this study.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 40.3 months. PSF and BMG showed comparable success rates (90.9% vs. 86.4%, p = 0.713). Recurrent stricture occurred in 2 patients (9.1%) who received PSF and in 3 patients (13.6%) who received BMG. Operation time was significantly longer for PSF than for BMG (108.4 min vs. 78.1 min, p = 0.01). Univariable logistic regression analysis revealed no relevant risk factors for stricture recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Early results indicate comparable success rates of PSF and BMG in penile urethroplasty. Further studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up periods are required to evaluate subtle differences between both techniques.
