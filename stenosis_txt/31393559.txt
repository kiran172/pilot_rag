Title: Therapeutic inhibition of microRNA-34a ameliorates aortic valve calcification via modulation of Notch1-Runx2 signalling.

Abstract: AIMS: Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is the most common valvular heart disease and is increased with elderly population. However, effective drug therapy has not been established yet. This study aimed to investigate the role of microRNAs (miRs) in the development of CAVS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured the expression of 10 miRs, which were reportedly involved in calcification by using human aortic valve tissue from patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with CAVS or aortic regurgitation (AR) and porcine aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) after treatment with osteogenic induction medium. We investigated whether a specific miR-inhibitor can suppress aortic valve calcification in wire injury CAVS mice model. Expression of miR-23a, miR-34a, miR-34c, miR-133a, miR-146a, and miR-155 was increased, and expression of miR-27a and miR-204 was decreased in valve tissues from CAVS compared with those from AR. Expression of Notch1 was decreased, and expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) was increased in patients with CAVS compared with those with AR. We selected miR-34a among increased miRs in porcine AVICs after osteogenic treatment, which was consistent with results from patients with CAVS. MiR-34a increased calcium deposition in AVICs compared with miR-control. Notch1 expression was decreased, and Runx2 expression was increased in miR-34a transfected AVICs compared with that in miR-control. Conversely, inhibition of miR-34a significantly attenuated these calcification signals in AVICs compared with miR-control. RNA pull-down assay revealed that miR-34a directly targeted Notch1 expression by binding to Notch1 mRNA 3' untranslated region. In wire injury CAVS mice, locked nucleic acid miR-34a inhibitor suppressed aortic velocity, calcium deposition of aortic valves, and cardiac hypertrophy, which were involved in decreased Runx2 and increased Notch1 expressions.
CONCLUSION: miR-34a plays an important role in the development of CAVS via Notch1-Runx2 signalling pathway. Inhibition of miR-34a may be the therapeutic target for CAVS.
