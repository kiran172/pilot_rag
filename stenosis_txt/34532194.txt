Title: Pseudomembranous Tracheobronchitis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Abstract: Although the incidence is declining in the western world, Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains one of the most common infectious organisms responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is the most commonly seen presentation; however, TB can affect nearly any of the body's organ systems. Endobronchial TB (EBTB) can complicate pulmonary TB or more rarely present as an isolated finding. It is essential to recognize and treat this condition promptly, as it can develop into tracheobronchial stenosis and chronic respiratory failure. Here we discuss the case of a 43-year-old female with a left upper lobe cavitary lesion who presented with weight loss, dyspnea, and hoarseness. After failing multiple courses of antibiotics, the patient underwent bronchoscopy, and pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis (PMTB) was diagnosed. Cultures of endobronchial samples grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Standard anti-TB quadruple therapy was initiated, and the patient clinically improved. Several subtypes of EBTB have been identified earlier. However, to the best of our knowledge, tuberculous PMTB has not previously been reported. This case allows us to consider the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this condition.
