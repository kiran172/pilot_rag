Title: Transsacral Canal Plasty for Decompression of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis in a Patient With Epidural Lipomatosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: CASE: A 58-year-old man presented with lumbar spinal stenosis due to epidural lipomatosis. He underwent transsacral canal plasty (TSCP), in a manner similar to epidural adhesiolysis, which can be performed under local anesthesia. His leg pain improved dramatically in the year after surgery. Furthermore, magnetic resonance images during this time show neural decompression by reduction of the amount of epidural fat.
CONCLUSION: TSCP was found not only to relieve pain but also to achieve neural decompression in this patient with spinal canal stenosis caused by lumbar epidural lipomatosis. This is the first report to demonstrate the usefulness of TSCP for spinal epidural lipomatosis.
