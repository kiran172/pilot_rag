Title: Zero upper arm hemodialysis fistulas: utopian or realistic goal?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although distal native fistula is the best first-line vascular access (VA), upper arm fistula (UAF) prevalence is increasing worldwide, except in Japan. Our previous survey on 50% of hemodialysis patients (HP) revealed a prevalence of UAF of less than 5%, which is lower than the findings published by the DOPPS 5 study in our country. We analyzed the VA prevalence on 100% of HPs from our department.
METHODS: In December 2021, we investigated the prevalence of vascular access of 1295 hemodialysis patients from 17 dialysis factories. VAs were classified according to location into distal forearm fistula (DFF), middle-proximal forearm fistula (MPFF), and UAF. The department manages VA using a Hub and Spoke model. The hub performs simple and complex VA including Graft placement, the Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) of fistulas and central stenosis, and the surgical and endovascular rescue of thrombosed or stenotic fistulas. The spokes perform mainly simple DFFs.
RESULTS: The mean age of 1295 HP (35% females and 21% diabetics) was 69 ± 12.4 years; 506 (39%) were over 75 years old. The prevalence of DFF, MPFF, UAF, GRAFT, and CVC was 63.5%, 10.1%, 3%, 0.7%, and 22.5%, respectively. Data comparison between our two surveys revealed a lower MPFF, UAF, and GRAFT prevalence and increased CVC prevalence. Patients aged 75 years or older, women, and diabetics showed a higher frequency of CVC and a lower prevalence of DFF.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings confirm the low prevalence of UAF found in our prior survey, demonstrating that UAFs can be reduced to 5% or less, as seen in Japanese experience.
