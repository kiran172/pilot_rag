Title: Etiologies of Splenic Venous Hypertension: A Review.

Abstract: Splenic venous hypertension or left-sided portal hypertension is a rare condition caused by an obstruction of the splenic vein. Usually, it presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the absence of liver disease. Etiologies can be classified based on the mechanism of development of splenic vein hypertension: compression, stenosis, inflammation, thrombosis, and surgically decreased splenic venous flow. Diagnosis is established by various imaging modalities and should be suspected in patients with gastric varices in the absence of esophageal varices, splenomegaly, or cirrhosis. The management and prognosis vary depending on the underlying etiology but generally involve reducing splenic venous pressure. The aim of this review was to summarize the etiologies of splenic venous hypertension according to the mechanism of development.
