Title: Efficacy of Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting With Concomitant Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the early and intermediate-term outcomes of patients who underwent concomitant off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHOD: Between January 2014 and June 2021, 49 patients underwent concomitant off-pump CABG and TAVR via median sternotomy (TAVRCAB group) and 143 underwent concomitant on-pump CABG and surgical aortic replacement. Of the 143 patients who underwent on-pump surgery, 80 (SAVRCAB group) were eligible for comparison. The composite event included all-cause death, heart failure rehospitalisation, repeat revascularisation, brain infarction, and repeat aortic valve replacement.
RESULTS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons' predicted risk for mortality and age were higher in the TAVRCAB group than in the SAVRCAB group (7.1% vs 3.1% [p<0.001]; 81 yrs vs 75 years [p<0.001], respectively), while the surgical time was shorter (289 min vs 352 min; p<0.001). There was no conversion to on-pump surgery in the TAVRCAB group. The postoperative maximum creatinine kinase-MB value was lower in the TAVRCAB group. There was no deep sternal wound infection or repeat revascularisation in either group. Hospital death and brain infarction developed in one patient (1.3%) each in the SAVRCAB group, but in no patients in the TAVRCAB group. The rates of freedom from the composite event were similar between the two groups during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant off-pump CABG and TAVR would be a less-invasive alternative procedure for treating intermediate or high surgical risk patients with aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease unsuitable for percutaneous coronary intervention.
