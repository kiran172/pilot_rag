Title: Carotid intraplaque neovascularization predicts atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients with carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study aimed to examine whether intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) of carotid plaques, as characterized by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), is associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) in patients with normal kidney function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated carotid IPN using CEUS in 198 consecutive patients with normal kidney function with and without ARAS. IPN was graded on the basis of the presence and location of microbubbles within each plaque (0, no visible microbubbles in the plaque; 1, moderate microbubbles confined to the shoulder and/or adventitial side of the plaque; and 2, extensive microbubbles throughout the plaque). The grades of each plaque were averaged to obtain an overall score per patient. ARAS was determined angiographically. We found that a higher CEUS-assessed carotid IPN score was associated with ARAS (Odd Ratio, OR: 7.281; 95% Confidence Interval, 95% CI: 3.246-16.336; P < 0.001). Furthermore, an IPN score >1.75 predicted severe stenosis with a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 58%. Compared with using the IPN score alone, the addition of the homocysteine (HCY) cutoff value (>22.5 mmol/L) resulted in a stronger predictive value (Area Under Curve, AUC: 0.893 vs 0.834; P < 0.001) for severe ARAS.
CONCLUSION: Carotid plaque neovascularization combined with HCY levels is predictive of severe ARAS in patients with normal kidney function. CEUS-assessed carotid IPN is clinically useful for stratification of ARAS in patients with normal kidney function.
