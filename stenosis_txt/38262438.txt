Title: Evaluation of Tubularized Incised Plate Urethroplasty with Spongioplasty-Dartosoraphy Reinforcement in Pediatric Hypospadias: A Randomized Controlled Study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: 窶サhe original description of tubularized incised plate urethroplasty (TIPU) was provided by Snodgrass in 1994. The results were significantly improved by several modifications. To decrease the incidence of complications, interposing a vascularized flap after tubularization of the neourethra is recommended. The extent to which the type of interposed tissue has a direct effect on the rate of complications and cosmetic outcomes after TIPU repair is considered the answer to the main hypothesis of this study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 窶サhis prospective controlled randomized trial was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Surgery, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt, between May 2019 and May 2023. A total of 220 patients were included in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to either group A or group B. Group A included 110 patients who underwent TIPU with spongioplasty-dartosoraphy reinforcement. The other 110 patients (group B) underwent TIPU with dorsal dartos flap interposition, without spongioplasty.
RESULTS: 窶イomplications developed in 34 of 220 patients (15.4%). In group A, complications developed in 11 of 110 patients (10.0%). In group B, complications occurred in 23 of 110 patients (20.9%). Although the fistula rate, glanular dehiscence, disruption, and meatal stenosis were not significantly different between the study groups, the skin necrosis rate was significantly lower in group A than in group B. The overall complication rate was significantly lower in group A than in group B. Also, the difference in the mean Hypospadias Objective Scoring Evaluation between the two groups was statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: 窶サIPU with spongioplasty-dartosoraphy reinforcement is an effective modification of conventional TIPU. This modification appears to reduce the rate of complications and yield better cosmetic outcomes.
