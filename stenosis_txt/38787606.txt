Title: Invasive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with phase delay for experimental atherosclerosis phenotyping.

Abstract: Distinguishing quiescent from rupture-prone atherosclerotic lesions has significant translational and clinical implications. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizes biological tissues by assessing impedance and phase delay responses to alternating current at multiple frequencies. We evaluated invasive 6-point stretchable EIS sensors over a spectrum of experimental atherosclerosis and compared results with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), molecular positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and histology. Male New Zealand White rabbits (n = 16) were placed on a high-fat diet, with or without endothelial denudation via balloon injury of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Rabbits underwent in vivo micro-PET imaging of the abdominal aorta with 68Ga-DOTATATE, 18F-NaF, and 18F-FDG, followed by invasive interrogation via IVUS and EIS. Background signal-corrected values of impedance and phase delay were determined. Abdominal aortic samples were collected for histology. Analyses were performed blindly. EIS impedance was associated with markers of plaque activity including macrophage infiltration (r = .813, p = .008) and macrophage/smooth muscle cell (SMC) ratio (r = .813, p = .026). Moreover, EIS phase delay correlated with anatomic markers of plaque burden, namely intima/media ratio (r = .883, p = .004) and %stenosis (r = .901, p = .002), similar to IVUS. 68Ga-DOTATATE correlated with intimal macrophage infiltration (r = .861, p = .003) and macrophage/SMC ratio (r = .831, p = .021), 18F-NaF with SMC infiltration (r = -.842, p = .018), and 18F-FDG correlated with macrophage/SMC ratio (r = .787, p = .036). EIS with phase delay integrates key atherosclerosis features that otherwise require multiple complementary invasive and non-invasive imaging approaches to capture. These findings indicate the potential of invasive EIS to comprehensively evaluate human coronary artery disease.
