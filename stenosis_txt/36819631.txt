Title: Comparative Clinical Analysis of Oblique Lateral Interbody Fusion at L5/S1 versus Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Interbody Fusion (MIS-TLIF) for Degenerative Lumbosacral Disorders.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Since 2015, we have performed minimally invasive oblique lateral interbody fusion (OLIF) at L5/S1 for various lumbosacral spine disorders using percutaneous pedicle screws. This study evaluated the clinical and radiologic results between OLIF at L5/S1 and minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) for single to multilevel degenerative lumbosacral disorders.
METHODS: A total of 124 patients underwent either OLIF (62 cases) or MIS-TLIF (62 cases). The applied disorders were L5 isthmic spondylolisthesis, foraminal stenosis, pseudarthrosis, adjacent segment degeneration, a combination of L4/5 and L5/S1 pathology, and others. We performed OLIF with posterior percutaneous fixation in the same lateral position. MIS-TLIF was performed with modified cortical bone trajectory screws. The operation time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), JOABPEQ effectiveness rate (%),Visual Analog Scale (VAS), fusion rate, radiologic segmental alignment, and complications were evaluated.
RESULTS: The average follow-up periods were 51 and 69 months (24-95) in the OLIF and MIS-TLIF groups, respectively. Furthermore, the average fused segments were 1.6 and 1.5 in each group, respectively. The OT and EBL per segment were 130 min and 56 mL and 100 min and 64 mL, respectively. The JOABPEQ effectiveness rate in the OLIF group demonstrated a statistically higher value in the domains of pain, low-back function, and gait than the MIS-TLIF group (P&lt;0.01). The follow-up VAS of low-back pain (LBP) and lower extremity numbness had lower values in the OLIF group (P&lt;0.05). The fusion rates were 98% and 90%, respectively. Segmental lordosis at L5/S1 was significantly larger in the OLIF group (15° vs. 11°, P&lt;0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The OLIF group demonstrated less pain as well as better low-back and gait functions at follow-up. The minimally invasive anterolateral fusion employing OLIF at L5/S1 using percutaneous screws serves as a viable and effective procedure with less residual LBP and high fusion rate.
