Title: Pseudo-Occlusion of the Internal Carotid Artery in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Clinical Outcome after Mechanical Thrombectomy.

Abstract: Pseudo-occlusion (PO) of the cervical internal carotid artery (cICA) can be caused by distal ICA occlusion. We explored the clinical impact of PO after mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Patients who underwent MT to treat distal ICA occlusions between July 2012 and March 2018 were reviewed. A cICA-PO was defined as when single phase computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a gradual decline in contrast above the level of the carotid bulb. We investigated the relationship between a cICA-PO and outcome; we also explored the association between successful recanalization and outcome. Among 71 patients, 40 (56.3%) exhibited cICA-PO and more likely to experience poor outcomes (80.0% vs. 25.8%, P < 0.001), hemorrhagic transformation (32.5% vs. 9.6%, P = 0.01), and a lower rate of successful recanalization (65.0% vs. 90.3%, P = 0.014) than the non-PO group. In binary logistic regression, a cICA-PO was independently associated with a poor outcome (odds ratio, 4.278; 95% CI, 1.080-33.006; P = 0.045). In the cICA-PO group, all patients who failed recanalization (n = 15) experienced poor outcomes, as did 69.2% of patients in whom recanalization was successful (P = 0.018). cICA-POs are common and have worse outcomes than non-PO patients. Patients with cICA-POs are more likely to exhibit poor outcomes after MT, particularly when recanalization fails.
