Title: What you need to know about: arterial cerebrovascular syndromes caused by static or dynamic musculoskeletal compression.

Abstract: Compressive syndromes of the cervical arteries caused by musculoskeletal structures include bow hunter's syndrome, beauty parlour stroke syndrome, carotid compression by the hyoid bone, carotid compression by the digastric muscle and Eagle syndrome. They are a rare but increasingly recognised group of syndromes, so a high level of suspicion is needed so the diagnosis is not missed. The diagnosis is typically based on a combination of clinical history and advanced imaging investigations. Compression of the arteries may be static (only provoked by compression) or dynamic (exaggerated by movement), and this should be considered when selecting imaging studies. Symptoms resulting from vertebrobasilar insufficiency or ischaemia of areas supplied by the internal carotid artery are caused by compression of the vertebral artery and the internal carotid artery respectively. Surgical procedures are the preferred treatment for most of these syndromes.
