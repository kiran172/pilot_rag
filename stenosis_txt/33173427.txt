Title: IL-21 promotes osteoblastic differentiation of human valvular interstitial cells through the JAK3/STAT3 pathway.

Abstract: Objectives: This study amied to whether IL-21 promotes osteoblast transdifferentiation of cultured human Valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Methods: We first confirmed that IL-21 alters gene expression between CAVD aortic valve tissue and normal samples by immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and western blotting. VICs were cultured and treated with IL-21. Gene and protein expression levels of the osteoblastic markers ALP and Runx2, which can be blocked by specific JAK3 inhibitors and/or siRNA of STAT3, were measured. Results: IL-21 expression was upregulated in calcified aortic valves and promotes osteogenic differentiation of human VICs. IL-21 accelerated VIC calcification through the JAK3/STAT3 pathway. Conclusion: Our data suggest that IL-21 is a key factor in valve calcification and a promising candidate for targeted therapeutics for CAVD.
