Title: GOLDIC therapy in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis: randomized, controlled trial.

Abstract: Aim: Comparison of the efficacy of conservative treatment methods: epidural GOLDIC serum, epidural steroid injections, manual therapy. Materials &amp; methods: A randomized, controlled trial. Three groups, each containing 30 patients. GOLDIC or steroid injections (dexamethasone) epiduralÂ versus manual therapy. Assessment: initial assessment and 4 (T1), 12 (T2) and 24 (T3) weeks after the last intervention. Primary outcomes: Pain intensity in numeric rating scale, Oswestry disability index, Zurich claudication questionnaire, EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Results: GOLDIC has shown the highest mean differences and number of cases with minimal important difference among groups for every primary outcome. Conclusion: GOLDIC therapy could be a new option for the nonoperative, symptomatic treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and is not inferior to epidural steroid injections and manual therapy.
