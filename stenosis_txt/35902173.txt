Title: Effects of Cyproheptadine on Mitral Valve Remodeling and Regurgitation After Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) is primarily caused by left ventricle deformation, but leaflet thickening with fibrotic changes are also observed in the valve. Increased levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; ie, serotonin) are described after myocardial infarction (MI); 5-HT can induce valve fibrosis through the 5-HT type 2B receptor (5-HT2BR).
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to test the hypothesis that post-MI treatment with cyproheptadine (5-HT2BR antagonist) can prevent ischemic MR by reducing the effect of serotonin on mitral biology.
METHODS: Thirty-six sheep were divided into 2 groups: inferior MI and inferior MI treated with cyproheptadine (0.5 mg/kg/d). Animals were followed for 90 days. Blood 5-HT, infarct size, left ventricular volume and function, MR fraction and mitral leaflet size were assessed. In a complementary in vitro study, valvular interstitial cells were exposed to pre-MI and post-MI serum collected from the experimental animals.
RESULTS: Increased 5-HT levels were observed after MI in nontreated animals, but not in the group treated with cyproheptadine. Infarct size was similar in both groups (11 ± 3 g vs 9 ± 5 g; P = 0.414). At 90 days, MR fraction was 16% ± 7% in the MI group vs 2% ± 6% in the cyproheptadine group (P = 0.0001). The increase in leaflet size following MI was larger in the cyproheptadine group (+40% ± 9% vs +22% ± 12%; P = 0.001). Mitral interstitial cells overexpressed extracellular matrix genes when treated with post-MI serum, but not when exposed to post-MI serum collected from treated animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Cyproheptadine given after inferior MI reduces post-MI 5-HT levels, prevents valvular fibrotic remodeling, is associated with larger increase in mitral valve size and less MR.
