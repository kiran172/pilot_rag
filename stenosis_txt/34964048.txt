Title: Virtual reality-guided aortic valve leaflet reconstruction for type 0 bicuspid aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Although virtual reality (VR) techniques that enable visualizing a patient's anatomy stereoscopically have been developed recently, these techniques are still scarcely used in clinical settings, and their benefits remain uncertain. Herein, we demonstrate how VR preoperative planning facilitated the efficiency of a complex surgical procedure. A 53-year-old male was diagnosed as type 0 bicuspid aortic stenosis. To take haemodynamical advantage and to lower valve-related reoperation risks, an aortic valve reconstruction was scheduled; however, anatomical tri-leaflet neocuspidalization for type 0 bicuspid aortic root is particularly challenging. To optimize the procedure, VR preoperative planning was applied to create a blueprint of the aortic root rearrangement and suture line design. This allowed for a competent aortic valve to be reconstructed speedily, resulting in an excellent postoperative course.
