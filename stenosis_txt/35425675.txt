Title: Relationship Between High-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol and Red Cell Distribution Width in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: Background A high red cell distribution width (RDW), which indicates ongoing inflammation, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent studies have suggested that HDL-C possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may explain its anti-atherogenic properties. This study aims to determine the relationship between HDL-C levels and RDW in patients with CAD. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was performed on 120 patients with CAD from July 2020 to June 2021 in the Hematology Department of Chughtai Lab Lahore. Patients were graded according to the degree of coronary artery stenosis as follows: Grade 1,30%-50%; Grade 2, 51%-70%; and Grade 3,>70%. The HDL-C level was measured from venous blood samples by a fully automated Abbot Alinity analyzer. The RDW was measured by Sysmex XN-5000. The sample size was calculated using the Select Statistics calculator. The mean RDW and HDL-C of the patients were calculated, and correlation analyses were performed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results The HDL-C level was inversely related to the RDW. Of the 120 patients, 38, 44, and 38 had Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 stenosis, respectively. The mean HDL-C level and RDW were 30.58 ±3.77 mg/dL and 16.04% ±1.66%, respectively. The value of r was -0.8622 (strongly negative). Data were stratified based on the degree of stenosis. The values of r in Grades 1, 2, and 3 were -0.43 (moderately negative), -0.604 (moderately negative), and -0.27 (weakly negative), respectively. Conclusion The RDW can be used as an additional marker to determine the disease status in CAD patients.
