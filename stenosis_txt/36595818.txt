Title: Prognostic and therapeutic implication of m6A methylation in Crohn disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation has been reported to participate in inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn disease [CD]). However, the prognostic and therapeutic implication of m6A methylation modification in CD is still unclear.
METHODS: Genomic information of CD patients was integrated to assess disease-related m6A regulators, and difference and correlation analyses of m6A regulators were explored by using the R packages. Next, CD patients were classified by the expression of differential and intersecting genes in m6A regulators, and difference and correlation analyses were conducted among immune infiltration and therapeutic responses. Finally, colon tissue resected from patients with CD were assessed to verify expression of Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) and METTL14 from these m6A regulators.
RESULTS: We identified 23 m6A regulators in CD patients. Difference analysis of these regulators showed that expression of METTL14, WTAP, RBM15 and YTHDF2/3 was upregulated in the treatment group compared with the control group, with expression of METTL3, YTHDF1, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein, HNRNPA2B1, IGF2BP1 and fat mass and obesity-associated protein downregulated. Moreover, RBM15, WTAP, leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein, YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 were considered the characteristic genes of CD in m6A regulators. In addition, we identified 4 intersection genes of 3 m6A cluster patterns. Based on the expression of these intersection genes, difference analysis among m6A regulators indicated that the expression of 8 m6A regulators had statistical differences among the 3 geneCluster patterns. Assays of colon tissues from CD patients showed that expression of WTAP and METTL14 were higher in areas of stenosis than non-stenosis.
CONCLUSION: m6A methylation modification might affect disease risk, immune infiltration and therapeutic responses in CD. Evaluating the expression of m6A regulators might provide insight into the prediction of disease prognosis and therapeutic responses.
