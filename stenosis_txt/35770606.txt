Title: Transfemoral Flow-Reversal for Carotid Artery Stenting with Balloon Guide Catheter: Proof of Concept with Robotic Transcranial Doppler.

Abstract: In this video, we demonstrate our technique for transfemoral carotid artery stenting (CAS) with flow-reversal through a Walrus balloon guide catheter (BGC) using robotic transcranial Doppler (rTCD) monitoring. Before crossing the plaque for distal filter placement and/or angioplasty, the BGC is inflated and the three-way stopcock opened, allowing back-bleeding. Immediately, the rTCD shows a change in blood-flow direction, indicating flow-reversal, which likely occurs due to a passive pressure gradient between the intracranial compartment and the atmospheric pressure. Then, the filter is placed with reduced risk of displacing plaque fragments, and angioplasty and stenting are performed with dual protection afforded by the BGC and filter. This technique may confer greater safety for CAS. Although in this case rTCD was used for proof of concept, it could also be used as a tool to monitor embolic load during CAS procedures.
