Title: Tetrahydropyrimidines, ZL-5015 Alleviated Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Acute Pneumonia in Rats by Activating the NRF-2/HO-1 Pathway.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Acute pneumonia is a severe inflammatory disease of the respiratory system. Drugs used to treat acute pneumonia often have strong side effects. Recent studies have shown that tetrahydropyrimidines, ZL-5015 has anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects. However, whether ZL-5015 can relieve symptoms of acute pneumonia is unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we used lipo-polysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate SD rats to simulate conditions of acute pneumonia. Diverse doses of ZL-5015 were used for treatment of these rats. After the rates were sacrificed, serum, lung tissue, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected for the next study. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining then was used to detect pathologic changes in lung tissues. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to assess levels of inflammatory factors in serum. Commercial kits were used to assess levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. RESULTS Treatment of ZL-5015 relieved stenosis of the alveolar space and pulmonary edema. Furthermore, levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-1ÃŸ and IL-18) in the lung tissues and serum were downregulated after treatment with ZL-5015. Production of ROS also was suppressed after application of ZL-5015. Moreover, inhibition of expression of NRF-2 and HO-1 was relieved after treatment with ZL-5015. The therapeutic effect of ZL-5015 showed a dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS ZL-5015 alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury and oxidative damage by activating the NRF-2/HO-1 pathway.
