Title: Rastelli conduit change with the Nuss procedure for relieving compression of extracardiac conduit.

Abstract: When Rastelli conduit stenosis occurs concurrently with pectus excavatum, redo Rastelli operation alone may not be sufficient to solve the situation. Therefore, we performed 2 procedures simultaneously: right ventricle to pulmonary artery extracardiac conduit change and the Nuss procedure. The Nuss bar was removed after 4â€‰years.
