Title: Esophageal dilation with EsoFLIP is faster than CRE balloon dilation combined with EndoFLIP in children.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloon dilators are traditionally used to dilate esophageal strictures during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). EndoFLIP is a diagnostic tool used during an EGD to measure important parameters of the gastrointestinal lumen, capable of assessing treatment before and after dilation. EsoFLIP is a related device that combines a balloon dilator with high-resolution impedance planimetry to provide some of the luminal parameters in real time during dilation. We sought to compare procedure time, fluoroscopy time, and safety profile of esophageal dilation using either CRE balloon dilation combined with EndoFLIP (E + CRE) versus EsoFLIP alone.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective review was performed to identify patients ≤ 21 years of age who underwent an EGD with biopsy and esophageal stricture dilation using E + CRE or EsoFLIP between October 2017 and May 2022.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine EGDs with esophageal stricture dilation were performed in 23 patients (19 E + CRE and 10 EsoFLIP). The two groups did not differ in age, gender, race, chief complaint, type of esophageal stricture, or history of prior gastrointestinal procedures (all p > 0.05). The most common medical history in the E + CRE and EsoFLIP groups were eosinophilic esophagitis and epidermolysis bullosa, respectively. Median procedures times were shorter in the EsoFLIP cohort compared to E + CRE balloon dilation (40.5 min [IQR 23-57 min] for the EsoFLIP group; 64 min [IQR 51-77 min] for the E + CRE group; p < 0.01). Median fluoroscopy times were also shorter for patients who underwent EsoFLIP (0.16 min [IQR 0-0.30 min] for EsoFLIP dilation; 0.30 min [IQR 0.23-0.55] for the E + CRE group; p = 0.003). There were no complications or unplanned hospitalizations in either group.
CONCLUSION: EsoFLIP dilation of esophageal strictures was faster and required less fluoroscopy than CRE balloon dilation combined with EndoFLIP in children, while being equally as safe. Prospective studies are needed to further compare the two modalities.
