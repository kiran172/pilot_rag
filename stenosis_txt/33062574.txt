Title: A Case of Suspected Metallic Embolism after Carotid Artery Stenting.

Abstract: A case in which metallic embolism was suspected after carotid artery stenting (CAS) is described. A 79-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of a severe stenosis of the left cervical internal carotid artery (ICA). Carotid ultrasound revealed that the plaque was fibrous and was accompanied with partial calcification. The carotid stenosis was treated by CAS. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken in the following day of the CAS demonstrated that a new abnormal spot at the left frontal lobe. The spot appeared as a signal void on T1, T2, diffusion, susceptibility-weighted image (SWI), and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image, and was surrounded by a high-signal halo on T2 and diffusion-weighted images (DWIs). The spot also demonstrated "blooming" appearance on SWIs. Despite the lesion she was asymptomatic all through the postoperative course, and she left our hospital on postoperative day 6. Follow-up MRI obtained 27 months after the CAS demonstrated that the lesion remained at the left frontal lobe without any signal changes. The patient remained asymptomatic at the last follow-up. Considering the location of the new abnormal spot (in the vascular territory of the catheterized vessel), these imaging characteristics and asymptomatic clinical course, the spot likely suggested metallic embolism. This is the first case in which the metallic embolism was suspected after CAS.
