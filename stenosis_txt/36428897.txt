Title: Distinctive Morphological Patterns of Complicated Coronary Plaques in Acute Coronary Syndromes: Insights from an Optical Coherence Tomography Study.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an ideal imaging technique for assessing culprit coronary plaque anatomy. We investigated the morphological features and mechanisms leading to plaque complication in a single-center observational retrospective study on 70 consecutive patients with an established diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent OCT imaging after coronary angiography. Three prominent morphological entities were identified. Type I or intimal discontinuity, which was found to be the most common mechanism leading to ACS and was seen in 35 patients (50%), was associated with thrombus (68.6%; p = 0.001), mostly affected the proximal plaque segment (60%; p = 0.009), and had no distinctive underlying plaque features. Type II, a significant stenosis with vulnerability features (inflammation in 16 patients, 84.2%; thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) in 10 patients, 52.6%) and a strong association with lipid-rich plaques (94.7%; p = 0.002), was observed in 19 patients (27.1%). Type III, a protrusive calcified nodule, which was found to be the dominant morphological pattern in 16 patients (22.9%), was found in longer plaques (20.8 mm vs. 16.8 mm ID vs. 12.4 mm SS; p = 0.04) and correlated well with TCFA (93.8%; p = 0.02) and inflammation (81.3%). These results emphasize the existence of a wide spectrum of coronary morphological patterns related to ACS.
