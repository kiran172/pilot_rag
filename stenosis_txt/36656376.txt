Title: Prognostic impact and diagnostic value of invasively derived hemodynamic measures in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ejection time (ET), acceleration time (AT) and time between left ventricular and aortic systolic pressure peaks (T-LVAo) might be of diagnostic and prognostic use in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
AIM: We aimed to assess the diagnostic value and prognostic impact of invasively measured ET, AT, and T-LVAo in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 1274 patients received invasive measurement of ET, AT and T-LVAo prior to TAVI. Anatomic AS severity was assessed by CT-derived aortic valve calcification density (AVC<sub>d</sub>). Impact on all-cause mortality was retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression, T-LVAo showed the strongest correlation with AVC<sub>d</sub>. No prognostic impact of T-LVAo was found according to uni- and multivariable analyses. In contrast, using an individual C-statistic derived cutoff (C<sub>D</sub>), patients with ET or AT ≥ C<sub>D</sub> showed lower mortality rates compared to patients with ET or AT &lt; C<sub>D</sub> (1-year mortality: ET ≥ vs. &lt; C<sub>D</sub>: 15.01vs. 33.1%, AT ≥ vs &lt; C<sub>D</sub> 16.3 vs. 26.5%, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, multivariable analysis identified ET ≥ C<sub>D</sub> (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.43-0.87; p &lt; 0.007]) to be associated with beneficial outcome after TAVI, independent from clinical risk factors and echocardiography-derived parameters.
CONCLUSION: Among the studied hemodynamic parameters T-LVAo provides the highest diagnostic value, whereas ET is an outcome predictor beyond clinical risk factors and echocardiographic parameters in AS patients following TAVI. These parameters could be of considerable use in diagnostic evaluation and risk assessment of patients scheduled for TAVI. T-LVAo (yellow): defined as time between left ventricular and aortic systolic pressure peaks. ET (green): Ejection Time defined as time from the start to flow end. AT (orange): Acceleration time defined as time from the start to the peak flow. AOP: aortic pressure, AVC: aortic valve calcification, CI: confidence interval, HGAS: high-gradient aortic stenosis, LGAS: low-gradient aortic stenosis, LVP: left ventricular pressure, SD: standard deviation.
