Title: [New progress in screening and treatment of carotid atherosclerotic stenosis].

Abstract: Carotid atherosclerotic plaque is the main cause of ischemic stroke. In recent years, with the continuous innovation of novel imaging technologies, numerous classification standards for carotid plaques provide more powerful evidence for the features of carotid plaques and perioperative vascular assessment, as well as the reference for surgeons in choosing therapeutic decisions. Ultrasound is the preferred non-invasive and convenient screening tool for carotid stenosis. Invasive examinations such as CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are suitable for carotid stenosis patients to determine the plaque composition and stability, which can guide surgical decision-making and help to prevent serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events. Advances in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis have focused on the improvement and innovation of vascular interventional devices and surgical procedures, including double-layer stents, coated stents and transcarotid artery revascularization. As technology continues to evolve, molecular imaging and more minimally invasive screening as well as therapies will be the way forward.
