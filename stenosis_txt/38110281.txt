Title: [Application of a new-type of defecator in the treatment of rectal fecal impaction].

Abstract: Objective: This study aimed to investigate the viability and safety of a novel defecator in managing rectal fecal impaction. Methods: In a descriptive case series, this new defecator was administered to constipated individuals among the ages of 18 and 80 years who met the diagnostic criteria for rectal fecal impaction and were identified with acute rectal fecal impaction through CT scans. The contraindications for this defecator included: (1) Anal stenosis, acute intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation; (2) Concomitant rectal malignant tumors; (3) Coagulation dysfunction, low platelet counts, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other bleeding risks; (4) Patients with severe underlying conditions affecting the heart, brain, lungs, or other systems; (5) Individuals with mental health disorders. Based on these criteria, clinical data from 42 patients with rectal fecal impaction who underwent treatment with the new defecator at Deyang People's Hospital between July 2020 and April 2023 were retrospectively analyzed.The defecator comprises three components: a head, a spiral rod, and a handle, constructed from disposable stainless steel wire. The treatment procedure involves the following steps: The patient assumes a flexed, supine position on their left side with their buttocks slightly protruding from the bed's edge. A transparent sealing bag is affixed to the buttocks, centered around the anus. With gloved hands inserted through the bag's entrance, a cotton ball soaked in liquid paraffin lubricates the anal canal and the head of the defecator's spiral rod. The defecator is then slowly rotated and inserted into the anus, with careful attention to any changes in resistance. Once the spiral rod is fully inserted, the patient is instructed to inhale and defecate while the defecator is slowly withdrawn, carrying the dislodged fecal matter, and depositing it into the sealed bag. This operation is repeated 2 to 3 times, followed by the injection of either 100 ml of 36Â°C normal saline or 60 ml of liquid paraffin into the rectum. After a 5 to 8-minute wait, the patient assumes a squatting position to expel any remaining feces from the rectum. The study assessed the operation time, single treatment success rate, pain levels during treatment, and the occurrence of complications. Results: All 42 patients successfully underwent treatment with the new defecator device, achieving a single treatment success rate of 100%. The average operation time was 11.0 minutes (range: 9.0 to 13.3 minutes). During treatment, 20 cases (47.6%) reported moderate to severe anal pain, with 1 case (2.4%) experiencing anal fissure bleeding, and 6 cases (14.3%) reporting discomfort such as palpitations and sweating. No serious complications, including rectal perforation, were observed in any case. Conclusion: The new defecator device demonstrates ease of use and safety, making it a feasible option for treating acute rectal fecal impaction.
