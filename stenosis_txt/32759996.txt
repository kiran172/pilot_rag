Title: Monitoring and long-term management of giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica.

Abstract: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common type of primary vasculitis in Western countries. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the second most common inflammatory rheumatic disease of the elderly after rheumatoid arthritis. Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of treatment for GCA and PMR, which are interrelated diseases. Glucocorticoids are effective, but adverse effects occur in a high proportion of patients. Careful use of glucocorticoids and the application of preventive strategies can minimize these adverse effects. Possible long-term complications of GCA include aneurysm and stenosis of vessels, even in patients with apparently clinically inactive disease; acute blindness is rare during glucocorticoid treatment. In PMR, whether subclinical chronic inflammation can lead to long-term damage is less clear. Management of both GCA and PMR is hampered by the lack of universally accepted definitions of remission and other disease states, such as low disease activity or vessel damage without active disease. In this Review, we outline current evidence on the monitoring and long-term management of patients with GCA and PMR, including the tapering of treatment.
