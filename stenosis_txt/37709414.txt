Title: Management of Benign Biliary Stricture in Chronic Pancreatitis.

Abstract: Endoscopic therapy is the first line of management for chronic pancreatitis (CP)-related benign biliary strictures. Multiple plastic stents (MPS) exchanged at regular intervals and temporary placement of fully covered self-expanding metal stents (FCSEMS) are preferred modalities of endotherapy. FCSEMS placement is non-inferior to MPS and requires fewer sessions of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography than MPS placement. The presence of head calcifications, severe CP, and length of stricture are predictors of failure or recurrence after endotherapy. Failure of endotherapy should be considered after 1Â year when surgery should be considered.
