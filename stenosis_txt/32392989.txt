Title: [On-pump total arterial revascularization in coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular dysfunction: a multi-center retrospective study].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of on-pump total arterial revascularization with bilateral radial artery (BRA) and left internal mammary artery (LIMA) as conduits in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). Methods: All the perioperative medical records and follow-up results of coronary artery disease patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% undergoing CABG from 24 heart centers of 15 provinces and autonomous regions in China between July 2015 and December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 87 consecutive patients (55 males and 32 females) underwent on-pump CABG with BRA and LIMA, with a mean age of (57.5±9.1) years old. There were 22 patients complicated with primary hypertension, 12 with diabetes mellitus, 8 with peripheral vascular disease, 7 with chronic obstructive lung disease, 12 with mild renal injury and 3 with partial aortic calcification. There were 43 cases with in-stent stenosis, and 21 had left main disease. The mean LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was (35.5±7.3)% and (65.5±2.6) mm, respectively. The mean graft number, aortic cross-clamp time and cardiopulmonary bypass duration was 3.2±0.9, (90.5±22.7) min and (113.4±19.2) min, respectively. There were 32 mitral and 9 aortic valve replacements, and 5 tricuspid annuloplasties. Prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pumps were implanted in 27 patients. There were 2 operative deaths from acute heart failure. After surgery, there were 15 cases of atrial fibrillation, 1 case of acute kidney injury, 1 case of acute myocardial infarction, and 1 cases of stroke. All the patients fulfilled the follow-up, with a mean time of (39.5±7.7) months. At 3 months after surgery, LVEDD was decreased and LVEF was improved significantly compared with pre-operative indicators [(53.0±1.5) mm vs (65.5±2.6) mm, t=9.51 P=0.02; (45.2±3.3)% vs (35.5±7.3)%, t=13.79, P=0.001]. No major cardiac events were reported during the follow-up. At (30.5±7.4) months after surgery, 62.4% of patients (53/85) underwent coronary CT angiography examination, and the results indicated that the graft patency was 98.8%, with only one case of RA occlusion occurred. Conclusion: In selected patients of LVD, on-pump total arterial revascularization with BRA and LIMA conduits was proved to be safe and effective.
