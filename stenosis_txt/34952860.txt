Title: Aortic stenosis in chronic kidney disease: challenges in diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly common and is associated with development and rapid progression of aortic stenosis (AS). Patients with AS and CKD have higher mortality rates than those with AS of similar severity and normal kidney function. The diagnosis of severe AS in patients with CKD is often challenging due to alterations in haemodynamics and heart structure, and integration of data from multiple imaging modalities may be required. When indicated, the definitive treatment for severe AS is aortic valve replacement. Patients with CKD are candidates for bioprosthetic valve replacement (surgical or transcatheter aortic valve implantation) or mechanical valve replacement. However, for patients with CKD, lifetime management is complex, as patients with CKD have a higher competing risk of bioprosthetic structural valve deterioration, bleeding in the setting of systemic anticoagulation and mortality related to CKD itself. The involvement of a heart-kidney multidisciplinary team in the care of patients with CKD and severe AS is ideal to navigate the complexities of diagnosis and management decisions.
