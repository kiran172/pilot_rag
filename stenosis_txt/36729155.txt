Title: Immediate extubation after single-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction for subglottic stenosis in children.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and clarify the appropriate indications for extubation immediately after single-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction (SS-LTR) in pediatric subglottic stenosis (SGS).
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed from July 2017 to July 2022. All patients underwent SS-LTR with anterior costal cartilage graft. Information such as demographics, comorbidities, history of intubation or tracheostomy, Classification and grading of airway stenosis, the operation-specific decannulation rate and overall decannulation rate were analyzed.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with simple SGS were identified. The median age at SS-LTR was 19 months (IQR = 18.5 months). Fourteen patients (63.6%) were intubated prior to the presentation of symptoms. Fourteen patients (63.6%) required preoperative tracheostomy to maintain a secure airway. Eight patients (36.4%) had congenital SGS, 10 patients (45.5%) had acquired SGS, and 4 patients (18.2%) had mixed SGS. Three patients had Grade II stenosis. Nineteen patients had Grade III stenosis. Comorbidities were found in 10 patients (45.5%). Major comorbidities were pneumonia. Congenital airway anomalies were found in 6 patients (27.3%). After anesthesia, all 22 patients were successfully extubated and returned to the general ward. Twenty patients had a satisfactory airway after SS-LTR. Two patients required reintubation or tracheostomy after operation. Operation-specific decannulation rate was 90.9%. The overall decannulation rate is 100%.
CONCLUSION: SS-LTR with anterior costal cartilage graft is an effective method to treat simple SGS ranging from Grades I to III in children. Extubation immediately after surgery is safe and feasible.
