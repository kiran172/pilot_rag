Title: Emergent Large Vessel Occlusion due to Intracranial Stenosis: Identification, Management, Challenges, and Future Directions.

Abstract: This comprehensive literature review focuses on acute stroke related to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS), with an emphasis on ICAS-large vessel occlusion. ICAS is the leading cause of stroke globally, with high recurrence risk, especially in Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations. Various risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and advanced age lead to ICAS, which in turn results in stroke through different mechanisms. Recurrent stroke risk in patients with ICAS with hemodynamic failure is particularly high, even with aggressive medical management. Developments in advanced imaging have improved our understanding of ICAS and ability to identify high-risk patients who could benefit from intervention. Herein, we focus on current management strategies for ICAS-large vessel occlusion discussed, including the use of perfusion imaging, endovascular therapy, and stenting. In addition, we focus on strategies that aim at identifying subjects at higher risk for early recurrent risk who could benefit from early endovascular intervention The review underscores the need for further research to optimize ICAS-large vessel occlusion treatment strategies, a traditionally understudied topic.
