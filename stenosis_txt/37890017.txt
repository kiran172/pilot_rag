Title: A novel high-risk aortic root anatomy for right coronary artery occlusion during TAVI.

Abstract: Acute coronary occlusion during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a rare but potentially lethal complication. Main mechanisms are sinus insufficiency or sinus sequestration with well-described risk factors. We present two cases of acute right coronary artery occlusion during TAVI with a self-expanding valve in the absence of classical risk factors and propose a novel mechanism.
