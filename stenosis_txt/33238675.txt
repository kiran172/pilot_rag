Title: [Effect of posterior lumbar fusion on the degeneration of adjacent segments using cortical bone trajectory screw fixation].

Abstract: Objective: To compare the degenerative changes of adjacent segments after posterior lumbar fusion surgery using cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screws and pedicle screws (PS) in lumbar spinal degenerative disease. Methods: According to certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, prospective non-randomized study on cases of the single-segment lumbar spinal fusion surgery using cortical bone trajectory screws fixation and pedicle screws fixation in Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital from January 2015 to February 2016 was performed. The intervertebral space height (ISH), foramen height (FH), foramen width (FW), cephalad adjacent segment (CAS) and intervertebral disc degeneration grades at MRI scans were measured before surgery and during follow-up. Clinical symptoms were evaluated by Oswestry Dysfunction Index (ODI) score and pain visual analogue scale (VAS) before and during the follow-up. Radiologic adjacent segment degeneration (R-ASD) and symptomatic adjacent segment disease (S-ASD) patients were diagnosed during the follow-up. Paired sample t test was performed when data were compared before surgery and during follow-up. Results: A total of 69 patients were included in the study, 33 in the CBT group (male/female, 15/18), with an average age of (65±11) years, and 36 in the PS group (male/female, 17/19), with an average age of (64±10) years. The follow-up time was no less than 36 months. At the last follow-up, the ISH of the adjacent segments in the CBT group were not statistically different from that before surgery; the ISH of the adjacent segments in the PS group were significantly reduced compared with that before surgery (t=6.78, P&lt;0.05). The loss of ISH, FH, and FW in the adjacent segments in the CBT group were smaller than those in the PS group, and the differences were statistically significant. During follow-up, 4 cases (12.1%) of R-ASD and no S-ASD were found in the CBT group, while 12 cases (33.3%) of R-ASD appeared in the PS group, which was significantly higher than that in the CBT group (χ(2)=4.35, P=0.04). According to MRI, the adjacent discs of PS group had significantly more severe degeneration at the last follow-up than the CBT group (Z=-2.14, P=0.03). Conclusions: Compared with the PS fixation fusion, the CBT screw fixation can effectively reduce the occurrence of adjacent segment degeneration.
