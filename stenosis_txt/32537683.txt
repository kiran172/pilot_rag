Title: Coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (CARTO) for the treatment of gastric varices via a single access route using steerable microcatheter: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (CARTO) is a modified balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) technique using coils instead of an indwelling balloon. A method involving two microcatheter systems forming a double access route has been reported. We report a case of CARTO using a steerable microcatheter to successfully treat gastric varices (GV).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old man was admitted for treatment of intractable GV due to liver cirrhosis. The GV were drained mainly into the left inferior phrenic vein, not the usual gastrorenal shunt. Introducing the balloon catheter to the left inferior phrenic vein was difficult due to mild stenosis between the inferior vena cava and inferior phrenic vein and the shunt angle. A CARTO technique was performed with 5% ethanolamine oleate with iopamidol from a single access route by inverting the steerable microcatheter distal to the coil placement site.
CONCLUSION: CARTO has advantages in cases where performing BRTO is difficult. Using a steerable microcatheter simplifies the procedure by reducing the required access routes in CARTO.
