Title: [Ring-sling complex association with pig bronchus: a pediatric case report].

Abstract: The ring-sling complex is an association between pulmonary artery sling and congenital tracheal stenosis. Pulmonary artery sling is a rare form of vascular ring in congenital heart disease. The clinical case of a child with inspiratory laryngeal stridor associated with respiratory distress is presented, evaluated in another center where respiratory endoscopy was performed, observing extrinsic tracheal compression. Given the clinical suspicion of a vascular ring, CT angiography was requested, confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary artery sling. He was referred to our hospital and during the surgical intervention a new respiratory endoscopy and tracheobronchography were performed, reaching the diagnosis of congenital tracheal stenosis, right accessory bronchus (pig bronchus) and complete vascular rings, both repaired in the same surgical act.
