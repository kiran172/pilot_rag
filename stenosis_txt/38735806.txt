Title: Can Anorectal Stenosis be Managed With Dilations Alone? A PCPLC Review.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Congenital anorectal stenosis is managed by dilations or operative repair. Recent studies now propose use of dilations as the primary treatment modality to potentially defer or eliminate the need for surgical repair. We aim to characterize the management and outcomes of these patients via a multi-institutional review using the Pediatric Colorectal and Pelvic Learning Consortium (PCPLC) registry.
METHODS: A retrospective database review was performed using the PCPLC registry. The patients were evaluated for demographics, co-morbidities, diagnostic work-up, surgical intervention, current bowel management, and complications.
RESULTS: 64 patients with anal or rectal stenosis were identified (57 anal, 7 rectal) from a total of 14 hospital centers. 59.6% (anal) and 42.9% (rectal) were male. The median age was 3.2 (anal) and 1.9 years (rectal). 11 patients with anal stenosis also had Currarino Syndrome with 10 of the 11 patients diagnosed with a presacral mass compared to only one rectal stenosis with Currarino Syndrome and a presacral mass. 13 patients (22.8%, anal) and one (14.3%, rectal) underwent surgical correction. Nine patients (8 anal, 1 rectal) underwent PSARP. Other procedures performed were cutback anoplasty and anterior anorectoplasty. The median age at repair was 8.4 months (anal) and 10 days old (rectal). One patient had a wound complication in the anal stenosis group. Bowel management at last visit showed little differences between groups or treatment approach.
CONCLUSION: The PCPLC registry demonstrated that these patients can often be managed successfully with dilations alone. PSARP is the most common surgical repair chosen for those who undergo surgical repair.
