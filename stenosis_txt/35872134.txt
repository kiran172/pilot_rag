Title: Anterior Thoracic Diskectomy and Fusion: Surgical Technique and Anatomic Considerations.

Abstract: Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a rare condition that can lead to progressive spinal cord compression.1 Currently, surgical decompression remains the optimal treatment in symptomatic patients.2,3 In cases with significant thoracic stenosis and concern for ventral erosion of the dura, an anterior approach may be necessary for direct decompression.4 In Video 1, we demonstrate the successful application of a multidisciplinary approach for surgical resection of a large OPLL lesion located at the T2-3 disk space. A 37-year-old female with medical history significant for rickets presented a year after a fall with bilateral lower extremity paraparesis and saddle anesthesia. Exposure consisted of a manubrial window, followed by thoracic diskectomy and fusion with drilling of the calcified posterior longitudinal ligament. Major steps within this video include 1) a summary of the patient presentation and preoperative imaging, 2) exposure of thoracic vertebrae via a manubrial window approach, 3) thoracic diskectomy and fusion with take-down of calcified posterior longitudinal ligament, and 4) a review of the postoperative imaging. The patient tolerated the procedure well with immediate relief of symptoms and was subsequently discharged on postoperative day 1 with no complications. This operative video illustrates the technical steps and capabilities of an anterior approach, achieving near-complete gross total resection of an OPLL lesion using a multidisciplinary approach. The patient consented to this procedure.
