Title: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or stenting for the treatment of basilar artery stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Basilar artery stenosis (BAS) carries high morbidity and mortality, with variable outcomes after endovascular treatments. We systematically reviewed the literature on percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or stenting (PTAS) for BAS.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web-of-Science, Scopus, and Cochrane were searched upon the PRISMA guidelines to include prospective/retrospective cohort studies describing PTAS for BAS. Pooled rates of intervention-related complications and outcomes were analyzed with random-effect model meta-analyses.
RESULTS: We included 25 retrospective cohort studies comprising 1016 patients. All patients were symptomatic, presenting with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke. BAS frequently involved the middle basilar artery (51.4%), mostly classified as Mori-B (57.4%). PTAS for BAS was indicated in severe (≥ 50-70%), symptomatic BAS refractory to dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients underwent angioplasty (95.5%) and/or stenting (92.2%), preferably using Wingspan or Apollo stents. Median baseline BAS was 81% (range, 53-99%), while median post-intervention BAS was 13% (0-75%). Actuarial rates of successful intervention and "good" final outcome were 100% (95% CI: 100-100%) and 89% (95% CI: 85-93%). Intervention-related recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 85 patients (8.3%) with actuarial rates of 5% (95% CI: 4-7%), differentiated into perforator (5.4%), in-stent (2.6%), and embolic (0.4%). Actuarial rates of intervention-related dissection, restenosis, and death were 0% (95% CI: 0-0%), 1% (95% CI: 0-1%), and 0% (95% CI: 0-2%).
CONCLUSION: Elective PTAS appears to be safe and effective in selected patients with medically refractory, severe, symptomatic, and non-acute BAS. Different stent types and angioplasty-assisted procedures should be considered based on specific clinico-radiological characteristics of the lesions. Future randomized controlled trials are required to corroborate these findings.
