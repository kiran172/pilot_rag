Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in a Failed Perceval Sutureless Valve, Complicated by Aortic Annular Rupture.

Abstract: As the use of surgically implanted sutureless aortic valves has increased over the past decade, we expect to encounter their failure increasingly in coming years. We describe a case of Perceval aortic valve failure with stent infolding and severe stenosis. This condition was treated with valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation and complicated by aortic annular rupture at the site of infolding. This case is important because it outlines the limited experience with valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation to treat failed sutureless valves and identifies sutureless valve infolding as a potential risk for annular rupture.
