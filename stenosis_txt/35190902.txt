Title: MicroRNA-22 promoted osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells by inhibiting CAB39 expression during aortic valve calcification.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common valve disease characterized by the fibro-calcific remodeling of the aortic valves, which is an actively regulated process involving osteogenic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). MicroRNA (miRNA) is an essential regulator in diverse biological processes in cells. The present study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of miR-22 in the osteogenic differentiation of VICs. The expression profile of osteogenesis-related miRNAs was first detected in aortic valve tissue from CAVD patients (n = 33) and healthy controls (n = 12). miR-22 was highly expressed in calcified valve tissues (P &lt; 0.01), and the expression was positively correlated with the expression of OPN (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.820, P &lt; 0.01) and Runx2 (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.563, P &lt; 0.01) in VICs isolated from mild or moderately calcified valves. The sustained high expression of miR-22 was also validated in an in-vitro VICs osteogenic model. Adenovirus-mediated gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments were then performed. Overexpression of miR-22 significantly accelerated the calcification process of VICs, manifested by significant increases in calcium deposition, alkaline phosphate activity, and expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers. Conversely, inhibition of miR-22 significantly negated the calcification process. Subsequently, calcium-binding protein 39 (CAB39) was identified as a target of miR-22. Overexpression of miR-22 significantly reduced the expression of CAB39 in VICs, leading to decreased catalytic activity of the CAB39-LKB1-STRAD complex, which, in turn, exacerbated changes in the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, and ultimately accelerated the calcification process. In addition, ROS generation and autophagic activity during VIC calcification were also regulated by miR-22/CAB39 pathway. These results indicate that miR-22 is an important accelerator of the osteogenic differentiation of VICs, and a potential therapeutic target in CAVD.
