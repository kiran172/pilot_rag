Title: Correlation between Morphological and Hemodynamic Parameters of Carotid Arteries and Cerebral Vasomotor Reactivity.

Abstract: The function of cerebral small vessels can be assessed using cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR). Our aim in this retrospective cross-sectional study was to investigate a correlation between carotid artery stenosis measured through ultrasonographic morphological and hemodynamic parameters and cerebral VMR. A total of 285 patients (125 males; mean age 54) were included. The breath-holding index (BHI) was used to evaluate cerebral VMR. Ultrasonographic carotid artery parameters were collected: the presence and characteristics of carotid plaques, the degree of carotid diameter stenosis, intima-media thickness (IMT), peak systolic velocity (PSV), and end diastolic velocity (EDV). Additionally, hemodynamic parameters of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) were evaluated, including the mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI). The following was collected from patients' medical histories: age, gender, and vascular risk factors. A negative correlation between the BHI and age (r = -0.242, p &lt; 0.01), BHI and the presence of carotid plaques, BHI and IMT (r = -0.203, p &lt; 0.01), and BHI and the PI of MCA on both sides (r = -0.268, p &lt; 0.01) was found. We found a positive correlation between the BHI in the left MCA and EDV in the left internal carotid artery (r = 0.121, p &lt; 0.05). This study shows the correlation between cerebral VMR and carotid stenosis but indicates a higher influence of morphological parameters on VMR values.
