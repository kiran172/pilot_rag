Title: United States Investigational Device Exemption study of the Revolution Peripheral Atherectomy System.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Atherectomy has become commonplace as an adjunct to interventional treatments for peripheral arterial disease, but the procedures have been complicated by risks including distal embolization and arterial perforation. This study aimed to examine the safety and effectiveness of a novel atherectomy system to treat femoropopliteal and below-knee peripheral arterial disease.
METHODS: The Revolution Peripheral Atherectomy System (Rex Medical LP, Conshohocken, Pa) was studied in 121 patients with 148 femoropopliteal and below-knee lesions, enrolled at 17 United States institutions. Technical success was defined when the post-atherectomy angiographic stenosis was ≤50%, as assessed by an independent core laboratory. Major adverse events were adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee.
RESULTS: Among 148 site-identified target lesions in 121 patients, 21.4% were in the superficial femoral artery, 13.7% involved the popliteal artery, and 67.9% were in tibial arteries; 3.1% involved more than one segment. Technical success was 90.2%, with stenoses decreasing from 73% ± 19% at baseline to 42% ± 14% after atherectomy. Adjunctive treatment after atherectomy included angioplasty with uncoated balloons in 91%, drug-coated balloons in 11%, bare stent deployment in 8%, and drug-eluting stent placement in 3%. Procedural success (<30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 93.7% of target lesions. Complications during the procedure included one target vessel perforation and two distal embolizations; each of which were adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee as unrelated to the device and were not visualized angiographically by the core laboratory. Freedom from major adverse events was 97.3% through 30 days. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency were 81.6%, 87.7%, and 91.6% at 6 months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Revolution Peripheral Atherectomy System was associated with few procedural complications and a high rate of success at the index procedure and through 6 months.
