Title: Clinical and Hemodynamic Outcomes of Rapid-Deployment Aortic Bioprostheses.

Abstract: Aim of this retrospective, multicenter study was to evaluate early and mid-term clinical and hemodynamic results of patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with Intuity rapid-deployment bioprostheses (RDB) (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). We analyzed data from the Italian Registry of Intuity Valve (INTU-ITA registry) that is a national, real-world and independent from the industry registry. Preoperative variables were defined according to EuroSCORE and postoperative outcomes according to Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC). Survival distribution was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier approach. A Cox-Proportional Hazard Model was employed to assess the effect of the covariates on patients' survival. The registry included 1687 patients from 23 centers (June 2012-September 2019). Aortic cross clamp time for isolated SAVR was 55 minutes (IQR: 45-70 minute). Postoperative pace-maker rate was 6.3%. At discharge transaortic peak and mean gradients were: 18 mm Hg (IQR: 14-23 mm Hg) and 10 mmHg (IQR: 8-13 mm Hg), respectively. Indexed effective orifice area was 1.10 cm2/m2 (IQR: 0.91-1.31 cm2/m2) and the incidence of severe patient-prosthesis mismatch was 0.6%. Hemodynamic data for all valve sizes remained stable during follow-up. Thirty-day overall mortality was 1.8% (30 patients), and at follow-up it was 5.3% (89 patients). Kaplan-Meier overall survival was 95.5% (94.3-96.7%); 90.7% (88.3-93.1%); 86.4% (82.6-90.4%) at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Serum creatinine (HR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.04-1.81; p = 0.0397) and cross-clamp time (HR: 1.01; 95%CI: 1.002-1.017; p = 0.0077) were identified as independent predictors of mortality. According to our data from the INTU-ITA registry, SAVR with RDB provides good early clinical and hemodynamic results that are confirmed at follow-up.
