Title: CABG With Internal Thoracic Artery in Children With Congenital Heart Defects: A Good Option When It Is the Only One.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Coronary complications may present during or after repair of congenital heart defects. We report coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) by internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafts to either coronary artery in children with congenital anomalies.
METHODS: Four cases who underwent CABG with ITA grafts from March 2016 to March 2020 were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: At the time of operation, patient's ages and weight were 7 and 20 months old and 14 and 15 years old and 6.5, 10, 40, and 45 kg, respectively. Diagnosis were anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery with leftward lateral ostial origin (n = 1), neopulmonary annulus hypoplasia post arterial switch with contiguous right coronary artery (RCA) arising from the left facing sinus (n = 1), RCA stenosis after the Ross procedure (n = 1), and right coronary ostial obstruction after aortic valve replacement in truncus arteriosus (n = 1). Procedures included left ITA to left coronary ostium (n = 1), right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) enlargement with pulmonary valve replacement with left ITA to RCA (n = 1), RVOT enlargement with pulmonary valve replacement with right ITA to RCA (n = 1), and aortic valve re-replacement, pulmonary valve replacement, and right ITA to RCA (n = 1). At last follow-up, all four patients were asymptomatic, with normal ventricular function, and all grafts were patent.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of CABG in children is valuable alternative when dealing with complex coronary anatomy not suitable for classic repairs. In children, graft patency is required to be longer than 50 years; therefore, use of arterial grafts seems mandatory.
