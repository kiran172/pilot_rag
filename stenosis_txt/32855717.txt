Title: Significance of high resolution MRI in the identification of carotid plaque.

Abstract: The stability of carotid artery plaque serves a key role in the occurrence of stroke. The present study was based on the recruitment of patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) was used to identify the nature of carotid artery plaque, and the results were then used to manage the high-risk group of stroke. The patients were divided equally into a symptomatic group (36 cases) and an asymptomatic group (36 cases). According to the degree of carotid artery stenosis, the patients were divided into mild, moderate and severe stenosis groups, each group comprising 12 patients, and HR-MRI was performed. The proportion of patients with vulnerable plaque in the symptomatic group was higher compared with that in the asymptomatic group (P<0.05). The more severe the stenosis, the higher the proportion of vulnerable plaque that was identified (P<0.05). Compared with carotid ultrasound, HR-MRI was indicated to have the capability to both identify and quantify the different components in the plaque, allowing an assessment of its properties. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that carotid HR-MRI is able to distinguish and quantify the different components of plaque, which may prove to be helpful for the hierarchical management of a population at high risk of stroke.
