Title: Acute-on-Chronic Subdural Hematoma Secondary to Falls Due to Alcoholism.

Abstract: The authors present a case of a 58-year-old male who is a daily drinker, experiencing bitemporal headaches starting one week prior to seeking medical attention. The patient's physical examination and vital signs exhibited no irregularities. Imaging studies revealed an acute-on-chronic left subdural hematoma but no intracranial arterial thrombosis or significant stenosis. The patient was managed conservatively due to his intact mental status and did well. The authors discuss alcohol use as a predisposing factor for intracerebral hemorrhage due to the increased risk for head trauma.
