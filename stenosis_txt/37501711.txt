Title: Orbital atherectomy to facilitate transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with calcified iliofemoral arteries: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The transfemoral (TF) approach drives most of the advantages of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) over surgical aortic valve replacement. Alternative accesses for TAVI are associated with higher complication rates, but are still considered in âˆ¼5% of cases due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can still allow TF-TAVI in selected cases with severe calcific PAD; however, ancillary techniques for calcium management are often needed.
CASE SUMMARY: Orbital atherectomy was selected to facilitate TF-TAVI in two patients with different degrees and aspects of calcific PAD. Pre-procedural computed tomography analysis was key to choose the most appropriate technique for calcium management. We describe our experience with a step-by-step procedural approach to orbital atherectomy-assisted TF-TAVI.
DISCUSSION: PAD is not uncommon in patients affected by severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. Orbital atherectomy can still allow TF-TAVI in selected cases with severe calcific PAD. A meticulous patient selection and a standardized, step-wise procedural execution are mandatory to optimize outcomes.
