Title: Gender Differences in Age-Stratified Inhospital Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from the National Inpatient Sample 2012 to 2018).

Abstract: Contemporary data on gender differences in outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), after stratification by age, remain limited. We studied age-stratified (60 to 70, 71 to 80, and 81 to 90 years) inhospital outcomes by gender after TAVI from the National Inpatient Sample database between 2012 and 2018. We analyzed National Inpatient Sample data using the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification, Ninth Revision, and Tenth Revision claims codes. Between the years 2012 and 2018, a total of 188,325 weighted hospitalizations for TAVI were included in the analysis. A total of 21,957 patients were included in the 60 to 70 age group (44% females), 60,770 (45% females) in the 71 to 80 age group, and 105,580 (50% females) in the 81 to 90 age groups, respectively. Propensity-matched inhospital mortality rates were significantly higher for females than males for the age group of 81 to 90 years (3.0% vs 2.1%, p <0.01). Vascular complications and a need for blood transfusions remained significantly higher for females on propensity-matched analysis across all categories of ages. Conversely, acute kidney injury and the need for pacemaker implantation remained significantly higher for males across all age groups. In conclusion, we report that mortality is higher in female patients who underwent TAVI between the ages of 81 to 90. Moreover, the female gender was associated with higher vascular complications and bleeding requiring transfusions. Conversely, the male gender was associated with higher rates of pacemaker implantation and acute kidney injury.
