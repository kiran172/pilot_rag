Title: House advancement flap anoplasty for severe post-hemorrhoidectomy anal stenosis.

Abstract: Anal stenosis (AS), which is a very rare but serious complication, usually develops after hemorrhoidectomy. It may be mild, moderate or severe depending on the grade of stenosis. While mild and moderate types can be monitored with conservative treatment, most of the severe type require advancement flap anoplasty. There are several commonly used flap types such as Y-V, diamond and house-type flaps, but the best results belong to house-type flaps. In this paper, we aimed to present a case of severe post-hemorrhoidectomy AS, in which we performed house advancement flap anoplasty, with its video demonstrating the procedure step by step.
