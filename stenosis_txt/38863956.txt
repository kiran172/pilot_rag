Title: Surgical treatment of pancreaticojejunal stenosis after pancreaticoduodenectomy: case report.

Abstract: Pancreaticoduodenectomy is established as the procedure of choice for malignant tumor pathologies of the head of the pancreas or ampulla, where the patient's life prognosis is low. Complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy (e.g. pancreatic fistulas, hemorrhages, or intra-abdominal collection) are well described in the literature and are generally acute. However, there is still a small risk for late complications (e.g. pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency), and due to its low incidence, there has not been a consensus on the treatment. We present the case of an 18-year-old female with recurrent bouts of acute pancreatitis as a late complication of a pancreaticoduodenectomy plus pancreatojejunal anastomosis due to a pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. The complication was managed though surgical revision consisting of dilation and stent placement in the stenosis. The patient had an adequate postoperative evolution without further complications. Despite the advances in the surgical field, pancreaticoduodenectomy represents a highly complex surgery with high morbidity and mortality rates. The late complications of this surgery are under continuous study due to its low incidence associated with low patient survival.
