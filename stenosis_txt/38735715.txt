Title: Full-endoscopic spine surgery in oldest old patients aged over 90 years:A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transforaminal full-endoscopic spine surgery (FESS) is the least invasive spinal surgery and can be performed under local anesthesia. In Japan, the population is rapidly aging and the number of spinal surgeries performed in the elderly is also increasing.
OBJECT: In this report, we describe 3 patients aged 90 years or older in whom we performed FESS under local anesthesia.
CASE: The first case was a 90-year-old man who presented with severe leg pain. He had multiple medical comorbidities and was unsuitable for general anesthesia. We performed FESS. After surgery, the leg pain resolved with full recovery of muscle strength. He was discharged with no perioperative complications. The second case was a 90-year-old man who presented with severe leg pain. MRI showed a herniated nucleus pulposus and foraminal stenosis at L4/5. We performed FESS. The leg pain improved immediately after surgery. The third case was a 91-year-old woman in whom we diagnosed left L5 radiculopathy due to foraminal stenosis at L5/S1. After surgery, her leg pain was relieved.
CONCLUSION: FESS is a good surgical procedure for elderly patients who are in a poor general condition because it is minimally invasive and can be performed under local anesthesia with early mobilization. J. Med. Invest. 71 : 169-173, February, 2024.
