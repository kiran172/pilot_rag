Title: Analysis of diagnostic characteristics and clinical related factors of 70 patients with atelectasis by painless bronchoscopy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To analyze the diagnostic characteristics and clinical related factors of patients with atelectasis by painless electronic bronchoscopy.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 70 patients with atelectasis admitted to Xuancheng People's Hospital from April 2019 to June 2021. The clinical data of the patients and the diagnosis characteristics under painless electronic bronchoscope were analyzed, and the clinical related factors were investigated.
RESULTS: Seventy patients with atelectasis underwent pathological examination and bacteriological examination after painless electronic bronchoscopy, including 16 cases (22.86%) of inflammation, 11 cases (15.71%) of tuberculosis, 36 cases (51.43%) of tumor, one case (1.43%) of inflammatory polyp, one case (1.43%) of congenital dysplasia, two cases (2.86%) of foreign body inhalation, and three cases (4.29%) of other symptoms. Male patients with atelectasis showed most cauliflower-like tumors and mucosal swelling under electronic bronchoscopy (P<0.05), while female patients showed scar occlusion/stenosis at most (P<0.05). Middle-aged and elderly patients under electronic bronchoscopy showed most cauliflower-like tumors, scar stenosis/occlusion and mucosal swelling cavity, while young patients mainly showed necrosis and purulent secretions. Heavy smokers were most likely to have cauliflower-like tumors, while non-smokers were predominantly with scar stenosis/occlusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Painless electronic bronchoscopy is of great value in the clinical diagnosis of patients with atelectasis, and it is likely to further clarify the etiology of atelectasis. Age, sex, and quantity of smoking may be clinical factors associated with atelectasis.
