Title: Risk Factors for Infectious Complications following Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography in Liver Transplant Patients: A Single-Center Study.

Abstract: Background: Liver transplant recipients often require endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for biliary complications, which can lead to infections. This retrospective single-center study aimed to identify risk factors for infectious complications following ERCP in liver transplant patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 285 elective ERCP interventions performed in 88 liver transplant patients at a tertiary care center. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of an infection following ERCP. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses, Cox regression, and log-rank tests were employed to assess the influence of various factors on the incidence of infectious complications. Results: Among the 285 ERCP interventions, isolated anastomotic stenosis was found in 175 cases, ischemic type biliary lesion (ITBL) in 103 cases, and choledocholithiasis in seven cases. Bile duct interventions were performed in 96.9% of all ERCPs. Infections after ERCP occurred in 46 cases (16.1%). Independent risk factors for infection included male sex (OR 24.19), prednisolone therapy (OR 4.5), ITBL (OR 4.51), sphincterotomy (OR 2.44), cholangioscopy (OR 3.22), dilatation therapy of the bile ducts (OR 9.48), and delayed prophylactic antibiotic therapy (&gt;1 h after ERCP) (OR 2.93). Additionally, infections following previous ERCP interventions were associated with an increased incidence of infections following future ERCP interventions (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: In liver transplant patients undergoing ERCP, male sex, prednisolone therapy, and complex bile duct interventions independently raised infection risks. Delayed antibiotic treatment further increased this risk. Patients with ITBL were notably susceptible due to incomplete drainage. Additionally, a history of post-ERCP infections signaled higher future risks, necessitating close monitoring and timely antibiotic prophylaxis.
