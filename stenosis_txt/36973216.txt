Title: [Chinese guideline for the clincal application of transcatheter aortic valve replacement].

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), as an important procedure for aortic valve diseases worldwide, features with a late start and rapid development in China. In the process of clinical application, the lack of standard guidelines and training system has brought challenges to the widespread use of this technique. In order to standardize the application of TAVR technique and improve the quality of medical care, the National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases and the National Center for Quality Control of Structural Heart Disease Intervention, together with the Chinese Society of Cardiology and the Chinese Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, jointly established an expert group on the guidelines for TAVR, combined with the recommendations of international guidelines and the current clinical practice in China, integrated the latest evidence in China and worldwide to develop the clinical guideline of TAVR with extensive consultation (Chinese Expert Consensus). The guideline mainly included 11 parts: methods, epidemiological feature, TAVR devices, requirements of cardiac teams, recommendations for TAVR indications, perioperative multimodality imaging evaluation, surgical procedures, anti-thrombotic strategies after TAVR, prevention and treatment of complications, postoperative rehabilitation and follow-up, limitations and prospects, aiming to provide reasonable recommendations for all-level clinicians in China.
