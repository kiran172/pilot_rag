Title: Current Strategies of Surface Modifications to Polyurethane Biomaterials for Vascular Grafts.

Abstract: As the number of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases and peripheral vascular diseases rises, the constraints of autologous transplantation remain unavoidable. As a result, artificial vascular grafts must be developed. Adhesion of proteins, platelets and bacteria on implants can result in stenosis, thrombus formation, and postoperative infection, which can be fatal for an implantation. Polyurethane, as a commonly used biomaterial, has been modified in various ways to deal with the adhesions of proteins, platelets, and bacteria and to stimulate endothelium adhesion. In this review, we briefly summarize the mechanisms behind adhesions, overview the current strategies of surface modifications of polyurethane biomaterials used in vascular grafts, and highlight the challenges that need to be addressed in future studies, aiming to gain a more profound understanding of how to develop artificial polyurethane vascular grafts with an enhanced implantation success rate and reduced side effect.
