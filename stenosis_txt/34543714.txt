Title: Outcomes Following the Endovascular Treatment of Renal Artery Stenosis Caused by Fibromuscular Dysplasia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Renal artery revascularization has been performed to improve blood pressure control and to cure hypertension in patients with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia (RAFMD). We herein conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing outcomes associated with the treatment of hypertensive RAFMD patients via endovascular angioplasty in order to offer an up-to-date overview of the relative costs and benefits of this approach to revascularization in RAFMD patients.
METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Embase databases and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials to identify relevant studies published as of January 15, 2020. Key outcomes of interest in these studies included technical success, the incidence of perioperative complications, cure rates, and overall improvement rates.
RESULTS: In total, we identified 36 relevant studies of 1916 total repairs conducted in 1191 patients. Of these included studies, 33 were retrospective, while 3 were prospective. The overall technical success rate across these studies was 94.3%. Rates of total, major, and minor complications in these pooled studies were 12.9%, 4.6%, and 7.4%, respectively. Pooled rates of cured hypertension and improved hypertension following angioplasty, defined according to study-specific criteria, were 37.0% [95% CI: 27.0%-47.0%] and 80.0% [95% CI: 75.0% to 84.0%], respectively, although these rates varied highly among studies. Cure rates for studies used current clinical definitions for substantial variations across studies. Cure rates in studies using current definitions of cured hypertension (blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg without treatment) were just 18.1% following angioplasty. Cure rates fell markedly with increasing mean patient age (OR associated with an increase in mean age of 10 years: -0.24 [95% CI: -0.44 to -0.04, P = 0.019] and with mean known duration of hypertension (OR associated with an increase in mean hypertension duration of 5 years: -0.09 [95% CI: -0.12 to -0.05, P = 0.001]).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that endovascular treatment yielded moderate benefits to RAFMD patients, with substantial variation across studies. The blood pressure outcome was strongly influenced by patient age.
