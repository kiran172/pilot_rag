Title: Rescue retrieval of a trapped embolic protection device using a JB2-type balloon catheter.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenting is a treatment option for patients with significant symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Although use of an embolic protection device during carotid artery stenting can prevent distal embolization, device retrieval after stenting can be difficult. In this report, during an embolic protection device retrieval, it was not possible to advance recapture catheters through the distal flare segment of the stent because the device wire would catch on the flare or become jammed between the flare and vessel wall. Then, an extension wire was connected to the end of the device and a 5.2-Fr JB2-type balloon catheter was advanced over the wire, which was able to pass through the stent. The use of a 5.2-Fr JB2-type balloon catheter to retrieve a trapped embolic protection device is feasible and effective if standard maneuvers fail.
