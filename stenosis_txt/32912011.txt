Title: Primary balloon dacryoplasty for nasolacrimal duct obstruction in adults: a systematic review.

Abstract: Introduction: Acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a major cause of epiphora. Balloon dacryoplasty (BD) is a minimally invasive procedure effectively used for congenital NLDO which has also been used in adults, instead of dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), the current gold standard technique. The main objectives were to assess the results of BD with and without silicone tube insertion (STI) in NLDO in adults.Materiel and Method: A systematic review of literature was conducted on PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases. The articles were scanned to identify all studies that evaluated the outcomes of primary BD for NLDO in adults. The mean success rates were calculated and compared using the multiple comparisons Sidak's T-testResults: Sixty-seven articles were identified but only 13 publications matched the inclusion criteria. For partial NLDO, BD had a mean, success rate of 73.29% (64.86% with STI) with a mean follow-up of 16 months. For complete NLDO, BD had a success rate of 36.67% (52.50% with STI) with a mean follow-up of 15.5 months. Altogether the success rate of BD was significantly higher for partial NLDO compared to complete stenosis (p = 0,002).Conclusion: BD is significantly more successful for partial NLDO, without significant additional benefit from subsequent STI. The main complication would be the high recurrence rate. BD is not effective for complete NLDO with very low success rates. However, BD could be proposed for partial NLDO, as it is a safe procedure, with minimal invasiveness in comparison to DCR. Further prospective and controlled studies are required to confirm these encouraging results.
