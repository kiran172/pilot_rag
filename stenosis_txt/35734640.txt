Title: Complete heart block and moderate stenosis aortic post radiation in a young woman with breast cancer.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: and importance: Although radiotherapy is a well-known cancer treatment and an important part of the therapeutic strategy for achieving long-term remission or disease control, the radiation-induced heart disease rates are high and may occur years later. This article aims to raise clinician awareness of cardiac side effects that can occur years after radiation therapy. In order to develop effective prevention strategies and improve clinical outcomes.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a rare case of a young female, on remission from breast carcinoma, who received mediastinal radiotherapy 13 years earlier, admitted in our department for recurrent syncope of sudden on-set. The etiology of heart block was attributed to the distant effect of radiation-induced cardiac toxicity based on her past medical history.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Radiation promotes fibrosis in all cardiac components, raising the risk of coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, valvulopathy, arrhythmias, and pericardial illness. In this population, physicians should aggressively address additional cardiovascular risk factors, and recommendations recommend obtaining routine imaging once symptomatology is established.
CONCLUSION: Serious cardiovascular complications may develop several years after radiation treatment, Screening, early recognition, prevention and the use of certain drugs can be quite helpful in reducing radiation-induced heart damage.
