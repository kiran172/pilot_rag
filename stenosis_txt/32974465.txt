Title: Leaflet thrombosis after valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) in degenerated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is an alternative to redo-SAVR. However, reports on leaflet thrombosis following ViV-TAVI are emerging and subclinical thrombosis has gained recent attention. Although the incidence of transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis after TAVI for native aortic valve disease is low, current imaging studies suggest the incidence of subclinical THV thrombosis may be significantly higher. While anticoagulation strategies for THV patients for native aortic stenosis presenting with symptomatic obstructive thrombosis has been described, the optimal management and anticoagulation therapy of patients with THV thrombosis following ViV-TAVI are less evident.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case series of three patients presenting with early and late THV thrombosis after ViV-TAVI. Two patients presented clinically on single antiplatelet therapy and one patient presented with subclinical valve thrombosis whilst taking a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulation agent.
DISCUSSION: Leaflet thrombosis after ViV-TAVI is an important cause of THV degeneration and may present subclinically. Imaging modalities such as serial transthoracic echocardiograms and multidetector computerized tomography aid diagnosis and guide management. Patient-individualized risk- vs. -benefit prophylactic post-procedural oral anticoagulation may be indicated.
