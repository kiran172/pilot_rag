Title: Superior vena cava tear during transvenous lead extraction: Medical management in hemodynamically stable patients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Superior vena cava (SVC) tear is the most lethal complication during transvenous lead extraction (TLE) with a mortality rate as high as 50%. Treatment involves aggressive attempts to maintain cardiac output and immediate sternotomy to localize and repair the vascular tear. Occlusion balloons have been developed to provisionally occlude the lacerated SVC and to provide hemodynamic stability allowing time for surgery. In case of mediastinal hematoma without hemodynamic instability, the strategy remains unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe two cases of SVC tear during TLE. The first case was a 60-year-old man who presented with a right ventricular single-chamber defibrillator lead fracture and innominate vein stenosis. The RV lead was removed using a laser sheath causing a mediastinal hematoma with no active bleeding during surgical exploration few hours later. The second case was a 28-year-old man that presented with a right atrial (RA) lead fracture and RV lead insulation failure in a dual-chamber defibrillator (ICD).
CONCLUSION: Both the RA and RV leads were removed with mechanical sheaths, and a mediastinal hematoma was medically managed.
