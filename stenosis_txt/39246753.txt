Title: Management of concurrent symptomatic tuberculum sellae meningioma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coexisting intracranial pathologies of distinct etiology which require intervention are rare. Only a handful of cases have been reported in the literature. The effects of each treatment option on both pathologies need to be considered during management. We describe the first report of the management of a patient with concurrent symptomatic tuberculum sellae meningioma (TSM) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old male presented with 2 weeks of vision loss and 3 months of headaches. He was found to have an inferior hemi-field deficit in the left eye and bilateral papilledema. Imaging studies revealed bilateral transverse sinus stenosis and a TSM abutting the left optic nerve. The opening pressure was 40 cmH2O. An expanded-endoscopic endonasal approach was performed for mass resection. Intraoperatively, a lumbar drain was placed to aid skull base repair integrity before definitive treatment was obtained. On postoperative day 9, a right transverse-sigmoid sinus stent was placed for IIH treatment. The patient was discharged the following day.
CONCLUSION: Our management of this patient targeted the etiologies of each symptomatic pathology. Stenting provided treatment for the IIH and mass resection for the vision loss. Both the order and approaches to treatment were felt to maximize patient benefit while minimizing harm.
