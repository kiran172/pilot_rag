Title: [Renovascular hypertension secondary to Takayasu arteritis].

Abstract: Secondary arterial hypertension (HT) is an increase in blood pressure due to a recognisable cause. It is estimated that the prevalence of people with HT is around 5%-15%. The search for secondary HT in all hypertensive patients is neither feasible nor cost-effective. However, there are a series of signs that force us to discount its diagnosis such as newly diagnosed hypertension before the age of 40, acute worsening of hypertension, resistant hypertension, the presence of extensive organ injury or clinical-analytical alterations, etc. It is important to diagnosis these patients since treatments can be curative, especially in young people. We present the case of a 46-year-old man with hypertensive emergency and subarachnoid haemorrhage due to aneurysmal rupture. The study of secondary causes was diagnostic for renal artery stenosis due to Takayasu arteritis in the scarring stage.
