Title: Avoiding Surgery: Endoscopic Treatment of Congenital Duodenal Stenosis.

Abstract: Duodenal stenosis is a rare congenital anomaly that is typically treated surgically, although endoscopic incisional therapy (EIT) and balloon dilation are minimally invasive alternatives. We present a case of a 15-month-old male with vomiting and difficulty tolerating solid food due to severe congenital duodenal stenosis. The patient underwent EIT and serial duodenal dilation to a diameter of 20â€‰mm, which resulted in significant symptom improvement. Intralesional corticosteroid injection (ISI) was administered to help prevent the duodenal septum from restricturing. The combination of EIT, balloon dilation, and ISI was successful in treating the patient's congenital duodenal stenosis and avoided the need for surgery. However, further studies are required to confirm the efficacy of this treatment approach in this patient population. This report highlights the potential of this minimally invasive approach as an alternative to surgical intervention in the management of congenital duodenal stenosis.
