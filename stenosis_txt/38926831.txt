Title: Pulmonary, aorta, and coronary arteries post-arterial switch in transposition of great arteries: intermediate-term surveillance utilizing conventional echocardiography and cardiac multislice computed tomography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arterial switch operation (ASO) is the standard surgical choice for D-transposition of great arteries (D-TGA). However, the implications of ASO on pulmonaries, coronaries, and aorta have not been adequately investigated. The current study evaluates arterial morphologic changes post-ASO at intermediate-term surveillance.
METHODS: From May 2021 to May 2022, patients with D-TGA who underwent ASO for more than six months were recruited. Preoperative and operative data were collected. Patients were assessed using echocardiography (ECHO) and multislice CT angiography (MSCT) to evaluate pulmonary, coronary, and aortic arterial anatomy.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were included with median age of 11 (10-23.25) days at ASO and 14 (7.25-32.75) months on last follow-up. Neo-aortic regurgitation was detected in 12(60%) and neo-pulmonary regurgitation in 3 (15%). Using ECHO, complete evaluation of pulmonary arteries (PAs) was not achieved in 35% and incomplete coronaries assessment in 40% of cases. No stenosis was detected in coronaries using MSCT, although coronary anomalies were found in 9/20 (45%). Dilated Aortic annulus was detected in 16/20 (80%), dilated aortic root in 18/20 (90%), and dilated sinotubular junction in 70%. Right PA stenosis was diagnosed in 10/20 (50%) and left PA(LPA) stenosis in 7/20 (35%). Although Z-score of PAs did not correlate with aortic data, LPA bending angle was positively correlated to neo-aortic root diameter and Z-score (rho = 0.65,p = 0.016; rho = 0.69,p = 0.01), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Echocardiography alone is not a conclusive surveillance tool for detecting late post-ASO anatomic changes in D-TGA patients. Cardiac MSCT should be considered for comprehensive evaluation on the intermediate-term follow-up post-ASO to accurately track morphologic abnormalities in the aorta, pulmonary, and coronary arteries.
