Title: A Rare Case of Vascular Malformation in India: Cutis Marmorata Telangiectatica Congenita.

Abstract: The current case report presents a male baby, second born to nonconsanguineous parents at 38 weeks of gestationÂ by lower segment cesarean section, with engorged blood vessels and distinctive patterns of discoloration and dilation of blood vessels on the left leg. A Doppler of the femoral artery and vein showed normal triphasic flow and waveforms without any evidence of significant luminal stenosis. There was also a lower limb length discrepancy of 1.5 cm. Genetic testing using fluorometric enzyme immunoassay screening revealed a negative screening report. Otologic screening using distortion product otoacoustic emissions revealed normal functioning of outer hair cells in both ears. The case was diagnosed as cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC), after ruling out genetic diseases. It was not associated with any other significant health problems. The diagnosis of CMTC was based on the appearance of the skin at birth, which became more noticeable shortly after two days. In this case, no specific treatment was warranted and the condition improved with time.
