Title: Clinical Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) vs Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR) in Patients With Sarcoidosis.

Abstract: Introduction Data regarding clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) vs surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with sarcoidosis is lacking. This study aims to clarify the clinical outcomes of TAVR vs SAVR in patients with sarcoidosis. Methods Data was collected from the National Inpatient Sample database from 2016-2019 using validated ICD-10-CM codes for sarcoidosis, TAVR, and SAVR. Patients were divided into two cohorts: those who underwent TAVR and those who underwent SAVR. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson's chi-squared test to determine clinical outcomes of TAVR vs SAVR in patients with sarcoidosis. Results The prevalence of sarcoidosis was 0.23%Â among total study patients (n=142,420,378). After exclusions, the prevalence of TAVR was 650 (49%) and SAVR was 675 (51%) in patients with sarcoidosis. Patients who underwent TAVR were on average older (74 vs 65 years old, p=0.001), and more likely to be female (57 vs 40%, p<0.001) compared to patients who underwent SAVR. The TAVR cohort had higher rates of congestive heart failure (CHF) (77.7 vs 42.2%, p=0.001), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (42.3 vs 24.4% p=0.001), anemia (5.4 vs 2.2%, p=0.004), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (1.5 vs 0%, p=0.004), and hypothyroidism (31.5 vs 16.3%, p=0.001) compared to the SAVR cohort. Inpatient mortality post-procedure was higher in the SAVR cohort compared to the TAVR cohort (15 vs 0, p=0.001). Regarding post-procedure complications, respiratory complications were more common in the SAVR cohort (4.4 vs 0%, p=0.001), while TAVR was associated with a higher incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) insertion (2.15 vs 0.8%, p=0.001). There was no statistical difference in the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) (0.8 vs 1.5%, p=0.33), AKI requiring hemodialysis (0 vs. 0.7%, p=0.08), or stroke (0.8 vs 0.7, p=1) post-procedure between the two cohorts. Conclusion This study found that in the sarcoidosis population, TAVR was associated with reduced mortality, shorter hospital length of stay, and lower hospitalization costs in comparison to SAVR.
