Title: The quality of life of 50-70 years old patients with orthopedic spinal stenosis surgery. A follow-up study (descriptive study).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Background: Nowadays, surgical procedures are assessed based on the state of an individual. This study aimed to investigate the effect of lumbar spinal stenosis surgery on the patient's quality of life and motor functions in Kashani and Alzahra Hospital in Esfahan.
METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, 40 patients aged between 50-70 were respectively evaluated who underwent lumbar spine stenosis surgery in Al Zahra and Kashani Hospitals in Esfahan University of Medical Sciences, Esfahan, Iran, during 2020-2021. The SF-36 questionnaire was used as a research tool. The visual analog scale (VAS), and spine functional index (SFI), were measured initially before surgery and 6 months and 9 months after surgery.
RESULTS: The mean scores of the SF-36, SFI, and VAS scores questionnaire were 87.95±4.94, 21.38±1.24, 6.07±0.69 (p<0.001) before surgery, 89.77±5.25, 19.73±1.40, 5.37±1.56 (p<0.001) six months after surgery, and 94.70±5.34, 18.63±1.56, 4.57±0.81 (p<0.001) nine months after surgery, and all were significant. Improvement in the domains of general health, role-physical, role disorder due to impaired physical health, social function, emotional role, and bodily pain was evident. Also, the overall quality of life was enhanced but energy levels and role disorder due to impaired mental health showed no improvement.
CONCLUSION: Not only does lumbar spinal stenosis surgery significantly improve the general health, role-physical, and the social function of the patients but also enhances their quality of life.
