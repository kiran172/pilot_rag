Title: [A Case of Remnant Gastric Cancer Occurring 12 Years after Surgery That Was Successfully Treated with Radiation Therapy].

Abstract: A 59-year-old woman had a history of distal gastrectomy and D2 dissection in May 200X for advanced gastric cancer(GC) in the antrum area. The pathological stage was poorly differentiated, T2(SS), N2, H0, P0, CY0, M0, pStage â…¢A. After administration of S-1 for 1 year as adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient underwent surveillance with no recurrence. However, remnant GC was diagnosed in April 200X+12. Considering that there was no indication for curative resection due to severe invasion of the proper hepatic artery, gastrojejunostomy was performed for the anastomotic stenosis. Although the patient was administered 3 courses of S-1 plus oxaliplatin therapy as first-line treatment, partial response was not achieved. Therefore, chemoradiotherapy(CRT)with capecitabine was administered for local tumor control. Complete response was achieved, and the patient underwent surveillance with no recurrence 16 months after the recurrence. There were no serious acute adverse events(AEs)during CRT and late AEs after CRT. The patient was successfully treated with CRT for locally advanced remnant GC. Although there is no standard treatment for locally advanced remnant GC, this case showed the effectiveness of CRT.
