Title: Sex differences and long-term clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A SWEDEHEART study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies on the impact of sex differences after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have shown conflicting results. The aim was to analyze the risk of long-term mortality, heart failure hospitalization, myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding and aortic valve reintervention in females versus males after TAVR.
METHODS: This nationwide, population-based cohort study included all patients who underwent TAVR in Sweden between 2008 and 2022 from the SWEDEHEART register. Additional baseline and outcome data were gathered from other national health data registers. Regression standardization was used to adjust for differences between the sexes.
RESULTS: Of 10,475 patients, 4,886 (47%) were female and 5,589 (53%) were male. The mean age was 81 years. The cumulative incidence of mortality at 1, 5, and 10 years was 8% vs. 10%, 38% vs. 45%, and 75% vs. 82% for females and males, respectively. After regression standardization, the risk of all-cause mortality was lower for females (absolute difference at 10 years of 6.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4%-8.4%). The mean follow up was 3.1 years (maximum 14.1 years). Females also had a lower risk of major bleeding than males (absolute survival difference at 10 years of 4.0%, 95% CI 1.9%-6.2%), but there was no difference in the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, or reintervention between the sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: Females had a higher survival rate and a lower bleeding risk than males after TAVR. Sex-specific factors are important to consider in the management of patients after TAVR.
