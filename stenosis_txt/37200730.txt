Title: A Child with an Esophageal Web Treated with Functional Lumen Imaging Probe.

Abstract: A 14-month-old male presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of vomiting after the intake of liquids or solids. During the admission, imaging studies revealed an esophageal web, a form of congenital esophageal stenosis. He was treated with a combination of Endoluminal Functional Lumen Imaging Probe (EndoFLIP) and controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloon dilation, followed by EndoFLIP and EsoFLIP dilation 1 month later. The patient's vomiting resolved after treatment, and he was able to gain weight. This report describes one of the first cases of applying EndoFLIP and EsoFLIP to treat an esophageal web in a pediatric patient.
