Title: Enhancing stent length and stability with a novel through-the-scope suturing platform: a case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fully covered self-expandable metal stents are commonly used for managing GI adverse events like perforations, leaks, fistulas, and strictures. Although effective, stent length and migration can be a limitation when dealing with larger defects. Over-the-scope clips and over-the-scope suturing can be used to mitigate migration risk; however, their role is limited for stent-to-stent suturing to create longer stents. We present a novel application of through-the-scope suturing (TTSS) system for creating longer stents to manage larger GI defects.
METHODS: We demonstrate using a video case series the applicability of TTSS for fixing multiple coaxially placed stents to create a longer stent and simultaneously anchor them to underlying GI wall to mitigate stent migration.
RESULTS: We illustrate our success in managing 3 cases of large esophageal and/or gastric pathologies (stenosis and leak) using the TTSS system to create longer stents through stent-in-stent fixation.
CONCLUSIONS: TTSS is a novel endoscopic suturing platform that is compatible with most endoscopes and can be navigated to challenging narrow and angulated location, giving it an advantage over over-the-scope suturing/over-the-scope clips. Our case series demonstrates that stent-in-stent fixation of multiple fully covered self-expandable metal stents to create longer stents using the TTSS system is an effective technique when managing larger GI defects.
