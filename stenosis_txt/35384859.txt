Title: Laparoscopic treatment of rare median arcuate ligament syndrome - medium-term follow-up.

Abstract: &lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare cause of chronic epigastric pain. The presentation might be unclear and non-specific. Diagnosing the syndrome requires interdisciplinary methods and specialists. Treatments consist of celiac axis release performed laparoscopically or robotically, and intraluminal stenting. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; The aim of the study was to report the medium-term postoperative follow-up results for four patients with MALS. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; We performed 5 laparoscopic celiac axis releases in patients with MALS in our department in 2018. The study included 4 patients who were admitted 16-23 months after surgery for computed tomography angiography.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt; Results:&lt;/b&gt; Patients constituted 4 women aged 28-63 with a mean body mass index of 22.4 kg/m2. The diagnosis of MALS was confirmed by computed tomography angiography, which showed severe (&gt;70%) narrowing of the celiac axis. Patients underwent laparoscopic celiac axis release, and were all discharged on the first postoperative day with no postoperative complications. The patients' quality of life improved and their symptoms subsided completely. Follow-up computed tomography angiography confirmed full decompression of the celiac axis in all 4 patients, with no stenosis caused by scarification of the celiac axis.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt; Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Laparoscopy is a valuable and safe method to treat patients with MALS.
