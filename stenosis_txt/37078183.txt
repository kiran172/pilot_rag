Title: Coronary artery dilation associated with bicuspid and unicuspid aortic valve disease in children: a series of 17 patients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery dilation associated with bicuspid/unicuspid aortic valves is described in adults with limited data in children. We aimed to describe the clinical course of children with bicuspid/unicuspid aortic valves and coronary dilation including coronary Z-score changes over time, association of coronary changes with aortic valve anatomy/function, and complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional databases were searched for children â‰¤18 years with both bicuspid/unicuspid aortic valves and coronary dilation (1/2006-6/2021). Kawasaki disease and isolated supra-/subvalvar aortic stenosis were excluded. Statistics were descriptive with associations measured by Fisher's exact test and overlapping 83.7% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Of 17 children, bicuspid/unicuspid aortic valve was diagnosed at birth in 14 (82%). Median age at coronary dilation diagnosis was 6.4 years (range: 0-17.0). Aortic stenosis was present in 14 (82%) [2 (14%) moderate, 8 (57%) severe]; 10 (59%) had aortic regurgitation; 8 (47%) had aortic dilation. The right coronary was dilated in 15 (88%), left main in 6 (35%), and left anterior descending in 1 (6%) with no relationship between leaflet fusion pattern or severity of aortic regurgitation/stenosis on coronary Z-score. Follow-up evaluations were available for 11 (mean 9.3 years, range 1.1-14.8) with coronary Z-scores increasing in 9/11 (82%). Aspirin was used in 10 (59%). There were no deaths or coronary artery thrombosis.
DISCUSSION: In children with bicuspid/unicuspid aortic valves and coronary dilation, the right coronary artery was most frequently involved. Coronary dilation was observed in early childhood and frequently progressed. Antiplatelet medication use was inconsistent, but no child died nor developed thrombosis.
