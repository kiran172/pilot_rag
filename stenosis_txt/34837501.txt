Title: Traumatic retroclival epidural hematoma associated with reversible ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Traumatic retroclival epidural hematoma is rare. It is more common in pediatrics than in adults. Although it has been known that these cases are frequently associated with abducens nerve palsy, internal carotid artery stenosis is rarely found with those hematomas.
CASE REPORT: An 8-year-old girl was transferred to our hospital following a traffic accident. She had clear consciousness with right abducens nerve palsy. Computed tomography revealed the left side of both retroclival hematoma without clival fracture and subarachnoid hemorrhage at the Sylvian fissure. She also had a fracture of left femoral neck and ipsilateral lung contusion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a retroclival hematoma located in the epidural space and severe stenosis of left internal carotid artery (ICA) from the cavernous to supraclinoid portion without evidence of brain contusion. She was managed conservatively, and her right abducens nerve palsy recovered completely without deterioration of other neurological findings. Neuroradiological findings suggested this ICA stenosis as traumatic dissection. She was discharged home 2Â months after the traffic accident.
CONCLUSION: Retroclival epidural hematoma without clival fracture associated with ipsilateral ICA stenosis is extremely rare. Although the exact mechanism of the ICA stenosis remains unclear, cerebral vascular events should be considered in the cases with traumatic retroclival hematoma.
