Title: Different Types of Circulatory Inflammatory Biomarkers Associated with Cerebral Arterial Atherosclerosis and Dolichoectasia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although inflammation is found to be related to arteriopathy pathogenesis, it is yet to be determined the distinct correlations of specific inflammatory biomarker types contributing to different cerebral large vessel diseases. We aimed to investigate the association between multiple inflammatory biomarkers and cerebral atherosclerosis and dolichoectasia in a community-based sample.
METHODS: A total of 960 participants of the Shunyi study were included. A panel of 14 circulatory inflammatory biomarkers was assessed and then grouped in three sets as systemic, endothelial-related, and media-related inflammation, based on underlying different inflammatory cascades. Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS), dolichoectasia estimated by magnetic resonance angiography, and carotid plaques estimated by ultrasound were also performed.
RESULTS: Endothelial-related inflammatory group was related to the presence of ICAS (R2 = 0.215, p = 0.024) and carotid plaques (R2 = 0.342, p = 0.013). Backward stepwise elimination showed that E-selectin was prominent (β = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54-0.85, p = 0.001; β = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68-0.93, p = 0.005). Systemic inflammatory group was associated with an increased basilar artery diameter (R2 = 0.051, p < 0.001), and backward stepwise elimination showed that IL-6 was prominent (β = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03-0.11, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Different types of inflammatory biomarkers were associated with atherosclerosis and dolichoectasia, respectively, implying dissimilar inflammatory processes. Further confirming of their distinct anti-inflammatory roles as potential therapeutic targets is warrant.
