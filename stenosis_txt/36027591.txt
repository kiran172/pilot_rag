Title: Burden of Psychiatric Disorders in Moyamoya Disease: A National Inpatient Perspective From 2007-2014.

Abstract: Objective: Moyamoya disease is a cerebrovascular illness that causes progressive stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches, increasing the risk of stroke. Moyamoya disease is associated with a small number of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The objective of this study was to investigate psychiatric comorbidities and trends in patients with Moyamoya disease in the United States. Methods: US National Inpatient Sample data from 2007 to 2014 were used for analyses in this cross-sectional study. The frequency of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric disorders among adult patients with known Moyamoya disease was assessed. Baseline demographics included in the analysis and diagnostic codes used to identify psychiatric disorders were determined. Categorical and continuous data were assessed using Pearson Ï‡2 test and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22.0. Results: The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities was 38.7% (7,861/20,289). The most common psychiatric disorders were mood disorders (17.8%) and anxiety disorders (8%). Psychosis and drug abuse were present in 4.4% and 4.1% of patients, respectively. Approximately 1 in 4 patients (22.2%) with Moyamoya disease had previously been screened for mental health or substance abuse. The rate of suicide or self-inflicted injury was 0.8%. Conclusions: The impact of Moyamoya disease on mental health services is expected to grow, as the condition's prevalence is increasing at a rate of approximately 1.5- to 2-fold. A multidisciplinary approach between neurology, psychiatry, and primary care can improve screening and management of comorbid psychiatric disorders.
