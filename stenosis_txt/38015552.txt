Title: The role of post-dilatation in carotid MicroNet-covered stent implantation, evaluated using 3D cone-beam CT angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aims to assess the role and safety of post-dilatation in protected carotid artery stenting (PCAS) using the new MicroNet-covered 2nd-generation stent assessed by cone beam CT scans.
METHODS: From March 2020 to March 2022, patients were enrolled in the study according to CT angiography results based on the following criteria: Evidence of 70% to 99% carotid stenosis in asymptomatic patients and 50% to 99% in symptomatic patients, per the NASCET index. Using a FilterWire EZ™ (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) embolic protection system (EPS), MicroNet-covered stent PCAS was performed by two interventional radiologists with at least 8 years of experience in endovascular intervention. Each patient underwent post-dilatation following stent placement. Finally, a third radiologist (not participating in the interventional procedures) evaluated the cone beam CT scans and calculated residual stenosis. Major and minor complications were recorded in the 30 days following the procedure.
RESULTS: A total of 192 patients (121 male, mean age 73±10 years) were included in the study, and all patients received post-dilatation following stent implantation. Technical successes were achieved in all procedures. Adverse events noted in this study were limited to periprocedural transient ischemic attacks that occurred in three out of 192 patients (1.6%) and showed a swift complete recovery. The post-dilatation balloon diameters used in the study were: 5.0 mm (30.3%), 5.5 mm (39.3%) and 6 mm (30.3%). Optimized postdilatation resulted in a significant increase in the final luminal area. Similar improvements were observed in all subtypes of plaque.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-dilatation in protected CAS is safe and induces a significant improvement in the cross-sectional area regardless of the stenotic plaque.
