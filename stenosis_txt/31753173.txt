Title: Aortic Stenosis: What Risks Do the Stresses of Noncardiac Surgery or Pregnancy Pose and How Should They Be Managed?

Abstract: Studies suggest that patients with aortic stenosis have increased risk in pregnancy and delivery and during anesthesia and surgery, although there are significant degrees of uncertainty as to the exact risks and best way to manage such patients. This article reviews current literature regarding impact of aortic stenosis on pregnancy and anesthesia during noncardiac surgery. There are shortcomings in the scientific evidence. Most of the available studies are observational and often retrospective and therefore there is a great deal of bias. This leads to difficulty in drawing conclusions in terms of how to apply the published information to clinical management.
