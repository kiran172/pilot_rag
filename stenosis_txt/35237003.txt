Title: Lumbar Artery Injury Related to Percutaneous Pedicle Screw Insertion.

Abstract: A 75-year-old woman underwent L4-L5 lateral interbody fusion for L4-5 foraminal stenosis with the use of percutaneous pedicle screws. On the day after the surgery, she was in shock. Emergency contrast-enhanced CT showed active extravasation from the 4th lumbar artery with a transverse process fracture. A radiologist performed a successful transarterial embolization, and the patient then began walking training on the 4th day post-surgery. Close attention should be paid to the insertion of a percutaneous pedicle screw, as it may cause a lumbar artery injury; in such a case, transarterial embolization is the preferred treatment.
