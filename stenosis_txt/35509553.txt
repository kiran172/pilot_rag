Title: Dysphagia after occipital cervical fusion for retro-odontoid pseudotumor with ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament (OALL) of the cervical spine is a relatively rare disease. If patients present with dysphagia, hoarseness, and/or dyspnea, they may require surgery.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Over a 7-month period, a 55-year-old female with a history of cerebral palsy developed a progressive quadriparesis accompanied by diffuse sensory loss (i.e., clumsiness of the hand/legs and gait disturbance). The cervical spine X-rays showed atlanto-axial subluxation with instability, while the cervical MRI demonstrated "pseudotumor in the retro-odontoid" region. Following an occipital cervical fusion (C0-C2) surgery, her quadriparesis resolved. Nevertheless, she had persistent dysphagia that worsened over 6 months. Video fluoroscopy revealed severe mechanical stenosis of the pharynx, which was attributed to OALL extending from the C3-C6 levels. Following OALL resection through a right anterior approach utilizing diamond burrs and an ultrasonic bone curette, the dysphagia rapidly resolved.
CONCLUSION: We report a rare case of retro-odontoid pseudotumor successfully treated with a posterior C0-C2 cervical fusion. Additional symptomatic C3-C6 OALL, responsible for progressive dysphagia, was later managed with focal anterior OALL resection.
