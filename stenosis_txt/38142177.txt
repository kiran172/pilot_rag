Title: Assessment of Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis with Non-contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography: Comparison with Digital Subtraction Angiography.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Early diagnosis of transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is crucial for salvaging kidney function and improving patient prognosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate image quality of non-contrast-enhanced MR angiography (NCE-MRA) and the value of NCE-MRA in evaluating TRAS compared to DSA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 60 patients with TRAS confirmed by DSA, the degree of TRAS was assessed using balanced triggered angiography non-contrast-enhanced (B-TRANCE) MR angiography and was compared to that of DSA. Image quality for NCE-MRA was assessed independently by two radiologists. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare NCE-MRA with DSA in assessing TRAS degree. Specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive-predictive value (PPV), and negative-predictive value (NPV) of NCE-MRA for the detection of marked (≥50%) TRAS were calculated.
RESULTS: The image quality of NCE-MRA based on the B-TRANCE technology of transplanted renal arteries was sufficient (excellent in 81.67%, good in 8.33%, moderate in 6.67%, and non-diagnostic in 3.33%) and had a high inter-observer reproducibility (Kappa=0.836). DSA helped identify severe, moderate, and mild stenosis in 6, 32, and 22 arteries, respectively. No significant difference in the extent of TRAS between NCE-MRA and DSA were observed (P = 0.317). The specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV of NCE-MRA in detecting marked (≥50%) TRAS were 90.91%, 100%, 96.55%, 94.74%, and 100%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: NCE-MRA based on B-TRANCE technology has shown promising consistency with DSA in evaluating TRAS and yielding high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in assessing the severity of TRAS.
