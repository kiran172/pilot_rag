Title: Giant aneurysm of the left atrial appendage: A case report of a rare cause of dyspnea in a 55-year old woman.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Congenital aneurysm of the left atrial appendage (LAAA) is a very rare heart with potentially serious and life-threatening complications. Diagnosis is difficult because of the asymptomatic forms, until complications arise. Early surgery is the treatment of choice, but the recommendation today remains unclear.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of congenital giant left atrial appendage aneurysm (LAAA), in a 55-year-old, woman, without any medical or surgical history, who presented with dyspnea, in whom transthoracic echocardiograhpy demonstrated the presence of a giant left atrial aneurysm with thickening of the small mitral valve, a chest scan confirmed the diagnosis of LAAA and a myocardial magnetic resonance imaging revealed the presence of thickened mitral valve with bi-valvular balloonization and annular disjunction, thickening of the basal segments of the inferior and lateral wall, left atrial aneurysm with a dilated right coronary artery. Coronary angiography showed a tortuous coronary artery with a loop in the second segment without any significant stenosis. The patient is currently awaiting surgery.
CONCLUSION: Left atrial appendage aneurysm is a serious illness will likely require years of medical care and follow up in the absence of surgical treatment. The choice and timing of surgical, conservative or catheter treatment always remains a challenge. Our case report shows that medical treatment is a safe approach that will delay or avoid surgery.
