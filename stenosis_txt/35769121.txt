Title: Critical stenosis of axillary artery treated with percutaneous angioplasty and stenting: a case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: Focal axillary artery stenosis or occlusion is a rare occurrence that is most commonly encountered after severe trauma involving the shoulder joint or proximal humerus. Other etiologies that can lead to axillary artery injury or pathology include different vasculitides, radiation arteritis, crutch-injury, and peripheral arterial disease. In this case report, a 70-year-old woman was referred for asymmetrically decreased right brachial artery systolic pressure and right-hand paresthesia with overhead abduction. Further evaluation with imaging revealed critical stenosis of the right axillary artery. The focal stenotic lesion was treated with drug-coated balloon angioplasty and stent placement leading to in-line flow and resolution of symptoms. Duplex exam 6 months post-treatment demonstrated a widely patent right axillary artery stent without stenosis. Biannual clinic visits up to 2 years post stent placement confirmed resolution of symptoms.
