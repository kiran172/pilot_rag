Title: Cardiovascular manifestations of Erdheim-Chester disease: A narrative review with two cases.

Abstract: Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare 'L' (Langerhans) group histiocytic neoplasm that affects a multitude of organ systems, causing osteosclerotic bone lesions, periaortic encasement ('coated' aorta), retroperitoneal fibrosis involving kidneys and ureters ('hairy kidney'), and infiltration of the central nervous system. Cardiovascular involvement can occur in up to 70% of patients and is usually found during computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. When present, cardiovascular symptoms can have wide variability in presentation from asymptomatic to pericarditis, fatal cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, conduction abnormalities, heart failure, renal artery stenosis, and claudication. Cardiac involvement found on imaging includes right atrial pseudotumor, right atrioventricular groove infiltration, and pericardial effusions. ECD can involve the large- and medium-sized arteries, often seen as periarterial thickening (commonly coating the aorta) with stenosis/occlusion. Although more cardiovascular ECD cases have begun to be published in the literature, more data are needed on the outcomes of these patients, as well as how cardiovascular manifestations respond to treatment of ECD.
