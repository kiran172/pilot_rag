Title: Artery of Percheron Occlusion: A Diagnostic Challenge.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Artery of Percheron occlusion is a rare cause of ischaemic stroke characterized by bilateral thalamus infarction. Presentation is varied and non-specific, with the most frequent manifestations being altered level of consciousness, hypersomnolence or altered oculomotor movements. We describe the case of a 37-year-old man hospitalized for hypersomnia and hypomnesia with 3 days of evolution, who was diagnosed with a bilateral thalamus stroke due to artery of Percheron occlusion.
LEARNING POINTS: Stroke is frequently encountered but can present a diagnostic challenge when presentation is non-specific or a lesion is not identified.Artery of Percheron stenosis has a varied and often non-specific presentation, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of these patients.It is important that doctors recognize this entity for timely diagnosis and treatment, and for the best prognosis.
