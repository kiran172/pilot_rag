Title: Case report of experience of misdiagnosis of Currarino syndrome as ovarian cyst.

Abstract: The medical information was collected for Currarino syndrome. The patient had anal surgery for congenital anal stenosis when 2 years old. Clinical manifestations were pelvic cystic mass and low abdominal pain. The pelvic mass was found with a diameter of about 20 cm during the transabdominal exploration. At the second day after operation, the patient complained of neck pain. Neurosurgeon performed surgical treatment and diagnosed it as anterior sacral meningocoele. Currarino syndrome has female pelvic mass, sacral malformation, and congenital anorectal malformation, blindly puncture or drainage before operation should not be permitted.
