Title: Residual Right Coronary Artery Stenosis after Left Main Coronary Artery Intervention Increased the 30-Day Cardiovascular Death and 3-Year Right Coronary Artery Revascularization Rate.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The outcomes of patients with concomitant left main coronary artery (LMCA) and right coronary artery (RCA) diseases are reportedly worse than those with only LMCA disease. To date, only few studies have investigated the clinical impact of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on RCA stenosis during the same hospitalization, in which LMCA disease was treated. This study was aimed at comparing the outcomes between patients with and without right coronary artery intervention during the same hospital course for LMCA intervention.
METHODS AND RESULTS: From a total of 776 patients who were undergoing PCI to treat LMCA disease, 235 patients with concomitant RCA significant stenosis (more than 70% stenosis) were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: 174 patients received concomitant PCI for RCA stenosis during the same hospitalization, in which LMCA disease was treated, and 61 patients did not receive PCI for RCA stenosis. Patients without intervention to the right coronary artery had higher 30-day cardiovascular mortality rates and 3-year RCA revascularization rates compared to those with right coronary artery intervention. Patients without RCA intervention at the same hospitalization did not increase the 30-day total death, 3-year myocardial infarction rate, 3-year cardiovascular death, and 3-year total death.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with LM disease and concomitant above or equal to 70% RCA stenosis, PCI for RCA lesion during the same hospitalization is recommended to reduce the 30-day cardiovascular death and 3-year RCA revascularization rate.
