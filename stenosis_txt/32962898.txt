Title: A nurse- and peer-led psycho-educational intervention to support women with gynaecological cancers receiving curative radiotherapy: The PeNTAGOn randomised controlled trial - ANZGOG 1102.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer is associated with multiple adverse effects. This randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of a combined nurse- and peer-led psycho-educational intervention on psychological distress, preparation for treatment, quality of life, psychosexual function, unmet needs and vaginal stenosis.
METHODS: Eligible women had a confirmed diagnosis of gynaecological cancer, scheduled to receive radiotherapy with curative intent, aged ≥18 years, and able to read and write English. Participants randomly assigned one-to-one to either four nurse-led consultations plus four peer-led telephone sessions, or to usual care. Participants completed study measures at baseline, immediately before first radiotherapy (FU1), and four weeks (FU2), three (FU3), six (FU4), and 12 months (FU5) post radiotherapy. The primary outcomes were psychological distress at FU1 and FU2 measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
RESULTS: Of 840 eligible participants, 625 were approached and 319 (51%) consented; 158 assigned to intervention, 160 to usual care with 1 withdrawing before randomisation. Between-groups differences for primary outcomes were trivial- and small-sized, (both p > 0.05). Notable effects on secondary outcomes favouring the intervention at FU2 included preparation for treatment (sensory/psychological concerns, d = 0.57; and procedural concerns, d = 0.52) and specific needs domains (sexuality needs, d = 0.38; and health system and information needs, d = 0.41).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that a nurse- and peer-led intervention had a beneficial effect on psychological distress compared to usual care. However, improved treatment readiness and lower health system and sexuality needs indicate the intervention may have addressed outcomes known to be important to this population.
