Title: Endoscopic Balloon Dilatation-Based Membrane Resection for Membranous Duodenal Stenosis: A Feasibility and Safety Study (With Video).

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Surgery is generally considered as the first-line therapy for membranous duodenal stenosis (MDS) in children. However, abdominal surgery leaves permanent scars and may even cause intestinal adhesion. Therefore, an effective, safe, and minimally invasive method is urgently needed. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of endoscopic balloon dilatation-based membrane resection (EBD-MR) to treat MDS in children.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with MDS treated with EBD-MR in Shanghai Children's Hospital from May 2016 to August 2021. Primary study outcome was clinical success, defined as weight gain and complete remission of vomiting, without the need for repeat endoscopic or surgical intervention during follow-up. Secondary outcomes included technical success, diameter changes of the membrane opening, and adverse events.
RESULTS: Nineteen children (9 females, mean age 14.5 ± 11.2 months) received endoscopic treatment for MDS, and clinical success was achieved in 18 of 19 patients (94.7%). No bleeding, perforation, and jaundice occurred. Diameters of the membrane opening increased from 2.97 ± 2.87 mm to 9.78 ± 1.27 mm after the treatment, symptoms of vomiting did not reappear during 10-73 months of follow-up, and body mass index of the children increased from 14.9 ± 2.2 kg/m 2 (pre-operation) to 16.2 ± 3.7 kg/m 2 (6 months after operation). One patient required surgical revision because of existence of a second web; three patients received 2-3 sessions of endoscopic treatment to obtain the final remission.
CONCLUSIONS: The EBD-MR technique is safe, effective, and feasible for MDS, which provided an excellent alternative to surgical management for the disease in pediatric patients.
