Title: Acquired Stenosis of the External Ear Canal.

Abstract: Acquired stenosis of the external ear canal (ASEEC) is a relatively uncommon condition. Stenosis or narrowing of the external ear canal (EEC) occurs lateral to the tympanic membrane resulting in a skin lined blind canal. Recurrent otorrhea, and conductive hearing loss are typical clinical features. Although ASEEC can be due to different etiologies, a common pathogenesis, namely an inflammatory cascade, has been implicated. Clinical evaluation, audiogram, and Computed tomography (CT scan) form the mainstay of diagnosis. Surgery is the primary modality for treatment. Restenosis is the most common postsurgical complication.
