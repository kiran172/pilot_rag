Title: [An updated review of the mechanism of fibrosis in acquired laryngotrachealstenosis].

Abstract: Acquired laryngotracheal stenosis is a laryngeal obstruction disease due to pathologic scar formation. Although acquired laryngotracheal stenosis is hypothesized to be related to fibrosis, its specific mechanisms have yet to be characterized. This article reviews the latest research progress on the mechanisms of laryngotracheal fibrosis, including metabolic changes, immune cell dysregulation, extracellular matrix changes and microbiota.
