Title: Association study between polymorphisms in MIA3, SELE, SMAD3 and CETP genes and coronary artery disease in an Iranian population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common heart disease. Several studies have shown association between some polymorphism in different genes with CAD. Finding this association can be used in order to early diagnosis and prevention of CAD.
METHOD: 101 CAD patients with ≥ 50% luminal stenosis of any coronary vessel as case group and 111 healthy individuals as control group were selected. the polymorphisms were evaluated by ARMS-PCR and RFLP-PCR methods.
RESULT: The results of this study show that there is no significant association between rs17228212, rs17465637, and rs708272 and risk of CAD. But there is significant association between risk of CAD and rs5355 (p-value = 0.022) and rs3917406 (p-value = 0.006) in total cases, and rs5882 (p-value = 0.001) in male cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed a significant interaction between CETP SNPs and CETP activity for affecting HDL-C levels. The SELE gene is a known cell adhesion molecule with a significant role in inflammation. Studies about possible linkage between SELE gene polymorphisms and the development of CAD are conflicting. We have found a significant association between polymorphisms of SELE gene and risk of CAD.
