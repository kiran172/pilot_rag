Title: CT-based radiographic measurements and effectiveness estimates of full-endoscopic surgery in thoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of ligamentum flavum.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Evaluate the effectiveness of posterior percutaneous full-endoscopic technique for patients with thoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of ligamentum flavum (TOLF).
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted for 16 patients with TOLF, who were treated with posterior endoscopic technique from 2017 to 2019. The sagittal and cross-sectional CT images are used to measure the area of ossified ligamentum and evaluate the decompression of surgery, respectively. The effectiveness was evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS), modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (mJOA), The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Macnab efficacy evaluation.
RESULTS: The average area of TOLF on sagittal and cross-sectional CT images in the 16 patients was (116.62 ± 32.72) mm2 and (141.59 ± 27.25) mm2 preoperatively, (15.99 ± 12.54) mm2 and (11.72 ± 8.64) mm2 at 3 days after the operation, (16.78 ± 11.49) mm2 and (10.82 ± 7.57) mm2 postoperative 1 year, respectively. The invasive proportion of spinal canal at preoperative sagittal and cross-sectional CT images was (48.10 ± 10.04) % and (57.58 ± 11.37) %, which decreased to (6.83 ± 4.48) % and (4.40 ± 3.01) % at the final follow-up. The average score of mJOA, VAS and ODI improved. The excellent and good rate was 87.50% according to Macnab evaluation. Compared with preoperative, differences in areas of TOLF, proportions of spinal canal, and clinical assessments of postoperative 3 days and 1 year were all statistically significant. Two cases of dural tear were observed.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic surgery has a good clinical effect on TOLF, which has the advantage of less trauma to the paraspinal muscles and no impact on the spinal structure. The CT-based radiographic measurements can quantitatively evaluate the degree of spinal canal stenosis in TOLF.
