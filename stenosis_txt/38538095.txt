Title: Infectious aortitis and managing it at a community military hospital.

Abstract: Infectious aortitis is a rare disease process which can be of fungal, viral or bacterial aetiology. This disease process is often incidentally found during concomitant infectious processes, likely due to haematogenous spread. Common sources are from cardiac, genitourinary and gastroenterologic sources. CT imaging of the aorta is essential in identifying physiological changes-wall thickness changes, ectasia and stenosis. We present a case of a female in her early 60s with a medical history of cardiomyopathy with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, who was initially admitted for acute cholecystitis complicated by the development of gallstone pancreatitis. Imaging evaluation incidentally noted findings consistent with aortitis with a penetrating ulcer, and blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, confirming her diagnosis of infectious aortitis. She was started on intravenous antibiotics, required preoperative nutritional optimisation, and subsequently underwent an open aortic resection and aortoiliac reconstruction with rifampin-soaked Dacron graft.
