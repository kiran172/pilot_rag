Title: Evaluation of Quality of Life and Self-reported Complications in Patients With Clean Intermittent Catheterization: An Observational Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study sought to determine health-related quality of life and self-reported complications associated with clean intermittent catheterization (CIC).
DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional study.
SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The target population was patients cared for by the urology department at Hospital 12 de Octubre in Madrid, Spain, undergoing CIC for chronic urinary retention of any etiology (neurogenic bladder dysfunction, neobladder, and other). The sample comprised 50 respondents with a mean age of 49 years; a majority (66%, n = 33) were female. Participants performed an average of 4 CICs.
METHODS: All participants completed the ISC-Q (Intermittent Self-Catheterization Questionnaire) and a questionnaire about CIC-associated complications. Data were collected in February 2019.
RESULTS: A vast majority of respondents (98%, n = 49) indicated preparation for catheterization was simple, and 76% (n = 38) indicated the catheter was easy to insert. One in 5 (20%, n = 10) considered carrying catheters and supplies inconvenient, though 58% (n = 29) indicated it was easy to dispose of the catheters outside the home. Most respondents (98%, n = 49) indicated they felt self-conscious about their need to self-catheterize, and 16% (n = 8) felt that CIC created limitations when visiting friends and family. The most frequent complication was symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs); participants reported an average of 1.7 UTIs in the last year. Additional complications, such as epididymo-orchitis, urethral stenosis, and urethral bleeding, were reported by less than 5% (n = 2) of participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants managed by CIC for chronic urinary retention of any cause reported acceptable levels of satisfaction with the procedure. The reported incidence of complications was low, except for UTIs.
