Title: [Review of Research Progress in Biliary Substitutes].

Abstract: Research and development of artificial biliary substitutes is an indispensable part of modern biliary surgery, bearing great clinical significance on the recovery of the normal functions of the biliary system. The implantation of artificial biliary substitutes may cause the blockage or stenosis of the biliary duct at the transplantation site, which is the most urgent problem in the research of artificial biliary substitutes. The fundamental cause of the problem is tissue hyperplasia caused by chronic inflammatory stimulation of artificial biliary substitutes. The regeneration of new bile duct tissue at the transplantation site can provide a solution to this problem. By looking at the literature from China and abroad, this paper reviewed the research and development of non-degradable artificial bile duct, degradable artificial bile duct and tissue-engineered artificial bile duct in order to provide reference for the further development of biliary replacements. Future studies should focus on the rapid formation of biliary epithelial layer on the tissue-engineered artificial biliary wall, the promotion of new biliary tissue formation, and the regulation of the degradation performance and mechanical properties of artificial biliary duct in order to fundamentally solve the problems encountered in the research of artificial biliary substitutes and accelerate the development of artificial biliary duct.
