Title: [Safety and effectiveness of Neuroform Atlas stent-assisted coiling in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms: a single-center observational study].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the safety and effectiveness of Neuroform Atlas stent-assisted coiling in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center observational study of 77 patients who underwent endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms using the Neuroform Atlas device at the Department of Neurology, People's Liberation Army General Hospital from July 2020 to May 2022. There were 34 males and 43 females, with a median (range) age of 59 (23-81) years. The degree and effect of aneurysm embolization were evaluated by modified Raymond grading post procedure and after 6 months. Complications occurring during the perioperative period were recorded. Vaso computed tomography was performed immediately after the operation to assess stent opening and adherence. Digital subtraction angiography was performed 6 months after discharge and the aneurysm was classified as cured, stable, or recurrent. Results: A total of 87 Atlases were successfully released in 77 cases. Angiography performed immediately after the embolization revealed 19 (24.7%) modified Raymond grade Ⅰ, 10 (13.0%) grade Ⅱ, and 48 (62.3%) grade Ⅲa cases. Three perioperative complications were observed including thrombotic events in 2 cases and stent migration in 1 case. A follow-up angiogram was available for 47 aneurysms, and showed that modified Raymond grade Ⅰ occlusion was achieved in 38 (80.9%) cases, grade Ⅱ in 2 (4.3%) cases, and grade Ⅲa in 7 (14.9%) cases. At the 6-month follow-up, 38 patients were cured and 7 were stable, whereas 2 patients experienced a recurrence of aneurysm. Stenosis of the parent artery occurred in 3 (6.4%) cases, including 2 at the head and 1 inside the stent. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary study suggest that Neuroform Atlas stent-assisted coiling has a high occlusion rate and low incidence of complications in the endovascular treatment of aneurysms. However, the effectiveness of this procedure for large aneurysms and long-term outcomes require further investigation.
