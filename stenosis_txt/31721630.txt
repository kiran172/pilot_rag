Title: Laparoscopic Approach of the Obstruction of the Lower Third of the Esophagus in Children.

Abstract: Objective: To review the diagnostic methodology in pediatric patients with obstruction of the lower third of the esophagus as well as minimally invasive therapeutic options. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study carried out reviewing records of children with esophageal obstruction diagnostic, from 2000 to 2018. They were divided into Group I stenosis secondary to reflux; Group II achalasia; and Group III embryonic remnants. Results: Thirty-three patients. Group I: 7; esophageal barium swallow irregular stenosis of the distal third and endoscopy irregular stenosis in 7. Treated with laparoscopic fundoplication 2, Collis Nissen 5. Group II: 22 patients, age X = 11.55 years. All with dysphagia and symmetrical stenosis of esophagogastric junction. Fifteen underwent manometry and all underwent intraoperative endoscopy. All had laparoscopic myotomy, with 2 perforations and no conversions, 2 patients had subsequent dysphagia to solids, and they did not need esophageal dilatation. Group III: 4 patients, stenosis was above esophagogastric junction. On endoscopy, inflammation was present in all 3 with irregular esophagogastric junction and difficulty passing endoscope. Three patients underwent laparoscopic resection and anastomosis. One patient leaked and developed a fistula. One patient has not been operated upon as yet. Conclusions: In those patients, the best surgical option depends upon the diagnosis. Esophageal barium studies and endoscopy allow discerning among them.
