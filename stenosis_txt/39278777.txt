Title: Association between the proportion of HDL-Cholesterol subclasses and the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Past research has shown an inverse correlation between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and coronary heart disease (CHD), while recent studies have shown that extremely high or low HDL levels increase the risk of cardiovascular death.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between HDL subtypes and the degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS: This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Ultimately, we included 1,200 adult participants with AMI hospitalized from 2017 to 2023. Patients were classified into mild and moderate-severe groups according to their Gensini score. Restricted cubic spline and multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between HDL subclasses and the severity of coronary stenosis.
RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratios (ORs), 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), and p values for HDL subclasses in the multivariate logistic model (adjusted for age, gender, hypertension status, diabetes status, stroke status, and kidney disease status) were as follows: HDL-2b: 0.97 (0.95-1.00, p= 0.018) and HDL-3: 0.98 (0.97-0.99, p= 0.008). Subgroup analysis revealed that HDL-3 exhibited a statistically significant impact on the severity of coronary stenosis among individuals aged <75 years of age and among men, and the influence of HDL-2b on the severity of coronary stenosis was statistically significant only in individuals aged â‰¥75 years.
CONCLUSION: The relationship between reduced levels of HDL-2b and HDL-3 and the risk of coronary stenosis exhibited a linear pattern and was significantly modified by age. Subgroup analysis identified specific populations that warrant attention regarding HDL-2b and HDL-3.
