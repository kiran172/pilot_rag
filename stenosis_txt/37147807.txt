Title: [Clinical features and CT findings of fibrosing mediastinitis associated pulmonary hypertension].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the clinical features and CT findings of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with fibrosing mediastinitis (FM). Methods: Thirteen patients with FM diagnosed between September 2015 and June 2022 were studied retrospectively, including patients with PH (FM-PH group) and patients without PH (FM group) confirmed on right heart catheterization. The t test of two independent samples, Mann-Whitney U rank sum and Fisher's test were used to compare the general information, symptoms, laboratory examination, right ventricular and pulmonary artery measurement data and pulmonary artery CT findings between the two groups, respectively. Results: Compared with the 7 FM patients aged 28-79 (60.00±17.69) years, the 6 patients in the FM-PH group, aged from 60 to 82 (68.83±8.35) years, had more peripheral edema, lower percentage of PaO<sub>2</sub>, wider inner diameters of pulmonary artery and right ventricle, a higher ratio of right ventricle and left ventricular transverse diameter, faster tricuspid regurgitation velocity and higher estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (P&lt;0.05). There were no differences in BNP levels and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion between groups (P&gt;0.05). Of the 6 patients with PH, 5 had precapillary PH and 1 had mixed PH. Except that the pulmonary vascular resistance in patients of the FM-PH group was significantly higher than that in the FM group (P&lt;0.05), there were no significant differences in cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure between the two groups. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) showed pulmonary artery and vein stenosis. Patients in the FM-PH group had more severe stenosis and occlusion of pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein (P&lt;0.05), and more involvement of multiple pulmonary veins (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The clinical manifestation of FM complicated with PH is related to the degree of involvement of pulmonary artery, vein and airway. It is recommended that the disease be evaluated in combination with multiple parameters such as clinical manifestations, cardiac ultrasound, right cardiac catheter and CTPA.
