Title: Editor's Choice - Durability of Open Repair of Juxtarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: A Multicentre Retrospective Study in Five French Academic Centres.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: With a focus on renal function, the goal of this multicentre study was to assess peri-operative complications and late mortality of open surgical repair (OSR) of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (JRAAA).
METHODS: From February 2005 to December 2015, 315 consecutive patients undergoing elective OSR of a JRAAA in five French academic centres were evaluated retrospectively. The definition of JRAAA was an aortic aneurysm extending up to but not involving the renal arteries, i.e., a short neck <10 mm. End points included post-operative death; acute kidney injury (AKI) defined by the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of function, End stage renal disease) criteria; and long term follow-up with freedom from chronic renal decline (CRD) and any graft related complications. Factors predictive of renal insufficiency were determined by multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: Of 315 patients, 292 (92.6%) were men (mean age 68 ± 8 years), and 73 (23.2%) had baseline chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The level of aortic clamping was supracoeliac (n = 11), suprarenal (n = 235), or inter-renal above one renal artery (n = 69). The mean duration of renal artery clamping was 24 ± 7 min (range 10-55 min). Eleven patients (3.5%) presented with a renal artery stenosis that was treated conservatively. Perfusion of the renal arteries with a chilled Ringer's solution was used selectively in seven patients (2.2%). The overall 30 day mortality was 0.9% (three patients). AKI occurred in 53 patients (16.8%). Nine patients (2.9%) required temporary dialysis and one patient required chronic dialysis. Predictors of AKI were pre-existing CKD (odds ratio [OR] 2.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-4.48; p = .021], diabetes (OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.48-6.71; p = .003), hypertension (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.33-8.57; p = .01), and age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10; p = .014). The level of aortic clamping and duration of renal artery clamping were not associated with an increased risk of AKI. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimate was 71% ± 5% at five years. Predictors of CRD during follow up were AKI (hazard ratio [HR] 15.81, 95% CI 5.26-47.54; p = .001), diabetes (HR 4.56, 95% CI 1.57-13.17; p = .005), and pre-existing CKD (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.19-7.20; p = .019), with freedom from CRD of 89% ± 3% at five years. Surveillance imaging was obtained by computed tomography angiography in 290 patients (92.6%) at a mean follow up of 4.3 ± 2.4 years. Renal artery occlusion occurred in two patients (0.7% of imaged renal arteries). One patient (1.9%) had an aneurysm of the visceral aorta and eight patients had a descending thoracic aneurysm.
CONCLUSIONS: This multicentre study suggests that in fit patients, open JRAAA repair can be performed with acceptable operative risk with durable results in terms of both graft integrity and preservation of renal function.
