Title: Atrial fibrillation as a novel risk factor for retinal stroke: A protocol for a population-based retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO; retinal stroke or eye stroke) is an under-recognized, disabling form of acute ischemic stroke which causes severe visual loss in one eye. The classical risk factor for CRAO is ipsilateral carotid stenosis; however, nearly half of patients with CRAO do not have high-grade carotid stenosis, suggesting that other cardiovascular risk factors may exist for CRAO. Specifically, prior studies have suggested that cardioembolism, driven by underlying atrial fibrillation, may predispose patients to CRAO. We describe the design of an observational, population-based study in this protocol. We evaluate two specific objectives: 1) To determine if atrial fibrillation is an independent risk factor for CRAO after adjusting for medical and cardiovascular risk; 2) To determine if use of oral anticoagulation can modify the risk of CRAO for patients with atrial fibrillation. This protocol lays out our strategy for cohort definition, case and control definition, comorbidity ascertainment, and statistical methods.
