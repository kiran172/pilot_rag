Title: Post-chemotherapy Gastric Obstruction in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: Endoscopic Dilation Can Fix It!

Abstract: Treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is based on immunochemotherapy with overall good outcomes. Complications related to the treatment or the disease itself can occur during follow-up. We herein report a case of a 37-year-old male who was diagnosed with stage IV gastric DLBCL. Subsequently, he underwent R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisone) chemotherapy. After six cycles of treatment, complete remission has been achieved. But afterwards, the patient presented with a symptomatic gastric obstruction related to a tight stenosis in the antro-fundic junction. Endoscopic dilation was performed and multiple macrobiopsies within the stenosis were taken. Pathological examination concluded to the fibrous character of the stricture. In cases of post-chemotherapy obstruction in gastric DLBCL, endoscopic treatment should be attempted carefully in patients with no evidence of active lymphoma. Diagnosis of fibrosis can avoid surgery and its morbidity.
