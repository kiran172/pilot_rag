Title: Comparison of long-term survival after endovascular treatment versus medical therapy in patients with Takayasu's arteritis and pulmonary artery stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: There is currently no unanimous consensus on the treatment of Takayasu's arteritis (TAK) involving the pulmonary artery, and there are very few related studies that compare the efficacies of drug-based therapy and revascularization. This study aimed to compare the long-term survival outcomes after endovascular treatment and medical therapy in TAK patients with pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS) and pulmonary hypertension (PH).
METHODS: A total of 129 TAK patients with PAS and PH (women, 101; men, 28; mean age, 40.5 years) were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Data on clinical features, treatment regimens, and mortality, were collected. Patients were categorised into medical treatment (n=75) and percutaneous transluminal pulmonary angioplasty (PTPA; n=54: 52 with PTPA and 2 with stent implantation) groups. The primary endpoint was cardiac mortality. The median follow-up time was 54 (40.5, 58.5) months.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sex, age, comorbidities, disease activity, World Health Organization (WHO) function classification, and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) between the two groups at baseline. Compared with the conservative treatment group, cardiac mortality, WHO functional class, and 6MWD were significantly improved in the PTPA group (p=0.031, p<0.001, and p=0.004, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Under basic medicine, PTPA therapy improves the long-term survival of TAK patients with PAS and PH compared to medical treatment alone. PTPA may be a promising modality for the TAK patients with PAS and PH.
