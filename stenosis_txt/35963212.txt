Title: Relationship between annular calcification of plaques in the carotid sinus and perioperative hemodynamic disorder in carotid angioplasty and stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between annular plaque calcification in the carotid sinus and perioperative hemodynamic disorder (HD) in carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS).
METHODS: The clinical data of 49 patients undergoing CAS due to narrowing of the carotid sinus were retrospectively analyzed. All patients had preoperative carotid computed tomography angiography (CTA) and were divided into HD and non-HD groups based on the occurrence of HD in the perioperative period of CAS. HD was defined as persistent bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats per min) or persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) in the perioperative period and lasting for at least 1 h. The baseline data, including the degree of carotid artery stenosis, plaque length, plaque thickness, calcified plaque morphologies (i.e., plaque circumferential angle: < 90° defined as dotted calcification; 90°-180° defined as arcuate calcification; > 180° defined as annular calcification), contralateral carotid artery conditions, balloon diameter, and stent types, were compared between the two groups. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for the occurrence of HD.
RESULTS: Among the 49 patients undergoing CAS, 14 (28.57%) developed perioperative HD, and 35 did not. Annular calcification was more common in the patients in the HD group than in the non-HD group. No significant differences in the probabilities of dotted and arcuate calcifications were found between the two groups (p > 0.05). The duration of continuous dopamine consumption in the HD group was 9-71 h. The average hospital stay of the HD group (10.14 ± 4.17 days) was significantly longer than that of the non-HD group (6.57 ± 1.9 days; p < 0.001). Patients in the HD group had significantly more pronounced lumen stenosis (p = 0.033) and longer plaque length (p = 0.034) than those in the non-HD group. After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis showed that the presence of annular plaque calcification was an independent predictor of HD (odds ratio: 7.68, 95% confidence interval: 1.46-40.37, p = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of annular plaque calcification in the carotid sinus was an independent risk factor for perioperative HD in CAS. Preoperative carotid CTA assists with the early identification of high-risk patients who may develop HD.
