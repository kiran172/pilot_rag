Title: Esophageal stent migration leading to distal small bowel perforation.

Abstract: Covered oesophageal stents are often used to treat dysphagia in patients with inoperable oesophageal cancer. Stent migration is a well-known but usually benign complication. We report the case of a patient whose esophageal stent migrated into the distal ileum with perforation hereof. A laparoscopic stent extraction and intestinal repair was necessary to treat the perforation.
