Title: Comparative Analysis of the Feasibility of Myocardial Blood Flow Index Versus CT-FFR in the Diagnosis of Suspected Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Using fluid dynamic modeling, noninvasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data provides better anatomic and functional information than CCTA, with a high diagnostic and discriminatory value for diagnosing hemodynamically significant lesions. Myocardial blood flow index (MBFI) based on CCTA is a physiological parameter that reflects myocardial ischemia. Thus, exploring the relationship between computed tomography derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and MBFI could be clinically significant. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between CT-FFR and MBFI and to analyze the feasibility of MBFI differing from CT-FFR in diagnosing suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: Data from 61 patients (35 males, mean age: 59.2 ± 10.02 years) with suspected CAD were retrospectively analyzed, including the imaging data of CCTA, CT-FFR, and data of invasive coronary angiography performed within one week after hospitalization. CT-FFR and MBFI were calculated, and the correlation between MBFI or CT-FFR and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) was evaluated. Using ICA (value ≥ 0.70) as the gold standard and determining the optimal cutoff value via a diagnostic test, the diagnostic performance of MBFI or CT-FFR was evaluated.
RESULTS: MBFI and CT-FFR were negatively correlated with ICA (r = -0.3670 and -0.4922, p = 0.0036 and 0.0001, respectively). Using ICA (value of ≥ 0.70) the gold standard, the optimal cutoff value was 0.115 for MBFI, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.833 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.716-0.916, Z = 5.357, p &lt; 0.0001); using ICA (value of ≥ 0.70) the gold standard, the optimal cutoff value was 0.80 for CT-FFR, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.759 (95% CI: 0.632-0.859, Z = 3.665, p = 0.0002). No significant difference was observed between the AUCs of CT-FFR and MBFI (Z = 0.786, p = 0.4316).
CONCLUSIONS: MBFI based on CCTA can be used to evaluate myocardial ischemia similar to CT-FFR in suspected CAD; however, it should be noted that CT-FFR is a functional index based on the anatomical stenosis of the coronary artery, whereas MBFI is a physiological index reflecting myocardial mass remodeling.
