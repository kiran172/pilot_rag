Title: Late presentation of middle aortic syndrome complicated with severe aortic regurgitation; the role of endovascular intervention as a bridging for Bentall surgery.

Abstract: Middle aortic syndrome presents with segment narrowing of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. A common manifestation is uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to severe aortic regurgitation in the long term. We have presented the case of a 31-year-old woman with worsening heart failure symptoms and longstanding uncontrolled hypertension. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic regurgitation. Aortic computed tomography showed severe stenosis of the aorta at the diaphragm level. Stent graft implantation was performed, followed by Bentall surgery 1Â year later. Endovascular stent graft implantation of the descending aorta can be used safely as a bridging surgery for the Bentall procedure to reduce the patient's blood pressure and relieve heart failure symptoms.
