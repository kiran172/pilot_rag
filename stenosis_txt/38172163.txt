Title: Dataset for Automatic Region-based Coronary Artery Disease Diagnostics Using X-Ray Angiography Images.

Abstract: X-ray coronary angiography is the most common tool for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. It involves the injection of contrast agents into coronary vessels using a catheter to highlight the coronary vessel structure. Typically, multiple 2D X-ray projections are recorded from different angles to improve visualization. Recent advances in the development of deep-learning-based tools promise significant improvement in diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease. However, the limited public availability of annotated X-ray coronary angiography image datasets presents a challenge for objective assessment and comparison of existing tools and the development of novel methods. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel ARCADE dataset with 2 objectives: coronary vessel classification and stenosis detection. Each objective contains 1500 expert-labeled X-ray coronary angiography images representing: i) coronary artery segments; and ii) the locations of stenotic plaques. These datasets will serve as a benchmark for developing new methods and assessing existing approaches for the automated diagnosis and risk assessment of coronary artery disease.
