Title: Handheld Osteotome Laminectomy in Cadavers and a Case Study.

Abstract: Laminectomy is a commonly performed surgery to decompress the spinal canal to relieve spinal canal stenosis secondary to a variety of etiologies such as degenerative spinal changes, fractures, tumors, vascular lesions, and infections. Advances in technologies have allowed for more precise osteotomies and offer more protection to nearby structures; however, these technologies may not always be available at some facilities. To the best of the authors' knowledge, we describe an innovative technique to perform laminectomy using a handheld osteotome, which is widely available and at low cost. Our experience with cadavers and a case study shows that the technique appears to be safe and effective and may have the potential to reduce the procedure length of a laminectomy.
