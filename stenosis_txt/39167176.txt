Title: Adherence to EAT-Lancet reference diet and risk of premature coronary artery diseases: a multi-center case-control study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In 2019, a globally sustainable dietary pattern that primarily emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods was proposed by the EAT-Lancet Commission. However, there is limited evidence regarding the association of this diet with coronary events.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between the EAT-Lancet Reference Diet (ELD) and premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) risk and its severity.
METHODS: This multi-center, case-control study was conducted within the framework of the Iran premature coronary artery disease (I-PAD). A total of 3185 participants aged under 70 years in women and 60 years in men were included. Cases were those whose coronary angiography showed stenosis ≥ 75% in at least one vessel or ≥ 50% in the left main artery (n = 2033), while the controls had normal angiography results (n = 1152). Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Logistic regression was utilized to examine the association between ELD and presence of PCAD.
RESULTS: Compared with individuals in the first quartile, those in the highest quartile of ELD (OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.39; P for trend < 0.001) and ELD calculated with minimum intake (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.52; P < 0.001) had lower risk of PCAD. Individuals in the highest quartile of adherence to the ELD and ELD with minimum intake had 78% and 72% lower risk of having severe PCAD compared with those in the lowest quartile, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An inverse association was observed between adherence to the ELD and PCAD risk and its severity. Large-scale prospective cohort studies are required to confirm these findings.
