Title: Comparison of Chronic Sialadenitis Symptom Burden in Patients With Sialolithiasis Versus Stenosis Before and After Sialendoscopy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To define symptomatology and responses to treatment in chronic sialadenitis from sialolithiasis versus duct stenosis and establish a minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) in the validated Obstructive Salivary Problem Impact Test (SPIT).
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, cohort.
SETTING: Tertiary-care center.
METHODS: Patients completed the SPIT questionnaire at presentation and 3 to 6 months after surgery. SPIT scores and domains were compared between patients with symptomatic sialolithiasis and those with stenosis of a major salivary gland.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients completed the SPIT, including 43 (54%) with sialolithiasis and 36 (46%) with stenosis. Stenosis patients displayed greater baseline scores compared to sialolithiasis patients (45.4 ± 19.9 vs 33.3 ± 18.5, P < .013). Frequency and severity of gland swelling and pain (21.9 ± 8.9 vs 17.1 ± 9.6, P = .02) and functional/psychosocial impact subscores were greater in the stenosis versus sialolithiasis groups (18.0 ± 10.9 vs 11.3 ± 9.4, P < .01). For 43 patients who underwent surgical intervention, SPIT scores improved at 3 to 6 months postoperatively in all domains (-18.6 ± 19.4, P < .01). Degree of improvement did not differ between sialolithiasis versus stenosis groups (-22.0 ± 20.9 vs -13.3 ± 15.8, P = .13). The MCID in SPIT score was found to be -13 points. A postoperative SPIT score of less than 10 suggested symptom resolution.
CONCLUSION: When compared to sialolithiasis, chronic salivary obstruction from stenosis is associated with greater baseline SPIT scores, indicating poorer sialadenitis-related quality of life due to greater symptom frequency and functional impact. Based on SPIT survey outcomes, a score decrease of 13 points or SPIT score <10 represent significant symptom improvement.
