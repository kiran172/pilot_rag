Title: Endovascular Treatment of an Extensive Iliocaval and Renal Vein Thrombosis Secondary to Inferior Vena Cava Stenosis and May-Thurner Type Iliac Vein Compression: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 23-year-old presenting with an acute history of back pain, leg swelling, and claudication was diagnosed with an extensive iliocaval thrombosis, extending from the popliteal veins into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and left renal vein. He was treated with a combination of endovascular techniques, including EKOS and AngioJet. An underlying congenital IVC stenosis and May-Thurner type iliac vein compression were subsequently treated with venoplasty and stenting. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of EKOS for renal vein thrombosis and we highlight the complementary nature of different endovascular techniques for managing complex venous thrombotic disease.
