Title: Trajectory of pulmonary congestion during TAVR.

Abstract: Patients with severe aortic stenosis often experience pulmonary congestion due to incremental afterload. The trajectory of pulmonary fluid volume during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains uncertain. Remote dielectric sensing (ReDS) is a recently introduced device for non-invasive quantification of lung fluid volume without expert techniques. We evaluated the trajectory of ReDS values during TAVR and its prognostic implications. Patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent ReDS measurements upon admission and at the index discharge after TAVR between 2021 and 2022 were eligible. They were followed up until August 2023. The primary focus was on the trajectory of ReDS values during TAVR, with secondary consideration given to its impact on the composite of death or all-cause readmission after TAVR. A total of 57 patients were included. Median age was 84 years and 24 were male. ReDS value remained unchanged after TAVR, changing from 27% (IQR 24%, 29%) to 26% (IQR 24%, 30%) (p = 0.65). ReDS value did not decrease in 23 (40%) patients. The presence of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation were associated with no decrease in ReDS value. This lack of decrease in ReDS value was linked to death or all-cause readmission after TAVR, with an age-adjusted hazard ratio of 3.40 (95% confidence interval 1.01-11.4, p = 0.048). The degree of lung fluid amount did not decrease in 40% of TAVR candidates during the procedure. The lack of decrease in lung fluid amount was associated with mortality and morbidity after TAVR. The next concern is to establish therapeutic strategy for patients with residual pulmonary congestion after TAVR.
