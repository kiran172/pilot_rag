Title: Inferior vena cava occlusion in retroperitoneal fibrosis and exogenous testosterone administration.

Abstract: Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) causing large vessel stenosis and thrombosis is rare but well-described. We describe a 50-year-old man with rapid progression of central venous thrombosis in the presence of RPF and exogenous testosterone use. Therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated and catheter directed thrombolysis was performed after placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Repeat venogram revealed severe focal retrohepatic IVC stenosis, which was treated with serial venoplasty and stenting. Clinical improvement was significant 48Â hours after intervention. This case represents a rare presentation of IVC occlusion in the setting of RPF and exogenous testosterone administration successfully treated with endovascular interventions.
