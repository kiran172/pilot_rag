Title: Isolated Reoperative Tricuspid Valve Surgery: Outcomes and Risk Assessment.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe patient characteristics and post-operative outcomes, including early and late mortality, defined by death within 30 days and after 30 days post-surgery, respectively, as well as 20-year survival after isolated reoperative tricuspid surgery.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 169 patients who underwent isolated reoperative tricuspid valve surgery at our institution (between 1997 and 2000) and describe post-surgical outcomes including intraoperative, early and late mortality. All patients included completed 21 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: The majority of our patients were females 147 (87%) with the mean age of 45.9 ± 12.9 years. The mean body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was 27.4 ± 6.0. Previous cardiac surgeries included tricuspid valve surgeries in 169 (100%) patients, with bioprosthetic valves, mechanical valves, annual rings and tricuspid repair surgeries utilized in 37 (21.9%), 21 (12.4%), 38 (22.4%) and 73 (43.2%) patients, respectively. The indication for previous tricuspid surgery was rheumatic heart disease in 154 (91.5%) patients.The most common cause of reoperative valvular surgery was tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in 139 (82.2%), with 66% of patients having severe TR. Other reasons for reoperative surgery included tricuspid stenosis 22 (13%) and dehiscence 8 (4.7%). For the redo surgery, 125 (74%) patients underwent Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TVR), 90 (53%) of whom received bioprosthetic valves while 35 (21%) received mechanical valves. Forty-four patients (26%) underwent Tricuspid Valve Repair. Mortality within 30 days of surgery was 11.3% (20 patients) and 11.4% after 30 days, with 20 years survival being about 80%.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, reoperation for failed isolated tricuspid valve replacement or repair was associated with reasonable mortality and good survival rate over long period of time.
