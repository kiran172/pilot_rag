Title: Late onset of coronary ostial stenosis following surgical aortic valve replacement in a patient with anomalous origin of the right coronary artery.

Abstract: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with anomalous origination of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus is associated with risk for myocardial ischemia during the perioperative period. [1] However, iatrogenic coronary ostial stenosis (ICOS) generally occurs within the first 6 months after SAVR. We present an unusual case of a 74-year-old man with anomalous origination of the right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus, who developed effort angina due to ICOS 19 months following SAVR and ascending aorta replacement. Angiography and computed tomography were utilized to perform a comparison before and after the procedure. From the results, it was evident that the flattened mild stenosis preoperatively was caused by anomalous origination of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus and progressed to severe stenosis by ICOS after the procedure. The patient was successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. &lt;Learning objective: Surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with anomalous origination of a coronary artery from the opposite sinus may lead to coronary ischemic events due to iatrogenic coronary ostial stenosis in the long term. Percutaneous coronary intervention is a reasonable treatment option for the patients with iatrogenic coronary ostial stenosis after surgical aortic valve replacement.&gt;.
