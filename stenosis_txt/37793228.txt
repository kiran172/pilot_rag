Title: Reversed midgut rotation revealed by cecal volvulus in the elderly: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Reverse midgut rotation constituted an extremely rare intestinal malrotation. Its recognition in the elderly was challenging as in our case revealed by cecal volvulus.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-years old man consulted for diffuse abdominal, vomiting, bowel movement and passing gas inability. Computed tomography concluded to cecal and last ileum loop volvulus with small intestine dilation upstream. Emergent laparotomy confirmed the existence of a cecal volvulus associated to a reversed midgut rotation non diagnosed at computed tomography before surgery. A Ladd' procedure was carried out. An isoperistaltic side-by-side ileocolic manual anastomosis was performed.
DISCUSSION: Our case illustrated an extremely rare reversed midgut rotation in the elderly accounting for 2 to 7Â % of all embryologic midgut malrotation anomalies. It could be revealed by mobile right colon volvulus as in our case, whole midgut volvulus, retro-arterial tunnel pressure transverse colon stenosis, or Ladd' bands duodenojejunal obstruction. Its recognition at the elderly was challenging and needed careful computed tomography combined signs determination. Surgical treatment accounted for the treatment of choice for reversed midgut rotation especially in emergency settings as in our case. Ladd' procedure is still the most performed procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Reverse midgut rotation constituted an extremely rare congenital intestinal malrotation. Its diagnosis in the elderly was challenging implicating careful interpretation of computed tomography.
