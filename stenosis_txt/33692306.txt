Title: Elective Endovascular Stent-Graft Implantation for External Iliac Artery Injury after Blunt Pelvic Trauma.

Abstract: External iliac artery (EIA) injuries caused by blunt trauma are rare. Here, we describe a blunt EIA injury after a motorbike accident suffered by a 16-year-old male. Despite conservative treatment, intermittent claudication persisted. He was successfully treated by elective endovascular stent-graft implantation on day 59 after the injury. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) improved, as did his symptoms. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan on postoperative day 90 showed no residual stenosis and favorable peripheral blood flow. This report suggests that elective endovascular stent-graft implantation might be a viable treatment option for blunt EIA injuries.
