Title: Early and mid-term outcomes of open popliteal artery aneurysm repair with prosthetic grafts.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the early and mid-term outcomes of open surgical repair (OSR) for popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) with prosthetic grafts.
METHODS: The pre-, intra-, and postoperative data for all the patients who had undergone OSR for PAAs with prosthetic grafts at our Institution between January 2009 and July 2019 were included in a prospectively maintained database, which was retrospectively analyzed. Primary patency was defined as uninterrupted flow (<50% stenosis) in the graft with no additional procedures performed. Secondary patency was defined as the restoration of graft patency.
RESULTS: A total of 82 patients had undergone OSR for 104 PAAs (median age, 71 years; interquartile range [IQR], 67-78 years; 82 men) with prosthetic grafts. Of the 104 PAAs, 72 (68%) had been asymptomatic. The median diameter was 30 mm (IQR, 24-37 mm). A medial approach was used for 35 PAAs (34%) and a posterior approach for 69 (65%). The repairs consisted of aneurysmectomy or aneurysm ligation without removal with an interposition graft placed and end-to-end anastomoses. The median operative time was 120 minutes (IQR, 103-142 minutes). The estimated blood loss was 281 mL (IQR, 150-281 mL). Only one patient treated with a posterior approach sustained a permanent peroneal nerve lesion. A second patient also treated via the posterior approach had required surgical revision for bleeding on postoperative day 2. No temporary lesions were recorded. No early amputations were required, and no perioperative deaths occurred. The median length of stay was 3 days (IQR, 3-4 days). An expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft was used in 92 cases (88%) and a Dacron graft in 12 cases (12%). An 8-mm graft was used in 64 cases (62%). The median follow-up was 34.6 months (IQR, 8.5-62.7 months). No related mortality occurred. Of the 104 PAAs, 19 had required reintervention, with primary and secondary patency of 78% and 88% at 3 years, respectively. The median interval to reintervention was 28.3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: OSR of PAAs with prosthetic grafts is safe and feasible, with good mid-term results and satisfactory primary and secondary patency at 3 years.
