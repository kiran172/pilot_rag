Title: Risk of new tumor, carotid stenosis, and stroke after Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Pituitary Tumor: A multicenter study of 2254 patients with imaging follow-up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Higher risk of secondary brain tumor, carotid stenosis and stroke has been reported after conventional sella irradiation for pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNET). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), which is a more focused approach, is now increasingly used instead. The aim was to assess the risk of secondary brain tumor, carotid stenosis/occlusion and stroke after SRS.
METHODS: In this multicentric retrospective study, 2,254 patients with PitNET were studied, 1,377 in the exposed group and 877 in the control group.
RESULTS: There were 9,840.1 patient-years at risk for the SRS and 5,266.5 for the control group. The 15-year cumulative probability of secondary intracranial tumor was 2.3% (95%CI:0.5%, 4.1%) for SRS and 3.7% (95%CI:0%, 8.7%) for the control group (p=0.6), with an incidence rate of 1.32 per 1,000 and 0.95 per 1,000, respectively. SRS was not associated with increased risk of tumorigenesis when stratified by age (HR: 1.59 [95%CI: 0.57, 4.47], p=0.38). The 15-year probability of new carotid stenosis/occlusion was 0.9% (95%CI: 0.2, 1.6) in the SRS and 2% (95%CI: 0, 4.4) in the control group (p=0.8). The 15-year probability of stroke was 2.6% (95%CI: 0.6%, 4.6%) in the SRS and 11.1% (95%CI: 6%, 15.9%) in the control group (p<0.001). In cox multivariate analysis stratified by age, SRS (HR 1.85[95%CI:0.64, 5.35], p=0.26) was not associated with risk of new stroke.
CONCLUSION: No increased risk of long-term secondary brain tumor, new stenosis or occlusion and stroke was demonstrated in SRS group compared to control in this study with imaging surveillance.
