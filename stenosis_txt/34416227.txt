Title: Left Ventricle Mass Regression After Surgical or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Veterans.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Differences in left ventricular mass regression (LVMR) between transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) have not been studied. We present clinical and echocardiographic data from veterans who underwent TAVR and SAVR, evaluating the degree of LVMR and its association with survival.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed TAVR (n = 194) and SAVR (n = 365) procedures performed in veterans from 2011 to 2019. After 1:1 propensity matching, we evaluated mortality and secondary outcomes. Echocardiographic data (median follow-up 957 days, interquartile range 483-1652 days) were used to evaluate LVMR, its association with survival, and predictors of LVMR.
RESULTS: There was no difference between SAVR and TAVR patients in mortality (for up to 8 years), stroke at 30 days, myocardial infarction, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, reoperation, or structural valve deterioration. SAVR patients (67.3% [101 of 150]) were more likely to have LVMR than TAVR patients (55.7% [44 of 79], P = .11). The magnitude of LVMR was greater for the SAVR patients (median, -23.3%) than for the TAVR patients (median, -17.8%, P = .062). SAVR patients with LVMR had a survival advantage over SAVR patients without LVMR (P = .016). However, LVMR was not associated with greater survival in TAVR patients (P = .248).
CONCLUSIONS: SAVR patients were more likely to have LVMR and had a greater magnitude of LVMR than TAVR patients. LVMR was associated with better survival in SAVR patients, but not in TAVR patients.
