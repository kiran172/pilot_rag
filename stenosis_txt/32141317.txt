Title: Posterior Glottic Stenosis Type I: Clinical Presentation and Postoperative Course.

Abstract: Posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) is a process that results in partial or total fixation of the vocal folds. Type I PGS (PGS-1) is an uncommon clinical entity that results from an interarytenoid adhesion/scar band that is separate from the posterior interarytenoid mucosa. We present a case series of patients with PGS-1 treated at our institution to contribute to the understanding of this complex clinical entity.
