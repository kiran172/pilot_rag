Title: Expression of Cyclophilin A in Coronary Artery Plaque with Intraplaque Hemorrhage Is More Frequent in Deceased Patients Who Had Impaired Kidney Function.

Abstract: Patients with impaired kidney function have a high frequency of intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) in their coronary arteries. Levels of cyclophilin A (CyPA), an indirect matrix metalloproteinase inducer, are increased in deceased patients who had impaired kidney function. In this study, we have examined the relationship between IPH and CyPA.We examined 47 samples of coronary plaque from 27 cadavers with coronary stenosis. These sections, all with > 50% coronary stenosis, were stained with an antibody against CyPA and the expression of CyPA was semi-quantified. Cadavers and plaques were classified into one of two groups depending on the presence or absence of IPH. IPH was defined as the presence of red blood cells stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) indicative of overt acute hemorrhage.In an individual analysis, estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the IPH group was significantly lower than that in the non-IPH group (P = 0.002). In a histological analysis, the percentage of stained area of CyPA in the IPH group was significantly higher than that in the non-IPH group (P < 0.0001).IPH was associated with a significantly higher expression of CyPA in this study. In addition, patients with IPH in their coronary arteries had significantly impaired kidney function.
