Title: Influence of Posture on Gait Parameters in Severe Symptomatic Lumbar Stenosis Before and After Decompression Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We searched to quantify the influence of sagittal vertical axis (SVA) on the improvement of spatiotemporal gait parameters using a gait motion analysis (GMA) before and after decompression surgery in patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with severe LisSS planned for lumbar decompression underwent a full-body biplanar radiographs (EOS) to quantify the SVA and have benefited from a 3-dimensional GMA 1 month before surgery (M0) and 6 month (M6) after surgery. The first step of this study was to confirm the validation of 3-dimensional sagittal vertical axis (3D SVA) for posture analysis. An analysis of modification of the 3D SVA and spatiotemporal gait parameters was then carried out in order to identify any correlation.
RESULTS: Decompression surgery did not significantly improve 3D SVA between M0 and M6 (respectively 49.1 [50.3] vs. 49.84 [19.02], P = 0.42). Concerning spatiotemporal parameters, we found significant difference for all parameters between M0 and M6. A strong correlation (R2 &gt; 0.65) between static SVA (EOS) and 3D SVA was demonstrated using a statistical regression equation. There was also a statistically significant correlation between SVA (static and 3-dimension) and improvement in spatiotemporal gait parameters after decompression surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: This study analyses the relationship between postural change (SVA) and improvement in gait parameters measured during GMA before and after decompression surgery for LSS. This specific analysis of gait parameters may represent a prognostic assessment tool for the recovery of patients undergoing surgery for a LSS.
