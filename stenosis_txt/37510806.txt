Title: Interventional Radiology for High-Flow Aneurysm of the Pancreaticoduodenal Arcades with Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome: Review of 14 Patients.

Abstract: Transarterial embolization (TAE) for high-flow pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) aneurysms in patients with celiac-trunk stenosis by the median arcuate ligament (MAL) has been found effective both after rupturing and to prevent rupture. The objective was to describe the TAE techniques used and their effectiveness in excluding PDA aneurysms due to MAL syndrome. This single-center retrospective study done at the Dijon-Bourgogne University Hospital included all patients treated by TAE in 2010-2022 for ruptured or unruptured high-flow PDA aneurysms caused by MAL syndrome. We identified 14 patients (7 women and 7 men; mean age, 64 years). Packing and trapping techniques were used alone or together. Occlusion was with microcoils, co-polymer, or cyanoacrylate glue, used separately or combined. Technical success was achieved in 13 (93%) patients. Clinical success was achieved in 12 (86%) patients. One major and two minor complications were recorded within the first 30 days. No complications occurred after 30 days. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 84 months. No cases of aneurysm recanalization have been recorded to date. TAE had high technical and clinical success rates in our patients with unruptured or ruptured PDA aneurysms due to MAL syndrome.
