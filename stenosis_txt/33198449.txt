Title: Impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation on coexistent mitral regurgitation parameters.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data on the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on coexisting mitral regurgitation (MR) are still inconsistent.
AIMS: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of TAVI on coexistent MR depending on its etiology.
METHODS: Out of 311 patients treated with TAVI, we selected 48 with coexistent MR: functional (FMR; n = 26) or nonfunctional (nFMR; n = 22). The impact of the procedure on MR was quantitatively assessed during a 1‑year follow‑up using MR effective regurgitant orifice area (MR‑EROA) and volume (MRV).
RESULTS: Compared with baseline, no change of MR‑EROA was observed at 1‑year follow‑up in all patients with MR (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.2 [0.17-0.23]cm2 vs 0.17 [0.14-0.2]cm2 ; P = 0.054). No change in MR‑EROA was also noted either in FMR (median [IQR], 0.21 [0.17-0.27]cm2 vs 0.19 [0.14-0.25]cm2 ; P = 0.142) or nFMR (median [IQR], 0.17 [0.12-0.23] cm2 vs 0.17 [0.1-0.2] cm2 ; P = 0.238) cohorts. Decreased MRV was seen in theoverall MR population after TAVI (median [IQR], 32 [28-36]ml/beat vs 26 [22-28]ml/beat; P = 0.002). Similarly, decreased MRV was noted in both FMR (median [IQR], 33 [26-42] ml/beat vs 26 [20-40] ml/beat; P = 0.042) and nFMR (median [IQR], 30 [20-46] ml/beat vs 24 [15-33] ml/beat; P = 0.015) cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation had no impact on MR‑EROA regardless of the etiology of regurgitation. However, the procedure reduced MRV in both FMR and nFMR.
