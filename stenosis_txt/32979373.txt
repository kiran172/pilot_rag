Title: Late Surgical Treatment for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Prosthesis Dysfunction.

Abstract: Structural valve degeneration, valve thrombosis, or acute infective endocarditis may affect the postprocedural outcome of transcatheter aortic valve implanted (TAVI) prostheses. Data of patients who required late surgical explant of TAVI prostheses were obtained from 8 European centers. There were 13 patients who underwent surgical treatment for TAVI prosthesis failure after original admission due to prosthetic infective endocarditis in 6 patients, structural valve degeneration in 4, and valve thrombosis in 3. Hospital mortality was 15%, and survival at the 2-year follow-up was 71%. Abstract word count: 80.
