Title: Clinical Outcome of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With TriGUARD 3™ Cerebral Embolic Protection Device.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Periprocedural stroke during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a highly feared adverse event. The TriGUARD 3 cerebral embolic protection device (CEPD) may have the potential benefit of reduction of embolic events, but it still remains unclear whether it reduces the incidence of periprocedural stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to investigate whether the latest TriGUARD 3 CEPD reduces the incidence of clinically overt stroke within 72 h or at discharge after TAVR.
METHODS: In this prospective single-center study 117 patients (mean age 80.3 years, 53.8 % male) were included from July 2020 to December 2021.
RESULTS: The primary efficacy endpoint of this study, periprocedural clinically overt stroke or TIA, within 72 h or at discharge after TAVR with the TriGUARD 3 CEPD occurred in 1/117 pts (0.8 %). Secondary endpoints (device related issues such as life-threatening or disabling bleeding, acute kidney injury, major vascular complications) were reported in 4/117 pts (3.4 %).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the use of the latest TriGUARD 3™ CEPD in transfemoral TAVR seems to be associated with a low rate of clinically overt stroke and a low rate of device related adverse events, reflecting "real world" TAVR practice. However these results should be hypothesis generating and confirmed in a large RCT.
