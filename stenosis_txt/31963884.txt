Title: Expression Patterns of Circulating MicroRNAs in the Risk Stratification of Bicuspid Aortopathy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Aortic size-based criteria are of limited value in the prediction of aortic events, while most aortic events occur in patients with proximal aortic diameters < 50 mm. Serological biomarkers and especially circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as an elegant tool to improve risk stratification in patients with different aortopathies. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the levels of circulating miRNAs in a surgical cohort of patients presenting with bicuspid aortic valve disease and distinct valvulo-aortic phenotypes.
METHODS: We prospectively examined a consecutive cohort of 145 patients referred for aortic valve surgery: (1) Sixty three patients (mean age 47 ± 11 years, 92% male) with bicuspid aortic valve regurgitation and root dilatation (BAV-AR), (2) thirty two patients (mean age 59 ± 11 years, 73% male) with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (BAV-AS), and (3) fifty patients (mean age 56 ± 14 years, 55% male) with tricuspid aortic valve stenosis and normal aortic root diameters (TAV-AS) who underwent aortic valve+/-proximal aortic surgery at a single institution. MicroRNAs analysis included 11 miRNAs, all published previously in association with aortopathies. Endpoints of our study were (1) correlation between circulating miRNAs and aortic diameter and (2) comparison of circulating miRNAs in distinct valvulo-aortic phenotypes.
RESULTS: We found a significant inverse linear correlation between circulating miRNAs levels and proximal aortic diameter in the whole study cohort. The strongest correlation was found for miR-17 (r = -0.42, p &lt; 0.001), miR-20a (r = -0.37, p &lt; 0.001), and miR-106a (r = -0.32, p &lt; 0.001). All miRNAs were significantly downregulated in BAV vs. TAV with normal aortic root dimensions Conclusions: Our data demonstrate a significant inverse correlation between circulating miRNAs levels and the maximal aortic diameter in BAV aortopathy. When comparing miRNAs expression patterns in BAV vs. TAV patients with normal aortic root dimensions, BAV patients showed significant downregulation of analyzed miRNAs as compared to their TAV counterparts. Further multicenter studies in larger cohorts are needed to further validate these results.
