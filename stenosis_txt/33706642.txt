Title: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition prevents venous adaptive remodeling via regulation of Eph-B4.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Vein graft adaptation (VGA) is a process that vein as a vascular graft conduits in arterial reconstructive surgery; VGA can lead to postoperative vein graft stenosis (VGS) and complications after coronary artery bypass graft and other peripheral artery bypass surgeries. VGA is characterized by vein graft loss the venous features without exhibiting arterial features; furthermore, the activation of ERK inhibited the maintenance of venous properties of the vein graft. We hypothesized that ERK inhibition can affect vein VGS through regulating the expression of EphB4.
METHODS: Rat vein transplantation model was established using wild-type and EphB4+/- Sprague-Dawley rats. Hematoxylin-eosin, Masson, Verhoeff, actin staining, and immunohistochemistry were applied to observe the structure of the vein grafts. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were isolated from the vein and vein grafts. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of p-ERK1/2 and EphB4, and immunofluorescence was applied to detect the expression and location of EphB4. Cell wound scratch assay and CCK8 assay were used to determine the migration and proliferation of VSMCs. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the mRNA expression of EphB4.
RESULTS: Western blotting in vein sample and vein graft sample detected p-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 expression in both EphB4+/+ and EphB4+/- rats. The expression of p-ERK was increased in vein graft compared to vein. Immunofluorescence in VSMCs form EphB4+/+ and EphB4+/- rats detected EphB4 expression in both cells, and the expression of EphB4 was increased in VSMCs form EphB4+/+ rats. SCH772984 reduces the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Inhibition of ERK suppressed the increase of vein graft wall thickness, and the expression of collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and Î±-actin was decreased. Vein graft from EphB4+/- rats reduces the expression of EphB4, and SCH772984 suppressed the decrease of EphB4 in vivo. Vein graft from EphB4+/- rats increased the expression of EphB4, and SCH772984 suppressed the increase of EphB4 in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of ERK1/2 suppressed the process of VGS by decreasing the proliferation of VSMCs. The ERK-inhibitor SCH772984 suppressed the level of VGS by extending the time of EphB4 expression during the process of VGA, thus maintaining the venousization of vein graft. The mechanism may be that the inhibitor SCH772984 suppresses the level of VGS by extending the time of EphB4 expression during the process of VGA. Therefore, our research provides a new target of VGS treatment by inhibiting the expression of ERK1/2 through the process of VGA.
