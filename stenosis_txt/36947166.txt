Title: A case of spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric arterial dissection with coeliac axis stenosis.

Abstract: Spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric arterial dissection with coeliac axis stenosis is rare but serious. We report a case of a 54-year-old male with coeliac axis stenosis who presented with acute superior mesenteric arterial dissection, which caused thrombosis of the branches. This is the first report of the full course of treatment using endovascular repair and laparoscopic surgery to deal with spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric arterial dissection combined with coeliac axis stenosis. This approach has been shown to be safe and effective for yielding short-term results.
