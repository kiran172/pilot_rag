Title: An Escherichia coli-Induced Distal Arch Aneurysm Presenting With Hemoptysis.

Abstract: Infected thoracic aneurysms are a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that present with non-specific symptoms. We describe here a case of an 83-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with the chief complaint of vomiting blood. The patient had presented to the emergency department 40 days earlier with abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis. She had a medical history of traumatic liver injury resulting in bile duct stenosis, necessitating percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage and subsequent bile duct-jejunal anastomosis 25 years ago. Emergency contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an irregular distal arch aneurysm. According to the patient's present symptoms, CT findings, and medical history, infected thoracic aneurysm was suspected. Total arch replacement was performed promptly, followed by thorough antibiotic therapy. Following successful treatment, the patient's condition stabilized, and she was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for further recovery.
