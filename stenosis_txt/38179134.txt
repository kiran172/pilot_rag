Title: Computational study of the balloon dilation steps on transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Balloon dilation is a commonly used assistant method in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and plays an important role during valve implantation procedure. The balloon dilation steps need to be fully considered in TAVR numerical simulations. This study aims to establish a TAVR simulation procedure with two different balloon dilation steps to analyze the impact of balloon dilation on the results of TAVR implantation. Two cases of aortic stenosis were constructed based on medical images. An implantation simulation procedure with self-expandable valve was established, and multiple models including different simulation steps such as balloon pre-dilation and balloon post-dilation were constructed to compare the different effects on vascular stress, stent morphology and paravalvular leakage. Results show that balloon pre-dilation of TAVR makes less impact on post-operative outcomes, while post-dilation can effectively improve the implantation morphology of the stent, which is beneficial to the function and durability of the valve. It can effectively improve the adhesion of the stent and reduce the paravalvular leakage volume more than 30% after implantation. However, balloon post-dilation may also lead to about 20% or more increased stress on the aorta and increase the risk of damage. The balloon dilation makes an important impact on the TAVR outcomes. Balloon dilation needs to be fully considered during pre-operative analysis to obtain a better clinical result.
