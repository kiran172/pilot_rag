Title: Leukocyte telomere length and lipid parameters in patients with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is defined as stenosis of less than 50% or no stenosis on coronary angiography in a patient diagnosed with myocardial infarction. Telomere length is expressed by studies that it acts as a biomarker, especially for biological aging and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between circulating leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and serum lipid values in MINOCA patients. Forty-five newly diagnosed patients with MINOCA were included in the study, along with 45 healthy controls who matched the patients in terms of age and gender. We determined the LTL value using the RT-PCR method. As a result of the study, we found LTL (p< 0.001) and serum lipid values (HDL-cholesterol (p< 0.001), LDL-cholesterol (p< 0.001), triglycerides (p< 0.05), and total cholesterol (p< 0.05)) to be significantly higher in the MINOCA group than in the control group. When the correlation relationship between LTL and lipid values in the MINOCA group was evaluated, a negative correlation was determined only between LTL and HDL (p=0.014, r=-0.362). This is the first study to evaluate telomere length in MINOCA patients in Turkey. Our results support the existence of short telomere length in MINOCA patients.
