Title: Multiple aneurysms coexisting with carotid occlusion revealed by cerebral infarction: A case report.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms are focal dilations of an intracranial artery. They can be discovered incidentally, during a hemorrhagic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, but it is rare for it to be detected after an ischemic stroke. The prevalence of the association between symptomatic carotid occlusion or stenosis and intracranial aneurysms is estimated to be 6.3%. We report the case of a patient hospitalized for the management of a stroke in whom investigations had revealed the coexistence of right carotid occlusion and multiple aneurysms in the right middle cerebral artery. The diagnosis was made by CT angiography of supra-aortic trunks.
