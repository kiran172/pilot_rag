Title: Innovations in Orthodontics: Skeletal Versus Dentoalveolar Expansion Utilizing Clear Aligners and TAD-Assisted Expanders.

Abstract: Hypoplastic maxilla is a common skeletal anomaly that compromises function and esthetics. Beyond just a narrow-appearing smile, this abnormality presents significant restorative challenges in adult patients as it is often associated with crowding, compromised axial inclination of the teeth, lack of alveolar bone support, root proximity, and occlusal trauma.1 Recent research also confirms association of maxillary deficiency with nasal stenosis and a predisposition to compromised nasal airflow and pharyngeal collapse during sleep.2,3 Maxillary transverse skeletal deficiency is often but not always associated with posterior dental cross-bite. In most cases, maxillary posterior teeth are flared buccally and mandibular posterior teeth are excessively lingually inclined masking the underlying skeletal problem.4 Advances in 3D imaging in dentistry, namely ultra-low radiation cone-beam imaging technology, have significantly enhanced clinicians' ability to diagnose and subsequently treat a maxillary transverse deficiency.5.
