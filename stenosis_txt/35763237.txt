Title: Successful bridge to transplantation with long-term support using Berlin heart EXCOR in a child with failing Fontan.

Abstract: A 2-year-old girl underwent the Fontan operation for aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, a hypo-plastic left ventricle, and a non-compacted right ventricle. The patient's cardiac function reduced gradually thereafter, mainly due to systemic ventricular dysfunction. A Berlin Heart EXCOR (BHE) ventricular assist device with a 10-mL pump was implanted at 4 years of age. After 465 days, BHE support without major complications, the patient underwent heart transplantation. A safe and long-term BHE support was achieved with proper case selection and repeated examinations.
