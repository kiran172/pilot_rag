Title: Endovascular treatment of patient with multiple extracranial large vessel stenosis and coexistent unruptured wide-neck intracranial aneurysm using a WEB device and Szabo-technique.

Abstract: The coexistence of severe extracranial large vessel stenosis and unruptured intracranial aneurysms is not rare. There are different treatment approaches for these conditions, such as initial treatment of the aneurysm before revascularization of the stenosis; single-stage endovascular treatment of both lesions; stenosis eliminating followed by treatment of the aneurysm, or without treating the aneurysm. But, taking into account the risk of aneurysm rupture on the one hand and the risk of ischemic stroke on the other, it is sometimes difficult to choose the right management strategy. Despite this fact, there are still no guidelines or consensus on the management of these coexistent lesions. The article describes a clinical case of endovascular treatment of multiple extracranial stenosis and coexistent unruptured wide-neck aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery. The endovascular treatment of the carotid stenosis and aneurysm using a woven endobridge device was performed in one session; endovascular treatment of vertebral artery stenosis with Szabo technique was performed in another session.
