Title: Intracranial Large Artery Disease is Independently Associated with Poor Functional Outcome in a Cohort of Ethnic South Asian Ischemic Stroke Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial large artery disease (ICLAD) in ischemic stroke patients is associated with an increased risk for recurrent stroke; however, it is not known if ICLAD influences functional status following stroke. We studied the 6-month functional outcome in south Asian ischemic stroke patients and compared those with and without ICLAD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of consecutive south Asian ischemic stroke patients. ICLAD was assessed with transcranial color-coded Doppler ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiography. Functional outcomes were obtained via telephone interviews with poor outcome defined as modified Rankin scale of 3-6.
RESULTS: Of 216 ischemic stroke patients studied, 203 (93.9%) had follow-up data, of whom 50.7% (103) had ICLAD. Patients with ICLAD had a higher prevalence of hypertension (P < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (P = 0.047), ischemic heart disease (P = 0.030), and extracranial carotid disease (P = 0.005). A higher proportion of patients with ICLAD had poor functional outcome at 6 months (30.1%) versus those without ICLAD (13.0%) (P = 0.004). After adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, extracranial carotid stenosis, and recurrent vascular events, patients with ICLAD were 3.01 (95% confidence interval: 1.35-7.10) times more likely than those without ICLAD to have poor functional outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of ICLAD rendered poorer functional prognosis after stroke. These findings support the specific evaluation of the benefits of known acute stroke treatments such as thrombolysis, as well as investigation of potential novel strategies such as acute stenting.
