Title: Decrease in the inflammatory cytokines of LPS-stimulated PBMCs of patients with atherosclerosis by a TLR-4 antagonist in the co-culture with HUVECs.

Abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are among the players of inflammation during atherosclerosis. We assessed the effects of Eritoran, a TLR-4 antagonist, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokines production by Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of patients with high-stenosis (HS) (n = 6) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 6) co-cultured with Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). LPS stimulation significantly increased the levels of IL-6 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.005), TNF-α (P = 0.006 and P = 0.005), IL-2 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.002), IFN-γ (P = 0.006 and P = 0.003), IL-17A (P = 0.004 and P = 0.003), IL-17F (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003), IL-5 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.005), IL-13 (P = 0.006 and P = 0.005), IL-9 (P = 0.005 and P = 0.005) and IL-21 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.005) in HUVECs co-cultured with HC and HS PBMCs as compared with un-stimulated co-culture condition, respectively. Eritoran treatment (50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL) significantly reduced the levels of LPS-induced IL-6 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.006; P = 0.007 and P = 0.007), TNF-α (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003; P = 0.007 and P = 0.005), IL-2 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.005; P = 0.005 and P = 0.004), IFN-γ (P = 0.007 and P = 0.005; P = 0.005 and P = 0.004), IL-17A (P = 0.005 and P = 0.002; P = 0.005 and P = 0.002), IL-17F (P = 0.006 and P = 0.006; P = 0.005 and P = 0.005), IL-5 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.006; P = 0.007 and P = 0.007), IL-9 (P = 0.005 and P = 0.005; P = 0.005 and P = 0.005) and IL-21 (P = 0.007 and P = 0.007; P = 0.005 and P = 0.005) in stimulated HUVECs co-cultured with HC and HS PBMCs, compared to un-treated condition, respectively. Our results demonstrate that attenuating effect of Eritoran on the inflammatory responses to LPS is higher in PBMCs of patients with high stenosis, suggesting its potential role in ameliorating inflammatory conditions in atherosclerosis.
