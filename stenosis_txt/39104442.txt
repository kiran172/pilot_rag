Title: SIADH as a Rare Complication of Foramen Magnum Stenosis in an Infant With Achondroplasia.

Abstract: Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and is associated with serious complications such as foramen magnum stenosis (FMS). This case report describes an infant with achondroplasia who presented with a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), secondary to significant FMS and myelocompression. A 2-month-old boy with prenatally diagnosed achondroplasia was referred due to disordered breathing and altered consciousness. On admission, apathy, hypotonus, and hypothermia with typical features of achondroplasia were noticed. Laboratory investigations revealed severe hyponatremia and hypochloridaemia with normal glucose and urea levels. The diagnosis of SIADH was made based on low serum osmolality in the presence of high urine osmolality, along with an elevated copeptin level. An emergency computerized tomography showed a high-grade stenosis at the cranio-cervical junction; subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated myelocompression. The patient underwent decompression surgery the next day; serum osmolality increased after the operation. Spontaneous breathing after extubation was sufficient whereas tetraplegia persisted despite intensive physiotherapy. Clinicians should be aware of SIADH as a presenting sign of FMS in children with achondroplasia. Further discussion is warranted regarding improving parental education and timing of screening recommendations.
