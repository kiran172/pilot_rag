Title: Twig-like middle cerebral artery as a variety of isolated middle cerebral artery disease with new vessel formation: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Twig-like middle cerebral artery (T-MCA) is reported as a rare vascular anomaly characterized by reconstitution of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by a plexiform network of small vessels. Although it is generally believed that the etiology of T-MCA is an embryological persistence, some investigators have suggested that T-MCA may be a secondary consequence. Here, the authors report a second case of de novo T-MCA formation and reconsider the concept of T-MCA in connection with isolated MCA disease.
OBSERVATIONS: A 40-year-old man's brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) checkup showed moderate stenosis of the M1 segment of the left MCA. Annual MRI follow-up was planned, and when performed 1 year later, it showed occlusion of the M1 segment of the left MCA. Cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of that M1 segment with abnormal arterial networks. This case was diagnosed as de novo T-MCA. The patient has remained asymptomatic for 2 years.
LESSONS: The reports of de novo T-MCA indicate that acquired factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of T-MCA. We suggest that T-MCA should be defined as a variety of isolated MCA disease with new vessel formation.
