Title: [Clinical features, diagnosis and treatment for patients presenting with granulation tissue of the external auditory canal].

Abstract: Objective:To explore the clinical characteristics and diagnosis and treatment in the patients presenting with granulation tissue of the external auditory canal. Methods:The data of 71 postoperative patients presenting with granulation tissue of the external auditory canal in the Department of Otolaryngology, the First Affiliated Hospital of the Air Force Military Medical University from January 2015 to June 2020 were analyzed retrospectively, including the chief complaint, physical examination, auxiliary examination and preoperative imaging, biopsy was performed when necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Among the 71 patients, 30 cases were diagnosed as chronic otitis media, 19 cases were external auditory canal cholesteatoma, 5 cases were external auditory canal carcinoma, 6 cases were paraganglioma, 1 case was granulomatous hemangioma, 1 case was first branchial cleft fistula, 4 cases were granuloma of the external auditory canal, 4 cases were hemangioma of the external auditory canal, and 1 case was foreign body of the external auditory canal. Individualized treatment plans are made according to the characteristics and extent of the lesions. Results:Postoperative follow-up was 12 to 74 months, with an average of （44±18.1） months. Seventy patients（98.6%） had no complications such as sensorineural deafness, external auditory stenosis or peripheral facial paralysis after surgery, and one patient with paraganglioma had postoperative neurological function grade Ⅱ, and was treated with nutritional nerves, and the postoperative neural function recovered to grade Ⅰ after 3 months. Conclusion:The patients presenting with granulation tissue of the external auditory canal can be diagnosed as various diseases. It is necessary to analyze the patient's medical history in detail, confirm the diagnosis in combination with imaging examination, and formulate an individualized treatment plan to reduce misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
