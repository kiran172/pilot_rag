Title: Successful creation and long-term usage of radiocephalic fistula based on the recanalized completely occluded radial artery.

Abstract: The total occlusion of radial artery is a contraindication for reintervention and further usage. In this study, we report successful revascularization with creation of radiocephalic fistula from post-procedural chronically-occluded radial artery. The completely occluded radial artery was recanalized through ultrasound guided balloon angioplasty. A traditional radiocephalic fistula was created subsequently by using the recanalized radial artery for hemodialysis therapy. Though the fistula was failed at the 6 weeks caused by the juxta anastomotic stenosis, the further ultrasound guided percutaneous transluminal angioplasty restored the blood, and the hemodialysis therapy lasts for more than 1 year so far. It's feasible to create radiocephalic fistula based on the recanalized radial artery and maintain long-term hemodialysis therapy.
