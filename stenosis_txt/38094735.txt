Title: Preconception Counseling in a Patient With a Mechanical Aortic Valve and Recent Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: A 31-year-old woman with a mechanical aortic valve for congenital aortic stenosis presented to the cardiology clinic for preconception counseling. After experiencing an acute stroke 4 weeks prior, she was subsequently discovered to have prosthetic valve thrombosis requiring replacement of the aortic valve. We discuss her clinical course and preconception considerations.
