Title: Sex Differences in a Real-World Registry Examining Coronary Lithotripsy for Calcified Lesions.

Abstract: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has established as a safe and effective treatment for coronary artery calcification (CAC). This study aimed to evaluate sex-related differences in the treatment with IVL in a real-world, all-comers international registry. Patients undergoing IVL between May 2019 and February 2024 were enrolled from the BENELUX-IVL registry. Patients were divided into men and women groups. Efficacy endpoints included device success (delivery of the IVL-balloon across the target lesion and administration of therapy without related complications), technical success (TIMI 3 flow and residual stenosis <30% by quantitative coronary analysis and/or fluoroscopically) and procedural success (composite of technical success with absence of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiac death, myocardial infarction or target vessel revascularization). Safety endpoints were IVL-related complications and MACE at one-year follow-up. 454 patients (73±9.0 years) were treated with IVL, comprising 342 (75%) men and 112 (25%) women. More women presented with acute coronary syndrome (41% in men vs 54% in women; p=0.014) and aorto-ostial lesions (17% in men vs. 29% in women; p=0.009), while the Syntax score (23.5±14.2 in men vs. 17.1±1.0 in women; p<0.001) was higher in men. Rates of device success (97% vs. 98%; p=1.000), technical success (90% vs. 91%; p=0.821) procedural success (90% vs. 88%; p=0.749), IVL-related complications (1% vs 2%; p=0.362) and one-year MACE rates (12% vs 17%; p=0.456) were comparable. In conclusion, despite differences in clinical presentation and lesion types, IVL seems to be safe and effective for both sexes across various clinical and anatomical scenarios.
