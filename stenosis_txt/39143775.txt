Title: [Application of arterio-arterial grafts access in hemodialysis].

Abstract: Patients who underwent arterio-arterial graft (AAG) surgery at Beijing Haidian Hospital from March 2021 to December 2023 were prospectively included. A total of 13 cases (6 males and 7 females) aged (59±13) years were collected, with a dialysis history of 4.0 (1.8, 10.0) years. Nine cases of "bow"-type AAG and 4 cases of "α"-type AAG were established. The follow-up time was 10 (7, 16) months. The primary patency and secondary patency rates at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery were 92.3% and 100%, 81.8% and 90.9%, 57.1% and 57.1%, respectively. Stenosis, thrombosis and infection occurred in 2, 5 and 2 cases, respectively. The current study indicates that AAG surgery is simple, minimally invasive, and has a high long-term patency rate. It can be used as a new type of vascular access for patients who fail to establish conventional dialysis access.
