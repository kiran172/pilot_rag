Title: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging investigation of the connection between the triglyceride-glucose index and intracranial arterial remodeling: a retrospective cross-sectional study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with atherosclerotic plaque progression and the occurrence of stroke, with the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index serving as a surrogate indicator. The present study aimed to investigate the association between TyG index levels and intracranial arterial remodeling in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).
METHODS: Patients with AIS who visited the Neurology Department of the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University and underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) between September 2018 and October 2021 were enrolled. A total of 123 patients were finally included in the study, with 81 excluded. The TyG index levels were measured, and the characteristics of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) plaques were evaluated using HR-MRI. A logistic regression model was employed to analyze the relationship between TyG index levels and remodeling mode. Patients were divided into two groups, positive remodeling (PR) and non-positive remodeling (non-PR), based on the remodeling index (RI).
RESULTS: Patients in the PR group had a higher TyG index than those in the non-PR group {median [interquartile range (IQR)]: 9.11 (8.82-9.51) vs. 8.72 (8.30-9.23), P&lt;0.001}. After adjusting factors such as age and gender, the TyG index was found to be significantly correlated with intracranial arterial PR [odds ratio (OR): 3.169, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.327-7.569, P=0.009]. In non-diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, the TyG index level in the PR group was significantly higher than that in the non-PR group (8.95±0.42 vs. 8.50±0.45, P&lt;0.001), whereas there was no such difference in patients with DM.
CONCLUSIONS: TyG index was correlated with intracranial vessel PR, indicating that the TyG index level may be a useful marker for predicting intracranial vessel PR.
