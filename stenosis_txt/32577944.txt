Title: Plasma lipoprotein(a) concentration as an independent predictor of hemodynamic progression of aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a common cardiovascular disorder of high social significance. This study aimed to identify independent predictors of hemodynamic progression of CAVD. The relationship between some risk factors, including the rs10455872 polymorphism in the intron 25 of the lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] coding region and the plasma Lp(a) concentration, and CAVD severity were prospectively examined in 114 patients. Age (p = 0.023), smoking (p = 0.038), lack of obesity (p = 0.005), triglyceride levels (p = 0.039), and plasma Lp(a) (p < 0.0001) levels were found to be significant determinants of stenosis progression. The rs10455872 polymorphism; however, was not found to be a significant factor for neither the stenosis severity (p = 0.773) nor for plasma Lp(a) levels (p = 0.617). We established a highly significant Lp(a) cut-off concentration (21.2 mg/dL) distinguishing the aortic valve calcification without stenosis from the significant stenosis. Plasma Lp(a) concentration was the only independent predictor of disease progression (p < 0.0001). Moreover, patients with plasma levels of Lp(a) ≥ 21.2 mg/dL were 55 times more likely to develop aortic valve stenosis. We conclude that Lp(a) concentration may prove valuable for more reliable identification of patients at risk of accelerated CAVD development. Future studies are desirable to determine whether plasma Lp(a) levels could be used as a potential biomarker for aortic stenosis progression.
