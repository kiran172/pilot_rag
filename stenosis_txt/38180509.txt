Title: Evidence of pial synagiosis through ventriculoperitoneal shunt entry site in a patient who manifested Moyamoya syndrome later in childhood: A case report and historical perspective.

Abstract: The term Moyamoya , or "puff of smoke" in Japanese , was first used in 1969 by Suzuki and Takaku to describe the classical appearance of collateral blood vessels in response to progressive vascular stenosis of distal internal carotid artery (ICA). Such condition may result in various clinical presentations ranging from strokes to developmental delays. In order to cease the progression of such stenotic vasculopathy, several means of revascularization have been developed over the years. In this paper we present a case of a two-year-old girl with history of myelomeningocele repair and ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by manifestation of Moyamoya syndrome later in childhood as an evidence of revascularization through a burr hole. To our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to report such findings in one patient. Moreover, this paper provides a historical perspective on the development of different types of revascularization techniques.
