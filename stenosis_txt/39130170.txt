Title: Balloon-Assisted Coronary Intravascular Lithotripsy for Large Severely Calcified Coronary Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: We present a patient with in-stent restenosis due to severe coronary calcification with asymmetric stent expansion and resulting stent eccentricity in a very large (6.0 mm) caliber coronary artery. We demonstrate the feasibility of using the largest commercially available coronary intravascular lithotripsy balloon (4.0 mm) along with a "buddy" balloon inflated simultaneously to treat focal coronary artery calcification in a vessel with a diameter significantly larger than the largest commercially available coronary intravascular lithotripsy balloon. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of this technique in coronary artery intervention.
