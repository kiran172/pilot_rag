Title: Patient Perspectives and Outcomes in Adult Hypospadias Repair.

Abstract: Background Hypospadias is a common congenital anomaly that needs repair at an early age (six months to one year). Ironically, many cases in India present late due to a lack of healthcare facilities, poverty, and illiteracy. Adult patients are different from children as they are aware of their genitalia. They are concerned with the aesthetics and, predominantly, the potency. In this study, we present the perspectives and outcomes of 111 adult cases of hypospadias. Methodology In this retrospective study conducted between January 2010 and December 2020, 111 patients aged more than 14 years who were diagnosed with hypospadias of any level with or without mild-to-moderate chordee were included. Hypospadias repair using a tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty technique was performed, and patients after surgery were followed up at three months, six months, and 12 months for any complications with physical examination, uroflowmetry, and patient-related outcomes (PROs). Results Age varied from 14 years to 32 years (mean = 19.88 years, SD = 5.93). The most frequent meatus positions after chordee adjustment were distal (n = 64, 57.65%), middle (n = 25, 22.52%), and proximal (n = 22, 19.82%). Among these, four patients had penoscrotal transposition. Chordee was present in 65.7% (n = 73) of the cases. (<30째 in 38.7%, n = 43; 30째-60째 in 23.4%, n = 26, and >60째 in 3.6%, n = 4). Chordee was corrected using many techniques, including ventral corporotomies. Urethroplasty was done using TIP and spongioplasty in 89% (n = 99), and one patient underwent inner preputial onlay flap urethroplasty. Snodgraft was used to augment the urethral plate in 10 cases. The success rate of one-stage surgery was 74.77% in our series, which significantly correlated with PROs. Uroflow varied from 12 mL/second to 18 mL/second, and in the majority of the cases, the flow rate improved over time. The most common complication was urethrocutaneous fistula in 11 (11.8%) patients, followed by glanular dehiscence in nine (8.1%) patients. Conclusions Adult patients undergoing primary hypospadias repair generally show good outcomes. Patients can have an acceptable mild degree of residual chordee and torsion, which correlate well with PROs. In our series, hypospadias fistula was the most common complication of hypospadias surgery, followed by glanular dehiscence.
