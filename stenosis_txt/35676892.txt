Title: Determination of the Fear of COVID-19 and the Quality of Life of Patients With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implants During the Pandemic.

Abstract: This study aimed to determine the fear of COVID-19 and the quality of life of patients with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) during the pandemic. This descriptive cross-sectional study included 132 TAVI patients. Data were collected using a patient information form, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), and the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D). The mean FCV-19S score of the patients was 17.37 ± 6.12. The mean EQ-5D index score was 0.56 ± 0.37 and the mean VAS score was 65.5 ± 11.5. As per the dimensions of the EQ-5D index, 75% of the patients had mobility problems. According to the logistic regression analysis results, mobility was the most affected parameter, as demonstrated by the worsening in symptoms during the pandemic (odds ratio: 7.370, 95% CI [2.183, 24.881]). The patients with TAVI had a moderate level of fear associated with COVID-19, and the pandemic negatively affected their quality of life.
