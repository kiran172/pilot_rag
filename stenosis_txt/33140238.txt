Title: Factors associated with event-free survival in Chinese patients with Takayasu's arteritis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate long-term outcomes of Takayasu's arteritis (TA) and explore the predictive factors associated with poor prognosis.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on consecutive TA patients admitted to the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital during the period from July 2010 to March 2019. Potential factors contributing to adverse outcomes, including death, vascular complications, and vascular stenosis aggravation were assessed by Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Seventy-one individuals were enrolled, in which 90.1% were female. The mean onset age was 29.44 ± 11.75 years, and mean follow-up time was 3.42 ± 2.38 years. Adverse outcomes were observed in twenty-five (35.2%) patients, and the 1-, 5-, and 8-year event-free survival was 94.2%, 61.8%, and 29.8% respectively. Univariable Cox regression revealed that pulmonary hypertension (PH) (HR 4.13), high total cholesterol levels (HR 4.49), high LDL cholesterol levels (HR 5.14), and low-dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) treatment (HR 0.53) were associated with adverse outcomes. Among them, only CTX treatment remained significant in multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR 0.62). Interestingly, compared to those ineffective to CTX, the responders had higher immunoglobulin A levels (p < 0.05) but lower CRP levels (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Even with vigorous therapy, a large proportion of TA patients may present adverse outcomes along with the development of disease. Low-dose CTX treatment is helpful for a better prognosis. Key Points • The prognosis of Takayasu's arteritis is still poor. • Application of low-dose cyclophosphamide in high-risk patients helps to improve the outcome. • Abnormal lipid profiles may contribute to the development of this disease, which also deserves attention.
