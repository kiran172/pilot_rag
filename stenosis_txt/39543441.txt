Title: Biomechanical analysis of nickel-titanium (NiTi)-cobalt-chromium (CoCr) hybrid-braided dense-mesh stents for carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: This study investigates NiTi-CoCr hybrid carotid artery stents to enhance mechanical properties over NiTi-only designs. Different configurations (24NiTi, 20NiTi-4CoCr, 16NiTi-8CoCr, and 12NiTi-12CoCr) were evaluated through radial compression and bending simulations. The 12NiTi-12CoCr stent showed the highest radial support (39.37 N) and increased bending strength by 77.96%. When modeled in a stenotic artery, this stent reduced stenosis from 81.52% to 29.33% and improved blood flow dynamics, alleviating high-pressure zones and balancing wall shear stress. These results suggest that CoCr wires improve stent performance, with the 12NiTi-12CoCr stent offering significant biomechanical and hemodynamic benefits.
