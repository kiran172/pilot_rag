Title: Progression of Valvular Pulmonic Stenosis in Adulthood: Never Say Never.

Abstract: • Historic data indicate mild valvar PS in adults does not progress. • The prevalence of older adults with CHD is increasing. • Valvular calcification may lead to progression of PS in later life. • Echocardiography should be used for routine follow-up for PS.
