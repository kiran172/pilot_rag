Title: Acute Stroke Caused by Progressive Intracranial Artery Stenosis Due to Varicella Zoster Virus Vasculopathy after Chemotherapy for Malignant Lymphoma.

Abstract: Decreased cell-mediated immunity can reactivate Varicella zoster virus (VZV), which can lead to various neurological complications, including vasculopathy. We herein report the case of a patient with acute stroke with progressive internal carotid artery stenosis due to VZV vasculopathy after chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma. Treatment for VZV vasculopathy improved the stenosis and prevented recurrent stroke. VZV vasculopathy is an important treatable cause of stroke in immunosuppressed patients.
