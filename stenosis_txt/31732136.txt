Title: Long-Term Electrocardiographic Changes and Clinical Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Recipients Without New Postprocedural Conduction Disturbances.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to determine the long-term (>1 year) electrocardiographic (ECG) and clinical outcomes of patients without significant changes in their electrocardiogram after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI; including patients with pre-existing ECG abnormalities). Among 772 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI in our institution, 397 patients (51%) without new ECG changes were included. TAVI patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of pre-existing ECG-conduction disturbances (ECG-CD: 140 patients, non-ECG-CD: 257 patients). Clinical follow-up (median: 35 [22 to 57] months) was complete in all patients but 5 (1.2%), and ECG data were available in 291 patients (84.3% of patients at risk) at a median of 29 (20 to 50) months. In the non-ECG-CD group, most patients (79.8%) remained without significant ECG changes at follow-up, and 16.9% developed first-degree atrioventricular block and/or bundle branch block over time. The rate of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation at follow-up was 3.5% (1.1%/year) in the non-ECG-CD group versus 15.7% (5.5%/year) in the ECG-CD group (p <0.001). The presence of pre-existing CD was an independent predictor of PPM at follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.15 to 10.16, p <0.001). The ECG-CD group exhibited a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization (non-ECG-CD: 25%, ECG-CD: 29%, log-rank p = 0.01), but not mortality (non-ECG-CD: 50%, ECG-CD: 46%, log-rank p = 0.60) at 5-year follow-up. In conclusion, the ECG remained unchanged in most TAVI recipients without new postprocedural CD. Pre-existing ECG-CD was associated with an increased risk of PPM and heart failure hospitalization at long-term follow-up. These results provide reassuring data in the era of TAVI expanding toward candidates with a longer life expectancy, and highlight the importance of a closer follow-up of those patients with pre-existing ECG-CDs.
