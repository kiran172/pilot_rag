Title: The poor long-term outcomes of owl's eye pulmonary reconstruction technique after arterial switch operation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the early- and long-term outcomes of patients who undergo owl's eye pulmonary artery (PA) reconstruction to those of patients who undergo conventional PA reconstruction.
METHODS: From January 2016 to January 2017, 64 consecutive patients underwent an arterial switch operation. The patients were divided into 2 groups in terms of neo-PA reconstruction method: 30 patients who underwent neo-PA reconstruction by owl's eye technique were defined as group 1 and 34 patients who underwent neo-PA reconstruction by the conventional approach were defined as group 2. In the final model, after propensity matching, 23 patients from each group with similar propensity scores were included in the study.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups regarding patient characteristics and operative findings. In the early period, the duration of intensive care unit and hospital stays and the rate of mild neo-pulmonary stenosis (neo-PS) were significantly higher in the owl's eye group (P = 0.04, 0.04 and 0.03). In the late period, the rate of severe neo-PS and reintervention was significantly higher in the owl's eye group (P = 0.02 and 0.04). Furthermore, the rates of 3-year freedom from pulmonary reintervention and freedom from moderate-severe neo-PS were significantly lower in group 1 (P = 0.04). In addition, the owl's eye reconstruction was the only factor independently related to moderate-severe neo-PS in the long term (hazard ratios = 11.2, P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: We have abandoned the owl's eye method for neo-PA reconstruction of the neo-PA because of serious complications. According to our series and the literature, reconstruction of the neo-PA with an oversized, pantaloon-shaped fresh autologous pericardial patch is still superior to the other techniques.
