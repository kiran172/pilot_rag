Title: An Extremely Rare Case of Bonneau Syndrome with Novel Cardiac and Eye Manifestations.

Abstract: Bonneau or cardio-ducto-polysyndactyly syndrome is an extremely rare, life-threatening developmental defect, which has only been reported in eight patients previously. Here, we describe one such case of Bonneau syndrome in a newborn with additional novel manifestations. This late preterm (35 weeks of gestation) neonate born to parents of consanguineous marriage following a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios was symmetrically small for date at birth (&lt;3rd centile for weight, length, and occipitofrontal circumference). She had the typical Bonneau syndrome features such as facial dysmorphism and polysyndactyly in addition to novel eye manifestations (microphthalmia, cataract, and vitreous hemorrhage) and cardiac defects such as D-transposition of the great arteries and pulmonary valve stenosis. The chromosomal study was normal (46, XX). The multiple congenital anomalies made the cardiac defects inoperable, and the patient died at the age of 16 days due to uncontrolled cardiac failure. A very high index of suspicion is required by pediatricians/neonatologists to identify this very rare syndrome based on presentation with known features.
