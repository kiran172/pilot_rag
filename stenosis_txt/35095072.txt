Title: Transcatheter Mitral Valve Edge-to-Edge Repair with a Novel System.

Abstract: The ValveClamp system is a novel edge-to-edge mitral valve repair system that is designed for ease of operation. We aimed to report the 1-year outcomes of the early feasibility study of this system.Patients with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation (MR) at higher surgical risk and who received transapical ValveClamp implantation were followed for 1 year for clinical and echocardiographic outcomes.Twelve patients (mean age, 76.5 ± 6.3 years; mean Society of Thoracic Surgery score, 6.9 ± 1.9%) were enrolled at three sites in China. At 1 year, no patient died, received reoperation, or had long-term complications. Of the 12 patients with MR of 3+ or 4+ at baseline, 11 patients (91.67%) remained with MR ≤ 2+ at 1 year, and no patient had mitral stenosis. Significant reductions in maximum MR area (from 15.1 ± 6.51 cm2 to 4.45 ± 1.85 cm2, P &lt; 0.001), effective orifice area (from 4.34 ± 0.34 cm2 to 2.38 ± 0.45 cm2, P &lt; 0.001), and vena contracta width (from 8.03 ± 1.11 to 3.38 ± 2.11 mm, P &lt; 0.001) were observed. The left cardiac dimensions were decreased, especially the mitral valve annulus diameter (from 34.79 ± 4.27 mm to 31.42 ± 2.81 mm, P &lt; 0.05). Of the 12 patients with baseline New York Heart Association functional class III/IV, all patients experienced an improvement of at least one class (P &lt; 0.05).Our study provides evidence that transapical ValveClamp implantation in high-risk patients with severe degenerative MR is safe and feasible, with good efficacy in the mid-long term.
