Title: Myeloid leukocytes' diverse effects on cardiovascular and systemic inflammation in chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: Chronic kidney disease's prevalence rises globally. Whereas dialysis treatment replaces the kidney's filtering function and prolongs life, dreaded consequences in remote organs develop inevitably over time. Even milder reductions in kidney function not requiring replacement therapy associate with bacterial infections, cardiovascular and heart valve disease, which markedly limit prognosis in these patients. The array of complications is diverse and engages a wide gamut of cellular and molecular mechanisms. The innate immune system is profoundly and systemically altered in chronic kidney disease and, as a unifying element, partakes in many of the disease's complications. As such, a derailed immune system fuels cardiovascular disease progression but also elevates the propensity for serious bacterial infections. Recent data further point towards a role in developing calcific aortic valve stenosis. Here, we delineate the current state of knowledge on how chronic kidney disease affects innate immunity in cardiovascular organs and on a systemic level. We review the role of circulating myeloid cells, monocytes and neutrophils, resident macrophages, dendritic cells, ligands, and cellular pathways that are activated or suppressed when renal function is chronically impaired. Finally, we discuss myeloid cells' varying responses to uremia from a systems immunology perspective.
