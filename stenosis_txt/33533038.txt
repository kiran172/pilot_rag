Title: Pacemaker following transcatheter aortic valve replacement and tricuspid regurgitation: A single-center experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: As transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures increase, more data is available on the development of conduction abnormalities requiring permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation post-TAVR. Mechanistically, new pacemaker implantation and incidence of associated tricuspid regurgitation (TR) post-TAVR is not well understood. Studies have evaluated the predictability of patient anatomy towards risk for needing permanent pacemaker (PPM) post-TAVR; however, little has been reported on new PPM and TR in patients post-TAVR.
METHODS: This retrospective study identified patients at our health system who underwent PPM following TAVR from January 2014 to June 2018. Data from both TAVR and PPM procedures as well as patient demographics were collected. Echocardiographic data before TAVR, between TAVR and PPM placement, and the most recent echocardiogram at the time of chart review were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 796 patients who underwent TAVR between January 2014 and June 2018, 89 patients (11%) subsequently required PPM. Out of the 89 patients who required PPM implantation, 82 patients had pre-TAVR and 2-year post-TAVR echocardiographic imaging data. At baseline, 22% (18/82) of patients had at least moderate TR. At 2-year post-TAVR echocardiographic imaging follow-up; 27% (22/82) of patients had at least moderate TR. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the TAVR valve size implanted. In patients who received a TAVR device < 29 mm in diameter in size, 25% (11/44) had worsening TR. In patients who received a TAVR device ≥ 29 mm in diameter, 37% (14/38) had worsening TR.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a patient population that may be predisposed to developing worsening TR and right heart function after TAVR and Pacemaker implantation.
