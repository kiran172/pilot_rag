Title: A Case Series on Successful Surgical Management of Patients Presenting With Lutembacher's Syndrome to a Tertiary Healthcare Center in Northern India.

Abstract: Atrial septal defect (ASD), whether congenital or iatrogenic, and mitral stenosis (MS), whether congenital or acquired, may all come together into a condition called Lutembacher's syndrome (LS). The ASD is typically larger than 15 mm in a normal LS case. However, congenital ASD is less frequent than residual iatrogenic ASD in the current era of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty for acquired MS. This is referred to as iatrogenic LS by cardiologists. Hereby, we report a case series of three patients who presented to us, were diagnosed with LS, a very rare entity, and wereÂ managed successfully.
