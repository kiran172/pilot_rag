Title: Differentiating between segmental arterial mediolysis and other arterial vasculopathies to establish an early diagnosis - a systematic literature review and proposal of new diagnostic criteria.

Abstract: Segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) is a rare vascular disease, characterized by acute but transient vulnerability of the wall of medium-sized arteries. The most characteristic feature of SAM is its biphasic course: an injurious phase marked by acute weakness of the arterial wall leading to acute dissection and/or hemorrhage, followed by a reparative phase in which granulation tissue and fibrosis restore the injured arterial wall. Residual stenosis, aneurysms, and/or arterial wall irregularities may remain visible on future imaging studies. Differentiating between SAM and other arterial vasculopathies is difficult due to its similarities with many other vascular diseases, such as vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia, inherited connective tissue disorders, and isolated visceral artery dissection. In this systematic review, we provide an overview on SAM, with an emphasis on the differential diagnosis and diagnostic work-up. We propose new diagnostic criteria to help establish a prompt diagnosis of SAM, illustrated by case examples from our multidisciplinary vascular clinic.
