Title: Awake intubation for thoracic aortic aneurysm causing esophageal stenosis with food residues and compression of the pulmonary artery and left bronchi: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anesthetic management of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) is sometimes difficult due to fatal complications, including hypovolemic shock secondary to aneurysm rupture. We report the successful management of an impending rupture of a TAA with associated esophageal stenosis and compression of the pulmonary artery and left bronchi.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 83-year-old woman, diagnosed with an impending rupture of the ascending TAA, was scheduled to undergo emergency total aortic arch replacement. Computed tomography showed esophageal stenosis with significant amounts of food residues in the thoracic esophagus and compression of the pulmonary artery and bronchi. We performed awake intubation and superior laryngeal nerve block with light sedation to prevent aspiration and aneurysmal rupture, respectively. General anesthesia was induced immediately after the intubation. No intraoperative complications occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Performing awake intubation with a superior laryngeal nerve block and sedation may prevent aspiration of food residues and hemodynamic changes that may lead to rupture.
