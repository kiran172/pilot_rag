Title: Anesthetic Management for Tracheal Resection and Reconstruction.

Abstract: Tracheal resection and reconstruction (TRR) surgery presents unique challenges to the anesthesiologist. These challenges include the induction of anesthesia and establishment of an airway in a patient with tracheal stenosis; airway management during the open tracheal phase of the operation; and emergence from anesthesia and extubation at the end of the case. A number of approaches to the safe conduct of these anesthetics have been described in the literature. Ultimately the successful anesthetic management of TRR hinges on an understanding of the surgical procedure, as well as close communication with the surgeon.
