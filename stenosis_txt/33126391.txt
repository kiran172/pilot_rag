Title: Metastasis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma to right occipital parafalcine meningioma: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare clinical phenomenon. Although meningioma is the most common intracranial recipient of cancer metastasis, only a few cases have been reported. We present a case of metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma into intracranial meningioma and review the published literature.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for a 1-month history of headache and pain in her lower extremities.
DIAGNOSIS: Brain and lumbar vertebral magnetic resonance imaging showed an intracranial space-occupying lesion in the right occipital region and spinal canal stenosis. Pulmonary computed tomography showed an irregular mass in the right upper lobe of the lung. The postoperative histological examination demonstrated adenocarcinoma metastasis to meningioma.
INTERVENTION: The patient underwent right occipital craniotomy for tumor removal and lumbar spinal canal decompression.
OUTCOMES: There were no initial abnormal conditions after the operation. However, the patient died suddenly 7 days after surgery.
LESSONS: Tumor-to-meningioma metastasis is a rare but important phenomenon. According to previous reports, it is associated with rapid onset of symptoms and a poor prognosis. Histological examination is of great importance in diagnosis. The history and process of malignant carcinoma should be closely monitored.
