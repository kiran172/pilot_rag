Title: Minimum-incision transsubclavian transcatheter aortic valve replacement with balloon-expandable valve for dialysis patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) face increased risk and have poorer outcomes than non-dialysis patients. Moreover, TAVR in dialysis patients using an alternative approach is considered extremely risky and little is known about the outcomes. We routinely perform minimum-incision transsubclavian TAVR (MITS-TAVR), which is contraindicated for transfemoral (TF) TAVR. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of MITS-TAVR compared with those of TF-TAVR in dialysis patients.
METHODS: This single-center, observational study included 79 consecutive dialysis patients who underwent MITS-TAVR (MITS group, n = 22) or TF-TAVR (TF group, n = 57) under regional anesthesia.
RESULTS: The rates of peripheral artery disease (MITS vs. TF, 72.7 % vs. 26.3 %; p < 0.01), shaggy aortas (MITS vs. TF, 63.6 % vs. 5.26 %; p < 0.01), and tortuous aortas (MITS vs. TF, 13.6 % vs. 1.75 %; p = 0.031) were significantly higher in the MITS group. The 30-day mortality was 2.53 % and comparable between the two groups (MITS vs. TF, 4.54 % vs. 1.75 %; p = 0.479). In the MITS group, 14 patients had ipsilateral dialysis fistulas, and three patients had patent in situ ipsilateral internal thoracic artery grafts; however, no vascular complications were observed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the two groups showed no significant difference in the survival rate (at 2 years; MITS vs. TF, 77.3 % vs. 68.8 %; p = 0.840) and freedom from cardiovascular mortality (at 2 years; MITS vs. TF, 90.9 % vs. 96.5 %; p = 0.898). The multivariable Cox proportional hazard model also indicated that survival in the MITS group was not significantly different from that in the TF group (hazard ratio 1.48; 95 % confidence interval, 0.77-2.85, p = 0.244). The patency rate of ipsilateral dialysis fistula was 100 % during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The outcome of MITS-TAVR was comparable to that of TF-TAVR in dialysis patients, despite the higher risk of patient characteristics.
