Title: Innovative seated vertical lumbar traction allows simultaneous computer work while inducing spinal height changes similar to supine lying.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lumbar intervertebral disc height loss has been associated with spinal height change (SHC) and low back pain (LBP), including stenosis. Non-invasive methods to improve disc height loss require forms of lying down, which are unconducive to computer work.
OBJECTIVE: Intermittent vertical traction (VT) integrated with seated computer work may provide ergonomic alternatives for increasing SHC to promote LBP relief. The primary aim was to develop and introduce a safe VT prototype and dosage to induce and measure SHC. Prototype comfort and LBP ratings were exploratory secondary aims.
METHODS: Forty-one participants were stadiometry-measured for pre- and post-intervention SHC from seated VT at 35% body weight removed, supine lying (SL), and sitting at a computer (SIT) without VT. Pain ratings were recorded for those self-reporting LBP. VT prototype evaluations were compiled from a 3-question, 7-point Likert-style survey.
RESULTS: SHC increased by 3.9 ± 3.4 mm in VT, 1.7 ± 3.4 mm in SIT, and 4.3 ± 3.1 mm in SL (P< 0.000). Post hoc findings were significant between VT and SIT (P< 0.000), and SL and SIT (P< 0.000). VT and SL LBP ratings both decreased, but not SIT.
CONCLUSION: Intermittent seated VT is a promising alternative for postural relief during seated computer work, producing SHC similar to lying down without compromising workflow.
