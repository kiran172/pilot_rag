Title: Novel technique of flexible endoscopic therapy of Zenker's diverticulum using a pulsed Holmium laser-a retrospective single-center analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In recent years, flexible endoscopic therapy of Zenker's diverticulum seems to become the standard approach. The aim of this study was to assess the safety, efficacy and short-term outcome of flexible endoscopic diverticulotomy of Zenker's diverticulum with a pulsed Holmium laser (PHL).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients treated with endoscopic laser-diverticulotomy using a PHL between February 2013 and November 2021 at the University Hospital Salzburg were extracted from our prospectively maintained endoscopic database. Demographic data, size of Zenker's diverticulum, procedure duration, complications, short-term outcome and rate of recurrence were evaluated.
RESULTS: In the study period, 45 procedures in 36 patients were performed. Mean depth of the Zenker diverticulum was 21 mm (10-60 mm), mean procedure time was 31 min (15-60 min), intraprocedural adverse events occurred in 2 out of 45 patients (5%) which were both managed endoscopically, post-procedural stenosis occurred in 1 patient (2%). In the follow-up examinations (mean follow-up after 6.4 months), 27 out of 36 patients (75%) were symptom-free, 6 patients (17%) reported an improvement of dysphagia. 3 patients (9%) suffered from persistent dysphagia. After initial symptom relief, a recurrent diverticulum occurred in 5 patients. Endoscopic re-intervention with PHL was done in these cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Flexible endoscopic treatment of primary and recurrent Zenker's diverticulum using a PHL is a promising, safe and effective treatment with, in our opinion, technical advantages in comparison to the CO<sub>2</sub> laser. Further controlled prospective trials are needed.
