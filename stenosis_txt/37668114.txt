Title: [Preventive treatment to avoid recurrence of stroke and TIA is effective].

Abstract: Healthy living with physical activity, healthy eating habits, no smoking, and no alcohol overuse have an important role in primary and secondary stroke prevention. Further secondary prevention depends on type and cause of stroke or TIA. After intracerebral bleeding, ischemic stroke or TIA, preventive pharmacological therapies include antihypertensive drugs. After ischemic stroke or TIA, treatment with antithrombotics (oral anticoagulants or antiplatelets) and statins is recommended. In stroke due to unusual causes, the pharmacological preventive treatment described above may need modification. For symptomatic carotid stenosis, carotid surgery is recommended, preferably within the first 14 days after onset. A surgical preventive treatment is closure of patent foramen ovale in patients aged 18-60 years with ischemic stroke of unknown cause.
