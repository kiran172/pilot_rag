Title: Gastrointestinal bleeding due to Heyde's syndrome resolved by transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).

Abstract: We introduce the case of an 82-year-old woman with Heyde's syndrome (HS) whose gastrointestinal bleeding was refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy, for which a percutaneous aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was performed. The outcome after TAVI was good, gastrointestinal bleeding ceased and Hb remained stable during follow-up in the following 3 months. Currently, although SH is not an indication for TAVI, it could be an indication for TAVI in patients with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding or refractory anemia to other therapies, using the percutaneous route in those with high surgical risk.
