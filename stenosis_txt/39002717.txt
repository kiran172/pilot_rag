Title: Morphological anomalies in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Insights from four-dimensional computed tomography and surgical correlation.

Abstract: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder in which left ventricular outflow tract obstruction critically affects symptoms and prognosis. Traditionally, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was primarily attributed to septal hypertrophy with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. However, recent evidence highlights significant contributions from the mitral valve and papillary muscle anomalies, as well as an apical-basal muscle bundle observed in HCM patients. Accurate morphological assessment is essential when considering septal reduction therapy. While transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance are recommended for assessing the anomalous structures, four-dimensional computed tomography offers superior spatial resolution and multiplanar reconstruction capabilities. These features enable the evaluation of details of the morphological anomalies, such as the apical-basal muscle band, papillary muscle anomalies, subaortic stenosis, and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Based on the detailed assessment of these morphological features, four-dimensional computed tomography has been utilized for planning of surgical correction in a comprehensive HCM center. This approach facilitates the intervention strategies and may improve outcomes in septal reduction therapy for obstructive HCM.
