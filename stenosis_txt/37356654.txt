Title: A Comparative Analysis and Results of Carotid Interventions Based on Duplex Ultrasound as a Single Exam Versus Multiple Diagnose Exams.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To determine the results, safety, and clinical outcomes of carotid interventions performed with duplex ultrasound (DUS) as a single preoperative image for internal carotid artery (ICA) assessment, compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).
METHODS: Prospective, consecutive cohort study of 2 groups of patients submitted to carotid interventions, 1 group of patients with DUS as a sole exam (group DUS) compared to patients with DUS plus CTA or MRA for ICA stenosis diagnosis (group CTA/MRA) regarding clinical outcomes such as major stroke, minor stroke, transient ischemic attack and perioperative mortality.
RESULTS: Two groups of patients were identified: group DUS with 47 patients and group CTA/MRA plus DUS with 68 patients. The mean age of the patients was 71.67 years in total cohort, and most of them were male (66.1%). Group DUS had higher prevalence of male, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease and chronic kidney disease than group CTA/MRA (83% vs. 54.4%, P = 0.001; 93.6% vs. 51.5%, P < 0.001; 36.2% vs. 16.2%, P = 0.009; 29.8% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.019; 14.9% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.007, respectively). We have performed a Kaplan-Meier regarding survival rates: Group DUS had 93.5%% and Group CTA/MRA had 90.3%% at 720 days. P = 0.15, standard error < 10 at 720 days. a Kaplan-Meier analysis regarding primary patency rates showed Group DUS with 92.7% and Group CTA/MRA with 94.7% at 720 days. P = 0.78, standard error < 10 at 720 days. Furthermore, the incidence of postoperative stroke was 2.6% (asymptomatic 1.7%, symptomatic 2.9%), with no differences among DUS and CTA/MRA groups (2.1% vs. 2.9%, P = 0.78, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Independently of the type of carotid intervention (carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting (CAS)), DUS as an only preoperative carotid image has similar results regarding postoperative outcomes when compared to CTA/MRA for preoperative carotid evaluation.
