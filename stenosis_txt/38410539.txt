Title: Outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in Israeli Jews and Arabs.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ethnic minorities may face disparities in access to health care and clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has an established role in treatment of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, however outcome of these procedures among different demographics within the multi-ethnic Israeli society is unknown. We sought to compare mortality following TAVR between Jewish and Arab patients in Israel.
METHODS: A prospective single-center TAVR registry in northern Israel was analyzed. We compared post-procedural survival among Arab and Jewish patients who underwent TAVR, presenting the estimated hazard ratio (HR) using Cox regression.
RESULTS: Of 923 subjects who underwent TAVR between 2010-2021, 172 (19%) were Arab and 751 (81%) were Jewish. The Arab patient population was younger (mean 77 vs. 81 years, P&lt;0.001), had lower prevalence of coronary artery disease (34%, vs. 43%, P=0.02), hypertension (80% vs. 88%, P&lt;0.01) and calculated procedural mortality (EuroScore II: mean 4.6 vs. 4.9, P=0.02), and higher percentage of females (65% vs. 53%, P=0.01), body mass index (mean 30 vs. 28, P&lt;0.001) and creatinine clearance (mean 67 vs. 59 mL/min, P&lt;0.001). Arab patients had similar post-procedural mortality compared to Jewish patients [7-day mortality: adjusted HR 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39-5.77, P=0.55; 30-day mortality: adjusted HR 1.79, 95% CI: 0.62-5.18, P=0.29; 1-year mortality: adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI: 0.72-2.12, P=0.43].
CONCLUSIONS: Arab patients undergoing TAVR were younger and had lower predicted mortality than Jewish counterparts, however, these characteristics did not translate into improved post-procedural survival.
