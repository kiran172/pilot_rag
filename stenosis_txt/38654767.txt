Title: D-Transposition of Great Arteries With Infective Endocarditis and Congestive Cardiac Failure: A Case Report.

Abstract: Embryological misalignment between the aorta and pulmonary trunk gives rise to the congenital anomaly of the heart known as transposition of the great arteries (TGA). TGA is a type of parallel circulation, where the heart pumps oxygenated blood from the left ventricle into the pulmonary trunk. The deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle is circulated into the body as it pumps blood into the aorta. This type of parallel circulation is not compatible with life unless there is communication between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. The presence of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in TGA patients serves as this communication. Cyanosis in the first month of life is the most common presenting feature. We had a five-and-a-half-year-old male child presenting with cyanosis and congestive cardiac failure (CCF), along with infective endocarditis with mitral valve regurgitation, which is an unusual complication of dextro-TGA (d-TGA) with pulmonary stenosis (PS) with VSD.
