Title: Unilateral Biportal Endoscopy for the Treatment of Lumbar Disc Herniation.

Abstract: Unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) is a minimally invasive spinal surgery technique increasingly employed in treating degenerative lumbar diseases, such as lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis, and spondylolisthesis. In UBE, two independent yet interconnected surgical channels are established-one for the endoscope and the other for surgical instruments-providing a broad and clear surgical field of view. UBE offers several advantages over traditional open surgery, including reduced tissue damage, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times. Additionally, it combines the benefits of microscopic surgery and interlaminar endoscopy, enhancing flexibility, accuracy, and reliability during the procedure. The learning curve for UBE is shorter than that for transforaminal endoscopy, as the surgical processes closely resemble those of conventional open surgery. Despite its favorable clinical outcomes, such as reduced blood loss and shorter hospitalization, UBE carries potential complications, including epidural hematoma, dural injury, and compression of the outlet nerve root. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to ensure appropriate patient selection, apply the correct surgical technique, and engage in careful postoperative monitoring. This article provides a detailed summary of the step-by-step surgical techniques used in UBE for treating lumbar disc herniation. It serves as a comprehensive guide to enhance practitioners' understanding of UBE. The presentation also underscores the importance of rigorous training and expertise to ensure optimal patient outcomes.
