Title: Rare instances of concomitant acute myocardial infarction and stroke.

Abstract: Cardio-cerebral infarction (CCI) is a term coined to describe concomitant myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke. Acute myocardial infarction and stroke, as separate events, constitute some of the most important causes for disability and mortality in aging societies. Stroke can either occur simultaneously with myocardial infarction or become a serious complication of myocardial infarction and/or its treatment. The frequency of CCI has been reported at a 0.009% incidence rate in stroke patients and is associated with an extremely high mortality. Because of the rare occurrence of CCI, there are currently no guidelines for assessing its diagnosis and optimal treatment. Therefore, currently, the management of CCI cases needs to be individualized. Hopefully, in the future, the results of large clinical trials or prospective registries are expected to enhance our understanding of managing concomitant acute MI and stroke. In this review we have focused on the current literacy in the diagnosis and treatment of CCIs. The paper illustrates potential distinct scenarios of CCI through the analysis of three patient cases (Fig. 5, Ref. 65).
