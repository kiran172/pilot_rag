Title: Surgical correction of a pulmonary artery aneurysm with severe pulmonary regurgitation with a valve-sparing technique.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery aneurysms are rare but are associated with a significant risk of rupture and dissection. Moreover, pulmonary valve regurgitation and/or stenosis often coexist. In this study, we present a case of a pulmonary artery aneurysm with severe pulmonary regurgitation in a patient with pulmonary hypertension treated with aneurysm resection and pulmonary valve repair.
