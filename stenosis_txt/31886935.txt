Title: Baseline left ventricular diastolic dysfunction affects midterm mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine whether preprocedural left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction impairs midterm mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), we performed a meta-analysis of currently available evidence.
METHODS: We identified all studies investigating impact of preprocedural severity of LV diastolic dysfunction on midterm (≥1-year) all-cause mortality after TAVI for patients with AS through a search of databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) until September 2019. From each study, we extracted an adjusted (if unavailable, unadjusted) hazard ratio (HR) of midterm mortality. We pooled study-specific estimates in the random-effects model.
RESULTS: Ten eligible studies with a total of 2380 patients with AS undergoing TAVI were identified. In accordance with pooled analyses, higher-grade preprocedural LV diastolic dysfunction was associated with significantly worse midterm all-cause mortality after TAVI compared to lower-grade dysfunction (HR for grade II vs I, 1.15; P = .002; HR for grade III vs I, 1.35; P = .001; HR for grade III vs II; 1.16, P = .002; HR for grade II-III vs I, II-III vs 0-I, or III vs I-II, 1.34; P < .00001 [primary meta-analysis]; HR per grade, 1.16; P = .003). No funnel plot asymmetry for the primary meta-analysis (for grade II-III vs I, II-III vs 0-I, or III vs I-II) was identified, which probably indicated no publication bias (P = .381 by the linear-regression test).
CONCLUSION: Higher-grade preprocedural LV diastolic dysfunction was associated with worse midterm all-cause mortality after TAVI for patients with AS compared to lower-grade dysfunction.
