Title: Relationship between Pulse Wave Velocity and Cardiovascular Biomarkers in Patients with Risk Factors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The relationship between pulse wave velocity (PWV) and biomarkers of structural changes of the left ventricle and carotid arteries remains poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between PWV and these biomarkers.
METHODS: This was an analytical, retrospective, cross-sectional study. Medical records of patients with diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and pre-hypertension or hypertension, who underwent central blood pressure (CBP) measurement using Mobil-O-Graph®, and carotid doppler or echocardiography three months before and after the CBPM were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson or Spearman correlation, linear bivariate and multiple regression analysis, and the t test (independent) or Mann-Whitney test. A p <0.05 indicated statistical significance.
RESULTS: Medical records of 355 patients were analyzed, mean age 56.1 (±14.8) years, 51% male. PWV was correlated with intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotids (r=0.310) and left ventricular septal thickness (r=0.191), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (r=0.215), and left atrial diameter (r=0.181). IMT was associated with PWV adjusted by age and peripheral systolic pressure (p=0.0004); IMT greater than 1 mm increased the chance of having PWV above 10 m/s by 3.94 times. PWV was significantly higher in individuals with left ventricular hypertrophy (p=0.0001), IMT > 1 mm (p=0.006), carotid plaque (p=0.0001), stenosis ≥ 50% (p=0.003), and target-organ damage (p=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: PWV was correlated with IMT and echocardiographic parameters, and independently associated with IMT. This association was stronger in individuals with left ventricular hypertrophy, increased IMT, carotid plaque, stenosis ≥ 50%, and target organ damage. (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; 115(6):1125-1132).
