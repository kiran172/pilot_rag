Title: Dual antiplatelet therapy in myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary artery disease - insights from a nationwide registry.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is a mainstay for myocardial infarction (MI) therapy. However, in patients with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA), clear recommendations are lacking in the literature. This study aims to identify the cases in which DAPT is currently prescribed at discharge for MINOCA.
METHODS: The authors analyzed a cohort of patients from a multicenter national registry enrolling patients who suffered their first MI between 2010 and 2017, and underwent coronary angiography revealing absence of stenosis ≥50%. Individual antithrombotic therapy was identified. A logistic regression analysis was applied to search for predictors of DAPT.
RESULTS: From a total of 16 237 patients analyzed, 709 (4.4%) were categorized as MINOCA. Mean age was 64±13 years, 46.3% (n=409) were females. 390 (55.0%) of MINOCA patients were discharged on DAPT. Males (OR 1.67, CI 95 [1.05-2.38], p=0.027), active smokers (OR=1.82, CI 95 [1.05-3.16], p=0.033), previous percutaneous intervention (OR 3.18, CI 95 [1.48-6.81], p=0.003), ST elevation MI (OR 2.70, CI 95 [1.59-4.76], p<0.001) and sinus rhythm at admission (OR=3.94, CI 95 [2.07-7.48], p<0.001) were independent predictors of DAPT use.
CONCLUSION: In this nationwide registry, DAPT was prescribed at discharge in 55% of MINOCA patients. Beyond sinus rhythm, the variables presented as independent predictors for DAPT use identify subgroups of patients who are classified as more prone to thrombotic events. The issue of how to handle antithrombotic agents in MINOCA patients is a topic open for discussion.
