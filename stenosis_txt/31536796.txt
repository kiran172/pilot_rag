Title: Comparison of Bypass and Endovascular Intervention for Popliteal Occlusion with the Involvement of Trifurcation for Critical Limb Ischemia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to analyze the technical aspects and outcomes of the treatment of occlusion of the popliteal artery with the involvement of the trifurcation treated with a bypass (open) and endovascular (endo) approach.
METHODS: Overall, 108 consecutive procedures were enrolled retrospectively. Patients were evaluated in 2 groups: the endo group (65 patients) and the open group (43 patients). Primary outcome were MALE (major adverse limb events), amputation-free survival, and early mortality (until 30 days). Secondary outcome was overall survival in 3 years. Inclusion criteria were Rutherford 4 and 5 and occlusion of the popliteal artery with the involvement of trifurcation and, at least, 1 infrapopliteal artery of runoff.
RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients in the open and 96.9% of patients in the endo group. Freedom from MALE was 73.5% and 68.5% for 1 and 3 years respectively for the endo group, and 84.3% and 77.2% respectively for the open group (P = 0.413). Considering the total number of major reinterventions executed until 3 years, the reinterventions was statistically more performed in the endo compared to the open group (P = 0.0459). Amputation-free survival for the endo group in 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years was 93.7%, 79.3%, and 66.0%, respectively, and the amputation-free survival for the open group was 88.4%, 77.4%, and 64.3% (P = 0.726). Early mortality was 9.3% for the open group and 1.5% for the endo group (P = 0.060). In 3 years, the overall survival was 75.1% in the open group and 84.3% in the endo group.
CONCLUSIONS: In 3 years, follow-up endovascular treatment of occlusion of the popliteal artery with the involvement of the trifurcation has similar time freedom from MALE compared to open approach. Overall and amputation-free survival was not different between the groups besides more reinterventions in patients who underwent endovascular approach.
