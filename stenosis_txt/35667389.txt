Title: Impact of endobiliary radiofrequency ablation on biliary drainage in patients with malignant biliary strictures treated with uncovered self-expandable metal stents: a randomized controlled multicenter trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endobiliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA), usually combined with endoscopic stent insertion, is a simple procedure with the potential to improve stent patency and patient survival for malignant biliary obstruction. We conducted this randomized multicenter trial to evaluate the impact of RFA on stent patency.
METHODS: Eighty-six patients with malignant biliary obstruction and nonresectable tumors (pancreatic carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or metastases) were included and randomly assigned to receive a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) only (n = 44) or RFA followed by SEMS insertion (RFA+SEMS, n = 42). The primary outcome measure was stent patency after 3 and 6 months; secondary outcome measures were patient survival and early adverse events within 30 days.
RESULTS: Technical success rates for RFA and stent insertion were 100% and 98.8%, respectively. Stent patency after 3 and 6 months did not differ significantly between groups (RFA+SEMS group, 73.1% and 33.3%, respectively; SEMS-only group, 81.8% and 52.4%, respectively; P = .6). Similarly, the addition of RFA did not impact overall survival (hazard ratio, .72; P = .389 for RFA+SEMS). The adverse event rate in the RFA+SEMS group was 10.5% compared with 2.3% in the SEMS-only group, without a statistically significant difference (P = .18).
CONCLUSIONS: RFA as an addition to SEMS implantation had no positive impact on patency rate or survival. (Clinical trial registration number: DRKS00018993.).
