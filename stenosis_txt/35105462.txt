Title: Late Access Site Complications Following Transfemoral Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Few data exist on late vascular complications (VCs) after transfemoral (TF) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of late access site VC after TF TAVI. A total of 128 patients (mean age: 80 ± 8 years, women: 52%) who underwent TF TAVI without major VC were included. A femoral US-Doppler evaluation was performed in all patients at a median of 5 (3 to 15) months after the procedure, and 76 patients (59.4%) also had a preprocedural ultrasound (US)-Doppler examination. The impact of baseline and procedural factors (including the use of simple 2 Proglides or complex additional Proglide or Angioseal device on top of the 2 Proglide technique, hemostasis techniques, and the use of balloon dilation for optimizing femoral hemostasis) were evaluated. The follow-up US-Doppler evaluation detected 2 asymptomatic VCs (1.6%), and 5 (3.9%) patients exhibited significant femoral stenosis (peak systolic velocity [PSV] ≥300 cm/s). Female gender (p <0.001) and smaller femoral diameter (p = 0.045) were associated with higher femoral PSV values. In those patients who underwent a pre-TAVI femoral US-Doppler, the median PSV values after TAVI were higher compared with those obtained pre-TAVI (p <0.001), but similar results were found for the contralateral femoral arteries. A complex hemostasis technique or the use of balloon optimization at the puncture site was not associated with any increase in PSV values. In conclusion, percutaneous femoral hemostasis after TAVI was associated with a low rate of late VC. The results were similar irrespective of the hemostasis technique and the use of balloon dilation at the puncture site, but women and a smaller femoral size were associated with increased PSV values. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal femoral hemostasis technique in TAVI procedures.
