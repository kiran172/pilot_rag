Title: Secondary endovascular procedures improve overall patency and limb salvage in patients undergoing in situ saphenous vein infragenicular bypass.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Secondary interventions strongly improves patency and limb salvage rates in patients undergoing infrainguinal vein bypass. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of secondary endovascular procedures performed during the follow-up on patency and limb salvage in patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) undergoing in situ saphenous vein infragenicular bypass.
METHODS: From January 2018 to December 2019 541 patients in 43 centers have been enrolled into the LIMBSAVE registry (treatment of critical Limb IschaeMia with infragenicular Bypass adopting in situ SAphenous VEin technique). In all patients a strict surveillance program with Duplex scan was established (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months). During the follow-up indications for endovascular procedures were anastomotic stenoses, improvement of run-in (iliac stenosis) or run-off (tibial vessels' stenoses or occlusions). Two-year estimated outcomes in terms of overall patency, and limb salvage were analyzed by life-table analysis (Kaplan-Meier test). Outcomes obtained in patients undergoing endovascular procedure (Group-endo) were compared by means of Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon Test with those obtained in patients with no secondary endovascular procedure during the follow-up (Group-no endo).
RESULTS: Two groups were homogeneous in terms of demographics and intraprocedural details. Overall mean duration of follow-up was 12.1 months (range 1-24). During the follow-up period (>30 days) 55 endovascular procedures were performed in 49 patients (9.1%) (Group-endo). Most of endovascular procedures (37/55, 67.3%) was performed to treat stenoses at proximal or distal anastomosis. Secondary endovascular procedures (40/55, 72.7%) were predominantly performed within 6 months from the index procedure. Estimated 2-year overall patency (97.9% vs. 85.2%, P=0.05), and limb salvage (100% vs. 93.9%, P=0.05) rates were significantly better in Group-endo.
CONCLUSIONS: Secondary endovascular procedures in patients with CLTI undergoing in situ saphenous infragenicular bypass significantly improve the rates of overall patency and limb salvage in the mid-term period.
