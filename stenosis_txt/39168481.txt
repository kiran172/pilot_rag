Title: First pediatric pelvic surgery with the Senhance® robotic surgical system: A case series.

Abstract: The Senhance® robotic system (Senhance [Asensus Surgical Inc., Naderhan, NC, USA]) is a new surgical assistive robot following the da Vinci Surgical System that has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious. Herein, we report the first case series of pediatric pelvic surgery using Senhance. Two anorectoplasties and one rectal pull-through coloanal anastomosis for rectal stenosis were performed in three children (5-9 months, 7-9 kg) using a 10-mm three-dimensional (3D) 4K camera and 3 and 5 mm forceps operated with Senhance. None of the patients had intraoperative complications or a good postoperative course. Pediatric pelvic surgery with Senhance could be performed precisely and safely with a small body cavity. With its beautiful 3D images, motion of forceps with reduced tremor, and availability of 3-mm forceps, Senhance may be better suited for children compared with other models.
