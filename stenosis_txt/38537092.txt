Title: [ Symptomatic Triple-Region Spinal Stenosis (TRSS): case report and narrative Literature Review].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Simultaneous spinal stenosis in three regions of the spine is an unusual condition that demands proper clinical evaluation and imaging. Currently, there are no established guidelines for its diagnostic and therapeutic approach.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe, based on a case report, the clinical presentation, treatment, and patient progression concerning triple stenosis, contrasting it with available evidence through a narrative review of the literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old woman presented with a progressive paraparesis accompanied by right sciatica and positive signs of upper motor neuron involvement. Imaging confirmed triple stenosis: cervical, dorsal, and lumbar. Dorsal decompression and tumor resection were performed in association with conservative treatment for cervical and lumbar stenosis, resulting in a favorable evolution one year post-surgery.
CONCLUSION: Symptomatic triple-region spinal stenosis is an unusual condition. Proper clinical and radiological assessments will enable accurate diagnosis and timely management.
