Title: Endovascular Revascularization Improves the Central Hemodynamics and Augmentation Index in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease.

Abstract: Objective To evaluate the effect of endovascular therapy (EVT) on the central blood pressure (CBP) and augmentation index (AIx) in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Methods The CBP and AIx were assessed by radial applanation tonometry the day before and the day after EVT. We compared the differences in the therapeutic effects between the stenotic and occlusive lesions and between the iliac and superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions. Patients We enrolled 60 consecutive patients with PAD who underwent EVT for de novo lesions. Results Both the CBP and AIx were significantly decreased after EVT (125±22 mmHg to 112±22 mmHg; p=0.002 and 84%±16% to 73%±15%; p<0.001, respectively). The effects of EVT on the CBP and AIx were equivalent, regardless of whether the target lesion was the stenotic lesion or the occlusive lesion. There were no significant differences between the iliac and SFA lesions in the effects of EVT on the CBP and AIx. Conclusion EVT improved the CBP and AIx in patients with PAD, regardless of the morphology or site of the lesions.
