Title: Thoracoscopic esophagectomy for stenosis of thoracic esophagus due to acute esophageal necrosis associated with alcoholic ketoacidosis.

Abstract: Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is a rare disease characterized by the appearance of diffuse black mucosa on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; the condition often progresses to esophageal stenosis in the chronic phase. A 70-year-old man was admitted to a neighborhood hospital with the diagnosis of alcoholic ketoacidosis and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed to investigate the symptom of esophageal tightness revealed AEN. The patient developed esophageal stenosis with scarring in the chronic phase and was referred to our hospital for surgery 6Â months after the diagnosis of AEN. We performed thoracoscopic esophagectomy with the patient in the prone position. Although the esophagus was thickened and strong adhesions were present around the esophagus due to inflammation, we were able to complete the surgical procedure thoracoscopically. In patients presenting with benign esophageal stenosis developing after AEN, thoracoscopic esophagectomy may be a useful treatment option, even in the presence of severe fibrosis.
