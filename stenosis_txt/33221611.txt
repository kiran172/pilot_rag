Title: The Association Between Apolipoprotein E Gene Polymorphism and In-Stent Restenosis After Extracranial and Intracranial Artery Stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neo-atherosclerosis plays a vital role in the incidence of in-stent restenosis (ISR) after extracranial and intracranial artery stenting, and Apolipoprotein (ApoE) gene polymorphism has been reported to be closely related to the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis. The present study aims to investigate the association between ApoE gene polymorphism and ISR after extracranial and intracranial artery stenting.
METHODS: A total of 169 patients with successful stent implantation were included in this study. ApoE genotypes were obtained during the postoperative follow-up. Color Doppler ultrasonography of cervical artery or head and neck CT angiography (CTA) was performed on the 1,3,6 and 12 months and then yearly in the clinical follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis of independent risk factors was performed to evaluate the ISR. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to compare the restenosis -free rate among the patients with different ApoE genotypes.
RESULTS: Of the 169 patients, 43 (43/169, 25.4%) developed ISR after a mean follow-up period of 10.4 months (1-35 months). Multivariate analysis showed that genotype E4/E4 (hazard ratio 3.305, P = 0.031, 95% confidence interval 1.118-9.773) and degree of stenosis >90% (hazard ratio 5.083, P = 0.001, 95% confidence interval 1.938-13.327) were significant determinants of ISR.
CONCLUSION: ApoE gene polymorphism is closely related to the incidence of ISR after extracranial and intracranial artery stenting, and the genotype E4/E4 is an independent risk factor for ISR.
