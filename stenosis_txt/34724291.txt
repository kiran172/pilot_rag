Title: Zero-contrast PTRA and stenting for child with TRAS: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is often complicated by TRAS, and PTRA can effectively treat it. However, PTRA is not appropriate for patients with CKD because iodinated contrast agent may induce nephropathy.
METHODS: This article reports about a 14-year-old boy with a history of kidney transplantation complicated by RAS. He initially underwent percutaneous balloon dilation to relieve the stenosis. One and half a year after dilation, he received zero-contrast PTRA and stenting under the guidance of external and IVUS with reference to previous PAG image.
RESULTS: After successful stent implantation, the cross-sectional area of the renal artery lumen was significantly increased.The blood pressure and level of creatinine also decreased and kept stable during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This report suggests the feasibility of external ultrasound and IVUS guided, zero-contrast PTRA in patients with poor renal function or iodinated contrast allergy.
