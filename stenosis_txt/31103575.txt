Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Role of Multimodality Imaging in Common and Complex Clinical Scenarios.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established therapy for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Technological advances and the learning curve have resulted in better procedural results in terms of hemodynamic valve performance and intermediate-term clinical outcomes. The integration of anatomical and functional information provided by multimodality imaging has improved size selection of TAVR prostheses, permitted better patient selection, and provided new insights in the performance of the TAVR prostheses at follow-up. Furthermore, the field of TAVR continues to develop and expand the technique to younger patients with lower risk on the one hand, and more complex clinical scenarios, on the other hand, such as degenerated aortic bioprostheses, bicuspid aortic valves, or pure native aortic regurgitation. The present review article summarizes how multimodality imaging can be integrated in TAVR in clinical (sometimes complex) scenarios that have not been included in the landmark randomized clinical trials.
