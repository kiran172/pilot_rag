Title: Prognostic implication of myocardial perfusion and contractile reserve in end-stage renal disease: A direct comparison of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and dobutamine stress echocardiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the prognostic value of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) and dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) without known coronary artery disease.
METHODS: Two-hundred twenty-nine ESRD patients who applied for kidney transplantation at our centre were prospectively evaluated by MPS and DSE. The primary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction (MI) or all-cause mortality. The secondary endpoint included MI or coronary revascularization (CR) not triggered by MPS or DSE at baseline.
RESULTS: MPS detected reversible ischemia in 31 patients (13.5%) and fixed perfusion defects in 13 (5.7%) patients. DSE discovered stress-induced wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) in 28 (12.2%) and at rest in 18 (7.9%) patients. MPS and DSE results agreed in 85.6% regarding reversible defects (κ = 0.358; P < .001) and in 90.8% regarding fixed defects (κ = 0.275; P < .001). Coronary angiography detected relevant stenosis > 50% in only 15 of 38 patients (39.5%) with pathological findings in MPS and/or DSE. At a median follow-up of 8 years and 10 months, the primary endpoint occurred in 70 patients (30.6%) and the secondary endpoint in 24 patients (10.5%). The adjusted Cox hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary endpoint were 1.77 (95% CI 1.02-3.08; P = .043) for perfusion defects in MPS and 1.36 (95% CI 0.78-2.37; P = ns) for WMA in DSE. The secondary endpoint was significantly correlated with the findings of both modalities, MPS (HR 3.21; 95% CI 1.35-7.61; P = .008) and DSE (HR 2.67; 95% CI 1.15-6.20; P = .022).
CONCLUSION: Perfusion defects in MPS are a stronger determinant of all-cause mortality, MI and the need for future CR compared with WMAs in DSE. Given the complementary functional information provided by MPS vs DSE, results are sometimes contradictory, which may indicate differences in the underlying pathophysiology.
