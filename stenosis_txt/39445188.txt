Title: Transthyretin amyloidosis in patients with spinal stenosis who underwent spinal surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accumulation of transthyretin amyloids (ATTR) is detected in ligamentum flavum in about 1/3 of patients underwent surgery for spinal stenosis. However, the significance of this finding is not known. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyze the incidence and importance of ATTR in patients with spinal stenosis who underwent spinal surgery.
METHODS: The primary outcome measure was incidence of ATTR in patients with spinal stenosis. English language observational studies published within 10â€‰years period were searched in Pubmed and Taylor and Francis databases.
RESULTS: Nine articles were included in the systematic review. The incidence of positive ATTR among patients who underwent lumbar spinal surgery was 48% (95%CI 38-58%). ATTR deposits were found in the lumbar region the most frequently. Seven studies showed that patients with positive ATTR were older than those with negative. Five studies investigated and found a significant relationship between the ligamentum flavum thickness and positive ATTR. Five studies investigated cardiac involvement among patients with positive ATTR.
CONCLUSION: ATTR deposits are frequently found in older patients with spinal stenosis, especially in the lumbar region. The presence of ATTR deposits is related to ligamentum flavum thickness.
