Title: Clinical Outcomes After Current-Generation Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation for Ostial Left Circumflex Lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are no available data about clinical outcomes of simple stenting for ostial left circumflex (LCX) lesions using current generation drug-eluting stents (cDES).
OBJECTIVE: We assessed clinical outcomes after simple stenting using cDES for ostial LCX lesions.
METHODS: We identified 81 consecutive patients who underwent PCI using cDES for ostial LCX lesions at New Tokyo Hospital, Matsudo, Japan between January 2010 and December 2016. An ostial LCX lesion was defined as a lesion with more than 75% stenosis by visual assessment and within 3 mm of the left main (LM) stem. The primary endpoint was target lesion failure (TLF). TLF was defined as a composite of cardiac death, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and myocardial infarction (MI). Additionally, we also assessed the revascularization for LM to left anterior descending artery (LAD) after ostial LCX stenting.
RESULTS: The TLF rate at 3 years after PCI was 24.5%. Furthermore, the rate of TLR and revascularization for LM-LAD after ostial LCX stenting were significantly higher in patients who were previously undergone stent implantation in ostial segment of LAD.
CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes after cDES implantation for ostial LCX lesion could be acceptable. However, it could have better to be avoided in patients who previously received stent implantation in ostial segment of LAD.
