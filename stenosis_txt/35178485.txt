Title: Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index and Heart Failure Hospitalization in Patients With Aortic Stenosis Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Background: The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) is associated with the severity of vascular stiffness and heart failure (HF). However, little is known about CAVI in aortic stenosis (AS) patients, probably because of the difficulty of accurately measuring CAVI in these patients owing to their slow-rising pulse. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and prognostic impact of abnormally elevated CAVI measured after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Methods and Results: Among patients with AS who underwent TAVI, those with bilateral peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and systolic HF were excluded. The effect of post-TAVI elevated CAVI (defined as ≥9.0) on HF readmission after the index discharge was investigated. In all, 149 patients (mean [±SD] age 84.8±5.6 years, 24.2% men, mean [±SD] post-TAVI CAVI 9.6±1.4) were included in the study. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between groups with and without elevated CAVI, except for lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and a higher prevalence of HF history in the group with elevated CAVI (P&lt;0.05 for both). Post-TAVI elevated CAVI (n=102) was associated with lower freedom from HF recurrence during the observational period (89.1% vs. 100%; median 726 days [interquartile range 329-1,104 days]; P&lt;0.05). Moreover, CAVI was an independent predictor of HF occurrence (hazard ratio 1.62; 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.46; P=0.022). Conclusions: Elevated CAVI was associated with HF occurrence before and after TAVI.
