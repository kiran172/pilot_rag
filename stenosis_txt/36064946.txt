Title: Combination of photodynamic therapy and endoscopic mucosal resection for recurrent esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy.

Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed for residual or recurrent esophageal cancer after radiotherapy. Here, we report a case of successful treatment of highly elevated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) that recurred after definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) using PDT combined with endoscopic resection (ER). An 86-year-old man was found to have an ESCC in the mid-thoracic esophagus. One year and two months after dCRT, a local recurrence was seen. The recurrent ESCC had a highly elevated component. The ESCC was estimated to have invaded the deep submucosa at the highly elevated component. PDT was selected as a treatment option since no lymph node or distant metastases were found. However, there was concern that the laser would not be able to penetrate deep into the ESCC due to its high elevated component. Therefore, ER was performed to remove the highly elevated component, and PDT was performed later. However, after the ER, the circumference of the recurrent ESCC was found to be approximately half the circumference, and post-PDT stenosis was also a concern due to the wide circumference of the ESCC. Therefore, we limited the area of laser irradiation in one session of PDT. Four sessions of PDT were needed over 13Â months, but a local complete response was achieved without adverse events.
