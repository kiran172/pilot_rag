Title: Native Aortic Valve Thrombus Complicating Intermittent Occlusion of a Left Main Coronary Artery.

Abstract: Intermittent left main coronary artery ostium obstruction (LMOO) caused by native aortic valve thrombus (NAVT) is an extremely rare condition. It may therefore be challenging to identify the cause using only coronary angiography, even though the clinical presentation and electrocardiography (ECG) strongly suggest myocardial infarction. We herein report a 53-year-old man with NAVT complicating intermittent occlusion of left main disease in preexisting coronary artery stenosis.
