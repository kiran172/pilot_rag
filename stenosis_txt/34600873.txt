Title: Potential Candidates for Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Intervention After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Predictors and Prognosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to document the prevalence of concomitant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) before and after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), to quantify potential eligibility for transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI), and to report clinical outcomes as a function of the severity of TR and potential candidacy for TTVI.
BACKGROUND: The importance of concomitant TR in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR remains unclear.
METHODS: In a prospective TAVR registry, the severity of TR before and after TAVR was retrospectively evaluated in an echocardiography core laboratory.
RESULTS: Among 2,008 eligible patients, 1,659 patients (82.6%) had mild or less TR, 242 (12.1%) had moderate TR, 57 (2.8%) had severe TR, and 50 (2.5%) had massive TR. More than one-half of patients with moderate or greater TR had a reduction in TR, while a small proportion of patients with severe or less of TR had worsening of TR after TAVR. In contrast to TR at baseline, severe TR (adjusted HR [HR<sub>adjusted</sub>]: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.03-3.49) and massive TR (HR<sub>adjusted</sub>: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.10-4.30) after TAVR conferred an increased risk for mortality compared with mild or less TR at 1 year after TAVR. After TAVR, 63 patients (3.1%) were deemed potential candidates for TTVI. They had a 2-fold increased risk for mortality between 30 days and 1 year (HR<sub>adjusted</sub>: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.15-3.25) and a higher risk for persistent heart failure symptoms (adjusted risk ratio: 2.80; 95% CI: 1.78-4.40).
CONCLUSIONS: A non-negligible proportion of patients were considered potential candidates for TTVI after TAVR and had impaired prognosis and persistently impaired functional status at 1 year. (SwissTAVI Registry; NCT01368250).
