Title: Innovative Approach to Manage Transcatheter Aortic Valve Embolization.

Abstract: We describe the case of a patient with an ascending aortic aneurysm who underwent valve-in-valve transcatheter aorticÂ valve implantation, which was complicated by valve embolization. After a multidisciplinary discussion and an innovative approach, the free-floating embolized valve was anchored securely in the aortic arch with an uncovered aortic endovascular stent. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
