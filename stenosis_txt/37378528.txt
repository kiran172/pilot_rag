Title: Takotsubo syndrome and its linkage to neuroendocrinological disorders: a case report.

Abstract: Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is an increasingly diagnosed entity, however the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and their clinical implications are incompletely understood. An 82-year-old female, diagnosed with pituitary apoplexy, presented with ECG abnormalities and hsTnI levels consistent with an acute coronary syndrome and therefore underwent urgent coronary angiography that showed no significant stenosis and apical ballooning at left ventricle angiogram and therefore a TTS diagnosis was made. Moreover, during catheterization a 20 s torsade de pointes was registered. TTS is an entity that can be triggered by numerous conditions. This case of TTS was linked to many neuroendocrinological disorders.
