Title: Transaortic septal myectomy at the time of aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis: a case series of 55 cases.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Symptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AS) is associated with asymmetric basal septal hypertrophy (ABSH) in 10% of cases. In this cohort, it has been suggested that rectification of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) by concomitant septal myectomy (CSM) can improve the results of aortic valve replacement (AVR).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present the technique of AVR with CSM for severe AS with ABSH and to determine the associated early and late post-operative outcomes.
METHODS: Fifty-five patients were prospectively recruited to undergo AVR with CSM between 2011 and 2021 at two centres. The primary outcomes were mortality within 30 days, incidence of post-operative ventricular septal defects (VSD) and prosthetic valve sizing. The secondary outcomes were in-hospital complications, permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), survival at 15 months and changes on transthoracic echocardiogram.
RESULTS: Post-operative mortality was 1.8% and this figure was unchanged at 15-month follow-up. No patients developed a post-operative VSD. Intra-operatively, it was found that in 94.6% cases the direct valve sizing increased by one, when compared to the measurement made before CSM. The indexed effective orifice area (iEOA) was &gt; 85 cm2/m2 in 96.4% and no patients had an iEOA ≤ 0.75 cm2/m2. Four patients (7.3%) required PPI due to complete atrioventricular block.
CONCLUSION: AVR with CSM is a simple technique that can be utilised in severe AS with ABSH. There does not appear to be an increase in mortality or incidence of iatrogenic VSDs. Importantly, CSM allows for the implantation of a larger aortic valve compared to measurements made before CSM.
