Title: Comparisons of noncoronary sinus pivot implantation (NCPI) and conventional method for transcatheter aortic valve replacement with self-expanding valve in pure aortic regurgitation (PAR).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: As compared to treatment of aortic stenosis (AS), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using the commercially available valves to treat pure aortic regurgitation (PAR) has a lower device success rate and higher complication rates.
AIMS: The study compared the acute results between TAVR using a novel noncoronary sinus pivot implantation (NCPI) method and that using the conventional method, aiming to explore a more optimized and effective operation method for TAVR in PAR.
METHODS: PAR patients who underwent TAVR with self-expanding valves in our center from September 2021 to September 2023 were enrolled were divided into the NCPI (group A, N = 16) and conventional method (group B, N = 39) groups. We analyzed the pre-operative evaluation parameters and procedural and postoperative data of the two subgroups.
RESULTS: The total patients' mean age was 71.2 ± 8.7 years and most were male (61.8%), with a mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 3.4 ± 1.9%. The device success rate of groups A and B was 100% and 71.8%, respectively. In group B, 48.7% had major adverse cardiac events (MACE); 46.2% patients had permanent pacemaker implantation or valve in valve implantation. None had MACE in group A. The noncoronary sinus implantation depth in NCPI was -1.1 + 1.0 and 4.2 + 3.7 mm in groups A and B (p < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR with a self-expanding valve using the NCPI method had a higher procedure success rate and dramatically low complications than that using the conventional method in PAR patients.
