Title: Progostic value of coronary artery calcium scores from 1.5 mm slice reconstructions of electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography scans in asymptomatic individuals.

Abstract: It is unknown whether the thinner slice reconstruction has added value relative to 3 mm reconstructions in predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). This retrospective study included 550 asymptomatic individuals who underwent cardiac CT. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores and severity categories were assessed from 1.5 and 3 mm scans. CAC scores obtained from 1.5 and 3 mm scans were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Cox proportional hazard models were developed to predict MACEs based on the degree of coronary artery stenosis on coronary CT angiography and the presence of CAC on both scans. Model performances were compared using the time-dependent ROC curve and integrated area under the curve (iAUC) methods. The CAC scores obtained from 1.5 mm scans were significantly higher than those from 3 mm scans (median, interquartile range 4.5[0-71] vs. 0[0-48.4]; p < 0.001). Models showed no difference in predictive accuracy of the presence of CAC between 1.5 and 3 mm scans (iAUC, 0.625 vs. 0.672). In conclusion, CAC scores obtained from 1.5 mm scans are significantly higher than those from 3 mm scans, but do not provide added prognostic value relative to 3 mm scans.
