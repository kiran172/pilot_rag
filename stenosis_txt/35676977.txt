Title: An Infant With Congenital Tracheal and Bronchial Stenosis Diagnosed by Chest Three-Dimensional Computed Tomography.

Abstract: In this case report, we describe the case of an infant with repeated wheezing diagnosed relatively early with congenital tracheal and bronchial stenosis after evaluation by chest three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT). The patient was a six-month-old male infant with a one-month history of cough and wheezing. His symptoms worsened the day before admission, and he was admitted with pneumonia and wheezing. However, wheezing continued after treatment with intravenous steroids and inhalation of a short-acting Î²2-stimulant. 3D-CT of the chest revealed tracheal stenosis, right bronchial stenosis, and right tracheobronchial bronchus. The patient was finally diagnosed with congenital tracheal and bronchial stenosis via bronchoscopy. A virtual bronchoscopic navigation image of the tracheal lumen was created based on the CT images. Although virtual bronchoscopic navigation is more difficult for the dynamic evaluation and evaluation of mucosal lesions than bronchoscopy, it has the advantage of not directly invading the airway. Therefore, if a fixed stenotic lesion is suspected at a facility where bronchoscopy is difficult, evaluation using chest 3D-CT and virtual bronchoscopic navigation may be helpful for diagnosis. In conclusion, congenital tracheal/bronchial stenosis should be considered in patients with prolonged wheezing and recurrent airway infections, and evaluation by chest 3D-CT and virtual bronchoscopic navigation may be helpful for diagnosis.
