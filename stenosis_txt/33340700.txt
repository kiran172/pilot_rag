Title: Efficacy of ultrasound-guided percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for arteriovenous fistula stenosis or occlusion at juxta-anastomosis: A 3-year follow-up cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred access for hemodialysis. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has become a choice for AVF stenosis, and ultrasound has been used in PTA more frequently.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study analyzed 129 patients who underwent PTA in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2016 to December 2016. Angioplasty was performed using a noncompliant high-pressure balloon. The process was visualized by duplex scan. Our inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) stenoses or occlusions were located at the juxta-anastomosis site: the first 5 cm of the vein distal to the anastomosis; (2) stenosis was confirmed with the following conditions: (a) flow rates are <500 mL/min in the brachial artery and <200 mL/min in the fistula during dialysis, and (b) the stenosis diameter is <1.7 mm. We used the Kaplan-Meier curve to show the postintervention primary and secondary patency rates of patients with stenosis and occlusion.
RESULTS: Altogether, 129 patients with 76 males were analyzed. Moreover, 104 have AVFs on the left arm, and only one patient had an ulnar-basilic AVF, whereas others had a radial-cephalic AVF. The postintervention primary patency rates are better in occlusion cases (P < .05), whereas secondary patency rates have no difference. The postintervention primary patency rates are better in patients without diabetes mellitus (P < .05), whereas the secondary patency rates had no difference.
CONCLUSIONS: For juxta-anastomosis site stenosis or occlusion, PTA can be used to obtain satisfactory results.
