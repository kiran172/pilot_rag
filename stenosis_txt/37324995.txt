Title: Inferior Vena Cava Stenosis Following Orthotopic Liver Transplantation: Differentiating Points from False Positives.

Abstract: Orthotopic liver transplantation has become the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage liver disease. Various early or delayed vascular complications, including arterial pseudoaneurysm, thrombosis, or stenosis, and venous stenosis or occlusion, may lead to graft failure. Early detection and prompt management of such complications are essential to achieve successful transplantation and prevent the need for retransplantation. This report presents differentiating points, using computed tomography and digital subtraction angiography findings and measurement of pressure gradient across the stenotic lesion, that require immediate intervention in patients with inferior vena cava stenosis after orthotopic liver transplantation.
