Title: Noteworthy Literature in Cardiac Anesthesia for 2019.

Abstract: This article represents a selective review of literature published in 2019. Initial results from PubMed searching for a combination of terms, including cardiac anesthesiology and anesthesiology outcomes, yielded more than 1400 publications. From there, we manually screened the results and identified 5 major themes for the year of 2019, including transcatheter techniques, delirium and anesthesiology, coagulation management following cardiopulmonary bypass, perfusion management with del Nido cardioplegia, and applied clinical research. The following research accomplishments have expanded what is possible and set ambitious goals for the future.
