Title: Utility of Hook Sign in the Diagnosis of Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a clinical syndrome caused by compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament that often manifests with nonspecific abdominal pain. Identification of this syndrome is often dependent on imaging of compression and upward bending of the celiac artery by lateral computed tomography angiography, the so-called "hook sign." The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of radiologic characteristics of the celiac artery to clinically relevant MALS.
METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review from 2,000 to 2,021 of 293 patients at a tertiary academic center diagnosed with celiac artery compression (CAC) was performed. Patient demographics and symptoms of 69 patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic MALS were compared to 224 patients without MALS (but with CAC) per electronic medical record review. Computed tomography angiography images were reviewed and the fold angle (FA) was measured. The presence of a hook sign (defined as a visual FA < 135°), as well as stenosis (defined as >50% of luminal narrowing on imaging) were recorded. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Chi-squared test were used for comparative analysis. Logistic model was run to relate the presence of MALS with comorbidities and radiographic findings.
RESULTS: Imaging was available in 59 patients (25 males, 34 females) and 157 patients (60 males, 97 females) with and without MALS, respectively. Patients with MALS were more likely to have a more severe FA (120.7 ± 33.6 vs. 134.8 ± 27.9, P = 0.002). Males with MALS were also more likely to have a more severe FA compared with males without MALS (111.1 ± 33.7 vs. 130.4 ± 30.4, P = 0.015). In patients with body mass index (BMI) >25, MALS patients also had narrower FA compared with patients without MALS (112.6 ± 30.5 vs. 131.7 ± 30.3, P = 0.001). The FA was negatively correlated with BMI in patients with CAC. The hook sign and stenosis were associated with diagnosis of MALS (59.3% vs. 28.7%, P < 0.001, and 75.7% vs. 45.2%, P < 0.001, respectively). In logistic regression, pain, stenosis, and a narrow FA were statistically significant predictors of the presence of MALS.
CONCLUSIONS: The upward deflection of the celiac artery in patients with MALS is more severe compared with patients without MALS. Consistent with prior literature, this bending of the celiac artery is negatively correlated with BMI in patients with and without MALS. When demographic variables and comorbidities are considered, a narrow FA is a statistically significant predictor of MALS. Regardless of MALS diagnosis, a hook sign was associated with narrower FA. While demographics and imaging findings may inform MALS diagnosis, clinicians should not rely on a visual assessment of a hook sign but should quantitatively measure the anatomic bending angle of the celiac artery to assist with the diagnosis and understand the outcomes.
