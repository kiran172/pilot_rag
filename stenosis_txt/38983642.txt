Title: The Complex Hemodynamic Interplay between Mitral Arcade, Midventricular Obstruction, and Prosthetic Aortic Valve.

Abstract: • MA is a malformation of valve tensor apparatus leading to early heart failure. • MA can be associated with subvalvar aortic stenosis, bicuspid AV, or aortic coarctation. • Multimodal imaging is invaluable in assessing mitral arcade.
