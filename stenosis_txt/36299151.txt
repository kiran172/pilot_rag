Title: [Midterm Outcomes of Pulmonary Valve Leaflet Augmentation using Fresh Autologous Pericardium for Transannular Patch Repair of Tetralogy of Fallot].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although valve sparing (VS) for patients with smaller pulmonary valves has been increasing, transannular patch repair( TAP) accounts for more than half of the total tetralogy of Fallot corrections worldwide. We use fresh autologous pericardial patches to perform a modified TAP procedure with pulmonary valve leaflet augmentation as proposed by Sung et al. We aimed to explore the early and midterm outcomes of this procedure.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 37 patients( group TAP:12;group VS:25) who underwent total tetralogy of Fallot corrections from April 2018 to December 2021.
RESULTS: No midterm mortality was observed at a median observation period of 20.4 months in both groups. The midterm rates of freedom from moderate or more pulmonary regurgitation( PR) were 64.2 % and 21.4% in group TAP and 100% and 100% in group VS at 1 and 3 years, respectively( p<0.001). The midterm rates of freedom from pulmonary stenosis reintervention were 100% and 100% in group TAP and 96% and 96% in group VS at 1 and 3 years, respectively( p=0.51).
CONCLUSIONS: TAP showed acceptable midterm survival and reintervention rate. Longer follow-up is essential considering the significantly higher PR in the postoperative period in group TAP.
