Title: Choice of anesthesia technique is associated with earlier hospital discharge and reduced costs after transcatheter transfemoral aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a viable alternative to palliation in patients with severe aortic stenosis. We compared general anesthesia to conscious sedation for TAVI procedures with respect to post operative morbidity, hospital length of stay, and financial burden.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected data in patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI procedures from 2012 to 2017. Patients were matched based on age and sex and classed into either general anesthesia or conscious sedation groups respectively. Conscious sedation was provided with a dexmedetomidine infusion, and patients in general anesthesia group received a standard induction, tracheal intubation, and maintenance with sevoflurane. The hospital case costs were compared between the two groups before and after adjustment for inflation.
RESULTS: We matched 124 pairs for a total of 248 patients. Both groups were similar with respect to demographic data, past medical history, medications, and intraoperative characteristics. There was no difference in postoperative morbidity and mortality between the two groups. The median hospital length of stay was 5 [interquartile range (IQR): 3, 10] and 7 (IQR: 4, 12) days, P=0.01, and after adjustment for inflation, the total hospital case costs were $48,984 (IQR: $44,802, $61,438) Canadian (CAD) vs. $55,333 (IQR: $46,832, $68,702) CAD, P=0.01, in the conscious sedation and general anesthesia groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Advancements in TAVI technologies, conscious sedation and a collaborative, multidisciplinary team approach reduces overall length of hospital stay and procedure costs.
