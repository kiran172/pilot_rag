Title: Long-term autograft dilation and durability after the Ross procedure are similar in infants, children, and adolescents with primary aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Autograft durability and remodeling are thought to be superior in younger pediatric patients after the Ross operation. We sought to delineate the fate of autografts across the pediatric age spectrum in patients with primary aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients age ≤18 years with primary AS who underwent the Ross operation between 1993 and 2020. Patients were categorized by age. The primary endpoint was autograft dimensional change, and secondary endpoints were severe neo-aortic insufficiency (AI) and autograft reintervention.
RESULTS: A total of 119 patients underwent the Ross operation, including 37 (31.1%) in group I (age <18 months), 24 (20.2%) in group II (age 18 months-8 years), and 58 (48.7%) in group III (age 8-18 years). All groups exhibited similar annular growth rates within the first 5 postoperative years, followed by a collective decrease in annulus growth rates from year 5 to year 10. Group III experienced rapid sinus dilation in the first 5 years, followed by stabilization of the sinus z-score from year 5 to year 10, whereas groups I and II demonstrated stable sinus z-scores over 10 years. There were 4 early deaths (3.4%) and 2 late deaths (1.7%) at a median follow-up of 8.1 years (range, 0.01-26.3 years). At 15 years, the incidences of severe neo-AI (0.0 ± 0.0% vs 0.0 ± 0.0% vs 3.9 ± 3.9%; P = .52) and autograft reintervention (8.4 ± 6.0% vs 0.0 ± 0.0% vs 2.4 ± 2.4%; P = .47) were similar in the 3 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Age at the time of Ross operation for primary AS does not influence long-term autograft remodeling or durability. Other physiologic or technical factors are likely greater determinants of autograft fate.
