Title: Carotid Artery Perivascular Adipose Tissue Density and Response to Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Acute Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: The importance of Carotid Artery Perivascular Adipose Tissue Density (CAPATd), a parameter that can be readily evaluated on emergency computed tomographic angiography (CTA), in acute stroke has not been adequately clarified. We created exploratory logistic regression models to detect the interaction between the effect of CAPATd and intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in 174 patients (mean age 71 ± 14 years, 94 women) with acute ischemic stroke treated with IV-tPA alone. The CAPATd-average mean (-60.6 ± 18.7 vs -89.8 ± 25.3 Hounsfield units (HU), P = .002) and CAPATd-maximum (14.8 ± 68.9 vs -20.5 ± 39.8 HU, P = .020) values were higher on the ipsilateral side of carotid artery stenosis &gt;60%. CAPATd-maximum ipsilateral emerged as an independent predictor for both modified Rankin's Score 0-2 (52%) [exp(β) = .984] and mRS 0-1 outcome (32%) [exp(β) = .828] in addition to admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, age and carotid plaque burden. CAPATd-maximum ipsilateral was acceptably accurate (Area under the Receiver operating characteristic Curve was .607, P = .0109 for mRS 0-2 and .613, P = .0102 for mRS 0-1). Ipsilateral CAPATd ≥ -25 HU predicted both mRS &gt;3 and mRS &gt;2 with usable sensitivity (59.8% and 66.07%) and specificity (63.6% and 59.68%). In conclusion, higher maximum CAPATd measured on emergency CTA indicates poorer functional prognosis in acute stroke patients treated with IV-tPA.
