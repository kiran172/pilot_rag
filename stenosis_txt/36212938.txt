Title: [Late presentation of anorectal atresia: a case report].

Abstract: Anorectal atresia and rectal stenosis are rare types of anorectal malformations, accounting for only 1-2% of cases. We here report one case of anorectal atresia. The study involved a female newborn baby delivered at term via vaginal birth, weighing 3600g, who was admitted with failure to pass meconium, abdominal bloating and fever on day 6 of life. Clinical examination showed a temperature of 39ºC, distended abdomen, normal anal location and peremeability, with prolapsed pinkish mass and no signs of necrosis. A cannula trocar stylet was inserted between the mass and rectal mucosa and stopped at about 3cm from the anal margin. Abdominal X-ray without treatment showed distended bowels and air-fluid levels, with no evidence of hollow-organ perforation. Due to suspicion of complete anorectal atresia, 16 gauge needle was inserted into the membrane and meconium was collected abundantly with considerable abdominal deflation. Surgical excision of the membrane was then performed. The postoperative course was uneventful and newborn baby was discharged at postoperative day 3. Anal dilatations were performed to treat anal stenosis. At 6-months´ follow-up, functional outcome was satisfactory. Anorectal atresia manifesting as failure to pass meconium associated with mass protruding through the anus has not yet been described in the literature. Membrane puncture confirmed the diagnosis. Membrane was resected with good outcome.
